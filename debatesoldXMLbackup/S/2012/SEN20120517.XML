	<P>I have received notice from Senator Martin Conway that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to indicate when she intends to commence the missing children&rsquo;s hotline number 116000.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by Senator Conway as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Companies (Amendment) Bill 2012 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and all other Senators not to exceed six minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than 1.35 p.m.; No. 2, statements on the 44th Plenary of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, to be taken on conclusion of No. 1, with the time allocation for this debate not to exceed one hour and with the contribution of each Senator not to exceed eight minutes; and No. 3, statements on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 2, with the contribution of each Senator not to exceed eight minutes.</P>

	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for the Minister for Health to come to the House as a matter of urgency.  We will not put it to a vote today but we expect that this issue will be dealt with in the earlier part of next week.  As many will be aware, the board of Tallaght hospital is meeting this morning to consider the 300-page HIQA report which many of us have been reading about in the newspapers and hearing of in the broadcast media.  We strongly object to the fact that the HIQA board will share this report with the media at a press conference at 12 o&rsquo;clock, rather than circulate the report to Members of the Oireachtas.  This shows the contempt in which these Houses are held.  This is something the deputy Leader should raise with the Government and with her party leader and the Taoiseach to ensure the appropriate respect is given to the Houses, which represents the people when considering health service reports important to their care.  Members will recall the Dublin county coroner&rsquo;s comments last year following the examination of the case of the death of Thomas Walsh, who was just 65 years of age.  His death shocked and appalled everybody.  The coroner wondered whether it would have been safer for Mr. Walsh to stay at home rather than go into that hospital. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Since then, no patients were meant to be kept on trolleys on corridors at Tallaght hospital.  Can the Minister confirm for us that this is now the case at Tallaght hospital?  The trolley watch website indicates this morning that there are 13 patients on trolleys there, and 278 patients on trolleys throughout the country.  Is the recruitment moratorium too blunt an instrument and is it affecting the day to day running of our emergency departments, whether in Tallaght, Sligo or the other hospitals throughout the country?  Reports say that recommendations in the report hold consequences for accident and emergency departments all over the country.  Will this form part of a centralisation agenda by the HSE and Government to wind down more Roscommons throughout the country or will the resources be available to ensure that if standards are to be raised, this will be done and resources will be provided?  We know already that 2,000 beds throughout the country remain closed, yet we have 13 people on trolleys in Tallaght and 278 on trolleys nationwide, in contravention of the much promoted report we expect from the HIQA today.  Last week in the D&aacute;il we heard the T&aacute;naiste celebrate the fact there was a 17% reduction in the number of people on trolleys at accident and emergency departments throughout the country.  I do not feel there is any cause for celebration for any Minister given that in the first four months of this year some 26,000 patients were being treated on trolleys.  This is a serious issue and I ask the Deputy Leader to raise it and seek an urgent debate in the House with the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Finally, new groupings of hospitals &mdash; trusts similar to the UK model have been suggested &mdash; are to be announced this week.  I mention in particular the grouping related to the west, where we will have Galway, Portiuncula, Roscommon and possibly, Castlebar, in one group.  A further grouping to the north west may bring Sligo and Letterkenny together.  When the Minister comes to the House for the debate we seek, will he also be prepared announce a commitment to the continuation of services at each of these hospitals?  Will he make a commitment that the proposed groupings or trusts will not be used as a vehicle to centralise services, taking them away from the communities that need them so much?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the fact that today is UN International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia.  I also welcome the fact that Ministers Frances Fitzgerald and Ruair&iacute; Quinn are hosting an anti-bullying forum and bringing together various stakeholders to help tackle bullying.  As we know, some frightful examples of bullying have taken place in our country in recent times, with horrible consequences in some cases.  It is meritorious that our two Ministers are jointly on this international day hosting this forum.  I wish it well.  Will the Deputy Leader comment further on this designated international day?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik kindly responded to my request for a debate on the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland report last week and I am grateful to her for that.  I understand it is the intention of the Government to facilitate debate in the Seanad on the report and I ask that we have that debate sooner rather than later.  Significant attention has been paid to what was said and done at the Oireachtas committee yesterday.  I am concerned that the debate on standards in our national broadcaster does not descend to a knockabout type of situation where everybody feels free to let rip on their own issues.  What we need is a thorough, analytical debate that concentrates on the key issues and the Seanad could contribute to that.  Therefore, we should have the debate in the Seanad on the issue sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>One of the issues I did not raise last week but which continues to trouble me concerns the way in which, at a time of crisis, a consensus seems to emerge that the only thing that can cure a problem is a resignation.  I feel strongly that resignation is something that is appropriate in certain situations, particularly when there is a current danger that needs to be addressed.  However, I am concerned that there does not seem to be a clear mechanism whereby people in institutions who get things wrong, as happened in the case of RT&Eacute; with the Prime Time documentary, can step back from their position, go through a period of reflection and reform if necessary.  Then, it would be seen that people can recover and take up a position of eminence or prominence again.  That is a more humane way to deal with human error.</P>
        <P>The other side of the issue is that people must be willing to take responsibility for what they have done.  As far as I know, it is only the journalist who resigned from RT&Eacute; who has given a personal apology for her role in the affair.  I am not aware that any of the other people involved, for example Mr. O&rsquo;Shea, Mr. P&aacute;irc&eacute;ir and Mr. Mulhall &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; have expressed personal regret at their part in the serious defamation of Kevin Reynolds.  I wonder what that says about them and about the organisation.  We need to consider how we deal with crises when they emerge, but we also need to focus on a culture of rehabilitating people.  We talk about that in the context of criminal justice, but we should also talk about it in the context of institutional mistakes.  This involves taking responsibility, but also providing a mechanism for people to learn, recover and reform.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, to end the sponsorship of sports events by alcohol companies and organisations.  This is something for which I have called over many years in the Seanad.  People are rightly concerned about the impact of a nanny state, but when it comes to the abuse of alcohol, particularly by young people, and when it comes to the bad example being set in homes and public fora, it is an area where we cannot be too vigilant.  Therefore, not only should we be moving to end alcohol sponsorship of sports, we should also be looking at the extent to which we permit public advertising of alcohol at all, particularly on broadcast media.  I would welcome a debate on that issue also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise one issue and call for the Minister of State to come to the House again to speak on the fiscal treaty.  This House should put a message out to the UK Independence Party, UKIP, and to Mr. Farage, Mr. Ganley, Mr. Messerschmidt and these other people who are coming to this country.  I understand Mr. Ganley is a temporary resident of this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all temporary residents of this country.  We are subject to death.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Harte, without interruption.  Senator Norris will get his opportunity to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This House should call on these people to desist from their campaign.  Mr. Farage, in particular, has come into this country and is distributing leaflets that peddle untruths to every household.   This is a departure we cannot accept, where a crowd of people from the UK who are anti-Irish and anti-foreign nationals in their own country want to come here and are being assisted by the usual suspects, who call themselves left-wing politicians.  These individuals should be asked who is going to benefit financially from a collapse or downgrade of the euro.  As the sterling will not collapse, people from the UK will be able to come to Ireland to purchase two holiday homes rather than one.  People must understand that certain people have a vested interest in destabilising the euro for their own financial advantage.  This is all about money and these individuals are telling us to get rid of the euro while at the same time they are stocking up on sterling and dollars.</P>
        <P>The ULA and Sinn F&eacute;in should announce they are on a different platform from Mr. Ganley, Mr. Farage and the other loonies on the right.  Now we have loonies from the right and the left on the same platform.  People must be made aware of who is going to benefit from destabilisation of the euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to update the House on his plans for reforming local government.  It is almost a year since he outlined his proposals and all we have gotten since then are drips and leaks about this, that and the other.</P>
        <P>Everybody in this House recognises the importance of local government in this country, be it town council, county council or regional authority.  They must be supported.  Town councils, in particular, are faced with the sword of Damocles.  It has been hinted that the smaller town councils will be abolished while the larger ones will be reformed.  Sitting councillors who expect an election in two years time are not sure whether they will still have a constituency.</P>
        <P>The Minister owes more than leaks to local government and, indeed, the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  He has already dodged his own timetable twice.  He indicated that he would make a statement at the AMAI conference, which took place several months ago, and that he would provide further information at the recent county council conference.  He brought forth a mouse on both occasions.  I hope the Deputy Leader can arrange for him to come to the House so that we can interrogate him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the previous speaker&rsquo;s call for a debate on local government.  We may give out about the closed methodology for Seanad elections but we must recognise that Senators are elected by councillors &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Not all of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to give me a chance to speak.  Every time I open my mouth I am interrupted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not mind him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Keane without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>The exception is the university panels and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  That would have been the next part of my statement had I been allowed to make it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to be of assistance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>This House should be the place in which the Minister, Deputy Hogan, makes his announcement and presents the report and recommendations.  He has indicated that he will be bringing them forward shortly but we do not know the length of that piece of string and the local elections are approaching.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of Facebook and the Department of Education and Skills.  Two pupils were expelled from a school in Dublin for posting abusive remarks about their teachers on Facebook and a further 40 were given detention for liking the posts.  This is a serious matter because posting abusive comments about teachers or children on Facebook is as serious a form of bullying as bullying verbally or by telephone.  The ASTI have come out on the issue.  I ask the Minister for Education and Skills to draw up a protocol for social media because schools may handle problems differently depending on their principals.  It would send a serious message to students and teachers about respect for social media.  These media are available for everybody to use but they have to be respected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator Coghlan on reminding us that today is International Day against Homophobia.  This is recognised in 100 countries and by the United Nations.  This year&rsquo;s theme is homophobic and transphobic bullying.  I advise my colleagues to read an excellent article in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> by Michael Barron, who wrote: &ldquo;To truly end homophobic and transphobic bullying we need to effect structural changes in curriculum, policy, support services and teaching practice which will enable a cultural shift in how we educate young people.&rdquo;  I contrast this with a disgraceful article in<i> Alive</i>, a newspaper which is distributed in Roman Catholic churches throughout the country.  A column entitled &ldquo;Editor&rsquo;s Jottings&rdquo; attacked any attempt to protect young gay people, arguing that such attempts will lead to further bullying and suggesting that those who try to protect vulnerable young people want to increase victimhood for their own purposes.  I call for this to be withdrawn.  The editorial is unsigned but one of the newspaper&rsquo;s correspondents, Senator Mullen, sits almost next to me and may know the identity of the editor.  The editorial states that the attempt to protect young gay people &ldquo;raises serious questions about any specific campaign to end bullying of these children...For example, if the children are being turned into a target, we may wonder if the real aim here is not to actually increase the bullying, to produce more &ldquo;victims&rdquo; and more &ldquo;concern&rdquo;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This is a disgusting and repulsive accusation but it fits into the reaction that ensued when people like Joe O&rsquo;Toole and I tried to develop a programme to protect children from inappropriate behaviour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator calling for a debate on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate because it is important that we discuss it.  The editorial also states: &ldquo;We may wonder too, if this is not a cynical and cruel abuse of these children and young people in order to promote acceptance of homosexual behaviour in society.&rdquo;  Decent parish priests should ensure this filthy and disgusting publication is removed from their churches because it has no place in a Christian context.</P>
        <P>While I have commended Senator Coghlan, I cannot commend his party on its recent behaviour, which has been extraordinary.  I contrast the cases of Deputy Mitchell and former Senator, Therese Ridge.  Apparently Deputy Mitchell was of systemic importance to her party and, therefore, had to be saved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not an appropriate matter for the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Therese Ridge was expendable, however, and was dumped.  Both individuals received money from Frank Dunlop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was on the margins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an internal matter for Fine Gael.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter of scandal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to facilitate a discussion on suicide prevention.  I acknowledge that we have debated the issue recently but the Seanad should give a high political priority to this most pressing of issues.  Suicide is probably the greatest single issue facing our society and we need to put it near the top of our agenda.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children has appointed me rapporteur on suicide prevention and charged me with bringing a report before the committee.  Over the past eight months I have consulted agencies and professional bodies in this area and it is time that I extend the consultation process to members of the public.  I intend to hold a series of public meetings across the country over the coming months to ascertain the views of ordinary people.  The first meeting will take place in Cork on 28 June.  I ask Senators to support this initiative by facilitating meetings in their local areas.  I have made information available for anyone who wishes to find out more about the matter.  This is an area in which the Seanad could play a useful role and I ask for a joint effort by Senators to give it the political attention it requires.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House to discuss the US-Ireland Alliance.  The Mitchell scholars programme is a great programme in honour of an extraordinary man but, unfortunately, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade has been unable to get a definitive answer from the president of the US-Ireland Alliance on whether she will appear before the committee to talk about the role and work of the organisation.  A letter was sent to her from the Chairman of the committee, following a request by members on all sides and from both Houses that she appear before the committee to talk about the US-Ireland Alliance.  I find it extraordinary that she would not reply in a clear manner that she is willing to appear.  Many members have received invitations from her to attend an event in Dublin next week, which she will be at, yet she does not see fit to talk to the committee.  She is most evasive and, rather than accept the invitation, she avoided giving a definitive answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely that is a matter for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is and it has come up twice, which is why I am asking for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to appear in the House seeing as the president of the US-Ireland Alliance will not indicate whether she will appear.  The Irish taxpayer will give over &euro;20 million to the programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter is more appropriate to the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The president has not indicated that she will appear before the committee.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is a member of the board of the US-Ireland Alliance and when he comes in he could explain why the president of the organisation will not indicate whether she will appear before the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Gilroy in his initiative on suicide, which the House should support.  It affects every community the length and breadth of the country and the more we highlight the issue and discuss how we can provide adequate funding to tackle the problem, the better.  I am pleased to welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement of 150 jobs in Merit Medical in Galway.  Ireland is attracting significant inward investment.  The trade missions over the past year are paying dividends and it is important that on 31 May we vote for stability and to ensure the euro remains strong to continue to attract the investment we have seen in recent times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the announcement by the T&aacute;naiste that &euro;8 million will be provided to tackle child undernutrition and to support cutting edge of research to boost agricultural productivity in the developing world.  He also gave a commitment that during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency in 2013 we will highlight hunger on the EU development agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like a debate on admission to universities.  When people are studying the leaving certificate, it is important they have confidence in the way they progress to the next level.  Happily, some 70% of students do so, which is one of the highest figures anywhere.  We have discussed problems in mathematics at second level and our neglect of languages.  The system was set up by Professor William Watts, a former provost of Trinity College Dublin, and its strength is that the Central Applications Office is not subject to influence from the universities or outside.  That is essential to the fact that every 18-year-old facing the leaving certificate has confidence in the neutrality of the system.  I am concerned there will be a repeat of the last meddling, a test called HPAT, designed to reduce the number of women studying medicine.  These matters are dangerous and if they cause a loss of confidence in 18-year-olds in the neutrality of the leaving certificate system.  Good performance at second level is a good predictor of how people will perform at third level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Gilroy&rsquo;s initiative on suicide awareness.  I urge everyone to participate in the process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For a number of months, Senators Landy and Moloney and I were complaining about the delays in processing medical cards.  Another issue has arisen, which is that the interpretation of the primary care reimbursement system of who is entitled to a medical card has been called into question.  For years, students between 16 and 25 years were entitled to a medical card if their parents had a medal card.  However, a 26 year old mature student with no income other than the grant, who is being subsidised by parents who are also medical cardholders, is being refused the medical card because these people have no income.  They have no income because they are full-time students.  It is frustrating to explain to these people that an income of nil is less than the guideline figure of &euro;184, which means they should be entitled to a medical card.  I am at my wits&rsquo; end.  Senator Healy Eames told me about the case of a person who was refused a medical card for being 10 cent a week over the guidelines for a medical card.  There is no common sense prevailing in the primary care reimbursement system.  I call on the Leader to arrange for representatives of the primary care reimbursement system to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to answer questions on their knowledge and interpretation of who is entitled to a medical card.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Given the day that is in it, I join Senators Coghlan and Norris in condemning homophobic bullying.  We are all aware of the consequences of bullying and, in the case of the gay community, it poses tremendous difficulties for people, particularly at a time when they are trying to come to terms with their sexual orientation.  It is very difficult.  We should condemn it across the board but it also needs to be said, for balance, that the gay community is not without its coterie of bullies.  Anecdotally, in colleges, people who are not gay come under certain pressure.  I was involved in the debate on civil partnership and I took a particularly strong line because I thought it was overly analogous to marriage.  As a consequence, on social media and in my home town I was condemned as a homophobe and a misogynist bigot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very different from a 15-year-old boy.  Senator Walsh is an adult.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris exemplifies the attitude of some of those in the gay community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I stick up for the underdog.  Senator Walsh&rsquo;s amendments were homophobic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris is being unruly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>GLEN is very professional.  When talking about civil partnership, I ask for a full debate about gay marriage, which was raised in the House because of President Obama&rsquo;s comments.  An interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> made a case opposing gay marriage by someone who is part of the gay community.  I would like to see a debate on that and the ramifications for society and children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the day that is in it, we should acknowledge that on this day 38 years ago 34 of Ireland's citizens were murdered in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  After 38 years, our civil societies and successive Governments have failed to bring those responsible to justice.  They have failed the victims by not pursuing as strongly as they should have with the neighbouring island in order to have the truth of what happened regarding the collusion involved in those atrocities brought to light so that at least the victims can get some element of closure.  They all have our sympathy on the day that is in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality where people from the gay, lesbian and transsexual community were making submissions.  It would be the wish of all to see homophobia eliminated from society.  It probably never will be eliminated but the best way of ensuring that it is kept at a minimum is to educate people.  It is all about education.  I call on the Acting Leader to prevail on the Minister for Education and Skills, even in these difficult times, to provide funding for a national educational programme in all schools so that the young people who are growing up in this society will not suffer from homophobia and will play an active part in mutual respect.  We have a duty to all elements in society to ensure that education is provided and is done properly.</P>
        <P>I ask the Acting Leader if she could ascertain a date when this country will ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  I would suggest that this ground-breaking ratification should happen during the six months of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union, between January and June of next year.  This society and this country can lead the way by ratifying this very important convention.  I ask the Acting Leader to see what can be done to get a date so that we can all work towards it.</P>

	<P>We have been talking today about anniversaries and dates.  Later this year, the date of 11 December, is the 90th anniversary of the establishment of the first Seanad on 11 December 1922.  I ask if we should recognise that event.  That Seanad was abolished in 1936 but came back into being in this present form in 1937.  The original Seanad was very effective in much of its work.  I suggest the Acting Leader might bring it forward as a consideration.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday the Minister for Finance made some appalling and distasteful comments about the situation in Greece.  He said that the only effect of a departure of Greece from the eurozone would be less feta cheese in Irish shopping baskets.  This was a flippant, arrogant remark.  We have to be conscious that the people in Greece are suffering and there is great concern about what is happening in that country.  Any arrogant or flippant comments coming from very senior politicians in this country send out entirely the wrong message.  What we need to do is put in place policies that will support the people of Greece, support all those people in Europe who are suffering because of austerity and put in place policies in this country which will get people back to work.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I raised the issue of the need for this House to play its role in highlighting what we mean by the growth agenda across Europe and in Ireland.  I make that call again now.  The Government strategy is not supported by the trade unions nor, in my view, by the vast majority of the members of the Labour Party because at their national conference they opposed the selling of State assets.  It seems we are going to sell off our family jewels, sell off profitable State-owned companies to make a few short bucks so that we can then pay back our debts and have some money for job creation.  What we should be doing is using the money we have in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, leveraging some money from the European Investment Bank and also using money from private pensions to stimulate the Irish economy and get people back to work.  We need to have a robust and thorough debate in this House about what we need in Europe and in Ireland to achieve growth, investment and recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been considerable discussion here and elsewhere over the past several days about the disclosure that various senior staff in the public service had been re-hired following their retirements.  Much of the discussion is focused on the appropriateness of this practice, the potential waste, and there has been a focus on the degree of compensation for people whose new temporary salaries are totted up with their pensions.  However, there has been insufficient discussion on what is the most important aspect.  This is the most telling example we could have of the inappropriateness of mandatory retirement.  These people were clearly able to do the job, they are still able to do the job, they wanted to do the job and they were told they had to retire and become dependent on the State.  This is irrational.  In the best of times if the economy was booming we would have difficulty dealing with the demographic burden that will be imposed by mandatory retirement and by the presence of a large number of ever longer-living retirees who will be using their pension funds.  The arbitrary figure of 65 years was one which was chosen at a time when the average life expectancy was considerably less than 65 and it was chosen at a time when people who lived to the age of 65, on average lived maybe two years longer.  Now we know that people who live to the age of 65 are very likely to make it close to their 90th birthday.</P>
        <P>This does not make economic or demographic sense, coupled with the fact that I know from first-hand experience that many doctors and nurses who work with me in the health service, do not want to retire.  They are in the full of their health, they are doing jobs well and they are told one day that they are now surplus to requirements and they must go on the pension and they must become dependent on the State.  This policy is irrational and anachronistic and is a breach of people&rsquo;s human rights.  I know my colleague and friend, Senator White, will be attempting to address this issue at some stage and I hope there will be cross-party support for an Irish-led initiative for a critical examination of a practice that has become a central tenet of social policy.  I do not mean we should terminate optional retirement but I certainly believe we should end mandatory retirement.  I would like a debate in the House on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the remarks made by various Senators about the United Nations day which reminds us all about the bullying that persists across this country and across the world against people who are homosexual.  I understand that the Ministers, Deputy Quinn and Deputy Fitzgerald, are hosting a forum today on that matter and this is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I ask the Deputy Leader if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, could come to the House to discuss the specific issue of artisan food and the slow food movement.  I live in Sligo and the So Sligo food festival is being held this weekend.  The festival is in its third year and it is celebrating local food and the advantages of having local food in local restaurants.  We know from anecdotal evidence and from reports that the food industry, and this aspect of the industry, rather than the great international businesses, is vital for tourism and cultural heritage.  Many counties have great food festivals, for instance, the food festival in Donegal this weekend, and festivals in counties Waterford and Kerry.  Such festivals should be encouraged in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>I would like to have this debate with the Minister so that his Department could join with the Department responsible for tourism to introduce a renewed policy.  It has the potential to create jobs.  There is much expertise, particularly among older people and it would be a way of inviting them to become involved and to be of assistance in their communities and in job creation.</P>

	<P>As has been said already, today is the 38th anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  In those two incidents, the greatest number of people were killed in one day during the course of the civil strife on this island.  Yet not one person has been prosecuted for killing 34 people, including an unborn baby.  It is a national scandal that this issue has not been dealt with.  It was swept under the carpet when it happened and the Government of the day did not deal with it in an ethical and honest manner.  It was afraid to handle it.  The motion on the Order Paper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to draw attention to today&rsquo;s Order Paper, which includes No. 23, non-Government motion No. 1.  The motion states:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann is keenly aware of the suffering of the families of those who died or were injured in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and in all the atrocities that were inquired into by Judge Henry Barron; that this suffering is exacerbated by the absence of closure in these terrible tragedies; and that we support their call for co-operation by the British Government to actively participate in a process to help provide answers to the questions that remain unanswered; and that the Irish Government will continue in its efforts to urge the British Government to give urgent consideration to this matter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a national scandal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from the issue raised by Senator Cullinane, I would like to have a debate on the growth package as it is extremely important.  It is also important to outline that the Government has set out a clear path on how it is dealing with the economic difficulties in this country.  In the debate perhaps Senator Cullinane could outline where Sinn F&eacute;in proposes to get the necessary funding not only to continue jobs growth but also to maintain essential services.  That is one of the reasons we are asking for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to ensure that an insurance fund will be in place.  If we are not able to borrow from the markets, the ESM funding will be available to us.</P>
        <P>The Senator&rsquo;s party leader has failed, neglected and refused to outline to the public where money will be accessed to maintain essential services.  I look forward to a debate on the issue of growth, not only here but also throughout Europe.  The sooner we have such a debate the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support what my colleague, Senator John Kelly, said about the medical card issues.  I have also come across a number of people who have been refused medical cards simply because they do not earn enough, which is ludicrous.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the MFGs, or Meitheal Forbatha na Gaeltachta companies which have been closed down for several months.  Many worthwhile projects are awaiting funding but they cannot access it because the MFGs have closed.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s proposals to incorporate the partnerships to take over the distribution of funding, but what is he waiting for?  Let us get on with it.  If there is to be a delay, perhaps the Minister could attend the House to inform us what is causing it.  We should debate the issue because it is necessary to get funding to people in Gaeltacht areas for their projects.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also wish to acknowledge that today marks the 38th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which claimed 34 lives.  I commend the Justice for the Forgotten group whose representatives I met earlier this year as a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The group will have a wreath-laying ceremony at the memorial in Talbot Street later today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the decision to allow the Irish team to wear black armbands for its match against Italy during the Euro 2012 soccer tournament to commemorate the anniversary of the Loughinisland atrocity in County Down when six men were gunned down while watching Ireland play Italy in a 1994 World Cup match.  I commend both the FAI and UEFA on allowing this to happen.  Coincidentally, Ireland will be playing Italy on exactly the same date.  I welcome the decision which was announced by Mr. John Delaney of the FAI.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Acting Leader to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator MacSharry sought the attendance of the Minister for Health in the House to discuss the 300-page HIQA report on the emergency department in Tallaght Hospital.  That report is being discussed by the hospital&rsquo;s board today.  The Senator also raised more general concerns about patients on trolleys and issues concerning continuing reforms of hospital services.  I will speak with the Leader about organising a debate on the health service generally.  We can have another question and answer session with the Minister for Health, which I think colleagues find the most useful format, particularly for discussing accident and emergency services.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Paul Coghlan&rsquo;s welcome for International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia.  I believe his sentiment is shared by all of us, and other Senators have also spoken on this issue.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Conway, I came to the Order of Business from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  That was attended by a range of seven groups, most of which were NGOs, as well as representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na led by a chief superintendent.  They were all there to discuss homophobia and transphobia with members of the joint committee, as well as how to tackle homophobic bullying.  We welcome the forum that has been convened on that issue today by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen called for a debate on the BAI report on the media.  As he knows, I have already promised such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Harte referred to leaflets that have been distributed by MEPs from outside Ireland calling for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum.  I am not sure they are particularly helpful to the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  I am sure that the ULA and Sinn F&eacute;in will dissociate themselves from those leaflets.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan wants the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to attend the House for a debate on local government reform.  The discussion paper on that topic may not be published in time for us to have such a debate before the end of this session.  However, we would all be keen to have that debate early in the autumn session, once we have seen what the recommendations are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Once the Government has made a decision on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed, and once the Government has made a decision on the constituency revision report also.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane sought a debate on local government reform as well as a debate on the bullying of teachers via Facebook.  There are reports today that school students have been expelled for this activity.  There is a need for a more general debate on social media.  I have already raised the issue of who controls social media and whether the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland should have a role, which it currently does not.  I would be happy to facilitate such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also referred to the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia, and we share his views on that.  He also mentioned an article by Michael Barron of the youth group &ldquo;BeLong To&rdquo;.  I commend Mr. Barron who spoke in Paris yesterday at a UNESCO launch of an international guide against homophobic bullying.  I share Senator Norris&rsquo;s condemnation of the editorial in <i>Alive!</i> magazine.  I have been the subject of attacks from <i>Alive!</i> magazine before now.  I entirely agree with the Senator that the sort of language used in that newspaper is often disgusting and repulsive.  I am not surprised to hear Senator Norris refer to this particular article.  I share his view that this newspaper should be removed from churches.  I do not see why it should be available in churches.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Gilroy referred to suicide prevention and I commend him on his work on this matter as a <i>rapporteur</i>.  He has made information available to us all on suicide prevention, as well as holding a series of public meetings on the topic.  We might well have an all-party motion on suicide prevention, and if the Senator wishes to draw up the wording, we could agree on it.  We have already had such a debate relatively recently but we can certainly have another one.  In the last week, other colleagues have sought a somewhat broader debate on the funding of mental health services, which could encompass the issues of suicide prevention and awareness.  I will be asking the Leader to facilitate that debate in early course.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly asked for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to attend the House in connection with the US-Ireland Alliance.  That is a matter for the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Senator can also write to the Minister about that.  A number of colleagues have sought  a debate on the Middle East with the Minister in attendance but that would clearly be a broader debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins supported the call for a debate on suicide prevention.  In addition, he welcomed, as we all do, the announcement of 150 jobs in the medical devices sector in Galway.  As the Senator said, it definitely shows the need to keep Ireland on a steady path to recovery and attract these levels of foreign direct investment.  In recent months, we have witnessed announcements involving the creation of thousands of jobs, which are very welcome.  These are key to remaining on the path to recovery.  The Senator also raised the announcement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of &euro;8 million to tackle child malnutrition.  Anyone who heard the very disturbing report this morning from Niger of the levels of child malnutrition and starvation there would agree with the Senator&rsquo;s welcome for that announcement.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett called for a debate on admission to universities and rightly paid tribute to a former provost of Trinity College, Professor Watts, on his role in developing an independent system for admission.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s views on that.  It is a good idea to have a debate on it.  We had sought a broader debate on universities and the third level sector more generally, which is something we need to follow up on.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly raised the issue of medical cards and, in particular, the entitlements of mature students.  He said that the Joint Committee on Health and Children is seeking to bring in representatives from the PCRS to answer questions on that.  It might also be something we could cover as part of a more general debate on health in a question and answer format with the Minister in attendance in this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh raised the issue of homophobic bullying and spoke of having been, as he described it, bullied himself.  Having just heard the submission from BeLonG To at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the extraordinarily high levels of homophobic bullying experienced by young people, students and children in Ireland, one has to keep a sense of perspective and proportion on this.  Some 50% of young people who participated in a BeLonG To survey have experienced verbal homophobic bullying in school, 25% were physically threatened by their peers, appallingly, 34% heard homophobic comments from their teachers and 20% of LGBT people under the age of 25 have attempted suicide.  We need to maintain a sense of perspective and to recognise the serious and pressing problem of homophobic bullying in this country and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh also raised the issue of gay marriage.  That is being dealt with in the constitutional convention promised in the programme for Government.  Senator Walsh also raised the issue of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, which other Senators also raised.  There was a motion on that issue in the House on 2 February.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It was without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Conway raised the issue of the meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality with the NGOs, on which we have spoken.  He also raised the issue of the need for a national education programme.  The Ministers, Deputies Quinn and Deputy Fitzgerald, have today launched a forum on bullying in particular and a national education programme dealing with that.  Therefore, that is in hand.</P>
        <P>Senator Conway also raised the issue of a date for Ireland to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has been dealing with the mental capacity Bill, which we have recommended, as the Senator will know, should be renamed &ldquo;the legal capacity Bill&rdquo;.  The passing of that legislation is an important part of the process necessary for us to ratify the UN convention.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of a very important anniversary, that of the 90th Anniversary of the establishment of the 1922 Seanad on 11 December this year, which we should absolutely mark in this House.  I will speak with the Leader about that.  It is an excellent idea.  I am sure there will be cross-party support in the House for commemorating it.  This year is also the 90th anniversary of the 1922 Free State Constitution.  That, again, is something that is often overlooked but something which is well worth a commemoration on a national level.  I thank the Senator for raising that issue and it is a very important point.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane, who I am aware is attending a committee, called for a debate on the growth agenda, which I have said we will seek to have after the referendum, although anyone who participates in the debate on the stability treaty this afternoon will no doubt address the issue of growth.  It is very clear that there can be no growth without stability and this treaty and referendum seek to promote stability in Ireland and keep us on the steady path we are on.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane also raised the issue of the sale of State assets.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, made it very clear this morning that no strategically important assets are to be sold.  That is also set out in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Crown dealt with the issue of the rehiring of public sector staff.  I have more information on that, which has been provided now.  Clear criteria have been set out.  Staff should not be retained beyond retirement age &mdash; that is the general policy of Government.  Any re-engagement should be kept as limited as possible and should be for a restricted period, and abatement of pension is in place to ensure that where a public servant pensioner is rehired, their pension is reduced accordingly to ensure they can never earn more than they would have if they had continued working.  There were some particular rehirings across different Departments.  For example, 254 teachers were re-employed in the Department of Education and Skills until the summer holidays to ensure continuity for students who are facing important examinations at secondary level.  I will not go through the list.  Clear rationales have been provided for the particular rehirings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>The question related to the advisability of mandatory retirement, not to the rehiring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to the question the Senator asked but I thought I would share that with colleagues because a number of others had raised the issue of rehiring more generally in recent days and I did not have that information when I responded then.</P>
        <P>On the specific issue the Senator raised on mandatory retirement age, I agree with him.  It is something we should examine in this House and it was an issue we examined in the context of the public consultation committee hearings on the rights of older people.  We will have a debate on that issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has committed to come to the House on, I think, 12 June.  That issue is one we should address in that debate because it is a very particular issue.  I agree with the Senator that it encompasses people&rsquo;s rights &mdash; that of the right of people to continue working if they so wish. That is something we need to examine.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also something on which Senator White is working.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe raised the issue of having a debate on slow food and artisan food with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in attendance.   Such a debate would be well worth having given the asset that this movement is providing for tourism, the growing number of food festivals around the country and the increase in entrepreneurial activity around artisan food.  I have been asked to seek a debate with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on fisheries.  We might arrange for the two issues to be dealt with in such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator White raised the issue of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  There is a Fianna F&aacute;il motion on this issue but a motion on this issue was also moved in the House on 2 February.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>That  motion was without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check the progress on that.  It is also a matter that is being dealt with and that is before the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, to which the Senator referred.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke called for a debate on growth, which we can organise after the referendum.  The referendum is critical in seeking to ensure we will have growth and that we will continue to have it in this country.</P>
        <P>Senator Maloney raised the issues of medical cards and funding for Gaeltacht services.  We might address the medical cards issue during a debate on health more generally and the other issue might be worth raising as a matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>Senator Moran raised the issue of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and commended the Justice for the Forgotten group.  I think we would all share that commendation.  The Senator interestingly raised the point that the Irish team had been given permission to play wearing arm bands in the Ireland-Italy match.  I did not know that but that is very welcome and a sensitive and appropriate gesture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to respond to two colleagues, who gave their apologies yesterday, to whom I did not get to respond yesterday.  Senator Walsh raised the need for a debate on the media, which I had promised to seek with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, before the end of the summer.  Senator Healy Eames raised the need for a debate on youth unemployment and trade links with China.  We have had debates on those issues with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, but we can seek to arrange those again.  I give those responses because I did not do so yesterday.  I think I have responded to everyone who spoke.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to bring the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2012 before the House and I thank Senators for facilitating the debate as an urgent issue.</P>
        <P>This Bill proposes a small number of focused changes to company law in the interests of maintaining a dynamic and flexible operating environment particularly for US companies.  This is in keeping with the spirit and tradition of responsiveness of company law to continually evolving corporate circumstances.  The body of company law at this time comprises some 15 Companies Acts, and it is not standing still.  My Department is currently involved with a major legislative project on the reform and consolidation of company law to which I will return later.  I believe that Bill will run to 2,500 sections and will delight Senators when it comes to the House.  The ambition is to make Ireland one of the best places in the world in which to establish a company.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House amends those provisions of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which permit the use of US accounting standards &mdash; referred to as &ldquo;US GAAP&rdquo; in the preparation of the accounts of a specified category of company and allow for the prescription of the use of other internationally recognised accounting standards.  Without changing the eligibility criteria, the Bill extends both the timescales relating to the availability for use of US accounting standards and the period for which an individual company can avail of this provision.  There was a sunset clause and a maximum period that companies could use, both of which are being amended.  It also correspondingly extends the periods in respect of the provision in that Act for prescription of other internationally recognised accounting standards.</P>
        <P>The present measure can be seen in the context of the Government&rsquo;s policy of encouragement and facilitation of foreign direct investment.  The importance of foreign direct investment to the economy remains highly significant.  FDI accounts for a total of 250,000 jobs, which is one in every seven, in Ireland.  The immediate outlook for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign investment portfolio is exceptionally good.  To date in 2012 there have been 25 investment announcements with the potential to create more than 4,000 jobs.  It is encouraging to note that notwithstanding the economic downturn, Ireland continues to be an attractive location for foreign direct investment and that so many companies are prepared to undertake and announce these investments in Ireland.</P>
        <P>FDI has a major role to play in the current situation where Ireland is in the process of emerging from a period of unprecedented financial turbulence and where critical stages in that process still lie ahead.  However, there is widespread acknowledgement of and admiration for the progress we have made on this difficult recovery.  This Government has been operating on a wide variety of fronts in addressing the task of repairing our economy and restoring our international reputation.  We are engaging with our European colleagues, the United States and many other countries to demonstrate that Ireland is squaring up to its economic difficulties, and has the intent, resolve and imagination to overcome them.</P>
        <P>The restoration of Ireland&rsquo;s fortunes is an incremental process in which we all have a role to play.  It has occupied much of my time since taking office last year.  For example, I have undertaken eight major trade investment missions in that time, involving either IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland, in the course of which I have met representatives of companies from both sides of the United States, Saudi Arabia, India and China.  This has given me the opportunity to promote Ireland&rsquo;s many strengths and its strategic location as a gateway to the European market.  There has been strong interest in all aspects of what Ireland has to offer, including our skilled workforce, our pro-business environment, our tax offering, the base of multinational companies already here, and our embedded links with Europe.  Ireland is open, ready and eager for business and investment, and my hope is that this will lead to more jobs being created in Ireland in the near future.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s FDI landscape has continually undergone its own transformation, scanning the horizons of enterprise focusing on and securing FDI using novel technologies, innovative business models and new markets.  Ireland has evolved from being a location based originally on manufacturing to rebranding ourselves as the &ldquo;young Europeans&rdquo;, through to the model of the smart economy built on the dual strengths of our innovativeness and entrepreneurship.</P>
        <P>On a global scale, Ireland scores extremely well in many of the areas of importance to investors, helping drive FDI.  The IMD &ldquo;World Competitiveness Yearbook 2011&rdquo; ranks Ireland first in the world for corporate taxes, first for business legislation for foreign investors and first for the availability of skilled labour.  The same report also ranks Ireland second in the world for consumer price inflation, third for direct inward investment flows, third for availability of finance skills, fourth in the world for labour productivity and fourth for exports of commercial services.  The World Bank &ldquo;Doing Business Report 2011&rdquo; ranks Ireland first in the eurozone for ease of doing business, while Ireland is ranked second most attractive country globally for foreign direct investment by the &ldquo;NIB/FDI Intelligence Inward Investment Performance Monitor 2011&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Ireland, as a member of the European Union offers international investors a stable political and economic environment and a sophisticated, well-developed corporate, legal and regulatory environment.  The quality of our economic regulation is a significant factor in our competitiveness and growth.  It is critical, therefore, that we have the capacity to respond to economic circumstances as they unfold in a way that is both strategic and reflective of the evolving needs of business and investors.  Those companies with a presence in Ireland and availing of the US GAAP facility under the 2009 Act provide significant employment here which the present measure should help to consolidate, with the possibility of further jobs being created, particularly if the economic situation in export markets picks up over time.  These companies are involved across a range of industry sectors, including health care, technology and services.</P>
        <P>As mentioned earlier, the Bill allows for the US GAAP facility and the provision for prescription of the use of other international accounting standards, as provided for in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, to be extended from the financial year ending on 31 December 2015 until 31 December 2020 with a removal of the restriction of a four-year maximum period for the use by a beneficiary company of either of the provisions.</P>
        <P>The present proposal is a response to a strong approach to me from a number of US multinational companies, most of which have a significant operating presence in Ireland, requesting a prolongation of the &ldquo;US GAAP&rdquo; facility provided for in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The request has a basis in delays in the process of international convergence of these US GAAP accounting standards with International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, which is lagging behind the expectations we had in 2009, as well as the restriction of the time period allowed for use by a beneficiary company of US GAAP in the 2009 Act.  The present situation as regards the US Administration&rsquo;s attitude to this standards-convergence process or to a move to permitting this category of company to list in the US using IFRS accounting standards continues to be inconclusive.  While it will clarify over time, it is difficult to predict with accuracy when this may be.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The four-year maximum period allowed to companies to use US GAAP under the present legislation means that a number of the companies seeking the extension would be faced with having to put measures in place, as of the present time, to provide for the move by them to preparing accounts under IFRS.  While the companies&rsquo; entitlement under the 2009 Act does not expire until 31 December 2012, a considerable lead time is required for the necessary groundwork to be undertaken to provide for taking on a very different set of accounting standards, if this is required.  These companies, which are listed on US exchanges, need legal certainty now as to whether the extension of the time-related elements of the US GAAP facility is being permitted from a number of perspectives, including considerations of the corporate risk and corporate obligations requirements of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and shareholders.</P>
        <P>If the requested facility were not granted, significant costs and resource implications are entailed for these companies.  Appropriate mechanisms would need to be in place to provide for the preparation of accounts under IFRS and subsequently applied in the production of these accounts using these standards.  It would be particularly onerous and expensive for a company if the obligation to convert to IFRS were to arise over a relatively short period.  Furthermore, these companies would still be required to produce accounts using US GAAP and report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, in order to remain compliant in the US.  A requirement to produce two sets of accounts would prove costly and burdensome for these companies.</P>
        <P>The legislation is designed to facilitate multinational companies that have operations in Ireland to consolidate, and if possible, add to activities.  Such developments would further contribute to economic activity in Ireland and provide valuable employment opportunities.  The legislation which I am now introducing, therefore, provides for the extension of the use by this restricted category of companies of US GAAP as provided for in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 until financial years ending at the latest on 31 December 2020.</P>
        <P>The restriction on the use by the relevant parent undertaking of this facility to four years is removed.  In the interests of maintaining the flexibility provided for in the 2009 Act, I am extending the enabling provision for ministerial prescription of other specified internationally recognised accounting standards if such a demand arose and was considered appropriate to do so.  This term of this extension will parallel that for US GAAP.</P>
        <P>A significant point to make is that companies will continue to be subject to Irish company law generally, including of course all the provisions which relate to accounts.  In fact, Irish company law will override any provision of the US GAAP which may be in conflict with the Companies Acts.  Allowing these companies to prepare their Irish accounts using US accounting standards for a further period of time would eliminate the significant duplication of cost and effort of preparing two sets of accounts under two different sets of accounting standards.  It will also create a bridge to span the period during which significant international developments may occur relating to the convergence of US and international accounting standards.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to the details of the Bill.  Section 1 is the interpretation section.  Section 2 provides for the extension of the use of US GAAP as provided for in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 by certain parent undertakings which are defined in the section.  This is subject to the proviso that the use of those principles in the preparation of the undertaking&rsquo;s accounts does not contravene any of the provisions of the Companies Acts or any regulations made thereunder.  The accounts in question are the company&rsquo;s group accounts and the individual accounts.</P>
        <P>As heretofore, this arrangement will be limited to a specified category of companies.  In addition to existing beneficiary companies, the specified category of companies also comprises parent companies incorporating in Ireland for the first time whose securities are not traded on a regulated market in the European Economic Area, EEA; whose securities are registered with or who are subject to reporting to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, and who, on the date that this Bill passes into law, have not already incurred an obligation to file their first accounts with the Registrar of Companies.  The section also provides for this arrangement to apply from financial year ending at the latest on 31 December 2015 until financial year ending at the latest on 31 December 2020, with the four year restriction for a beneficiary company removed.</P>
        <P>Section 3 extends the Minister&rsquo;s power to make regulations to prescribe other specified internationally recognised accounting standards under which specified categories of companies may prepare accounts from financial year ending on 31 December 2015, as provided for in the 2009 Act, up to and in respect of financial year ending on 31 December 2020 at the latest, with the four year restriction for a beneficiary company removed.  The criteria applied under the 2009 Act remain.  These require that any such regulations shall specify the accounting standards, which shall be internationally recognised, and generally accepted accounting principles or practices of a jurisdiction where a majority of the subsidiaries of the parent undertaking have a substantial connection or where the market is situated on which the shares of the parent undertaking are primarily admitted to trading.  In preparing accounts using other internationally recognised accounting standards companies must not contravene any provision of the Companies Acts or any regulations made thereunder.</P>
        <P>Section 4 is a standard provision and simply contains the Short Title and provides that the Act and the Companies Acts shall be read as one.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to the ongoing major review and consolidation of the suite of Companies Acts being undertaken in my Department, and I welcome this opportunity to brief Senators on the status of this major project.  The Companies Bill will consolidate existing Irish company legislation dating from 1963 and introduce several reforms.  The proposed Bill will consolidate the existing 15 Companies Acts, or 16 when the Bill currently before the House becomes law, dating from 1963, as well as other regulations and common law provisions relating to the incorporation and operation of companies, into a single Act, which is expected to comprise some 1,400 sections.</P>
        <P>Parts 1 to 15 of the Companies Bill, which correspond to &ldquo;Pillar A&rdquo; of the general scheme, were published in soft copy format on my Department&rsquo;s website in May of last year.  Parts 1 to 15 contain all of the law relating to the most common company type in Ireland, the private company limited by shares.  These Parts comprise some 952 sections, together with 6 Schedules, and represent over two-thirds of the entire Companies Bill.  I decided to publish Parts 1 to 15 in May 2011 to afford stakeholders, including business owners, practitioners, advisers and representative bodies, an opportunity to become familiar with the proposed new legislation.  In summary, the provisions of the Bill cover the incorporation of companies, corporate governance duties of directors and secretaries, financial statements and auditors, receivers, reorganisations, examinerships, windings-up and compliance and enforcement.  The provisions are brought together in a coherent structure which will facilitate business people in incorporating and operating companies on a day-to-day basis.</P>
        <P>The Bill also modernises company law to reflect modern business practice.  Given that almost 90% of companies in Ireland today are in the form of a private company limited by shares, the Bill sets out all of the provisions relating to that type of company in sequential Parts.  In subsequent Parts the provisions for the private company limited by shares are modified for other company types such as public limited companies, PLCs, and guarantee companies.  Furthermore, to promote compliance with the law and to protect members and creditors, the Bill also sets out clearly the duties of, for example, directors, company secretaries and auditors, including corporate governance duties.  The Bill also sets out the functions of the Companies Registration Office, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority in ensuring compliance with the law and brings together the provisions relating to compliance and enforcement such as company investigations, compliance and protective orders, disclosure orders, disqualification and restriction of directors and prosecution, offences and evidential matters.</P>
        <P>I am happy to inform Senators that drafting of the remaining Parts of the Bill &mdash; those corresponding to &ldquo;Pillar B&rdquo; &mdash; is at an advanced stage, and I hope to be in a position to publish and introduce the Bill into the Houses towards the end of this year.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, the extension of the time lines both in the US GAAP provision and in the scope to designate other internationally recognised accounting standards is a facilitative measure which signifies the Government&rsquo;s practical and active approach to industrial promotion and stimulating foreign direct investment.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on his speech.  It brings us up to date on the agenda of the Government to make Ireland the best place to do business.  The Minister gave a first class presentation on the up-to-date position.</P>
        <P>As the Minister pointed out, one in every seven jobs in the Irish economy is the result of direct or indirect foreign investment, but 99.99% of Irish people do not realise that.  After all the years of foreign direct investment, and the continued success of that investment in Ireland, most Irish people still do not realise the contribution it makes.  It is positive for Ireland that despite our and Europe&rsquo;s financial woes companies considering investing abroad are still very happy with what is happening in Ireland.  At present, they are the drivers of our economy and are keeping it stable.  I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done in going around the world to spread the story of Ireland and in retaining international investors&rsquo; confidence in this country.</P>
        <P>The Bill extends the period in which companies can avail of using a different accounting standard from the accounting standards that prevail in Ireland.  The exception was introduced in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It was part of an evolving economy that kept up its standards for attracting investment.  One of the secrets of Ireland&rsquo;s success has been that no Government or political party, for a long time, has had a divergent view on how the economy should be developed.  We are all in agreement on the importance of foreign direct investment.  The extension of the period is necessitated by delays in the convergence of two international accounting standards, the US generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, and international financial reporting standards, IFRS.</P>
        <P>By extending the definition of relevant parent company or undertaking, this Bill includes companies which had not been required to make an annual return to the registrar of companies before the date on which the Bill comes into operation or those companies which used US generally accepted accounting principles in accordance with the 2009 Act since 23 December 2009.  The Bill also extends the expiry date which currently applies to the use of US generally accepted accounting principles.  At present, this is limited to four financial years, with an expiry date of 31 December 2015.  The amendment contained in the Bill will alter this by removing the four-year period and imposing an expiry date of 31 December 2020.  The Bill also amends the timeframe within which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation may make regulations under section 2 of the 2009 Act.  Currently, the Minister may make regulations allowing for the use of other internationally recognised accounting standards.  These regulations are subject to the time limits and expiry date set out in the 2009 Act.  The amendments contained in the Bill alter the wording of section 2 of the 2009 Act to reflect the removal of the four-year period and the extension of the expiry date from 2015 until 2020.</P>
        <P>Standard accounting practices require companies to follow certain accounting rules when presenting financial statements in order that the readers of the statements can comprehend the financial health of the company.  Unfortunately there is no worldwide agreement on the accounting rules and standards vary for different countries and for different types of companies within a country.  Some commonly used accounting standards include the generally accepted accounting principles of the United States, which are known as GAAP, as well as the United Kingdom&rsquo;s generally accepted accounting principles, which Ireland follows.  This standard is known as UK generally accepted accounting principles or occasionally as Irish generally accepted accounting principles.  There also are the generally accepted accounting principles of France and the international financial reporting standards, IFRS, which also are used in Ireland.  The lack of uniform accounting standards is particularly problematic when a company works across borders and under two different accounting standards.  As for convergence of such accountancy standards, work is ongoing by global accounting bodies to unify the US generally accepted accounting principles and the international financial reporting standards.  While it had been hoped these two standards would be unified by 2015, the delay in the harmonisation process necessitates this Bill to give companies confidence as to their future accounting rules.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, this Bill eliminates inherent waste and the burden of red tape, which is the <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of businesses and companies that are trying to invest and move fast on delivery of their projects.  Mr. Sean O&rsquo;Driscoll of Glen Dimplex recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education and it would be worth the Minister&rsquo;s while to study his contribution.  He raised the point, in an excellent speech drawn from his own practical experience, about the number of regulations made here that inhibit businesses from developing.  Allowing companies under certain circumstances to use the US generally accepted accounting principles framework makes Ireland a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment companies.  I thank the Minister and wish him continued good luck on his journey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>The provisions of this Bill will be welcomed by companies operating in Ireland.  The Minister has outlined how they made known to him their opinion on the need for this Bill.  It is highly pragmatic legislation to ensure that companies, most of which probably are American companies operating here, can continue to use both accounting standards and that both would be accepted.  The proposed revisions and the extension to the time within which such companies will be allowed to prepare their accounts under the framework that applies in the United States rather than the Irish or United Kingdom standards, was to have expired by the end of 2015.  However, as previous speakers have noted, this deadline is to be extended to 2020, within which timeframe such companies can avail of the facility.</P>
        <P>The first advantage comes with the elimination of red tape and the necessary savings that will accrue to companies when preparing end-of-year accounts.  I noted a media reference to the effect that an estimated &euro;15 million per annum can be saved by companies and while that figure was subjective, it probably gives an idea of the ballpark.  In addition to facilitating the reduction of red tape and saving time and money companies otherwise would be obliged to spend preparing end of year accounts, it also avoids confusion.  It is important for companies to have a single set of accounts for investors, shareholders and the public.  The case of a German company, Daimler-Benz, has been highlighted in this regard.  It was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1993 and while the company&rsquo;s end-of-year reports under German standards would have shown a profit of DM 615 million, under US standards it showed a loss of DM 1,800 million.  In itself, this example makes the case for the need for a single set of accounting standards to avoid confusing the public and would-be shareholders as there is a significant difference between the two standards.  In an ideal world and in a global sense, it would have been ideal to have in place a single set of accounting standards.  This matter was exercising G20 leaders, who set a deadline of the end of June 2011 to ensure the establishment of a single global set of accounting standards.  However, the deadline has passed and this has not happened.</P>
        <P>I note that in general, reporting here is done under the IFRS system.  While it will be important to achieve such certainty internationally, on reading the background material prior to making my contribution today, I learned some doubt exists as to whether such convergence can or will occur.  I hope it will but as it is out of Ireland&rsquo;s control, it is important to introduce pragmatic legislation such as this Bill.  I understand that financial instruments and insurable contracts are the challenge and are at the nub of the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the differences between the US GAAP and the IFRS model that operates in Ireland and across Europe.  An interesting summation is that the United Kingdom model, on which Ireland&rsquo;s model is largely based, is largely Victorian in origin and is based on absentee shareholders for whom the profits were important and who were far removed from the decisions made.  However, the United States system derives from the period after the crash of 1929 and much legislation was introduced during the 1930s.  For example, the Securities Exchange Act 1934 established the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Regulation is geared towards decisions at a lower level of involvement of shareholders and a lower level of stewardship in the accounting world.  It is geared mainly towards larger companies that are listed, rather than towards smaller companies.  Constantly, there are significant differences between the US GAAP and the IFRS, which is the system under which Irish companies generally operate.  There is divergence and broadly speaking, two international standards operate.  Ensuring certainty through having a single system will require the bringing together of international expertise.  From a global perspective, this would be ideal, particularly as borders now are disappearing and there are so many international stock markets.  In this context, it is important for companies, investors shareholders and the public to have certainty and a single system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome this Bill, although the number of sections is daunting and I am sure it will be challenging for Members.  However, it is important for the country because of the difficulties we have experienced.  A message must be sent out that Ireland is a place in which standards of the highest level are required on an international basis.  Such a message must be sent out from the perspective of investment and to have certainty.  The Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield, has gone a long way towards ensuring the sending out of a strong message to the effect that Ireland is a place in which one can do business and where standards of the highest possible level are required.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the investigation by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, into the Irish banking crisis found in some cases auditors and accountants should have been much more alert to weaknesses.  I welcome also that the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Purcell, former Comptroller and Auditor General, is also undertaking an investigation in this regard.  Such investigations are important.  As we move forward in consolidating and developing company law, it is important standards are clearly spelled out for all those involved, including directors who are not merely members of boards but who, because of their particular expertise, have been appointed to cast a watchful eye over accountants, company secretaries and so on.  Standards are important for a country which aspires to being the best small country in the world in which to do business.  We need to send a strong message in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Commission directive in respect of auditing, on which consultation is taking place, refers to the need for auditors to be rotated, an issue highlighted in the many incidences which have occurred recently.  There are many areas in respect of which we need to take action.  I look forward to publication of the companies Bill towards the end of the year and to our discussions around it.  The Bill before us is pragmatic.  It is a sensible piece of legislation in terms of the extension of the timeframe to 2020 in order to give certainty to foreign direct investors coming here.  As the Minister stated, they are an important part of our economic recovery.  Their interaction with our indigenous companies has been positive.  I recently attended a breakfast meeting in Cork at which the chief executive of IBM Ireland spoke about the reasons that company is in Ireland.  While our corporation tax rate is important to IBM Ireland, it is here because Ireland is a member of the European Union which has in place a strong regulatory regime and an excellent skilled workforce.  In my view, this legislation is a no-brainer.  It is hoped that we will, before we reach 2020, have in place internationally recognised regulatory standards world wide, thus there will be no need for this dual set of standards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I found the Minister&rsquo;s figures interesting, in particular those from the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2011.  I am impressed to hear that Ireland ranks first in respect of corporate taxes, business legislation, foreign investment and availability of skilled labour, second for consumer price inflation and third for direct inward investment and financial skills.  That is interesting information of which I was not aware.  It is also a reminder that we are in a competitive marketplace.  I have travelled a great deal during the past couple of years, including to Panama and Singapore which are determined to be the most attractive places for small businesses.  On that basis, we must remain alert.</P>
        <P>I welcome this legislation which extends to US companies the exemption from 2015 to 2020 for filing their accounts under Irish accounting practice<i>.  </i>The companies involved are major employees.  The last thing we need to do is discourage them or others from locating in Ireland.  It seems likely the quality of discourses will not change.  This exemption is to be welcomed because the US is such a large employer in Ireland and a massive contributor to FDI here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On foreign direct investment, can we make it easier to do business and so attract more FDI?  According to the British Government, a 2005-2010 programme in the UK reduced the burden of regulatory compliance on businesses by 25%, resulting in a &euro;4 billion saving for firms.  I frequently refer to the cutting of red tape to make it easier to do business.  However, I have an idea that could allow businesses, including foreign companies responsible for FDI, have a say on regulation, which could be done through e-government.  The UK invites comment on regulatory proposals on the website of the Better Regulation Executive.  Canada and the US publish guidelines on the evaluation process underlying the cost-benefit analysis of new regulations.  In the UK, the &ldquo;one in, one out&rdquo; system requires Departments to assess the net cost to business of complying with any new regulation that is proposed &mdash; which is an &ldquo;in&rdquo;.  These calculations are validated by the independent regulatory policy committee.  If a new regulation means a cost to business, a deregulatory measure &mdash; an &ldquo;out&rdquo; &mdash; that reduces the net cost by at least the same amount must be found.  One such &ldquo;out&rdquo; is a measure permitting credit unions to communicate with their members electronically.  This is estimated to reduce the net cost to business by around &pound;10 million, a calculation validated by the regulatory policy committee.  I believe we should not be putting on small business the same burdens as those placed on a multinational, in the same way as the Minister is trying to make it easier for US companies to do business.  We could have a public website through which the Government could gather the views of the business community, including foreign companies and the public, and invite practical suggestions for  alternatives.  Anybody would able to access the website and comment on any particular legislation identified for review.  The feedback from those affected by regulation will inform Government decision making.  When the period for comments closes Ministers would have a specified period, perhaps two months, to consider the comments provided.  This means burdensome regulations would be removed where no good reason for retaining them has been identified.   We debated legislation in this House yesterday which dealt with abolition of some old laws that have been on the Statute Book for years.  Many of the regulations which were introduced some ten or 20 years ago are no longer needed.  This would be a very practical step to show foreign companies that we are making it even easier to do business here.</P>
        <P>Could we attract more foreign investors into our marine business?  Ireland has the largest maritime area &mdash; 220 million acres to land mass &mdash; in the EU, yet it derives only 1% of its gross domestic product from the maritime sector.  Comparative figures for the UK, Denmark and Norway are 5%, 11% and 20% respectively.  Does the Minister or Minister for Communications, Natural Resources and the Marine intend to introduce any further incentives or tax breaks for companies who want to invest in the maritime area?  On a related note, why are wind energy electricity producers forced to pump power back into the grid for free while in the UK there is an incentive in terms of producers being paid for power that they generate, which is a source of income for farms and families.  If there is no reform of this area, there is much less chance of investment in wind energy, which could help business and the country as a whole.  We need to change this provision.  I believe it can be changed and that it would be comparatively simple to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, could bring new opportunities to bring FDI into Ireland and for Irish business to expand. The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s visits to OSCE states, where there are conflicts or field presences, will also be important in raising Ireland&rsquo;s profile.  These are states in which Ireland is not known.  While the primary purpose of these visits must be to aid in conflict resolution, they also offer opportunities to promote awareness of Ireland in an economic context.  Irish businesses active or interested in those countries can expect far greater name recognition for Ireland during 2012 than heretofore.  A region of particular importance is Central Asia.  Ireland has no resident diplomatic or trade presence in these five states and has traditionally had little contact with them.  However, the OSCE is a household name in this entire region and the visit of the chairman of the OSCE, the T&aacute;naiste, will offer an unequalled opportunity to make Ireland a household name too.</P>
        <P>I support the Minister in his efforts and I hope he is open to ideas to attract more foreign direct investment here.  It is something we can continue to do.  I know from what he said today that he is determined to do that and I encourage him to continue with the same energy, enthusiasm and commitment he has shown up to now.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and apologise that I missed his opening remarks because I was at a committee.  I will not profess to be an expert when it comes to economics, my knowledge of economics is pretty limited.  This legislation seems very sensible in that it will remove that onerous task of having to compile separate sets of accounts.  Where I come from, we know how important foreign direct investment is in providing jobs and this legislation can be seen in that light.</P>
        <P>Having to complete two sets of accounts is a very onerous task.  I agree with Senator Clune that it is a pity harmonisation seems to be taking a very long time.  I do not know if it can happen, although perhaps the Minister might have a different point of view.  It is a pity we cannot introduce a single set of accounts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure every Member will know that red tape is a major problem and stumbling block for businesses, even for small and medium sized businesses.  As it is seen as a barrier in some respects, I commend the Minister on these measures to reduce the amount of red tape for companies.</P>
        <P>As Senator Quinn pointed out, we must continue to make this country as attractive as possible for foreign direct investment, especially given the position in which we find ourselves.  It is paramount that we continue to attract foreign companies.  Our low corporation tax is thrown up every time a referendum is held, we are told it will be abolished and so on.  It is hugely important that we continue to bring companies here and this will go some way towards doing that.</P>
        <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> mentioned that the measure will save companies &euro;15 million per year but no source was given for that information.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to clarify that for us.  If it will save companies &euro;15 million per year, I hope they will invest it in real and tangible jobs.  I thank the Minister.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senators for their contributions to this debate and, in particular, I welcome Senator White&rsquo;s support for the work in seeking to build international confidence.  Through her family connections, she is very familiar with the competitive environment in which we are working.  It is true that one of the strengths of Ireland over a long period is the consistent political support for an open approach to business investment.  We have seen a number of changes in government over the years but a consistent approach has been maintained and investors like that certainty.  It is an instructive issue when we come to consider the referendum on which we must vote very shortly.  That sense of certainty and political consistency that people know how the Government will treat them over a long period is very important, in particular for industries where there is a long lead time on their investments as applies in many sectors, especially the pharmaceutical sector.  That level of long-term certainty is vital.</P>
        <P>I take Senator White&rsquo;s point about the address by Sean O&rsquo;Driscoll.  I have heard him speak before and I will familiarise myself with the speech he made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education to see if we can mine it for practical suggestions.</P>
        <P>Senator Clune raised the issue of the unsatisfactory nature of these differences.  That is well recognised.  I will have to check whether we have the potential during our Presidency of the Councils next year to, in any way, advance the reconciliation of the two systems.  Undoubtedly, if that level of cost is being experienced by companies, we need to ensure there is a permanent solution to it, even though we are providing a temporary solution to it here.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point about the initiative for regulatory compliance.  That is a practical suggestion and I will see if we can implement it.  As the Senator rightly suggested, the provision of, say, a two-month period with the opportunity to consider and comment on the regulatory environment would be very useful.  From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, we are very close to delivering the target of a 25% reduction in administrative burdens by the end of the year.  Other Departments are applying measurements to the level of administrative burden they create.  Where those Departments or agencies have not delivered the 25% target, which is an EU-wide one, they are engaged in developing specific proposals to deliver it.  It is an important benchmark which we need to achieve by the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>However, this is a continuing area for debate and Senator Quinn rightly pointed out that we need to go beyond the administrative side.  Even if we minimise the administrative cost of certain regulations, are they all still necessary?  That is a deeper issue and it is also exercising a lot of minds across Europe.  There is the issue of what the European target will be after the 2012 target expires.  It is very much focused on the narrow administrative side rather than the broader issue of whether the compliance burden is unnecessarily large because we have unnecessary regulations.  The Senator&rsquo;s suggestion is one I can go along with to see if we can factor that into our action plan for 2013.</P>
        <P>In concrete terms we are already undertaking an audit of licences for the retail sector to see what licences there are and to see if we can simplify them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is undertaking that audit.</P>
        <P>I confess that I am not an expert in the marine sector which does not fall centrally within my area.  The logic of the statistics the Senator produced, that we only generate 1% of GDP even though we have the highest ratio of sea to land, would suggest there is an untapped opportunity.  One of the elements of our action plan for jobs is to look at those sectors.  We have identified a number of sectors in the 2012 plan which we seek to develop.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is acutely interested in this sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Wind is another sector in which there are huge opportunities.  We have a natural advantage in that sector.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is developing refit price proposals &mdash; I do not have the details before me &mdash; for onshore wind and biomass delivery into the grid which incorporates incentives into the system.  Clearly, incentives constitute a gamble as one is committing to a higher price for a fuel and asking electricity users to pay more in the hope and expectation that the technology in the long term will be more competitive.  Therefore, there is a cost benefit analysis to be done by the State in each such decision.  One is making a gamble on the direction of oil prices in asking industry and households to pay more in the interest of a gain later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a balance to be struck in such calculations because we must be conscious of the here and now with many businesses under pressure.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, has to strike a balance in deciding these issues.  Clearly, there are many who see enormous opportunities in Ocean Wind where, undoubtedly Ireland has a competitive edge, but the ambition for Ireland is to get into the export market.  The real issue for Ireland is to establish a basis on which we would get the potential to export in the wind sector.  As I understand it &mdash; I am not speaking <i>ex cathedra -</i> the key is having access to other grids that would make a high proportion of wind on our grid cost effective.  We need the export markets.  As large amounts of wind cannot be generated for a confined grid, the extensions are required.  There is a whole economic strategy in developing the wind sector and there are huge opportunities.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is committed to developing a renewable energy policy which will provide a direction for that debate.</P>
        <P>In the conflict resolution territories, there are opportunities but I am not in a position to comment on the scope of them.  However, I will take note of what Senators have said.</P>
        <P>Senator James Heffernan raised the issue of savings from the reform and whether we can achieve investments for Ireland.  Clearly these issues are not linked.  To create a linkage would undoubtedly be illegal.  What I can say is that many of the companies we are facilitating are companies that have made significant investments in the recent past and continue to look at expansions in Ireland.  It is a stand-alone good regulatory practice that we who are host to many companies from the US should seek to have an accountancy environment that is supportive of their needs.  Rather than look for a<i> quid pro quo</i> we must recognise that our whole story is about making it easy to do business in Ireland and the more effectively we can do that, as Senator Feargal Quinn said, the more we will attract people to locate.</P>
        <P>In regard to the new approach to audit, and whether we could have a more consistent approach, at EU level new proposals are emerging, some of which are controversial.  Some would argue that the pendulum is swinging too far whereby if companies are conducting audits they cannot engage in other activities, the requirements of turnover of auditors, and the range of companies in which there would be intense audit requirements.  A debate is taking place to strike a balance to ensure the flaws in audit, exposed during the financial crisis, are corrected but not to introduce unduly restrictive requirements that we would regret in time.  This debate could come to fruition during our Presidency.  It may be that we are in the business of banging heads together when it comes to working out those audit rules.  We would be seeking to get a proportionate response.  As Senator Clune said, in the financial regulatory area we have sought a balanced response to get risk based regulation proportionate to the risks provided.  There is a need to do the same in the audit area.  I do not understate the difficulty of getting that because there are many interests involved which have to be balanced.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the support in the House for the Bill.  It makes good sense and it is part of a wider agenda to create a good business environment.  I thank Senators for their contributions and support for the measure.</P>

    <Title>British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first time either House has debated the subject matter since its inception in 1990 and it is useful and proper that we do so.  The 44th plenary which was completed in this Chamber made history because it was the first time that the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, as a body, sat in any parliamentary chamber in either country.  It is important to note that.  The body which, was formed in 1990, had many notable members.  When it was founded the former Taoiseach, the late Garret FitzGerald, and the current Taoiseach were members, as were some current Labour Party Ministers and the President, Michael D. Higgins.  I should have explored the list in order that I would have it correct.  In any event, they laid great foundations and the body has done useful work.</P>
        <P>As I said, the 44th plenary took place in this Chamber last Monday and Tuesday.  It was highly successful with a full and engaging programme.  We should thank the House and the authorities in the Oireachtas, the Cathaoirleach and his staff for making the Chamber and all of the ancillary facilities available.  The assembly members attending enjoyed the occasion.  It was appropriate that the meeting took place on the anniversary of the Queen&rsquo;s momentous visit to Ireland.  It provided us with a further opportunity to build on, enhance and deepen Anglo-Irish relations.  It was the first time that the assembly had met in a parliamentary chamber and proved most worthwhile.  The location was favourably commented on by the members from various parts of Ireland, Britain, the North, Jersey, the Isle of Man and Guernsey.</P>
        <P>The theme of the plenary was &ldquo;Making Business Easier Between Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and the topic is close to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s heart.  We heard addresses from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  The assembly also engaged with senior business leaders from the agrifood, manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries on developing trade opportunities between the two jurisdictions, islands and countries.  It was a new and innovative way to speak directly with key business people and to identify their priorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We heard a number of proposals that were endorsed by the assembly and I will refer to some of them.  It arose from the discussion with the chairman and chief executive officer of Glen Dimplex, Sean O&rsquo;Driscoll, who made the proposal that we conduct an annual British-Irish trade mission led by senior Government Members.  He also proposed that it would be useful if the Taoiseach could lead the Irish trade mission one year and the British Prime Minister could lead one the following year when it came here and they could accompany business leaders, with the venue alternating between Britain and Ireland.  The assembly endorsed his proposal.</P>
        <P>He further proposed a requirement for a joint manufacturing cluster.  Manufacturing strengthens an economy more than any other factor and acts as a multiplier of jobs.  He also recommended that the potential of the energy sector be exploited such as for renewables, buildings and homes.  Data on that sector was quoted and 50% of the energy consumed in Ireland and the UK is in buildings, 6 million homes are in fuel poverty and 50% of income is spent on fuels costing &euro;40 million per annum to provide heat.  He pointed out the enormous potential and opportunities for the sector and the potential for further direct job creation.  We all know that the development and certainty of an energy policy, similar to that in the UK, is important.  It would allow emerging businesses in the sector to plan and develop their businesses and UK counterparts could assist them.</P>
        <P>The area of regulation was dealt with and we all know that a certain amount of regulation is necessary and welcome.  However, we also know that there are some needless regulations imposed at enormous cost to business.  Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll suggested that an inventory of all regulations should be undertaken to ascertain which ones can be streamlined or done away with and his proposal was adopted by the assembly.</P>
        <P>Another assembly suggestion was to review and open up the Government&rsquo;s procurement policy to enable SMEs to compete for contracts more easily.  The adoption of a social consideration was suggested when assessing tenders.  Mr. Eoin Tonge from Greencore put forward the key message that Ireland and the UK are interdependent <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> proximity and a similar food culture.  The relationship is huge and needs to be protected.  He talked about the synergies across the UK and Ireland as it pertains to the food industry.  Common standards were also mentioned and food regulation is necessary to create consumer confidence but duplication poses a difficulty.  We need to ensure that we do not create false barriers to or for business.</P>
        <P>With regard to EU regulations, a common approach should be adopted and expertise shared to ensure a similar local interpretation.  We should also facilitate companies that work together to remove inefficiencies which is more important and pertinent in order for the UK and Ireland to co-operate as trading partners.  Another assembly suggestion was the creation of links between companies in the food industry, particularly with educational institutions and Deputy Conway mentioned Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was important that the body met here and it was a success and it dealt with the points outlined by the Taoiseach.  He was very strong in pointing out that Britain is our nearest neighbour and closest ally and that the body, and now the assembly, has done much good work in establishing closer links and great co-operation over the years.  It has gone beyond what was imagined in its early years and our task is to build on that.  The relationship between the two islands has exceeded what the body was initially set up to assist with, namely, the central issue of the North of Ireland, and that is important.  The President hosted a reception for the assembly and made similar interesting points in his address.  I will leave it to other colleagues to address those points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The work of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly plays an extremely important role in fostering the relationship between the two islands.  As my colleague from Kerry has pointed out, the issue of trade has become more focused at these meetings.  Once upon a time Britain was our largest trading partner and it is as important to all of our manufacturers and suppliers in Ireland as we are to it.  As certain issues in the North have receded, such as the violence that blighted this island for so long, we can focus on the issues of mutual concern and benefit to both populations.  That does not mean that we cannot raise such matters as some colleagues did today in the chamber on the Order of Business when they spoke about justice and justice delayed.  Today is the anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and we have been denied justice for it.  As my colleagues, Senators Mary M. White and Jim Walsh have pointed out, nobody has been brought to trial for the atrocity where more people lost their lives than in any other single atrocity during the Troubles.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is important because we can raise these issues with our parliamentary colleagues in Westminster and seek justice for those who have been denied it for so long.</P>
        <P>As my colleague has pointed out, trade issues are increasingly important and should be.</P>
        <P>He has proposed that a trade delegation should be led by senior Ministers and the Taoiseach.  That would be very important in expanding these links.  I am pleased that Mr. Naughton has taken up the challenge of being the first president of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce.  That positive development will be good for the economies of both islands.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I mentioned on Tuesday that I welcome the use of the Seanad Chamber for the deliberations and discussions of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on issues of concern to Ireland and Britain.  I have proposed to the Minister that this Chamber be used next year during The Gathering for a meeting of members of the Westminster Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the assemblies in America, the Parliament of Australia and the Parliament of New Zealand who are of Irish descent.  We should invite them to come back to Ireland to discuss issues of mutual concern.  The Members of the Seanad and the other House should be involved in those discussions with our colleagues from other parliaments.  This Chamber would be the ideal location for such a debate.</P>
        <P>I welcome the ongoing work of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I wish it continued success.  I know it has issued a number of reports on certain topics.  We would like progress to be made on those matters.  If we discuss our problems and try to find solutions, we can achieve a better outcome for our citizens.  I refer not only to economic matters, but also to the justice that has been denied to so many citizens and communities from all parts of this island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was with great interest that I saw the Seanad Chamber in all its glory when I turned on my television the other day.  When I noticed that every chair in the House was filled, I wondered whether somebody had failed to tell me about something.  When I realised that the Chamber was being used for the 44th plenary session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I was glad it was getting that kind of coverage.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly mentioned that today marks the anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974.  Some 33 civilians were murdered and approximately 300 people were injured in that horrible atrocity.  It has to be noted that nobody has ever been convicted of those crimes.  We should keep pursuing the matter.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to see the Seanad Chamber full of parliamentarians from Britain and Ireland.  Since 2001, parliamentarians from Northern Ireland, the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Parliament and the assemblies in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey have participated in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  It goes to show how far we have moved with our neighbours across the water.  We have developed a much more cordial relationship with them.  We have a closer working relationship as well.</P>
        <P>The British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, has said the mutual dependence of our economies is widely recognised on both sides of the Irish Sea.  He has mentioned that the value of Britain&rsquo;s exports to Ireland exceeds the combined value of its exports to the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China.  That shows how much we depend on one another.  It is important for us to continue to work together.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is an important cog in that regard because it brings parliamentarians together.</P>
        <P>I note that this week&rsquo;s session of the assembly was addressed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  He spoke about the historic visit to this country of Queen Elizabeth.  He mentioned that the Olympic flame, which is an internationally recognised symbol of unity, co-operation and friendship, will be carried through the streets of this city and other cities and towns on both parts of the island.  This fantastic event for the country, North and South, will have to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>As Senator Paul Coghlan said, the theme of the session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly was making business easier between Great Britain and Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, made an interesting point in his remarks when he referred to the opportunity to attract high-value, high-spending visitors to both islands from rapidly growing countries like Brazil, Russia, China and India.  He said he wants to find a way to facilitate that.  The common travel agreement for our own citizens is beneficial to us, but it does not help a person from China who wants to visit Dublin.  Such a person would need a separate visa for every country in Europe, even if he or she wanted to cross the Border to see the Bushmills distillery or the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.  The Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the provision of a visa waiver in such circumstances is an important step forward.</P>
        <P>I am glad the next session of the assembly to be held in Ireland will take place in the spring of next year and will tie in with the massive Gathering extravaganza that has been promised.  As part of that event, people from all corners of the globe will be encouraged to come back to Ireland.  It will be vital to get people to come back here and to invest in our country.  I look forward to that.</P>
        <P>I am not a member of the assembly, unfortunately.  I would have had an interest in it.  I was glad to be asked to contribute to this morning&rsquo;s debate.  I am impressed by the extent to which the assembly is sensitive to people&rsquo;s sensibilities in advance of the various centenary celebrations in the coming years.  I have to give a plug to my party&rsquo;s involvement in one of the first of those celebrations this year &mdash; the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Labour Party.  Given that the centenaries of momentous occasions like the Battle of the Somme and the 1916 Rising could provoke division rather than understanding, it is important that the advisory group on centenary celebrations will consider the context and the tone of those celebrations and will make sure such events are marked on an all-island basis, as much as possible.  When the group is making its recommendations, it needs to take account of the fact that events like the 1916 Rising, the 1913 Lockout and the Battle of the Somme were part of a bigger global picture, especially as we often tend to be insular about our history.</P>
        <P>Having spoken to some of those who attended this week&rsquo;s session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, it seems to have been a successful occasion.  I wish the assembly continued success.  The work it has done since its foundation to promote understanding and peace between our peoples cannot be under-estimated.  We have come a long way since its foundation.  We must welcome that and wish it continued success into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I endorse all the statements made by my colleagues.  This is a marvellous time in British-Irish relations and the work of the interparliamentary body is to be commended by all sides of the House.  When one thinks of some of the wonderful things that have happened, one could say the &ldquo;Bull&rdquo; Hayes was not the only person who shed a tear on that memorable day in Croke Park when God Save the Queen was sung before that wonderful match.  The work of Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly to ensure this came about was magnificent.</P>
        <P>When we think of parliamentary relations between Ireland and the UK, it is certain we sent some pretty good hitters over there &mdash; the Bantry Band, commemorated in the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s home town, Edmund Burke, Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, Charles Stewart Parnell, Henry Grattan and Edward Carson.  We have really made a mark on the parliamentary institutions of the adjoining island.  Any obstacles that exist in regard to trade and energy policy, which were noted by Senator Paul Coghlan, will, I am sure, be removed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach spoke about our close links.  It is a little over a year since the Queen&rsquo;s visit, which had a marvellous impact.  Among my own constituents, many of whom live in England, I found it was probably one of the happiest days of their lives to see Her Majesty being received everywhere in Dublin, including in Trinity College, and it made them feel very proud of their associations with this country.  They will have a good outing this Saturday night at Twickenham, with two Irish teams in the sell-out European final fixture.  This has brought Ireland to a place on the world stage which we have not seen the like of before.</P>
        <P>The joint effort of the two communities to run the Derry-Londonderry City of Culture is a wonderful idea which I hope succeeds.  I was grateful for the hospitality of Mr. Speaker Hay and Ms Sheila McLelland in Stormont, where the hospitality and friendship are wonderful.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to President Higgins, who also hosted an event.  One of the first invitations he received from outside the country was to give a lecture at the London School of Economics.  Those contacts between universities mentioned by Senator Coghlan are continuing all the time and it is a wonderful era in that regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of Mr. Martin Naughton as president of the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce.  It is hard to think of a better man to do that job, given he has had businesses on both sides of the Border and in the UK for a long time.</P>
        <P>In my own constituency, in 1931, the college historical society asked Douglas Hyde whether he would become president of the society.  He said he would, but on one condition, namely, that the society had to ask Edward Carson first.  It was most interesting that the future President of Ireland nominated the leader of the Unionist Party to be head of a student discussion and debating society.  We have recovered all of that spirit and camaraderie in recent times.</P>
        <P>It was a wonderful idea to use this Chamber as the centre of the debates.  One can only wish the work of the interparliamentary body every success and award to it and to the previous Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, to Mr. Tony Blair, who did such great work, and to the current leaders in Northern Ireland the thanks and appreciation of everybody here.  While we have had our problems on the economic front, relations between the two countries and between North and South have never been better.  Full credit to all concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to make my contribution as a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  As has been said, we were in this Chamber for the very historic occasion of the 44th plenary session, which I was privileged to attend.  The assembly consists of members of the parliaments of the United Kingdom and the Oireachtas, as well as five representatives from the Scottish Parliament, five from the National Assembly for Wales, five from the Northern Ireland Assembly and one each from the States of Jersey, the States of Guernsey and the Tynwald of the Isle of Man.  Working together, the assembly has since it was founded done Trojan work to promote peace, justice and reconciliation throughout all of the islands.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many speakers have focused on the atrocities that have happened and, particularly given the dates concerned, on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the Loughinisland massacre, and the fact the FAI has agreed the wearing of armbands for Euro 2012, rightly so.  There was acute instability on these islands at that time.  We must look to the work of the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, the Justice for the Forgotten group and the peace commission.  All of those groups on this island and the other islands should be brought to this House for a further debate on peace and reconciliation and how we could move forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Historically, the assembly has its origins in the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which initially consisted of 25 members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and 25 members of the Oireachtas.  In 1998 the British-Irish Council was established under strand three of the Good Friday Agreement.  The council, or the assembly, as it is known today, brings together Ministers from the British and Irish Governments and all of the administrations in the various parts of the United Kingdom and Ireland.  In addition, Strand Three of the Good Friday Agreement stated that, as well as intergovernmental links, &ldquo;the elected institutions of the members will be encouraged to develop inter-parliamentary links, perhaps building on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In 2001 the body was enlarged to include representatives of the various legislative bodies.  I would like to see this enlarged further to include a local authority grouping.  We all know the fantastic community and voluntary groups working on the ground with the local authorities, and such an add-on to the assembly could serve to flesh it out further.  While there was a group at local authority level some years ago, it has been disbanded.  I would like to see such a grouping reinvigorated and re-established under this body.</P>
        <P>The committees that comprise the assembly meet regularly, although they could perhaps meet more regularly and take on extra work.  At the most recent plenary this week, a wide range of issues were discussed and studied by the respective committees, including the role of business in supporting business and tourism, the report on SMEs, the food sector in Britain and Ireland, health provision and British-Irish economic relations.</P>
        <P>Committee D, of which I am a member, discussed the findings of its report on flooding in Britain and Ireland.  During the plenary meeting of the assembly in Brighton in October 2011, severe flooding occurred in Dublin and in England.  Given the operation of river basin management and the links between North and South, we presented a report on flooding at the plenary session, with recommendations which give plenty of food for thought.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who is responsible for the OPW, was present.  He is in regular contact with the river agencies in Northern Ireland and, indeed, there is a legal requirement for cross-Border co-operation as well as east-west co-operation.</P>
        <P>The levels of co-operation between the local authorities is good.  I have just come from an Oireachtas committee meeting on the new water authority, where one of the recommendations is for an all-Ireland strategy on water provision.  I will be taking that up at the next meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach said in his address to the assembly members on Monday that Britain is our closest ally.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, commented that Britain was by some distance our most important trading partner and a transit point for trade and travel with much of the rest of Europe and the world.  It is difficult to argue with these views.  British-Irish relations are imperative in terms of business and trade and it is imperative that all Governments play their parts to ensure that our relationship with our nearest neighbour continues to grow and strengthen.</P>
        <P>We had a number of guest speakers from the business and food sectors, including Mr. Sean O&rsquo;Driscoll, CEO of Glen Dimplex; Mr. Eoin Tonge, director of Greencore; Ms Sally Storey, vice president of GlaxoSmithKline Ireland; and Ms Darina Allen of Ballymaloe Cookery School, who also wears many other hats.  All of the speakers acknowledged the opportunities for creating stronger links with Britain.  In particular, I noted Darina Allen believes there should be huge potential for the creation of jobs in food sector tourism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, I support Sean O&rsquo;Driscoll&rsquo;s suggestion that we should have a rotating trade mission to the United Kingdom every second year.  According to his suggestion, Ireland and Britain would host trade missions from each other in alternating years, therefore there would be an Irish trade mission to the UK every second year.  Ireland is also an important export market for the UK and I believe there would be interest from Britain in engaging with Ireland on a more formalised basis on this issue.  In the past couple of months, Ireland engaged in high profile trade missions to the US and China, which have been instrumental in generating business for Irish companies and promoting Ireland as a country in which to invest.  These trade missions are a highly effective way of displaying our wares to a dedicated audience.  Britain is our nearest neighbour and by far our largest trading partner.  I agree with Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll that this form of trade mission to Britain would be an effective way of promoting Ireland.</P>
        <P>Few Irish companies have had as much success as the four we had in the House.  While it is clearly important from an economic and environmental trading perspective that we maintain and reinforce our links with the United Kingdom, it is equally important that we cherish and value our shared heritage, culture and geographic ties.  It is not so long since relations were so estranged that there was little or no cross co-operation or dialogue.  A DUP Member of the Legislative Assembly, Jim Wells, said when he spoke in this Chamber on the historic occasion of the 44th plenary that if he had been told 20 years ago that he would visit Leinster House and speak here, he would not have believed it.  That speaks volumes for everybody who was in the Chamber on the day.  Also, who would have thought that the Queen would visit Ireland in 2011?</P>
        <P>Progress has been made at political level in promoting peace and better relations North and South and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly plays a huge part in what we do in this regard.  I look forward to the next meeting of the assembly and believe the outlook for the future of relations with Britain is very positive.  Networking with members, be they political or non-political is invaluable.  This group has done significant work for peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the 44th meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I am well acquainted with this group and had the privilege from 1995-1997 of being the Irish co-chairman of what was then known as the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  My colleague on the British side at the time was the then Conservative MP, Peter Temple Morris.  Now, having done a little political side turn, he is a life peer representing the Labour Party.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What the people who set up this body in the late 1980s or early 1990s &mdash; the likes of Jim Tunney, Peter Barry, Michael Mates and Peter Brooks &mdash; put in place has turned out to be a most effective element of parliamentary business.  We often hear the phrase &ldquo;talk is cheap&rdquo; and we often hear politics and political assemblies being deemed to be nothing more than talking shops.  However, this was a talking shop which worked and produced results.  The great benefit of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, as it was, and now the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, was that it brought people together who previously would not even meet each other or engage in any degree of political dialogue and through ongoing meetings, sub-committee and plenary meetings in  the course of ten to 15 years, people who were foes became friends.</P>
        <P>People sometimes criticise politicians for the social occasions which often flow from formal politics, but I recall many social occasions at which members from either end of the political spectrum were comfortable wining, dining and singing along with people from the other end.  Complex problems such as the Northern Ireland problem can only be resolved by dialogue and friendship and the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, now Assembly, played a strong role in that regard.  I was delighted to be associated with it for the few years I was.  The work, however, must continue, because the building of peace is slow and its bedding down is even slower.  We cannot rest on our laurels and the ongoing dialogue between east-west and North-South must continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know there was a busy schedule of work before the assembly this week and I am aware it concentrated on many issues, including the commemorations project being led by former Senator and Deputy, Maurice Manning.  This project must be handled very carefully because different days and dates mean different things for many people.  Respect and consideration must be at the core of all of the commemorations, whether the Battle of the Somme, the Ulster Covenant, the First World War or the 1916 Rising.  All of these issues must be handled with great care.  Seven or eight years ago, I requested we begin planning for the commemoration of the 1916 Rising and I tried to take into account all sides of the equation.  I am happy that is happening now and that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, is showing leadership on that issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call on the Minister and on my party and everybody else to begin to plan for the commemoration of what was probably the greatest tragedy on this island, the Irish Civil War.  It has been the source of bitterness, division and strange politics on this island since the early 1920s.  As a country, a nation and a Parliament, we are great at lecturing others on peacemaking and on how to move on.  However, we have a big job of politics, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Party members in particular, in reflecting upon the Civil War.  We cannot replay it because what is written is written and what is done is done.  We must consider how we grow, develop and move on.  It is great that when the 1916 centenary will be commemorated, we will have an island at peace with itself and with its neighbours.  I hope that by 1921 and 1922, when we are commemorating and reflecting on the centenary of the Irish Civil War, we will have arrived at a stage of grown-up politics and that political parties will recognise the reality that the divisions which divided brother from brother, neighbour from neighbour and family from family are well over and that we must now look at the new allegiances and political alignments that must flow from that.  This will be a big project for us and we can learn from the work done by groups such as the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in tackling and considering the past in a reflective and sensitive manner, while deciding that the future cannot be a prisoner of the past.  I look forward to engaging on that in some small way and to seeing the two Civil War parties decide to let bygones be bygones.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate the co-chairmen of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on the work they did during the week.  I watched some of the proceedings on the monitors and believe there was a great level of engagement.  In its previous incarnation, the body consisted of 25 Members from the House of Commons and House of Lords and 25 Members from Leinster House and that may have been a sharper and more precise grouping.  However, the addition of the Scottish, Welsh, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey groups adds to the flavour and helps colour the jigsaw.  All of these people coming together to talk &mdash; maybe talk shop &mdash; produces results and helps trade, tourism and relationships.  Just 25 or 30 years ago, the majority of people in the Republic had never travelled to Northern Ireland.  I recall asking people at Fine Gael meetings over the years how many had travelled abroad.  Almost 100% would have visited Britain, 20% to 30% had been to the United States but only 5% or 10% had been to Northern Ireland.  That mental barrier has broken down but that does not mean we can end the dialogue or discontinue the economic, social and political projects.</P>
        <P>I congratulate all who were involved in the plenary.  It was great that the Seanad Chamber was used as a venue for meetings, although I hope it is not a sign that it will become an antique house for extraneous bodies.  There are interesting similarities between BIPA and the Seanad.  While BIPA does not have the power to make big decisions or overturn governments&rsquo; proposals or legislation, it can exert an influence through dialogue and constructive engagement.  The Seanad must approach its work in the same way.  The two bodies can learn from each other.</P>
        <P>I understand the assembly will hold its next plenary in Scotland but its sub-committees meet frequently and its members are very active even if their work is not well publicised.  They do valuable work which has made a genuine difference.  Long may that continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to hear the views of Senator Bradford, as a distinguished co-chair of BIPA.  The Senator urged the committee of which I am a member to exercise caution as we enter the decade of commemoration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the co-chairs of the assembly, Deputy McHugh and Laurence Robertson, MP, for the great body of work they managed to deliver.  Tewkesbury, the constituency which Mr. Robertson represents in Parliament, encompasses the famous Cheltenham racecourse with which a number of Members will be familiar.  He has extended a general invitation and I believe the Taoiseach intends to visit next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is another day&rsquo;s work.  I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  Senators Heffernan, Keane, Daly and Barrett made worthy contributions.  There was a degree of duplication in some of our remarks but we touched on most of what needed to be said.  This is the first occasion in which time was set aside not only in this House, but also in the D&aacute;il to discuss a plenary of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  This was also the first time in which both a Taoiseach and a President addressed a plenary.  The President hosted a wonderful reception in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and gave a highly significant speech.  He made several interesting statements and also complimented this Chamber&rsquo;s ceiling and chairs.  I know he made a great impression on our visitors from around the islands.  The great thing about Britain and Ireland is that we have moved on to this stage.  There is further work to be done but we have been co-operating in Europe for the last 40 years.  There is no doubt that we have reached a new level of maturity.</P>
        <P>Among the speakers was Darina Allen, who is a food genius.  Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland also deserve our thanks.  I hope we have properly thanked everyone involved.  I am grateful to the Leas-Chathaoirleach for giving me the time to speak.</P>

    <Title>Treaty on Stability, Cooperation and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With less than two weeks to go to the referendum day on 31 May, it is important to have a debate in the House on the importance of the treaty to Ireland, to the future of our country and to the stability of the euro.  The first reason for voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the treaty is that it promotes good housekeeping.  Passing the treaty will prevent future governments from spending and borrowing excessively from future generations to finance reckless and unsustainable budgetary policy.  The treaty is essentially a set of fiscal rules designed to strengthen and stabilise the European Union and to support job creation and growth.  The rules are backed up by strengthened surveillance, co-ordination and governance among member states.  For Ireland, this will mean legislating to introduce fiscal rules that will require future governments to run sensible and sustainable budgets.  We never want a repeat of the past number of years.  The rules will ensure that never again can a government increase current expenditure on the basis of unsustainable tax receipts as we saw in the property bubble in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Contrary to what has been suggested by many on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side, the treaty will not lead to our budgetary and fiscal policies being decided in Brussels and Berlin.  The Government of the day will be free to decide the level of public services and, in line with common sense, it must ensure it raises sufficient revenue to pay for the services.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Another reason to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the importance of foreign direct investment.  The multinational sector in Ireland employs more than 140,000 people directly in factories and offices across the country.  As we have seen in recent weeks, many significant job announcements have been made.  Today, in County Galway, 150 jobs were announced by Merit Medical, which will be of great significance to those in west Galway and many in east Galway.  Ireland is still a significant place to invest and in a debate this morning the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, cited interesting figures.  On a global scale, Ireland scores exceptionally well in many of the key areas of importance for investors.  This score helps to drive investment.  The IMD world competitiveness yearbook of 2011 ranks Ireland first in the world for corporate taxes, business legislation for foreign investors and availability of skilled labour.  The report ranked Ireland second in the world for consumer price inflation, third for direct inward investment flows, third for availability of finance skills and fourth for labour productivity and exports of commercial services.  We certainly need to protect this.  When the people of Ireland make a decision, they should keep this in mind.</P>
        <P>The foreign direct investment sector is proving to be a key driver of job creation, following record levels of investment in 2011, and more than 1,000 jobs a month have been announced by multinational companies in the year to date.</P>
        <P>This sector employs thousands of graduates directly from Irish colleges and universities and offers graduates great opportunities to build rewarding and challenging careers.</P>
        <P>Multinational companies see Ireland as an excellent base from which to service their European and world markets.  In addition to the US and European multinationals, emerging countries such as China, are beginning to look at Ireland as a hub and a gateway to the European and US markets.  I refer to the recent very successful trade missions to China and the visit to Ireland by the Chinese has been very significant and it is hoped this will drive future Chinese investment in this country.</P>
        <P>These companies are not establishing in Ireland with the intention of servicing the domestic market.  Potential investors regard our central place in Europe as key to our attractiveness and a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will send a clear message to investors that Ireland is fully committed to the European project.  A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will ensure that investors who have put decisions on hold pending the outcome of the referendum will make the investment and will ensure that the existing companies continue to trade and prosper in Ireland.  However, a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote will diminish our attractiveness as a base for investment and this is a risk we should not take.</P>
        <P>It is significant that the IFA has decided that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is best for our families, best for our businesses, best for our communities and best for our country.  Membership of the EU and a stable euro is critical for exports, jobs, inward investment and economic recovery.  Agriculture is the only major sector with a common EU policy, the Common Agricultural Policy, which is centrally funded from the EU budget.  Negotiations on the future size and structure of the CAP towards 2013 are ongoing and it is vital that Ireland is in a position to exert its influence and maximise its goodwill in these negotiations.</P>
        <P>It is significant that the managing director of Glanbia has said it is critical to have a stable currency base in order to maximise our competitive position as export markets are developed.  The chairman of Connacht Gold, Padraig Gibbons, said that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is critical for building confidence in our fragile economy and for ensuring that Ireland continues to have access to all sources of funding and support from the EU.  The chief executive of Cork Marts cites the availability of credit at a competitive rate as being significant and many more people across the agri-food business are supporting the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum.</P>
        <P>This treaty is an insurance policy or a safety net and it will ensure that we will have access, if needed, to ESM funding which will allow us to fund those public services and all Government spending.  The Government programme is on target but the country is far from immune to global economic events.  The markets need to know that we will have a backup in the form of the ESM for access to funds if required.  It is vital that Ireland ratifies the treaty on 31 May.  I call on all the people of Ireland to study the treaty over the next week and to attend the information meetings.  If anyone from east Galway is listening, there will be an information session in Ballinsloe on Monday evening at 8.30 p.m. and all are invited.  The Government and the Referendum Commission are doing a good job in providing information to the electorate.  I hope that on 31 May, the people of Ireland will give a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the stability treaty which will ensure the future success of our country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">People are becoming quite tired of the campaign at this stage.  They are hoping it will be over as quickly as possible and that a positive decision will be made.  To assist in the campaign, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, of which I am a member and the sub-committee on the treaty published its report yesterday and this is available online.  The sub-committee was chaired by Deputy Dominic Hannigan, the clerk to the committee is Mr. John Hamilton and its members were an excellent team from the Oireachtas.  We put together a very good document on the treaty which has been well researched.  We have been studying the various aspects of the treaty since early this year and before the treaty was even finalised.  I compliment our representatives in Brussels, our negotiators, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach and everyone who worked to achieve the treaty at this stage and which is vital to the national interest of Ireland.  Of the 17 eurozone members, only 12 members must agree to the treaty for it to come into force.  I would like Ireland to be one of the first members to ratify the treaty.  Furthermore, the 4.5 million people in Ireland are the only ones of the 500 million people to have a say.  I note that visitors from other countries have been here trying to persuade the Irish people to reject the treaty but all the people I have heard are totally anti-Europe.  They are opposed to Europe and they regard the destruction of Europe as starting here on 31 May if the Irish people reject a positive, progressive treaty which is in the best interests of their country.  In my view, the involvement of these visitors will assist the Government and the main opposition party in the campaign to have the treaty ratified.</P>
        <P>The leaders of the main parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, are promoting this treaty.  The submissions and detailed comments by the members of the sub-committee are well worth reading and I hope the public will be given the opportunity to read the report which is available online.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to stress the importance of the treaty which establishes the European Stability Mechanism as an element of a global strategy to strengthen the economic and monetary union.  The granting of assistance in the framework of new government programmes under the European Stability Mechanism will be conditional as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of the treaty by the contracting party concerned and as soon as the transposition period mentioned in Article 3.2 has expired, on compliance with the requirements of this article.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is the key point in that it gives us access to funding in the region of &euro;700 billion after we finish our present programme with the troika, the European Union and the European Central Bank.  Nobody else can guarantee funding.  This was a point put to the leaders of other parties and others who are campaigning against the treaty.  It is a case of if, but, and maybe.  If we reject this treaty maybe we will receive money from the IMF.  Why would the IMF provide funding of up to &euro;16 billion to &euro;18 billion after the end of 2013 if we do not get it on the bonds which would be the first step?  It is highly unlikely the IMF would give us funding at a low rate if we reject access to the European Stability Mechanism.  Such funding, if provided, would be at a very high interest rate.  Nobody in the opposite camp in this campaign has given me or the public an idea of where the money will come from as it is purely aspirational.</P>
        <P>In the ordinary line of business, if a person with access to very low interest rates on borrowings rejects that proposal and then goes to a commercial bank looking for funding, the bank would doubt that person&rsquo;s head for business.</P>
        <P>Nobody in the opposite camp can explain this key point in this debate.  The contributions by the Taoiseach and by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin who is a former Minister have made the situation clear.  Brian Lucey, the associate professor of finance in Trinity College, Dublin, stated on page 76 of the report:</P>
        <P LI="1">Alternative funding is potentially available but it is a question of politics as to whether it would be provided.  If we reject this treaty, Ireland could well move from being the poster boy for austerity to facing hard default which would be a political disaster for all concerned.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Those are the type of contributions that have been made by very eminent people.  I have quoted directly from what he said in that regard.  Above and beyond the economist&rsquo;s view, we must bear in mind the experience of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party who is a former Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Deputy Martin was involved in Lisbon I and assisted in ensuring that Lisbon II became a success, which it was after further consultation with the Irish people.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader are not trying to guide people into a decision on 31 May that would be detrimental; they are doing it in the best interests of the people.  As a member of the main Opposition party in this House, I am pleased that I can call on Fianna F&aacute;il supporters the length and breadth of Ireland to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 31 May.  They are voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; because Fianna F&aacute;il has always had a proud tradition of supporting all referendums.  Another political party which is opposing this treaty, has never supported any referendum in favour of the EU.  It has always adopted a negative position as far as Europe is concerned.  Therefore, according to the biblical saying, &ldquo;By their works ye shall know them&rdquo;.  We can judge them based on the work of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il who have always supported the European Union, and the Labour Party which is supporting it now.  I hope Labour Party supporters will realise that it is in the best interests of the Irish people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 31 May.  I know the Labour Party has some work to do in that respect.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach said, Europe needs to promote confidence for investors and the euro must be seen as a strong, credible and enduring currency.  He also said that this treaty should be seen as a strong statement of intent.  We are committed to the euro and will do whatever it takes to stabilise and defend it.  Those comments are taken from page 51 of the report of the sub-committee.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leader of the House for giving us this opportunity to debate the matter.  The Taoiseach also said:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is not true to say that Ireland can veto the adoption of the ESM treaty, nor is there any good reason why we should do so.  The ESM is an insurance policy that would help to increase confidence in Ireland when we seek to return to the markets.  Unanimity is required to amend Article 136 of the treaty on the function of the EU, but the ESM can go ahead without that.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a clear statement based on the legal advice of the Attorney General to the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>I urge people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 31 May.  We are canvassing this weekend and will be intensifying our canvass in the coming period.  I will be holding a public meeting in Roscommon town on Friday, 25 May in the Abbey Hotel to try to develop this issue further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the fiscal treaty referendum which will be the most important vote for our country in a generation.  There are two main reasons we should consider voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and be actively canvassing for it.  The first is to demonstrate our commitment to the European project, which promotes certainty and stability across the eurozone.  We will benefit from that.  The second reason for voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is for access to funding.  However, as the date for the referendum draws ever closer, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side is still persisting with an argument that has nothing to do with the substantive contents of the stability treaty.  I was going to ask those proposing a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote where they intend to get the money from.  I would have asked them if they were here.  It is disappointing that the only party opposing the treaty cannot even find time to attend the House for this debate.</P>
        <P>If we cannot return to the financial markets next year and we shut ourselves out of the ESM due to a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, where will we get the money for essential services?  We should be serious about this matter.  The &ldquo;No&rdquo; side says that we will not shut ourselves out of the ESM if we vote against the treaty, or they say that if we shut ourselves out, our European partners will give us the money.  If our European partners do not give us the money, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side says we will get it from the EFSF or the IMF.  If we cannot get it that way, they say we will get it by vetoing the treaty establishing the ESM.  Failing that, they say we can veto the treaty amending Article 136.  If we cannot do that, they say somebody somewhere will give us money.  That seems to be the gist of their argument but it is a recipe for uncertainty.  In recent days, we have seen what uncertainty has done for the good people of Greece.</P>
        <P>I anticipate that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side will claim we are scaremongering by merely drawing attention to these facts.  However, if we take a closer look at what is happening in Greece, our fears may be confirmed.  Greece is following a policy of austerity which is similar to, although stricter than, ours.  The recent elections in Greece saw the hard-left parties emerge to hold the balance of power.  The leader of the Syriza party, Alexis Tsipras, refused to enter government despite the popularity of his party, which is based on an anti-austerity platform.  According to Mr. Tsipras:</P>
        <P LI="1">The EU, led by Berlin, is engaging in a high stakes game of bluff.  The threat to accept more austerity, or exit the eurozone, would never happen because the eurozone itself has too much to lose.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If we think that argument sounds familiar, of course it does because that is what our own anti-treaty people are saying.  However, when Mr. Tsipras had the opportunity to enter government and implement the policies on which he was elected, he failed to do so.  It clearly sounds as if he did not have confidence in his own argument, and the same could be said for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side here.</P>
        <P>This type of talk is good at getting votes, of course, as the hard left has seen in Greece.  It has been calculated by some politicians to be good for increasing party support here as well, as we have seen in recent polls.  Those with a simple, popular argument are gaining party political support and I suspect that this is calculated in the actions of those proposing a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>
        <P>On the night of 28 September 2008, Sinn F&eacute;in backed the bank guarantee.  They did so even though I think they did not understand what they were doing.  It did not have a consequence for them because the other parties also backed it, apart from the Labour Party.  Sinn F&eacute;in was lost in the numbers then and it is the same this time.  The leader of that party appeared before the fiscal compact committee a few weeks ago and demonstrated a clear lack of understanding of the economics involved.  I am sorry to say that because I had several questions to put to him, but he failed on every occasion to give me any sort of credible answer.  When he was pushed on particular points he descended into personal attacks on his questioners.  It was a disappointing performance by him.  It makes me wonder if he was not properly briefed before attending the meeting, or perhaps was not convinced by his own arguments.  Perhaps he did not know enough about the subject.</P>
        <P>On this occasion, there is a real consequence for those who are proposing a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Populist, political posturing in Greece has led to uncertainty which has seen a run on the Greek banks.  Some &euro;3 billion has been withdrawn from Greek banks in the ten days since the elections.  Uncertainty leads to chaos as the Greek people are now experiencing.  We can see how delicately the euro economy is balanced.  Uncertainty in Greece has seen Irish bond spreads widening.  It has seen some private capital being withdrawn from Spain.  In addition there has been speculation about Greece leaving the eurozone and imposing controls on how much can be withdrawn from banks.  This is what uncertainty does and it is not a positive thing.</P>
        <P>If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; would we undermine that fragile certainty that is slowly and painfully returning to our own economy?  It is everyone&rsquo;s right to advocate a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, but in so doing one has a responsibility to spell out the consequences for those being encouraged to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on its own will not lead to a run on the Irish banks and neither would it cause us to leave the eurozone.  However, it will shut us off from the ESM and other funding sources if we cannot return to the markets next year.  It will also demonstrate that Ireland wishes to remain in some sort of semi-detached relationship with Europe where uncertainty is embedded in our economy.</P>
        <P>Looking at it in the wider context, which is affecting Greece, Spain and perhaps Portugal also, it will create conditions that will put our hard-won gains since the last election at risk.  If we are prepared to risk this, then we should vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but if people are not prepared to take the risk, the obvious thing is to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.   If parties wished to increase the share of their vote, they could encourage people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If one thinks one&rsquo;s party is more important than one&rsquo;s country, perhaps one should encourage people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If one does not understand the situation, and I think some commentators do not understand it, one should pause and take time to sit down with one&rsquo;s policy people to familiarise oneself with the facts.  If people refuse to acknowledge the economic and political complexities involved, they are being dishonest.  If one wants to encourage people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, one should not link the treaty with extraneous issues such as water charges, the household charge or bank debt.  It is plain dishonest to do so.  The treaty should be debated on its merits in the context of the consequences of voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>On what Senator Leyden said about the access to IMF funding, when countries join up to the IMF they are allocated a quota relative to the size of their economy.  A country is allowed to borrow against that quota up to 200%, 300% in extreme circumstances and 600% cumulatively over the course of the borrowing.  Having borrowed &euro;16 billion, Ireland&rsquo;s share of the quota stands at 1,300%.  If we are to rely on the IMF for all of our funding, which would be &euro;64 billion, we would be borrowing 5,000% against our IMF quota.  The IMF is funded by countries such as Canada, even ourselves, America and Britain and also by African, South American and some Third World countries.  It is preposterous, dishonest and outlandish for anybody to recommend that countries in the Third World should bail out Ireland.  That is dishonest.  It has nothing to do with left wing or any type of politics and more to do with &ldquo;la la&rdquo; politics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An &euro;11 billion bond is due to paid in February 2014.  If we do not have access to the EU markets and the ESM, where will we find &euro;11 billion on top of the &euro;7 billion or &euro;8 billion that we will have to borrow to run the country at that time?  We will have to close the fiscal debt in public finances in one year.  We know the difficulty that was created when we tried to close the debt by &euro;3.6 billion this year and we can imagine the difficulty it would create if we were try to close a debt by &euro;17 billion next year.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>This is probably one of the most important debates for the country that we will have in this Chamber.  Everything hangs and depends on this treaty and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it in the Chamber.</P>
        <P>Ireland may be an island but our trade, currency, exports and workforce stretch far beyond our geographical boundaries.  This is a small open economy.  This is easily said, but to understand the facts we need to recognise that Ireland exports 80% of everything it produces.  We also depend on the stability of the euro currency, which we share in common with 16 other eurozone countries.  Today, we are dependent on international institutions for funding to pay our everyday costs &mdash;  to pay for pensions and wages and to keep our hospitals, schools and other public services running.  Ireland and the European Union need stability, which is at the core of the new treaty, which strengthens the rules that support the euro and introduces better national budget rules, with improvements in the way euro countries work together and support each other. This is vital for all of the European Union but especially for Ireland.   A stable euro will build confidence and help us to recover and generate jobs.  The Government does not generate jobs but creates the environment for growth and stability, and that is what this treaty will enable us to ensure we have in this country.</P>
        <P>The treaty will give Ireland an insurance policy, ensuring we will have access to money to fund public services, if we have to seek access to funds again.  At present, we have to access money from Europe through the IMF but if we need to access further funds, the treaty ensures that this lifeline will be available to us.  The Government is determined to return to the financial markets next year to raise money on our own again, like we did previously.  We are on target to do this, but we must also recognise that we cannot control world events and the world economy.  The markets need to know that there is a backup in the form of the European Stability Mechanism, which we can only access if we ratify the treaty on 31 May.  We cannot access it otherwise.  There are no two ways about it &mdash; that is written in the treaty.  There are major benefits for Ireland, but it is also of interest that all European countries have access to the ESM, if they need it and manage their budgets in a responsible way.</P>
        <P>A supportive vote for the treaty on 31 May will not change Ireland overnight.  It will not immediately eliminate the array of challenges the Government is working to resolve.  However, support for the treaty will be an important part of a solution to that problem and a step forward for Ireland, the European Union and the eurozone.  I hope reason will prevail, people will see the logic and will not be led astray by false allegations in the debate on the treaty.</P>
        <P>From where will the money come if we do not have access to the ESM?  That question has not been answered, a point to which Senator Leyden and other speakers referred.  It has been ignored by those on the other side.  They have said we will have access to the IMF.  We can ask the IMF for funds but if we refuse access to the ESM at a lower interest rate, do Senators think it will give us access, of course it will not.  Why would it if other European countries have agreed to sign up to the treaty and we have decided to ride our own horse into the unknown abyss.  A previous senator quoted Brian Lucey.  People who throw out facts off the top of their head without any figures to back them up are irresponsible to say the least.</P>
        <P>Insisting that future governments, both here and in the rest of the eurozone, implement a balanced budget as a norm is a major part of the treaty.  If we had followed that rule, while it would not have solved all our ills, it would have helped.  In terms of the plan to reduce the deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015, we are already doing that and that will not be affected by the treaty.  The Government has already announced its &euro;17 billion infrastructure and capital investment programme and that will not be affected by the treaty. The maximum structural deficit a country could plan to have would be 0.5% of GDP.  Each country would have to have a specific target for this agreed with the EU.  A question that has been asked is what will happen if we fall on hard times again.  It is written into the treaty that a country may deviate from this in &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; &mdash; this is known as the country-specific medium-term objective.  There are those who say we will lose out and will hand over all our decision making to Europe, but we will not lose out.  It is built into the treaty that there is a country specific medium-term objective.  The objective can be changed from time to time to take account of economic circumstances in any country.</P>
        <P>Under the current rules all countries must keep their general Government deficit below 60% of GDP.  This was brought in under the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 but as we know everybody broke the rules.  Under the existing EU rules, excess debt must be reduced by one twentieth per year.  That was not done and that had led us to where we are now.  A correction mechanism is built into the stability treaty.  If countries do not move towards their target to correct the deficit, that may be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the court may impose a fine of 0.1% on those countries.</P>
        <P>On the general government deficit, the treaty requires that countries which ratify it support the European Commission when it makes recommendation on how countries should reduce their deficits.  However, they do not have to support these proposals if a qualified majority of the euro area countries opposes the Commission&rsquo;s recommendation.  Each country has a responsibility to ensure that they do what is in the treaty and if they do not there will be a call-back option.</P>
        <P>The real austerity would occur if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, cut ourselves off from the ESM and then if we were to require funding, we would have to close our deficit by speeding up the progress of adjustment.  This is where austerity would hit the Irish people, if we had to speed up our adjustment at a faster pace that we are doing at present.</P>
        <P>We often hear it argued that we would not be in this situation if it were not for the banks and that we bailed them out.  Much of that is true but such provision is not in the treaty, it is not a part of it and has nothing to do with it.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Government are currently renegotiating the burden on the Irish taxpayers and we want that to continue.  We want to ensure a growth package is built into the treaty, and we agree with new French President that there should an addendum to the treaty.  The treaty will not be changed because every country has to come back again on it.  We agree there must be growth, and the French President was not the first to state this as the Taoiseach has been stating it in Europe for the past two years.</P>
        <P>Some people do not recognise that even without bank debts there is still a &euro;13 billion gap between the Government&rsquo;s spending and revenue.  Where will we get the money to bridge this gap?  Even if we never had a bank that went bust we would still have a gap of &euro;13 billion.  This is a serious issue and those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side must answer these questions.  They speak about extraneous issues such as water and household charges.  One would be led to believe they were mentioned in the treaty.  They have absolutely nothing to do with the treaty.  Domestic Governments in power make these decisions and will continue to do so.  It is irresponsible of people to put up posters with false information leading astray people who will not read the full treaty as they try to make a very serious decision.  Everybody&rsquo;s vote will count.  The vote of the person on the street is as important as that of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s, the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  Everybody should ensure they do the right thing for the country.</P>
        <P>We must all ensure that we play our part for the country.  Rather than calling for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote because it is politically opportunist to raise issues such as water rates and household charges I ask people to please consider their future, consider from where the money will come and consider that Ireland must sign up to the treaty to access the ESM rescue fund.  It will enhance confidence in the business community if Ireland is a stable place in which to do business.  This is the message we want to send to Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not need reminding that Ireland is a small open economy with a population of just over 4.4 million people on the periphery of Europe.  Our future lies at the heart of Europe.  In 1973 when we joined the European Economic Community we leapfrogged mentally, and in business and trade, over the UK.  We became Europeans instead of being dependent on the UK for many aspects of the economy and law, which we copied so much.</P>
        <P>At present 450,000 people are unemployed and it has been stated this is not about jobs but I do not agree.  The first issue in Ireland is the economy and creating employment for our people.  The only way to create employment is to bring in foreign money through making products we can sell abroad or through tourism.  Ireland is an exporting country and this is the only way it will survive and keep its economy and public services going.  We depend on producing goods and services that other countries will buy.  I am sorry to state many Irish people do not realise this.  Unless people want to buy our goods at a competitive price existing businesses will not grow and we will not have the money to loan to businesses.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about foreign direct investment.  When we joined the EEC in 1973 we had an accelerated influx of US multinationals.  The reasons for this were our access to the European market and our English-speaking highly-educated workforce.  This continues to be true but business needs certainty and confidence that no seismic shift in taxation will occur.  The Sinn F&eacute;in policy of taxing people earning more than &euro;100,000 is frightening to people in business and to those who want to start businesses.  We need to create an environment in which people can grow businesses because this is the only way to create employment.  At present 250,000 people in the country are directly or indirectly employed in US multinationals.  As the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation stated in the House this morning, foreign direct investment is involved in employing one in every seven people in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am a passionate supporter of being a European.  I remember when we were dependent on Britain and how our social legislation, mentality and everything about us opened up with dramatic social change when we joined the then EEC.  A key change was that married women could go to work.  I do not know whether everyone else who remembers when married women&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do, but it had nothing to do with the British.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I was speaking about the EU.  When we became members of the EEC we had to transpose a directive whereby married women could no longer be prevented from taking up employment.</P>
        <P>I do not have a problem with people having a different opinion or view to me because this is a democracy.  We have had a very stimulating debate and I believe the Irish people have become invigorated by it.  I am positive the treaty will be passed.  A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is an important step on the road to economic recovery.  It will provide stability in our nation&rsquo;s finances.  It is mercurial to state we will get the money anyway if we are not at the heart of the action to negotiate.  I would prefer for us to be there and that our colleagues are part of the European team.  We would have supporters in Europe who would help us if we need more money in the future.  The strategy of stating we will get the money some other way is very high risk and nonsense.</P>
        <P>We should have stability as a committed member of the eurozone and through our commitment to follow a defined path of recovery.  This stability is a prerequisite for global corporations making strategic investment decisions and will help protect Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as the preferred gateway to the European market for overseas investors.  Ireland is the gateway to Europe for more than 600 US businesses.  These companies have invested &euro;150 billion here to date and employ one in seven of the population.  As I stated to the Minister this morning, one of Ireland&rsquo;s successes has been successive Governments consistently supporting foreign direct investment.  A change of Government did not mean a swing to the extreme left or extreme right and this stable political Government, no matter what political party was in office, has been a major part of our success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator White on one thing: it is important that we have this debate because it shows we have democracy in the country.  However, we appear to be the only country in Europe that has it.  We, as a very small nation, are voting on behalf of the entire people of Europe.  Our trade union movement appears to be somewhat divided because it is terrified.  However, throughout Europe the trade union movement is recommending against doing this because it is a fraud from top to bottom.  There is not a reputable economist who has done the figures and is able to say that Ireland can meet the targets to which we are committing ourselves.  The same is true in Spain.  The Spanish signed it in the morning and said in the afternoon they knew they could not meet them.  Germany postponed its ratification.  In France the newly elected President Hollande has said he will try to renegotiate some aspects of it.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, this is not something that is fixed.  It is unstable and amorphous &mdash; we do not yet know its shape.  Yet the Government adamantly sets its face against what I asked &mdash; I believe I was the first politician in either House to do so &mdash; which is to postpone the referendum.  Who is telling us it is not possible to do so?  It is the Referendum Commission.  Since when was it the Supreme Court of this country or the European Court of Justice?  It has exceeded its brief in this in my opinion and the documentation that has emerged from it is not unbiased, as an analysis of the language will show.  Just yesterday I had to point out that the Government, in my opinion, illegally used money to fill every box in this House with 60 pieces of deliberately pro-austerity treaty material.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no balance in this debate at all, but there is plenty of money to be made.  People talked about Greece.  An Irish citizen &mdash; an American who bought his passport &mdash; made &euro;411 million during the week out of the Greek bond system.  That is a great advertisement for the kind of capitalism the Government is walking us into.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I said this years ago and I have repeated it.  What is happening in Europe is a phenomenon with historical parallel if we consider how Prussia was formed into Germany, first with a customs union followed by tighter fiscal control and so on, and eventually the German Reich.  At that stage I said it would go in one of two ways.  A centrifugal force has been inevitably set in motion which would inexorably lead to either a strong fiscal union or an explosion of the entire system.  While I do not gloat in it, I believe we are seeing an explosion of the system.  I believe the whole system in Europe is unravelling, which presents us with an opportunity.  Throughout this crisis both domestically and internationally there has been a complete lack of any kind of prophetic vision and it has been replaced by tinkering around at the edges so that the system could be preserved.  The welfare of the people must be put first.  We need to measure what impact that has on the system and then adjust the system accordingly.  Communism collapsed because it was too doctrinaire.  We have a very doctrinaire form of capitalism and I believe it is also going to collapse.</P>
        <P>One of the things we were not told is that the importation by stealth of the blackmail clause in this treaty could be defeated by the Government.  We have the capacity to hold a gun to the head of the bullies in Europe and particularly in Berlin and Frankfurt.  We could refuse to ratify the ESM.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us put it to the test.  We are quite capable of doing this and we should use that to get relief from the bank debt.  We are told that those of us on this side of the House do not do the sums.  I do not believe those on the Government side do either.  If we sign up to this and it is implemented strictly, the debt-reduction rules should ensure a further &euro;5 billion will be paid to the bankers and bondholders each year.  The bankers and bondholders are not an irrelevancy, they are central.</P>
        <P>There was a quiet change in February with the importation of this blackmail clause which threatened that any member state that did not sign up to the austerity treaty would be shut out from participation in the bailout fund.  How is that for European solidarity?  We have been part of Europe ever since the continent of Europe was geologically formed.</P>

	<P>I got involved in a European organisation in 2006.  When I went to Brussels, Paris and other cities, I found that we were regarded very highly.  We had been at the bottom of the pile and had come up to have the highest GDP per capita along with Luxembourg.  We had more people employed &mdash; with 2 million employed compared with 1 million 15 years earlier.  Everybody asked how we did it.  We did it by availing of all the facilities given to us.  Three years ago, however, we were suddenly disgraced and at the bottom of the pile.  People who had previously commented on how wonderful the Irish people were now asked how we had got it so wrong.  We did get it wrong.  We sought a bailout, received it and we were at the bottom of the pile for the past couple of years.  In the past six months, however, when I travel to Europe, and I was in Paris last week, it has been interesting to hear people say: &ldquo;What good boys you are and how well you are managing to get on top of this again.&rdquo;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;one must get one&rsquo;s figures right.  One cannot spend more than one takes in.  One can for a short period.  During a tough time one can borrow, but during the good times one puts one&rsquo;s money aside.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is happening.  This stability treaty tells us that during the good times the EU wants us to allocate some money for the rainy day, but during the tough times it will allow us to borrow.  What it and we do not want to do is to find ourselves in a situation where we have no banker, have thrown the key of the bank away and have no chance to go back.  It is essential that during the tough times, and we will have tough times for another couple of years, we can borrow again.</P>
        <P>This is an extremely important time, and I am referring to today, given the renewed crisis in Greece.  I have been watching what is happening there.  It would be a mistake to go backwards by postponing or rejecting the treaty.  It is not the time for procrastination.  It is time for action.  We must do something and the one thing we must not do is throw away that bank key.  Passing the treaty will be another step for Ireland to demonstrate clearly that it is a country of action and not just of words.  Two years ago not many would have predicted that we could have a stable economy and return to significant export growth in such a short period.  It has been so interesting in recent times to hear what others in Europe are saying about Ireland.  Now they are asking how we got it so right again so quickly when others are not doing it.</P>
        <P>We have been distanced from Greece and even Portugal because of the steps we have taken.  Spain is now experiencing major difficulties.  The heat is on.  One of Spain&rsquo;s bigger banks is seeking to be bailed out.  It could be argued that the worst of our banking crisis is over.  I am not sure if that is the case but it is not over in Spain and that country appears to be too big to bail out.  The Nobel Prize winner, Paul Krugman, who writes for <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The New York Times</i>, has said that a Greek exit from the euro is &ldquo;very possible next month&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>He is also opposed to the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, he certainly has views about it.  He predicted that Spanish and Italian depositors will try to move money to Germany, forcing the ECB to intervene or accept the end of the euro.  There is a danger that we could see the end of the euro, and I accept that.  However, I believe the eurozone, and Ireland being part of it, is of huge benefit to Europe and us.  I have no wish to throw that away.  If Greece leaves the euro, that is tough on the Greeks but it is certainly not something we wish to do.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a stable country taking the tough medicine.  It is seen as the most successful of the three countries to be bailed out.  We are making progress to recovery and we are getting confidence back.  Irish businesses have taken the tough steps to recovery and to becoming much more competitive.  New research from EUROSTAT, for example, shows that Ireland is the only country in the eurozone where the cost of hiring workers has fallen since the start of the crash.  As <i>The Economist</i> says: &ldquo; . . . the Irish . . . can draw consolation from a brighter outlook for recovery.  After a grim slide between 2007 and 2010, the economy picked up modestly last year, buoyed by exports, and is expected to grow this year . . . Ireland has some trump cards which the other two economies lack.  In particular it remains an attractive production base for high-tech international firms, especially in information-technology and pharmaceutical companies, lured by a skilled workforce and a low corporate tax rate . . . and thanks to a flexible labour market and an open economy it has already clawed back a good deal of the cost competitiveness it lost during the boom years.&rdquo;</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I believe this treaty is balanced on our ability to get loans if we need them.  That is the important element.  Urging people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; means we will not have somewhere to go if we need loans, and there is a possibility that we will.  Whether someone is running a family home, a business or a government, the books must be balanced.  They must be balanced in the long term.  We can borrow in the short term but in the good times we must cover that.  We all know this.  We also know that if we do not balance the books, we will have to go back to the banker to ask for help to get through the difficult period.  We must not throw away the keys to the bank door and say we will never need them again.  That is what the &ldquo;No&rdquo; voters are suggesting.  They are telling us to throw the keys away as we will never need them again.  I hope we will not but we might and we must have the ability to access cash quickly if we need it.  We should not close down that facility.</P>
        <P>We have made great progress in rebuilding our international reputation.  This is crucial if we are to attract inward investment.  A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would be a major setback and undermine the significant efforts that have already been made.  Earlier today Members debated changing some of the rules we have for inviting foreign direct investment into Ireland.  Foreign direct investment has played a major role in Ireland.  The Minister said one in seven jobs comes from foreign direct investment.  The figures he produced from the different investment measurements for Ireland put us among the top three places in the world for investment.  It is one of the best countries in which to do business.  I believe we are in danger of losing that if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We do not have a choice in this.  It is easy to say that we must vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  If we vote for the treaty, we will still have a banker on whose door we can knock.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that door will be closed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a business viewpoint on this.  I have run my own business, a small catering business, for 30 years.  The simple rule of business is that one cannot spend more than one earns.  It is that simple.  It does not matter whether it is &pound;100, &euro;100 or &euro;50 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>Our difficulty is that we spend &euro;50 billion, but we raise &euro;36 billion in tax.  We must borrow money.  Let us deal with the island of Ireland and its budget.  This is what is involved.  We must borrow that amount this year, next year and the following year within an agreed programme.  To be honest, anybody who advocates a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, even though I have the greatest respect for my colleagues, is grossly irresponsible.  I will never play Russian roulette with the economy and its people.  However, that is what we chancing.  It is too much of a risk to take in any shape or form.</P>
        <P>The cost of Irish bonds on the bond market this morning is 7.5%.  Even if we wanted to go back into the bond market, we would be raving lunatics to do so when we can access the funds at 3.2%.  It is a very simple decision, and I hope the people of Ireland see it that way.  However, I am deeply concerned.  I do not think people understand that simple message, because they have been given the convoluted message that if they vote against austerity they will vote away the household and other charges.  In fact, they will not.  If the &euro;50 billion has to be collected on the island of Ireland in five years&rsquo; time, those charges will probably have to be multiplied by ten.  Ireland would become Greece overnight if it cannot borrow that money.  Let there be no mistake about that.  We are accused that we are trying to scare people.  I am not trying to scare anybody.  I am trying to tell the truth, and that is the truth.</P>
        <P>We are given the option of going down one of two roads.  If we go down one road, it will be a mystery tour where one jumps into the black hole and hopes it will work out.  One hopes that somebody might deal with one, but at a price.  If we go down the other road, we will have a guaranteed line of income and stream of funding.  I do not see that there is any choice.  I seek one answer from the naysayers to the following question: where will we get the money and at what rate will we get it when we need it in three years?  That is the only question I want those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side to answer.  If they can tell me that and if there is a better deal available, I might reconsider my position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>We would all vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we would all vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  At present, however, the only deal in town to manage our household budget, and it is a household and business budget in Ireland, is a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to secure a guaranteed stream of funding so we can maintain our services.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Our services do not merely include ourselves, the politicians.  They include the doctors, the nurses and the teachers.  They also include those who are on welfare.  Those who receive wealth from the State are also part of that &euro;50 billion in service provision.  When we make this decision, and if we do vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, we should think of the impact, damage and harm we could do to every man, woman and child in this country if we do not have access to those loans to maintain our economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Often where there are debates in this House I am reminded of how much the Houses of the Oireachtas can be a bubble far removed from reality and where people are at, and this debate is a good example of that.  A number of Senators, one of whom was Senator Feargal Quinn, made the point that we have no choice and must vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The previous speaker talked about naysayers, irresponsibility and damage, and also that we have no choice and must vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The reality is that the people of this country have a choice.  That is what referendums are about.  That is what democracy is about.  The people can say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or they can say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The simple reality is that if the people reject this treaty, they say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the strict fiscal discipline rules which are in the treaty.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn also made the point that this is about balancing budgets, and to an extent he is correct.  It does force countries to balance books, but it also prevents countries from borrowing to invest.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It puts in a new rule, a structural deficit target of 0.5%.  Of course, it also puts in place a debt-brake rule, where it sets a percentage for a country&rsquo;s debt-to-GDP ratio of 60%.  Currently, ours is approximately 105%.  It will be 120% in 2015 and must be reduced by 5% every year until we get down to 60%.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn made the point that this merely forces us to put money away for a rainy day.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many who will not be listening to this debate but who, if they were, would understand that we did put money away for a rainy day in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and that fund was emptied.  It was emptied, not to invest in people or to invest in jobs, but to give to the banks to recapitalise them and pay back the bond holders.  That is the reality that is facing the working people of this country.</P>
        <P>We hear a great deal of nonsense and scare-mongering from those on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side about the positions which are being adopted by those of us who are campaigning for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  I would remind those same persons that they used exactly the same arguments during the Lisbon treaty campaign, that if this treaty is not passed, the sky will fall in, our economy will collapse and all that they said would happen.  The people voted for the Lisbon treaty and what happened is that three times as many are out of work.  Far from stability, recovery, investment and all that of the benefits they promised, our economy completely collapsed and those picking up the tab and paying the price are ordinary working people.</P>
        <P>I have just come from a good debate hosted by the Digital Hub agency.  I commend the agency because it was a worthwhile exercise.  It organised a debate between a number of politicians &mdash; a member from each of Fine Gael, Labour, Sinn F&eacute;in and People Before Profit.  It was organised by the management and the staff.  It was a worthwhile exercise and other companies should do likewise.  The people at the agency are clear that it does not matter what way we vote on this; we still have the same problems in Ireland which need to be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The two problems we have in Ireland, which I would hope we all would accept, are the lack of growth and investment and the need for jobs.  This treaty does not do anything to bring about any of that.  What it does is force countries to reduce their deficit far too quickly and in a way that will hamper their domestic economy.  We had that in this country.  The Exchequer deficit in 2008 was &euro;12.7 billion.  Four years and five budgets later some &euro;24.6 billion has been taken out of the economy as part of all of those adjustments.  Despite all the pain that went with that, such as the universal social charge, cuts in hospitals, cuts in schools &mdash; we saw the Tallaght report by HIQA today &mdash; and what all of that means for working people, the Exchequer deficit has increased.  It is now over &euro;13 billion.  This approach has not worked and it will not work.</P>
        <P>What we need is a strategy to get people back to work.  We need growth and investment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The first is what caused the crash in Ireland and what caused the problem in the first place.  Our public finances collapsed in 2008 because the property and consumption bubble burst.  That is what caused the crash.  We built our public finances on sand, an unsustainable foundation, and it all collapsed.</P>
        <P>Let us remind ourselves why it collapsed.  It was because banks, primarily the former Anglo Irish Bank, not a high street bank but a property and developers&rsquo; bank, borrowed cheap money from French, German, Dutch and British banks and from the bond markets and gave it to a small group of developers and speculators who speculated on the price of land.  What happened is they ended up with huge loans that they could not pay back, massive debts and, of course, the taxpayer had to come in to bail them out.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There is nothing about any debt write down.  The treaty, if it was in place in 2008, would not have solved any of our problems because we ended up with a big gaping hole in our public finances following the collapse of our property bubble, driven primarily by the banks and by their recklessness.

	<P>On &ldquo;show me the money&rdquo;, the only reason the Government, in a shameful and contrived way, with its European partners put a formula of words into the austerity treaty to try to link it to the ESM treaty is because they were unable to sell a bad, flawed treaty to the people of this country.  They knew the people would not wear it.  They had to have some stick to hang over the heads of the people, which is that if one does not vote for this, one will not get the money.</P>

        <P>I respect the views and opinions of all Members in this House, but what I would say about this referendum &mdash; I made this point about what is happening in Greece, and I mean it genuinely and sincerely &mdash; is that there is a real danger we are lecturing people about what they can and cannot do, pointing to the people of Greece because of the way they voted as causing instability and pointing to the people of this country about what way they will vote on the austerity treaty.  The people have a choice.  The people can make up their own minds and democracy should prevail.  People should be allowed to vote without fear and make up their own minds about what is in the treaty and whether they believe the treaty is good or bad for this country.</P>
        <P>We have a choice.  We always have a choice.  Democracy is about choice.  Once we go down that slippery road of saying to people that they do not have any choice, that will be a retrograde step for the future of Europe.  We should respect people&rsquo;s point of view and respect their right to do whatever they wish in a referendum.</P>

	<P>The Irish people realise that.  I wished to put that on record.</P>
        <P>This is an extremely important treaty from an Irish perspective.  Senator Mulcahy and others have dealt with the fact that we are spending &euro;50 billion while taking in &euro;36 billion.  I wish to talk about confidence and our reputation abroad.  Work has been done, in particular in the past 12 months by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and other Ministers to restore the reputation of this country abroad.  Our reputation was in tatters.  When people spoke about Greece they referred almost instantaneously to Ireland after that.  If one googled newspaper articles 18 months ago such as<i> The New York Times</i> or newspapers in Germany and as far away as Australia, Greece was the first word and Ireland was next.  A difficult sales job was required to be done internationally to at least steady the Irish ship and the Irish reputation.  Thankfully, that has been achieved.  Now, this country is regarded as one that continues to take its responsibilities seriously.  We are endeavouring to rectify the situation to correct the overspending that has taken place.  We have cut away a lot of the fat.  We have reduced numbers in the public service, turned things around and tried our level best to comply with all elements of the troika deal.  We have succeeded in that regard.  Every time the troika has done a review on our performance for the previous three months we have met the criteria.  That has given us flexibility to negotiate a stimulus package, which is what we want.</P>
        <P>I heard an extremely good interview this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  It was one of the best interviews I have heard in a long time in terms of the confidence he has and how he proposes to deal with the State assets to leverage money and be in a position to build the primary health care units and schools we need and to invest in vital elements of infrastructure in this country which will ensure that the construction sector can get a kick start.  A vibrant construction industry is as vital to this country as any other industry.</P>
        <P>In terms of the work that has been done in the past 18 months to restore our international reputation, if we turn around and reject the treaty we will be seen internationally as having chosen to kick Europe which has been so good to us.  We will be seen as a country that is on the outside tier &mdash; that is allowed into the bar and the restaurant but cannot play the course.  We do not need that.  Just when the work has been done to improve our reputation and ensure there is respect for us internationally again the last thing we as a nation need to do is turn around and dismantle it because if we do it will be at our peril.  A resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will ensure that we will benefit from the work that has been done internationally.  In effect, the cream will come to the top.  On 1 June we will be able to look all of our European colleagues in the eye and say that we are a central part of the European project.  Our voice will be heard and respected.  We can ensure that as a country we will play a pivotal, strong and influential role within the European project.  We have always punched above our weight in the past and we can ensure that is the case by endorsing the treaty resoundingly.</P>
        <P>I do not know what plan B is if the approach we are taking does not work.  I have listened to the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side and I note that Deputy Wallace in the other House acknowledged the fact that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote is divided all over the place; that there is no coherence to its argument and no effective campaign.  The reason for that is that there is no other option.  We created the mess we are in over the past decade.  We are lucky that we have friends who are prepared to help us out.  The last thing we need to do is eliminate any source of funding.  We must have access to every possible source of funding available.  The ESM model is a good one.  It is an insurance policy.  I accept the description has been used previously but to bring it down to a common sense level; one insures a house.  If one does not insure the house, one is being reckless.  One pays a small amount of insurance to ensure that when something does go wrong with the house that one can make a claim.  The ESM is precisely the same.  I accept we will contribute to the ESM but if and when we get into trouble again &mdash; let us hope we do not &mdash; at least we will be in a position to draw from that source of funding.  If we are limited to one source of funding &mdash; there are no guarantees that the IMF will lend to us, but if it does, it will dictate the terms.  It would be preferable to have a choice.  If we have played our part and bought into the stability mechanism then we will have a choice.</P>
        <P>In terms of job creation it is worth noting that ten years ago there were 1.5 million people working in this country.  In the height of the boom the number increased to 2.2 million.  However, there are still 1.8 million people working in this country.  That is 300,000 people more than were working in the late 1990s.  That is a point to consider.  It is not all doom and gloom and we must recognise that.  The Government&rsquo;s target of creating in excess of 100,000 jobs is doable.  Confidence is returning.  If we endorse the treaty, confidence and belief in this country will continue to flow back.  We will see foreign direct investment.  If one had &euro;100 million and one was looking to create a European headquarters one would wait to see the outcome of the treaty before investing in this country.  The last thing one would do is invest money in a country that has opted to be on the outside track.  Anyone with such an amount of money to invest from the United States or China, among other countries, would decide to wait and see.  They want to do business with a country that is at the centre and the core of the European project.</P>
        <P>I will campaign between now and 31 May for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  Whatever side of the argument we are on, as parliamentarians we have a responsibility to explain to as many people as possible why we want them to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I commend the treaty.  I sincerely hope the Irish people do the right thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity for a renewed debate on the stability treaty.  This is the third time we have debated this issue in the Seanad.  We debated the treaty itself in the first place and then we debated the Bill and we are now debating the matter again.  I am delighted we were able to facilitate this debate because it is so important given how close we are to the date of the referendum on 31 May.</P>
        <P>Like the majority of speakers who have spoken before me I too am calling for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  I am out campaigning actively for one.  I have debated publicly against those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side and I am happy to debate with them again in this Chamber.  I am happy to debate the issue on the doorsteps and out and about also.  It is always important on both the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side and the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side that we seek to conduct the debate in a respectful and dignified fashion and that we do not resort to scaremongering, misleading, overstating or making false claims.  All of us would agree with that in principle but it is unfortunate therefore that there are some on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side &mdash; I emphasise that it is only some &mdash; who have made outrageously misleading claims in the course of the debate.  I do not refer to the debate in the Seanad Chamber today but to the debate more generally.  In particular we have seen in the past 24 hours an extraordinary link being made between the stability treaty and our rate of corporation tax.  There is absolutely no link between the stability treaty and the issue of corporation tax.  The Government has made very clear its commitment to retaining Ireland&rsquo;s 12.5% corporation tax rate.  That will remain clear when the treaty is ratified, assuming it is ratified.  It would be extraordinary for the vast majority of businesses and employers in the country who support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to do so if there was some sort of link between the treaty and an undermining of Ireland&rsquo;s tax rate.  That is one claim that has to be firmly nailed.</P>
        <P>The other glaring issue that has dominated the debate is the use of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; word by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  I refer to the issue of austerity.  There is an insistence on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side to call this the austerity treaty, despite the fact that the full title is the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.  Stability treaty is the most accurate shortened version.  I take issue with RTE which insists on calling it the fiscal treaty.  That is not the correct shortened version.  An editorial in, I think, <i>The Irish Times</i> today, very usefully, deals with this issue of austerity and criticises what the writer calls the simplistic refusal of some &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners to acknowledge that the alternative to what those campaigners call the austerity treaty is, in fact, austerity in spades.  <i>The Irish Times</i>  goes on to refer to the naive and wishful thinking on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side and the irresponsible feeding of a fanciful narrative to a people who are anxious for some sort of reassurance.   Nowhere is this more evident than in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side&rsquo;s refusal to accept that access to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, would be a good idea for Ireland.  It is utterly irrational to rule out access to the ESM.  As my colleague, Senator Gilroy, pointed out, the question is where else will we get the money.  If we cannot access the ESM, and if we have ruled ourselves out of access to it, we are not guaranteed or assured of access to any other fund.  Those who argue that we could seek to access IMF funding or that our European partners will not let us down are engaged in the sort of fanciful narrative  <i>The Irish Times</i> has, rightly, criticised.</P>
        <P>There is no issue of blackmail.  We are not being asked to sign up to a treaty under threat of losing access to the ESM.  The issue is one of reassurance for the states that are funding the ESM that the states that are accessing the ESM will have signed up to certain targets.  The majority of those targets have already been agreed at EU level as part of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Access to the ESM has come to be a dominant issue in the debate.</P>
        <P>The other issue is the ESM itself and what it entails.  This week, the Government published the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 in order to ensure that people are fully informed when casting their votes on the stability treaty.  The Bill, and the terms of agreement that led to it, make clear that Ireland&rsquo;s capital contribution is capped at 1.59% of the total &euro;80 billion, amounting to a total of &euro;1.27 billion over three years.  This is a small price to pay for the security and certainty that will come with access to the ESM, especially in the context of the &euro;36 billion of funding we will require to run the State in 2014 and 2015.  Those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side are fully aware of the level of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution.  They are also fully aware, because it is on the public record, that the capital contribution to the fund is fully factored into our latest budgetary forecasts and will not impact on our general deficit target of 8.6% in 2012, which we are well on the way to reaching.</P>
        <P>There has been some talk about callable capital in the ESM.  It is important to note that the callable capital is not expected to be called upon and has no impact on our measured debt levels or our deficit, so it does not affect our deficit reduction plans.  There has been a good deal of scaremongering about what the ESM entails.  The Bill is on the website of the Department of Finance and is clear for all to see.  The commitments under the ESM are clearly set out and separate from the commitments under the stability treaty, albeit that to access the ESM after 1 March 2013 we need to have ratified the treaty.  That is a key issue for many people in debating the pros and cons of the treaty.</P>
        <P>Finally, we must deal with the consequences of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Growing instability and chaos in Greece is bringing home to people the need to ensure maintenance of our steady path to recovery and stability in our own finances.  Senator Gilroy has pointed out to me a comment made some time ago by Alexis Tsipras of the ultra-left Greek party, who did not engage in the recent attempts to form a Government.  He said some time ago that the EU, led by Berlin, is engaged in a high stakes game of bluff and that the threat to accept more austerity or exit the eurozone would never happen because the eurozone itself had too much to lose.  That is wishful thinking.  It brings home to us in Ireland the vital importance of maintaining stability in public finances when we see what can happen in other countries and the political, as well as the economic, fallout in Greece.</P>
        <P>Other colleagues, most recently Senator Conway, referred to the great benefit we have derived from foreign direct investment.  The job creation figures in recent months alone are considerable.  Thousands of jobs are coming in because companies from abroad feel confident in investing in Ireland because we are a stable economy on a steady path out of our current programme.  We need to ensure the maintenance of that stability.  We need to ensure growth but we cannot have growth without stability.  All of us, particularly those of us in the Labour Party, are very supportive of Francois Hollande&rsquo;s efforts to ensure that there will be a growth package alongside the fiscal restraints contained in the stability treaty.  That is very important.  The fact that we will see a growth package developed alongside the treaty and in parallel with it will be a positive factor in speaking in favour of the treaty.</P>
        <P>The treaty aims to maintain the stability of the eurozone.  It aims to maintain security of confidence in the eurozone countries.  It is about much more than Ireland.  As everyone is now aware, Ireland has no veto on the treaty.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, ratification of the treaty will go ahead and we will be left behind, with all the ensuing instability and potential political fallout that will involve.</P>
        <P>For all of those reasons, and many more, I will be urging everyone I meet between now and 31 May to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the treaty in the referendum on that date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with the previous and other speakers in suggesting that Ireland&rsquo;s best interest will be served by a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on referendum day.</P>
        <P>We have discussed many of the issues pertinent to the debate during our discussion of the Referendum on the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  On that occasion, we expressed the hope that sufficient information would be made available to every citizen, that there would be a reasoned and calm debate and that there would be strong encouragement to access information about the treaty itself in order fully to understand its content.  In the main, that has happened.  The Referendum Commission has done its work effectively and in good time.  Information of an independent nature has gone to every household in the country and, side by side, the Government has made information available.</P>
        <P>At previous referendums, members of the public claimed they did not understand what the referendum was about.  There will always be a number of people who claim they do not understand something, but on this occasion, as a result of debates on TV, radio and other media and the information posted to each house, there is a much clearer understanding of the referendum and its consequence.  The consequence of the treaty for the country is significant.  Do we continue on a road of stability and certainty or do we take a wild guess and a tour down a road that could turn out to be a cul-de-sac?  Ireland&rsquo;s best interests are served by a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
        <P>A referendum, in which every citizen is asked to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, can give rise to the belief that the question must be huge and complex.  As the Government is making it clear that the stakes are high in this case, people believe the question must be substantial.  The issue is, in fact, precise and clear-cut.  Of all the referendums on European matters since our accession to the European Union in 1973, this is the most black and white.  It is not complex.  As we are having a referendum, some people believe the question must be complex.  The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side must, perhaps, exaggerate its argument and the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side must do likewise.  This can sometimes be unhelpful.</P>
        <P>The referendum is about stability and not about austerity.  The treaty is not called the austerity treaty but the stability treaty.  It is about ensuring future investment and sustaining an environment where job creation will be strong.</P>
        <P>We have discussed many of the issues pertinent to the debate during our discussion of the Referendum Bill.</P>
        <P>We    Today in Galway the Taoiseach made a significant announcement about investment, and on an almost weekly basis over the past number of months there have been announcements of job creation.  We have had successful visits to and from China, we still have significant interest from the United States, and of course we have significant interest from investors here at home in future projects.  All of these people, who have a stake not only in their own industries but in the future of this country, are telling us a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is necessary.  The representatives of business, big and small, are saying a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is necessary for investment and job creation, the representatives of Irish farming, in the main, are recommending a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, and a significant number of trade unions are recommending a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  They cannot all be wrong.</P>
        <P>Those who are advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote are, in general, those who have advocated a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on every occasion since 1973.  The people saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; are those who told us that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for the Lisbon treaty and a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for the Nice treaty would result in the introduction of conscription to a European army, with children being kidnapped from their parents.  They were as wrong then as they are now.  We are having, and must continue to have, a calm debate about the facts.  A country, just like a household, must live within certain financial parameters.  There is a growing acceptance that if this treaty and its provisions had been in place five, ten or 15 years ago, our country would not be in its current economic difficulties, because different political and economic choices would have had to be made.  The additional responsibility that will now be forced not just on our Government but on the Government of every country signing up to the treaty is good for all of us.  It will result in better management and better economic conditions, and it will result in stability and investment.  That is what the debate is all about.</P>
        <P>The polls appear to indicate that a significant number of people have yet to make up their minds, and the job of all politicians, no matter what side of the argument they are on, is to encourage people to read about the treaty, listen to the debates, and vote.  My desire is that there will be a strong &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, but also that there will be a significant turnout, and that it will not just be a majority of a minority saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but a majority of a majority.  There is a substantial amount of time to go.  If it was a general election that was being held on 31 May, it would have been called only last week.  Much canvassing must be done and much convincing must be done.  That is what a referendum is about.</P>
        <P>Ireland is the only country in the EU that is offering its citizens the chance to make this decision, which is of significant political importance.  There was a school of thought that suggested that the Government could proceed to have the treaty ratified by a vote of the Oireachtas, but the Government took the more difficult but better route of consulting with the people and asking them in a calm and mature fashion to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I join with my colleagues in recommending a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  I firmly believe, from the point of view of future development and future investment in this country and in order to put our people back to work, that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is by far the wiser and more sensible choice.  It will not change things overnight or fix all of our problems but to leap into the dark with a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would be much too dangerous for Ireland and its people.  Therefore, I sincerely hope Ireland will say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on referendum day.</P>
