	<P>I have received notice from Senator C&aacute;it Keane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to discuss and re-evaluate the plastic bag levy applicable to biodegradable bags in the light of the fact that laminated or waxed carrier bags used in retail clothes stores are not subject to the levy, even though they are less environmentally friendly.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mark Daly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to outline the amount spent on wastewater treatment plants in the past 15 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to discuss the impact of the &euro;900,000 cutback in the 2012 budget for Bantry General Hospital, indicate if there will be bed closures, staff reductions and the loss of any other post that may adversely affect the staff of the hospital and confirm that the proposed reconfiguration will be advanced as committed to by the last Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Michael Mullins of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to explain the reason funding approved in 2006 for the Irish Institute of Naturopathic Medicine was never provided, with the promised service level agreement for the established treatment centre at Colliga House, County Wicklow.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Averil Power of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to clarify if he raised the matter of the ongoing grave and widespread human rights violations by the Chinese regime with Vice President Xi Jinping during his recent visit; if he has raised these issues in general bilateral relations with China and at EU level.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to reclassify Down&rsquo;s syndrome as a low incidence disability in order that children with the syndrome receive the teaching and learning resources appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators C&aacute;it Keane, Mark Daly, Denis O&rsquo;Donovan and Michael Mullins and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Averil Power and Fidelma Healy Eames may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 2 p.m., if not previously concluded.</P>

	<P>While I accept what has been ordered, I am sure the Leader will agree that it is somewhat light, even on a Thursday.  Will he endeavour to get some of his ministerial colleagues to consider bringing forward more legislation on a Thursday?</P>
        <P>Once again, the Government has been embarrassed, but I am sure it is also seething with anger at another leak from the European Commission to the finance committee of the German Bundestag.  Once again, members of the German government have been given discussion documents and draft papers on the Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary position ahead of their being discussed in the Oireachtas.  At a time when we are about to embark on a very important referendum campaign, this activity undermines and further erodes the waning trust many people have in the European project.  Will the Leader indicate what steps the Government is taking, given that this is the second occasion, within three months, such a leak has come from the Commission, to ensure this does not happen again?  Can he give an assurance that these documents will find their proper way to this sovereign Parliament, despite our difficulties?  It is clear the issue is linked to the referendum.  It is obvious from looking at the document that the Government&rsquo;s economic policy is in disarray and not receiving the acceptance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is possible that the level of acceptance the Government is conveying of it being <i>ad idem</i> with the EU and the troika in respect of budgetary policy may not necessarily be what it appears.  Given that it is very much in the news I reassure the Leader and the House that Fianna F&aacute;il remains steadfast in its support for the Government in respect of the referendum.  It is with regret that the former deputy leader of our party should dissent on a matter of policy.  However, I can also inform the House that much of what Deputy  &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has been saying about the continuing unsustainability of the bank debt has been raised here consistently.  I have no doubt the Leader will agree that these issues will form an important and central part of the debate in order to ensure the people have a full awareness of the issues on which they will vote.  I reiterate that the bank debt is unsustainable.  This is a unique opportunity for the Government to play hardball with the EU on this issue.  This is not a conditional support, neither is it equivocation on our part, we are simply stating a particular fact that there are elements of the bank debt that can be renegotiated, specifically the promissory notes, which are effectively a ball of smoke.  It is a sum of money that was created and printed by the Irish Central Bank, underscored by the ECB and the State has to pay it back to the Central Bank.  As Professor Karl Whelan, Professor Brian Lucey and others have pointed out in recent weeks to the relevant committee, this is effectively little more than a technical exercise.  If that &euro;31 billion was to be taken out of the equation it would go a long way towards ensuring we return to prosperity and economic independence.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader what steps the Government is taking to ensure there are no further leaks from the Commission.  While the Commission was set up to help and protect small nations, recently it has not shown many examples of same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am confused in regard to the reference to a ball of smoke &mdash; &euro;31 billion is a fair ball of smoke.  It was like groundhog day coming in this morning.  It was as if 29 February had never occurred.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I understood  it, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on the Order of Business yesterday was united and unequivocal in its support for the referendum.  However, by teatime all that support had evaporated and septic tanks, turf cutting and everything bar the kitchen sink had been thrown into the equation and support is clearly conditional.  It is dangerous to raise people&rsquo;s expectations on what is and is not in the treaty.  The promissory notes have nothing to do with the treaty as Senator Mooney is well aware.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To say to the people that if we play hard ball on this we will get a good deal and a good cut-off from the EU is a dangerous tack.  Clearly we do not know whether the Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin wing is supporting the referendum, but the Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v wing, which is a substantial wing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Does Senator Whelan want the Bill to pass?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>As today is officially the first day of spring, I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, and Mr. <Col N="4"/>Conor Skehan of the Peatland Council for the Trojan work they are doing in trying to resolve the turf cutting issue.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Senator Whelan to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>As one who comes from the heart of the bogs and who cut turf, as did my family, I am cognisant of the emotional attachment to land, turf cutting and turbary rights.  A forum is concluding in Athlone today at which Mr. Conor Skehan with Judge John Quirke have tried to facilitate families.  It is important to note that only 53 raised bogs out of 1,400 across the country are affected by the measure.  The families in question are being offered substantial and fair compensation, alternative deliveries of turf, ten tonnes per annum to their homes for 15 years or alternative turf plots nearby.  Most people would agree that is not an unreasonable proposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I simply want to draw the attention of the House to the matter because it is fair and good work.  Others who seek confrontation and protest on the matter are leading people up a cul-de-sac or a boithr&iacute;n at which there is no good.</P>
        <P>With the permission of the Cathaoirleach I commend the efforts in the pipeline by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to resolve the scandal of the use of prefabs in primary schools throughout the country.  Some 50,000 children attend school in prefabs.  The amount of money being wasted on rented prefabs is nothing short of a scandal.  I commend the Minister for the efforts he is making in this area and I look forward to a positive intervention by him in this regard in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week Goodbodys and AECOM published a review of the Irish railway network, although dated October 2011.  It shows up a serious problem that we spent &euro;559 million on putting in place four railway tracks to Kildare, that the passenger business was down by 25% and the freight business, between 2003 and 2009, was down 61%.  This is another example of the reason capital projects should be independently evaluated &mdash; this one appears to have continued with the press releases up to 2009.  We continued to put in &euro;595 million to double the capacity to cater for 25% fewer passengers and 61% less freight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to get a grip on the weaknesses in the Departments of Finance and Transport in appraising projects.  It is strange that this project was allowed to go through while GAA referees are being pursued for &euro;13 or whatever they get, for refereeing a match, to try to remedy the national finances.  If we had proper project appraisal we could save much more money.  This one appears to have been unnecessary to double the capacity of what has proved to be declining activity in the past four years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of unfinished housing estates, the Minister has asked Westmeath County Council to carry out an investigation following the tragic death of a toddler in an estate.  Our sympathies are with the family of the toddler who died.  The problem of unfinished housing estates is serious.  The Minister should investigate if the same developers are continually working on office buildings and other buildings and ensure priority is given to the estates in which people live to make them safer.  I appreciate the Minister has asked Westmeath County Council for a report under category 3, which is under the responsibility of the developer.  When does a building site cease to be a building site?  I understand five houses in the <Col N="5"/>estate are occupied while all the others are vacant.  We have a responsibility to those living in unfinished estates.  If work is taking place and there is money the priority should be to ensure safety and that whoever is responsible is held to account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Can the Leader confirm that the Government parties will play a substantial role and put all their efforts into ensuring that, along with the pronouncement made by Fianna F&aacute;il, this important referendum is passed?  I have canvassed on a number of referendums and the then Opposition, consisting of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, had a negative attitude towards us when we were in government. Recently it was confirmed to me by a senior Fine Gael politician that they had smirked at us when we canvassed for Lisbon I and II and Nice I and II, which was unfair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>They did not lift a finger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Our position this time is clear and unequivocal.  The referendum should not just be about &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and his position.  He is one man and democracy is at stake.  It was important for Senator Whelan to lecture us about a man going overboard and mistakes being made.  Given that there was a motion before his parliamentary party not that long ago to silence one of its own Senators, I ask him to be fair on this issue.  The Government parties need to put all of their efforts into the referendum.  It is primarily the function of the Government side of the House, the Taoiseach and his Cabinet to sell the referendum.  My party will play its part and all of its members here are in unison.  The last referendum was on the legal fallout of the Abbeylara tribunal but it was badly sold.  I am afraid again because this is the first referendum on Europe that the Government will face and it is a critical one.  The onus is on the Government to ensure that it is passed and that shoe leather is worn out travelling around rural Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It was done in the countryside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It was not done in the past and that is an important point.  I sincerely ask the Leader - he knows me a long time as I am a long-standing member of the House - to agree that it is important that the referendum is passed.  The onus is on the Government side and we should not be lectured to.  Our position has been made clear by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and we should not be lectured to. The Government side can be assured that we will deliver the votes but if the referendum fails, it will not be our fault. </P>

	<P>I saw and heard clearly why we need the facts on the fiscal compact treaty.  Last night it was not clearly stated that the treaty is not an EU one and there is no need for a &ldquo;fiscal compact II&rdquo;.  Only 12 countries out of 17 must ratify the fiscal compact for it to take effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to share the concern that was already expressed that, for the second time, a committee of a foreign parliament is considering information that emanated from an institution of the European Union that deals with matters that relate to the economy and finances of this state, yet the information has not been presented to the legitimate Parlia<Col N="7"/>ment of this state.  This shows there is an appalling attitude somewhere within the European Union and other member states.</P>
        <P>The Leader was correct to say the other day that we should not direct our ire at the people of another member state.  It is also true that small countries in the European Union, and especially at a time of crisis like this, need to be treated with a measure of respect.  Treating a small country like Ireland as though it were little better, with due respect to local authorities, than a county council in the European Union is an appalling message to be sending, particularly at a time when our people must make a sensitive decision on the fiscal compact.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There is something seriously lacking in the attitudes of powerful people in the EU that this would be allowed to happen a second time.  This is not just a matter of political point scoring or an opportunity to slag the Irish Government.  I would like to see the Government make representations about the issue and express its annoyance in forthright terms.  If I am wrong, I would like to hear why.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Most of us would agree that the Irish people are not a stupid race and will not be politically bribed or brow beaten.  With regard to the forthcoming vote, the most important thing in the next couple of weeks is that full information on the contents of the treaty, not on what it does not contain, will be provided for every single voter. The House can do itself a favour, but more importantly can do the public a huge political favour, by having an engaging, informative debate in advance of the legislation being published. As we know, the formula is that the legislation is published to allow a referendum, we have a debate for a day or two and a few weeks later the referendum takes place. This House, in advance of the publication of any referendum Bill, needs to have a substantive debate on the fiscal compact treaty and its contents, thus avoiding a debate on what it does not contain. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">We can talk about revising history.  It is quite bemusing to hear people claim that they were not in government or responsible for massively incorrect financial decisions.  To use an awful political phrase, &ldquo;we are where we are&rdquo; and must move forward.  The public demands that we do not lecture them on how to vote but advise and inform them about what the treaty contains.  I ask the Leader to arrange, at an early date, a substantive debate on the fiscal compact arrangement or treaty that will be signed by the Taoiseach tomorrow.  I ask that, in advance of the referendum legislation coming here, we debate the treaty and give everybody, irrespective of their views, an opportunity to debate it, not just a three minute slot each.  That will be good for the House and the public.  Irish people are not stupid and they want information, not lectures.</P>

	<P>I agree with the previous speakers that raised the issue of the leaked documents discussed at the meeting of the German finance committee.  The D&aacute;il and the Seanad are being treated with contempt and being usurped by the people that leak the documents.  Such behaviour is unacceptable.  Wherever we might find ourselves in terms of the argument on the fiscal compact treaty, it is disgraceful that our finance committee did not have sight of those documents which referred to a number of important things that could impact on the country.  The documents raised the possibility of a mini-budget and that, following discussions with the troika, the figure for the sale of assets increased from &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion.</P><Col N="8"/>

        <P>German parliamentarians are debating all of these issues.  They have full knowledge of what is happening in the discussions on Ireland&rsquo;s financial affairs.  However, parliamentarians here are not being given the same opportunity.  Regardless of our various stances on the fiscal compact treaty, let us all agree that the leaking of these documents and the provision of information that is of vital importance to Ireland should, in the first instance, be discussed in this Parliament before it is the subject of debate elsewhere.  People are angry about austerity measures, about the fact that we do not have power over our own fiscal affairs and our loss of sovereignty.  We all want to work together to assuage that anger and regain our sovereignty.  However, when the German Parliament rubs our faces in it by discussing these matters when we have not had the opportunity to do so, it is an embarrassment for the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In dealing with this issue it is important that people approach it in a balanced way.  I worked in Brussels for two years and one of the things I learned was that people from the various member states had respect for parliamentarians or officials from other countries.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that this matter has again arisen in respect of Germany.  It is not a welcome development.  It is important, however, that we do not exaggerate the problem and make it far greater than it actually is.</P>

	<P>We need to approach the matter in an extremely delicate way.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the need to be positive.  Today some people from Northern Ireland are visiting the Oireachtas to discuss matters relating to health.  That is a welcome development.  This is a matter on which a great deal of progress has been made.  Yesterday was International Rare Disease Day.  The authorities both here and in Northern Ireland can work together on an all-island basis.  It is important that we continue to encourage the sharing of services and information.  The process relating to such sharing is welcome and we must ensure it continues and is developed further.</P>
        <P>The cross-border health care directive was adopted in February 2011.  However, it has not yet been transposed into Irish law.  I have raised the matter with the Department of Health.  If we are not able to provide particular health care in this country, it is important that people be entitled to travel to another member state in order to access it.  This highlights the advantages of membership of the European Union.  Will the Leader request the Minister for Health to ensure the directive to which I refer is transposed into Irish law at the earliest possible opportunity?  In addition, we must carry on and develop the work being done on health issues with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The first matter to which I wish to refer relates to the fact that the statutory instrument on copyright which was signed last night is not on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.  While I was able to procure a copy of it from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, when statutory instruments become available on the Internet and are the subject of discussion <Col N="9"/>in the media, they should be listed on the Order Paper and readily available from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  I request that the relevant officials examine the position in this regard.  I am not complaining, however, because staff in the Oireachtas Library and Research Service eventually obtained for me a copy of the statutory instrument to which I refer.  However, it took some effort to procure it.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il is absolutely clear in its position on the fiscal compact.  We will be voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  This is despite the fact that many of us have the same misgivings as the former Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and understand his genuineness on the issue.  Fianna F&aacute;il is a pro-European Union party and has done more than any other party in this country to integrate Ireland into the Union.  We are going to continue our work in this regard.  The reality, however, is that the people do not have a choice: they must vote in favour of the treaty.  This is because the Government has signed up to a pact, under which we do not have a veto in respect of the treaty.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, it will mean nothing because only 12 countries need to assent to the treaty for it to come into force.  We will not, therefore, have the same leverage which applied in the case of the Lisbon treaty.  It is unfortunate that the Government has signed us up to these arrangements.</P>
        <P>The Government also signed us up to a blackmail clause, whereby there will be no further bailouts if we do not sign up to the treaty.</P>

We should not be asking why it was leaked to the Bundestag because the German Government is obliged under its country&rsquo;s constitution to circulate such documents to Members of Parliament.  Why did the Government not circulate the document to Members of the Oireachtas in order that we had an opportunity to read it before our German counter<Col N="10"/>parts?  The Government was aware of the German legal obligation from the previous occasion on which this occurred.  Why is the document in question not listed on today&rsquo;s Order Paper for discussion?  The Government is going to be obliged to introduce a second budget.  It spent all of last year claiming credit for the budget it had opposed.  However, nearly three months after its own budget was introduced, it is already contemplating the introduction of a second budget.</P>

	<P>That was a very uncharacteristic remark from Senator Tom Sheahan who is a gentleman.  I am glad he withdrew it immediately.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that colleagues on both sides of the House referred to the leaking of a particular document to the finance committee of the German Bundestag.  What has happened in disgraceful.  People in this country are obviously of the view that this is a matter of importance <Col N="11"/>and it is the subject of a leading article on the front page of today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Yesterday I raised this issue under Standing Order 30 and the Cathaoirleach ruled it out of order.  He has my sympathy.  Thereafter, the Leader informed the House that a particular Bill would be introduced next week when he knew that this was not correct.  There is an urgent case to be made in respect of the revision of Standing Orders in order that we might have honesty, openness and transparency.</P>
        <P>It is absolutely appalling that the Cathaoirleach informed the House that a matter of direct relevance to the people, namely, the fact that we have been told that we will require further austerity measures and possibly another budget and that we were obliged to scale upwards the level of State assets to be sold, a matter discussed by another sovereign parliament, was out of order.  Members of the Bundestag were able to discuss what affected our people before elected representatives here were in a position to do so.  However, that does not surprise me, although I am not criticising the Cathaoirleach.  On a previous occasion when I raised something I considered to be a national emergency, namely, a strike in the ESB, I was informed that it was not a matter of national importance.  Simultaneously, the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, was declaring a national emergency in the Lower House.  These things make a farce of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

        <P>The other matter to which I refer is the fact that an honourable man whom I do not believe has ever been obliged to tell a lie outside the House was forced to tell one yesterday.  We all knew that the relevant Bill would not be introduced next week and we were told that what had been said reflected a form of words used under Standing Orders.  No one should be compelled by Standing Orders to tell a lie.  They are a complete and absolute antiquated nonsense and must be revised in the interests of this House.</P>

	<P>I have no doubt that during the course of the debate we will have during the coming weeks, the people will be very much focused on economic recovery, job creation and how we can get our country out of the mess it is in right now.  In that vein I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, opening the Enterprise Ireland high potential start-ups showcase yesterday, which featured 92 brand new companies which will employ 1,600 people by 2013 and generate in excess of &euro;200 million in annual sales.  This is on top of the Government announcement that &euro;500 million is to be spent on research aimed at turning good ideas into jobs.  I very much welcome that 18 trade delegations will take place in 2012, with many going to Brazil, Russia, India and China.  Three visits to China alone are planned for this year.</P>
        <P>In some further good news on the jobs front, I see in this morning&rsquo;s newspaper that the Lynch farm in Clarecastle, County Clare, lit up Chinese eyes, with a focus on agricultural <Col N="12"/>production and how we can increase the very significant exports we already have to China in baby food and milk products.  There are some positive issues on the horizon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join others in expressing concern about the Europe-wide discussion on budgetary matters for Ireland before we discuss them here.  It is unacceptable, as the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Byrne and others have articulated very well.  In the context of ongoing and future debates about the forthcoming referendum, I will unequivocally support its passage.  It is incumbent on all of us to keep the message simple.  Much of the analysis I have seen so far is much too complex and there is a finite amount of time to get one&rsquo;s message across.  I will support it because it will put a mechanism in place to prevent a repeat of the financial catastrophe we have seen throughout Europe and the wider world, as well as Ireland.  That should be welcomed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That does not deduct in any way from my passionate view that the European Union owes the Irish people.  In advance of international acceptance of problems in Spain, Italy, Portugal and even France and the United States, the Irish people fronted up in a way and absorbed austerity, blanket guarantees and other measures.  Nobody would wish to have to put such measures in place, but we did so, and I sat on the Government side of the House and had to defend these.  For that reason, make no mistake that the European Union owes the Irish people &mdash; not Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il.  For that reason, every time I speak on the issue or canvass for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, I will push the Government and any person with influence in Europe to ensure that they do the decent thing, front up for us now and ensure we get debt write-down, action on the promissory notes and other concessions that acknowledge the actions and support given unequivocally by the Irish people to the European Union.</P>

        <P>There is no point in us needlessly getting into a flap, which is happening far too frequently.  Everyone on the Government side would accept the bona fides of the Opposition with regard to the very important referendum which is staring us in the face and which is necessary legally and constitutionally.  Let us not argue about it, and Senator MacSharry is probably right that we should keep it in terms as simple as possible when presenting the argument.  Allied to this, I have no doubt that the Referendum Commission will do a fair, impartial and good job of work in presenting the facts.</P>

It is a seven-page document which asks more questions than it gives answers, to say the least.  I call on the Leader to facilitate a debate in the House, next week if possible, on the standards for septic tanks that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is seeking people to meet.</P>
        <P>Regarding the discussion in the House this morning concerning the fiscal treaty, much has been said in trying to blame, in a political fashion, people who have spoken and have sought concessions for this country.  It is only right and proper that those concessions would be made.  The only reason those questions are now being asked and that Fianna F&aacute;il has debated this over the past 36 hours is because of the shortcomings of the negotiation team representing this country and the Government: the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs is also at fault.  We have not achieved what Ireland sought in terms of a write-down on the banking debt.

Taca&iacute;m leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill maidir le ceist na dabhcha s&eacute;arachais.  Yesterday, a large crowd protested outside the House on the important issue of septic tanks.  The Minister promised to have a debate on the standards that will apply to septic tanks once they were published.  I welcome the publication of this information because it may put to bed many of the rumours and scaremongering that may have taken place.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister for Education and Skills come before the House to debate the future of rural schools.  While the House has debated educational issues on a number of occasions, it has not had a specific debate on rural schools.  The Government has rowed back somewhat on its proposals on DEIS schools in urban areas but has failed to row back on its proposals for DEIS schools in rural areas.  Hundreds of rural schools with between one and four teachers still do not know what the future will hold.  It is important, therefore, that Senators discuss the implications of cutbacks in rural schools, school transport, scholarships and other areas.  It is important to have a debate on rural Ireland.  I will quickly plug the launch of our rural campaign in Castlebar tomorrow.  Perhaps we will see the Taoiseach at the event.</P>

	<P>I have asked the Leader on a number of occasions to ensure the Taoiseach addresses the House and treats Senators properly.  Under the 1937 Constitution, Senators are nominated or democratically elected.  I ask the Leader, on my behalf, to request that the Taoiseach come before the Seanad to discuss the EU fiscal treaty and inform us about the negotiations in which the Government is engaged with a view to securing a reduction in the &euro;31 billion in promissory notes issued to the Central Bank.  I understand such negotiations are ongoing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland must pass the fiscal treaty.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party was the driving force behind Ireland joining the European Economic Community.  When I was doing my leaving certificate we did compositions and discussed the issue, Bunt&aacute;iste agus m&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste an chomhargaidh.  Ireland is a small country with a population of just 4.4 million.  Access to a European market of 300 million people &mdash; it has since increased to 500 million people &mdash; was the reason multinational <Col N="15"/>companies thronged to this country.  We are the only English speaking people in the European Union.</P>

        <P>My life has been very much wrapped up in the issue of industrial development.  I am pleased the Government and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, recognises the significance of multinational investment.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, did not share his brother&rsquo;s passion when he was Minister for industry.</P>
        <P>I do not know if Senator Whelan read today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Financial Times</i>, the most important newspaper in the world, in which the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, states she wants to secure a better deal for Ireland.

	<P>I would like the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to come to the House.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is saying the same thing as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  All of us are in favour of passing the referendum.  I ask the Leader again to request that the Taoiseach come before the House to sell the fiscal treaty to the Seanad.  The issues should be explained in simple terms.  What, for example, is a promissory note?  In simple English that everyone understands, a promissory note is an IOU.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This is the first day of spring and every year at this time I religiously ask that we have this day the whole year around.  The reason I say this is that, as the Leader is aware, I have believed for many years that Ireland should move to central European time.  Making this change would give us an extra hour of daylight throughout the year.  I raise this issue again because the British are moving in this direction.  Any qualms we had about making this change, to which there is no opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have difficulty hearing with Senator White still speaking.  My apologies to the Senator but I was on the point of saying that the idea of having an extra hour of daylight is under consideration in Britain.  The British do not use the term &ldquo;central European time&rdquo; but refer to retaining &ldquo;summer time&rdquo; throughout the year.  The additional hour of daylight has a clear benefit to the economy in terms of tourism, energy costs, road traffic accidents and in many other respects.  A Bill to move Britain to central European time is before the House of Commons.  The only reason Ireland has not made the transition to central European time, for which there is almost universal support, is that it would create a time gap between Dublin and Belfast.  On that basis, let us ensure the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who I understand has responsibility for the matter, informs his British counterparts that we are anxious to make this change because they will then follow us.</P>

If the reasonable people of this country are given proper information, they will accept and pass the referendum.  However, the arguments are already becoming fractious, even in this House whose Members like to believe they set an example.

        <P>On an organisational matter, I ask the Leader to suggest to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, that presiding officers and polling clerks who will run the polling stations in the referendum be drawn from the live register.  They should be people who do not have a job but are competent and capable of doing the job.   We should make a strong effort to send out a clear message that people who have given good service over the years but are reasonably well off, with pensions and other jobs and so forth, should be moved aside to give an opportunity for at least a day&rsquo;s work for people who are on the live register.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The acting Leader of the Opposition, Senator Mooney, mentioned the leaking of documents.  The document that was leaked yesterday from the German parliamentary committee is a European Commission staff report, not an Irish document.  All of the key documents related to the Irish programme were published on the website of the Department of Finance on 14 February.  These include the letter of intent and the accompanying documents such as the memorandum of understanding and the economic and financial policies.  The leaked document was a report that was being discussed by European Union officials.  It is not an important programme document.  The leaking of this document is not an issue of concern for the Government.  Following a decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court, official programme documentation must be circulated to the German Government and the relevant parliamentary committee of the German Parliament, as everybody is aware.  The Government is working hard, as everybody realises, to exit from the programme of assistance in order that there will no longer be a requirement for the circulation of such information.  In order to exit the programme, we will be strongly urging a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, lines 18 and 19, to delete subsection (2).</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock.  This is dangerous legislation.  It provides that it shall be deemed to have come into operation on 5 December 2011.  This is the first time I have seen an effort being made to introduce retrospective legislation and as such, I am sure it will end up in court.  Today is 1 March and I presume Report Stage will be taken next week.  As I note the Government has tabled an amendment which means the legislation will return to the D&aacute;il, I assume it will be sometime later this month when the legislation will become law.  However, its effect will be backdated to 5 December last year.</P>
        <P>This legislation will end up in court.  We cannot have a situation where legislation is passed in March but its effect is backdated to December.  On that basis, a case must be made that this section should only apply from the day the legislation is passed, not 5 December last year.  I do not believe the legislation will be upheld in court.  I assume the Attorney General has said the Government can take a run with it and that, on balance, it should be upheld.  However, that is a mistake.  I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment and pass the legislation with its provisions stipulating that it will come into effect on the day it is actually passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Feargal Quinn on this amendment.  For as long as I have been a Member of this House, it has always been stated retrospective legislation does not comply with the Constitution.  When the Minister spoke on Second Stage, he said he had received legal advice that the legislation was in order.  However, the same happened in the case of the nursing home Bill and when it was challenged, it was found to be unconstitutional.  I, therefore, strongly urge the Minister to ensure the provisions of this Bill will be applicable from the date of enactment.</P>
        <P>The only reason for backdating is to get over the problem that the Bill was not ready and passed by the Houses in time.  However, that is not a reason to apply retrospectively provisions which might have implications for businesses and, perhaps, employment.  In fact, the Minister conceded on Second Stage and in his correspondence with the unions that there would be job losses arising from enactment of the directive.  That is lunacy at a time of such high unemployment.  I have said in the past &mdash; I am not making a political point because I said it from 2008 <Col N="20"/>to 2011 also &mdash; that the public service and politicians have failed to grasp the severity of the downturn for those who are struggling.  We are acting as if we are still living in good economic times.  Every Bill should be jobs-proofed.  If this Bill was, it would clearly be illustrated that its provisions should be ameliorated as much as possible in the interests of maintaining jobs in the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for tabling the amendment.  I appreciate their concerns about the intention to have the Bill apply retrospectively from 5 December 2011, the transposition date of the directive.  On Second Stage earlier this week the Minister indicated that he was in receipt of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that the legislation should, on enactment, have retrospective effect from 5 December 2011, with the notable exception of the offence creating provisions in sections 13 and 15 in Part 4 of the Bill.  These provisions will come into effect on enactment of the legislation.  My advice is based on the fact that implementation of the directive provisions is necessitated to meet the obligations arising from membership of the European Union and that, therefore, they enjoy protection under the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I really believe a mistake has been made for two reasons.  First, this is shaky legislation which will end up in court.  There is a danger that the Attorney General has decided to take a decision &ldquo;on balance&rdquo; &mdash; the phrase she used.  This is very dangerous legislation on which to do so.  I had the experience in 1971 &mdash; probably before the Minister of State was born &mdash; of ending up in the Supreme Court in a case which I won on a four to one judgment.  I was only a young fellow at the time, or at least I thought so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is still a young fellow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I won the case in the High Court but the State appealed the decision.  However, I won in the Supreme Court.  I mention this not because I have a legal background, but because I learned enough about legislation way back in 1971 to realise there is always the possibility of dangerous legislation being enacted.  Since I came a Member of this House 19 years ago, I have seen a few efforts being made to introduce legislation which would have had retrospective effect and in practically every case the relevant Minister decided not to go ahead with it.  This is one of the exceptions.  However, a mistake has been made.  We should have had the directive transposed before 5 December and the legislation should have copied the directive word for word, but we have not done this.  The phrase &ldquo;at least&rdquo; was inserted when there was no need to do so.  I do not know why the legislation has been changed, but that is not a point I wish to make now.  The point I wish to make is that this legislation is being backdated to give it retrospective effect and that, on that basis, it should not go through.  I, therefore, urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House.  I second the amendment and plead with the Minister of State to at least go back on it, although I know the Minister has taken legal advice.  When I spoke on this issue on 20 October, I pleaded for us to take this agency directive very seriously.  However, there is no point in looking back now.  We know how fortunate is the United Kingdom in seeking a 12 week derogation.  I am a business person who was parachuted into the House.  While I am not a legal person, I am <Col N="21"/>thinking about all other businesses, as this is super-complicated, convoluted legal stuff.  Senator Lorraine Higgins is a legal person, but business people will not understand this legislation.  If we have to implement it retrospectively from 5 December, there will soon be one hell of a mess for the business people of Ireland.  It is about jobs, jobs and jobs.  There has been nothing but job losses.  Will the Minister of State look again to see if anything can be done?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>What Senators Feargal Quinn, Jim Walsh and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien have said is very important.  We often hear about the complications of starting up a business.  It is all about creating employment, yet bureaucracy adds further regulations.  There is no logic to the proposal that this legislation be backdated.  Agency workers are used as cover for staff who are on leave of absence, maternity, parental and sick leave.  The dramatic increase in costs will be completely unsustainable, especially when the agency fee is factored into the equation.  The problem is that there are not that many business people here because any business person knows the cost of hiring an agency worker is normally much higher than in taking on a permanent worker.  This is a prime example of regulations being introduced that will prevent people from starting up a business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I hear what the other Senators are saying.  No one wants to get caught up in a situation where the provisions of legislation have to be implemented retrospectively.  Nonetheless, as the Minister of State said and as the Minister pointed out on Tuesday, the advice from the Attorney General is that we are obliged to implement the directive as and from 5 December 2011.  A consultation period started in October 2010.  We would like to have seen a grace period introduced in the legislation, similar to the 12 week period in the United Kingdom.  Unfortunately, however, there was no agreement between unions and employers&rsquo; representatives.  That is why the Minister has been forced, against his better judgment no doubt, to implement the legislation as and from 5 December, the date from which the directive was to take effect.</P>
        <P>We have acknowledged that there is a competitiveness issue.  There will be a cost to employers.  The Minister has said the same.  We are in a period in which we are trying to reduce costs to employers to ensure those who are competing, particularly on an international basis, do not incur additional costs.  The Government has received advice from the Attorney General that the legislation should have retrospective effect from 5 December and it would be foolhardy of any Government to ignore the advice of the Attorney General.  This week we received important advice from the Attorney General on the need to hold a referendum on the fiscal compact treaty and again today we are considering important advice from her.  I do not think any government has ignored advice from the Attorney General.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>People are at their wits&rsquo; end wondering how they will survive and pay their bills this week.  They are good people who have worked all their lives.  The least they can expect from us in the recession which has hit them is not rhetoric &mdash; the 100,000 jobs have now been announced three times &mdash; but effective action to ensure there will be no more job losses in the economy.  On Second Stage I quoted the economist Jim Power, for whom I have no great gr&aacute;, but he has estimated that 10,000 jobs could be lost.  The Minister has conceded that jobs will be lost as a result of this measure.  We are, therefore, passing legislation which could result in 20,000 to 30,000 people enduring hardship because the breadwinner in the house will lose his or her job.  It is unconscionable that the Minister of State is so sanguine about this, as is the senior Minister.</P><Col N="22"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is one thing to say the Attorney General has stated it conforms with the Constitution to backdate the legislation to 5 December, but it is another to make the argument that the Attorney General has stated we must do this.  That is a policy decision for the Minister and his Government colleagues.  Senators Feargal Quinn, Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien and Mary White have provided employment for many decades.  They are business people and stating clearly the implications of this are wrong. </P>
      
        
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, as a young Minister starting his career in that capacity, to have the courage to accept and implement this amendment, which is a minor one.  There are more substantive ones coming down the line.  Does he accept the principle which previous occupants of the position always held dear, that legislation should not be retrospective and to make it so incorporates bad precedent and principles into the law?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Britain got a derogation, and the Minister of State must take much of the responsibility for the fact that the Government failed to get one.  The only reason for this I can see is that the Government prevaricated with the former social partners pretending, that they somehow would be given a veto on this legislation.  That era has gone.  Unions withdrew from social partnership.  We do not have social partnership anymore.  IBEC, representing the large employers, and the unions benefited significantly through increased salaries.  There are union officials who are on &euro;200,000 a year representing small sectoral interests, particularly in the public sector, and it is totally unrealistic and unreasonable.  We need to put those days behind us and go back to collective bargaining at local level.  Let employers and unions, at local level, decide what is appropriate and what can be done by way of rates of pay and terms and conditions of employment.  I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the arguments that are being put before him, and this minor adjustment to the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Does the Minister of State accept that there will be significant job losses, without quantifying the number, as a consequence of introducing this legislation?  I would like a straight answer from him.  His senior colleague has put it on the record to the unions that there will be significant job losses.  I ask the Minister of State to put the same on the record of this House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I oppose the amendment.  I support what the Government is doing and the advice which has come from the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>I am flabbergasted at some of the comments that I have heard so far in the Chamber today because I fail to see how we will see job losses on the scale that some Senators have stated we will see them.  I just do not see it.  Senator Walsh spoke of three Senators who represent themselves in terms of them being business people.  I applaud those who set up businesses and entrepreneurs, but I also have spoken to those who represent workers in trade unions.  I refer not to the senior trade union representatives on high salaries of whom Senator Walsh spoke but to those on the ground who represent agency workers.  I spoke to agency workers.  I was part of a campaign that SIPTU and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions initiated to protect workers.</P>
        <P>This is a simple measure we are trying to implement.  It is not convoluted and complicated, as somebody said.  It is to try to bring about equity for those who are agency workers and those who are directly employed permanent workers.</P>
        <P>I am at a loss.  Perhaps those Senators could point out to me from where the job losses will come, how they believe this will amount to massive job losses, and why that is so.  If that was the case, it would say more about employers in this country than anything else.</P>
        <P>Senator White should explain why an employer would want to leave an agency worker go simply because he or she is being asked to provide that worker with the same terms and <Col N="23"/>conditions as somebody who is a permanent worker.  Senators should explain how they believe this will amount to job losses and why they have a difficulty with the notion of agency workers having the same rights and entitlements.</P>

        <P>We need to ensure there is equity for workers in this country.  I do not believe in a modern republic there can be a situation where one worker who is doing exactly the same work as somebody else is treated differently simply because he or she is an agency worker.  Some of the profits on the back of their labour goes to the agency company, of which they are part.  I do not believe that is the best way in which we should create employment in this country.</P>
        <P>I accept what the Government is trying to do here.  I have some reservations because there are many exceptions, our amendments on which, unfortunately, have been ruled out of order, but we can address them on the sections.  However, I reiterate that if Senators make the claim that this will amount to massive jobs losses, let them spell out how there will be such massive job losses.  Let them explain why employers would let workers go.  That would say more about the employers than about anything that we are doing here today.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I take issue with something Senator Walsh stated about the senior Minister and the Minister of State.  One will not find two Ministers in any Government who are more pro-jobs and who have introduced as many initiatives in as short a period of time, and that must be acknowledged.  I spoke earlier in the House about the launch yesterday of the high potential start-ups and the potential to create 1,600 jobs in the next year, and the &euro;500 million research budget targeted at getting those with good ideas, which the Minister of State announced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.  There was an opportunity before 5 December last to have a lead-in period similar to what they had in the UK and it is regrettable that the social partners did not engage in a meaningful way.  Everything we do and say in this House must be geared <Col N="24"/>towards creating jobs and making it easier to retain and create new jobs.  A situation similar to what they have in the UK would have been desirable.  I wish the Minister was in a position not to have to back-date this to 5 December, but we are being told the advice is that he must.  Maybe there is an opportunity to have another look at it and, if that is possible, we would very much welcome it.  The real opportunity was lost in the run-up to 5 December.  I would certainly take issue with both IBEC and the trade union movement that they were unable to reach an agreement that would have been acceptable to everybody.  We are possibly closing the stable door when the horse has bolted on this issue.  As the Minister of State indicated, the Attorney General is saying that 5 December must be the operational date.  However, I join previous speakers in asking the Minister of State to have a look at it to see if it is possible to modify it in any way.</P>

	<P>In answer to Senator Cullinane who asked whether this would amount to job losses, I met two companies in the past 24 hours.  One is a multinational manufacturing exporter in the top 50 in this country with 650 employees, 300 of whom are agency workers and 350 of whom are permanent.  Let me take the Senator to the boardroom in the United States where this company is run.  It has companies all over the world, in Mexico, Asia, eastern Europe and Ireland.  The board is in the United States and Ireland is one location.  They run a red, amber, green system.  They work on margins, not profitability.  Let us say this year our margin is 42% of a target and at the end of this year, Ireland does not hit that 42%.  When the board members ask why, they see that different labour laws have come into Ireland, competitiveness is gone and there is a new cost.  Ireland has gone from a green in flexibility in the labour department to a red, and we will be struck off by the board.  It will take them a year or a year and a half to disband that company, and 600 jobs will be gone.</P>

I am only here because of my workers.  I adore, revere and respect my workers.  I am very proud that we take great pains with the law and with the right advice on how to treat our workers.  I am here today to try to legislate a perfect balance between the company, the agency, the permanent worker and the temporary worker.

	<P>I wish to make the point, although Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien has made it for the benefit of Senator Cullinane, that there are companies utilising agency workers where those workers themselves are quite happy with the rates of pay they are getting and the permanent employees are happy with the arrangement around the agency workers.  It is the permanent workforce in some of these companies, apart from the agency workers, who are raising <Col N="25"/>the issue that the lack of flexibility being introduced within the system will have long-term implications for their jobs.  Decisions are made outside of Ireland in many cases.  It is my fear that we will consign these people to the unemployment register.</P>
        <P>I would have thought Sinn F&eacute;in would have changed its tune from the 1980s.  There was a big company in New Ross with up to 1,000 people working there until some Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA activist came in and caused a number of strikes which led to the closure of the company.  I thought those days were behind us.  I ask people to enlighten themselves about the real issue in this economy as it stands, rather than false ideology for populist reasons to garner votes.

As such, we have signed up to a process of consultation through co-decision procedures and interaction with the Council of Ministers and the Commission.  When the Commission makes a legislative proposal, if there is a co-decision procedure to be adhered to, then we, as a member of the EU, are party to that consultation process.  When an agreement is reached, primarily on the basis of consensus, we then transpose the directives.  In this case, the directive dates back to 2008; therefore, we have to transpose it.  If we all agree to the fact we are a member of the EU, then we subscribe to those founding principles and the legislative actions arising thereof and to which we are party.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To take the points made by Mr. Jim Power, he was extrapolating from a UK figure.  While the Senator states he has no gr&aacute; for Mr. Power, I happen to think Mr. Power is provocative and one who has provoked debate in a very positive sense in this country around issues such as agriculture, for example&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P Just="Left">I am not aware of any evidence on the record of this House or the D&aacute;il in respect of utterances by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in regard to job losses.  With the indulgence of the House, I will quote again from his speech: </P>
        
        <P LI="1">The final derogation available under Article 5.4 of the directive recognises the voluntarist nature of industrial relations in the United Kingdom and in Ireland and was designed to meet the needs and flexibilities required in the labour market to accommodate the system in place in both countries.  The derogation includes the possibility for a &ldquo;qualifying period&rdquo; before the principle of equal treatment would apply to temporary agency workers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">To be fair to the Minister, what we are trying to do here is to protect the rights of workers, to comply with the EU directive and to do so in a way that is balanced.  If there is a contention that job losses will occur directly in one specific company or entity as a result of this, I respectfully suggest I have my doubts.  The evidence in terms of inward investment into Ireland by global companies, which have public affairs departments and are <i>au fait</i> through those departments with trends in EU legislation and transposition of EU directives, is that they are aware this legislation is on the cards and would have regard to that fact when they are making their investment decisions in Ireland.  We have had some notable investment decisions and notable companies setting up here, some of whose operations would be within the sphere of employing temporary agency workers or contract workers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have not seen any evidence of job losses in the UK and do not know of any public utterance by the Minister to this or the other House in respect of prospective job losses.  If somebody has done a study or has extrapolated from UK figures, it should be put on the record or submitted to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret the amendments were ruled out of order and wish to take the opportunity to raise my concerns by speaking to the section, although I support the section and will not push the question to a vote.  We were seeking that all terms and conditions of agency workers would be comparable with those of directly employed workers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 2(1) sets out the position on terms and conditions, including pay, working time, rest periods rest breaks during the working day, night work, annual leave and public holidays.  While I accept all of the conditions listed, it is by no means an exhaustive list.  Permanent workers have many other entitlements which are not included in that list.  We were seeking to provide, <Col N="28"/>not that all conditions be listed, because there could be thousands of conditions to which an employee is entitled, but that whatever conditions apply to a permanent worker would apply to an agency worker.  I am speaking in this regard of comparing like with like.  We are not seeking that a temporary agency worker would have the same rights as a permanent worker but that he or she would have the same rights as a directly employed person who is a part-time worker and that a permanent agency worker would have the same entitlements as a permanent worker.  I am talking about like for like.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 2(1) states that sick pay and pension scheme payments are excluded, which I do not understand.  The Government is currently considering the proposal that employers meet workers&rsquo; entitlements in respect of the first three days of sick pay.  I raised this issue on Second Stage.  If I understood him correctly, the Minister said that the agency worker is not employed by the person for whom he or she may be working, which is part of the problem.  If an agency does not provide a pension and the organisation for whom a person is working is not obliged to provide a pension then workers could end up in limbo.  What we are trying to do &mdash; whether people see this as ideological is of no consequence to me &mdash; is to ensure there is equity between workers.</P>
        <P>We had a number of good discussions in this House on pensions.  The Government is encouraging people to take out pensions.  We are all aware that we have an ageing population and that pensions will be a big issue in the future.  People know that the state pension could potentially be cut at some point in the future, if not by this Government then by a future Government.  Issues have already arisen in relation to private pensions.  The Government, while encouraging people to take out private pensions, is for whatever reason excluding pension schemes from this provision.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will explain the reason the amendments were ruled out of order and clarify the reason sick pay and pension schemes are excluded from this legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and on the points raised in that regard by Senator Cullinane.  While I do not believe pensions should be covered by this legislation, the issue needs to be addressed as a matter of priority.  Only approximately 50% of the population have pensions cover.  The Government&rsquo;s raiding of pension funds has had a negative impact on people in terms of their taking out pensions.  We should be encouraging them to create their own pension funds.  Pensions is a important issue but I do not believe it should be addressed in this Bill.  However, legislation in this regard, once introduced, should address the issue holistically.  Addressing this issue should be a priority of Government.  I disagree with many of the negative things the Government has done in respect of pensions.  However, that is a debate for another day.</P>

	<P>In the wake of Senator David Cullinane&rsquo;s contribution, I wish to put a question to the Minister of State.  The Senator has indicated that temporary agency workers should have the same rights as temporary workers.  What will an employer or an agency do if there is no temporary worker in a company?  What will be the position if a company wishes to confer equal rights in circumstances where there is no comparable worker available?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="29"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Such rights would reflect those of a comparable worker in a similar company.  It generally relates to the rights of full-time directly employed part-time workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter is contemplated in a later amendment.  Perhaps it might be more appropriate to discuss it at that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of full-time agency workers, I met representatives of a company last night and the only comparable, full-time employee in the company has been working for it for 15 years.  What should employers or agencies do in such circumstances?  I apologise for giving the Minister of State a migraine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendment which has been ruled out of order seeks to move beyond the scope of the requirements contained in the directive.  The directive seeks only to set a floor of entitlements in respect of basic working and employment conditions.  Article 3.2 allows member states, in their national law, to determine the definition of pay, as well as other elements.  Under Article 5.4, member states are asked to specify whether elements such as pensions, sick pay, etc., are included in basic working and employment conditions.  Given the scope of the directive, this extends only to basic working and employment conditions.  It is not the Government&rsquo;s intention to move beyond either the spirit or intent of the directive, particularly at a time when we face such challenges in the labour market.</P>
        <P>I may be obliged to defer to the officials on Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s point.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, lines 41 to 43 and in page 8, lines 1 to 15, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1) For the purposes of this Act, an employee is a comparable employee in relation to an agency worker if&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) that employee&rsquo;s employer and the hirer of the agency worker is the same person,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) that employee and the agency worker work at the same place of work within the meaning of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 or, where that employee and the agency worker work or are required to work at different locations, their work is directed and supervised by the hirer from the same place, and</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>)(i) both that employee and the agency worker do the same work under the same or similar conditions or each is interchangeable with the other in relation to the work, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) no employee of the hirer of the agency worker is a comparable employee by reference to <i>subparagraph (i)</i> and the work done by that employee is the same or similar in nature to that done by the agency worker and any differences between the work done or the conditions under which it is done by each are of minor significance when viewed as a whole or occur with such irregularity as not to be significant.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to focus on amendment No. 8.  If we do not pass it, there is a danger that, as a result of the doubts expressed, further disputes and differences will arise and that there will be a need for more conciliation, arbitration and court cases.  Amendment No. 8 states the hirer company should pick the comparator.  I love that word.  I had not heard it previously, but I accept that it may be a common legal term.  If we are to avoid disputes in the future, we must find a way to decide what the comparator will be in order to determine which particular agency workers should be paid.  In each case either the union representing an agency worker or the worker will indicate what the comparator should be, whereas the hirer company will state it should be something else.  Successive disputes will occur as a result.  Amendment No. 8 stipulates that the hirer company should choose the comparator and indicate the going rate which should apply.  The company would be obliged to have solid grounds for its decision.  If the position remains vague, court cases will arise and people will be forced into conciliation, arbitration, etc.  The provision would be much clearer if the amendment was accepted.  Of the three amendments in this group, amendment No. 8 is the one about which I am really concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 4 has been designed to bring additional clarity to the position on agency workers.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>)(i) states &ldquo;that employee and the agency worker do the same work under the same or similar conditions or each is interchangeable with the other in relation to the work&rdquo;.  If they are interchangeable, this obviously means that they should possess equal skills.  Senator Feargal Quinn is absolutely correct in stating the more ambiguity there is in respect of the comparator, the more likely it is that disputes will occur.</P>
        <P>International and other companies often engage agency workers because their services may only be required in the short term.  If companies take on such workers, it removes from them the burden of carrying out additional administrative work.  Agency workers may also be taken on as a result of the competitiveness issue.  This matter has been raised with me by a number of companies which employ people on a permanent basis to do particular jobs.  These individuals would obviously have developed certain skills over time and, therefore, their productivity levels are such that they warrant the rates of pay they receive.  In the early stages of being employed those engaged to do work on a temporary basis will only be learning the relevant processes.  In many instances, their output will not compare with that of their permanent counterparts.  As a consequence, it is not unjust that the rates of pay they attract are lower.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I might draw a comparison with the public service in this regard.  An incremental pay scale based on seniority applies in the public service.  This is defective, but I accept that it has grown up over time and recognise that it involves the principle that people improve with experience.  That is an important factor in the context of the matter under discussion.</P>
        <P>The kernel of the issue is that the more we leave matters open to dispute, the more excuse there will be for people to appeal in respect of their rates of pay in order to have them increased.  As Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien rightly pointed out, if this leads to uncompetitiveness in particular companies, it will lead to decisions being made outside Ireland to move operations elsewhere.  I have spoken to representatives of companies which have resisted the transfer of <Col N="31"/>significant elements of their Irish operations to countries such as India.  In the context of the earlier amendments, other Senators tended to focus solely on workers and their conditions of employment.  That is fine when there is good economic development and growth and when the level of employment is high.  In current circumstances, however, we cannot afford to haemorrhage any more jobs.  That is the reason we tabled the amendments.  I ask the Minister of State to give further consideration to the matters to which I refer.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 8 attempts to ensure discretion to choose the comparator will rest with the employer in circumstances where more than one person is engaged in comparable work.  Under the amendment and in the same way which applies in respect of direct recruitment, an employer would be in a position to designate a rate of pay.  The agency worker would then be obliged to make a decision on whether he or she would be prepared to take up a position at that rate of pay.  In the context of the way in which we are transposing the directive via the legislation before the House, we seem to be creating circumstances where such a worker would be in a position to appeal the rate in question.  This would give rise to a subjective decision on the part of the Labour Court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not know how that would turn out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  My concern is that this could lead to a situation where companies would be obliged to cease operations which would lead to agency workers and permanent employees going on the dole.  If that proves to be the case, we will have done a bad day&rsquo;s work.  That is the nub of the issue.  Therefore, every precaution should be taken by means of provisions in the legislation to try to avoid the eventuality to which I refer.  As Senator Feargal Quinn stated, amendment No. 8 would be of assistance in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Having handed the Minister of State a nice puzzle to mull over, I do not propose to repeat myself.  I will, however, refer to the case of a company in north Dublin on the edge of the senior Minister&rsquo;s constituency.  A representative of the company which is American and has its headquarters in Columbus, Ohio was with me last evening.  As I stated, it operates a red, amber and green system.  In 2008-09 it was in danger of relocating to the Czech Republic.  At the time the managing director took the difficult decision to make 50 permanent workers redundant and introduce an extremely lean cost structure.  He outsourced the human resources department to an agency and employed 50 permanent agency workers at a new rate.  The 50 permanent workers are earning approximately &euro;45,000, including PRSI, per annum, while the agency workers are earning around &euro;25,000 per annum, which equates to the salary the permanent workers earned when they started in the company some 15 years ago.  The managing director is extremely worried and the flag has already been raised in Ohio.  A meeting of the company&rsquo;s board will be held in April with a further meeting scheduled in October.  The issue will be flagged at the April meeting and a decision taken in October.  This is a major concern as the company is a multinational which has made a direct investment here.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated that jobs had not been lost in Britain as a result of the implementation of similar legislation.  Britain opted to seek a 12 week derogation.  I do not expect any job losses to occur for another year or 18 months.</P>
        <P>On Monday last I was in the United States meeting an extremely good customer to discuss a contract worth &euro;1.5 million which would be vital to my little company.  Senator Mary White will note with glee that I am competing with the Belgians.  I know precisely what the Belgians are charging the customer in question and the weight involved.  I have the beating of the Belgians, but I am very worried about this agency directive.  Perhaps I am a simpleton, but the manner in which our legislators have copied and pasted makes for convoluted legislation.  My <Col N="32"/>operations staff find the legislation unclear because it no longer reflects the EU directive.  The Government has made it more complicated and added new provisions in the Bill which will add costs to my company this summer.  As a result, we may no longer be competitive and I may not secure the contract to which I referred.  I will find out on 18 March if we have won it because I am recosting it this afternoon based on the provisions of the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin with the last point.  If the lights are flashing amber or red in Columbus, Ohio, and the company to which the Senator referred is IDA Ireland supported or other State agencies have been actively involved with it, I suggest the State agencies talk to representatives of the company.  The Senator should approach the State agencies to discuss potential difficulties the company may have.  Successive Governments have always taken a hands-on approach and intervened through the State agencies to try to assist individual companies.</P>
        <P>On Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s earlier point, where there is no comparable employee, the rate paid should be that which would be paid to a comparable direct employee.  If such were to employed, the rate would have regard to skills, qualifications and length of service under sections 3 and 7(3), which sets the clock to 5 December 2011 and allows the hirer to base the rate on the rates that applied on that date.  I hope that addresses the point raised by the Senator.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their amendments.  The Government understands the various circumstances Senators are trying to guard against with the amendments.  Amendment No. 4 seeks to amend the definition of &ldquo;comparable employee&rdquo; as contained in section 3.  Amendment No. 5 seeks to avert any attempt by agency workers to select the most advantageous possible comparable employee in a scenario where there may be more than one possible comparator in a hirer undertaking.  Amendment No. 8 seeks the ability for the hirer undertaking to designate one person as the comparable employee against which the agency worker would be measured for the purposes of equal treatment.  In the context of ministerial amendments made to the Bill during its passage through the D&aacute;il, the legislation already caters for the circumstance Senators are seeking to address.  In this connection, sections 3 and 7 must be read together.  The criteria in section 3 require that the employer of the agency worker and employee must be the same, the agency worker and employee must work at the same place and the work undertaken must be the same or similar in nature and be carried out under the same or similar conditions.</P>
        <P>Section 2 provides a further safeguard to avoid the selection of the most advantageous possible comparator, where it is a relevant factor, in the recruitment of direct employees, by providing that skills, qualifications and length of service are reckonable factors that a hirer can take into account.  These provisions all address in an appropriate manner the concerns of hirers and allow them to develop a robust defence in terms of the relevance or otherwise of the comparator selected.</P>
        <P>While I understand the concerns raised on the issue of the possible selection of inappropriate comparators, it is the case that there are instances, even in the civil and public service, where new entrants are taken on on less favourable terms and conditions than those that applied previously.  In this case, it is difficult to see how a successful challenge could be mounted by an agency worker in favour of the application of terms and conditions that applied previously.  For instance, new terms and conditions now apply to new recruits to the teaching and nursing professions, which would, therefore, be a logical benchmark for new agency workers being taken on.  It is inconceivable that a claim for equal treatment would succeed on the basis that an agency worker could claim that the previous terms and conditions of direct recruits should apply to him or her.  The Bill provides this certainty in so far as it can without unduly prejudicing the position of agency workers.</P><Col N="33"/>
        <P>On the basis that they are already catered for, a view supported by the Parliamentary Counsel, while I thank the Senators, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I feel as if I am going around in a circle with the Minister of State, for which I apologise, in that this amendment also addresses the issue of the comparable employee, to which he has already responded.  One can only imagine how business people are going to sort it out, given the conversations we are having on it.  It might appear simple to the Minister of State.  However, I do not know, given the lack of clarity on the issue, how I am going to explain it at a management meeting of my company this afternoon.  The only comparable employee in my company is a full-time worker who has been working with it for seven years.  As I understand it, the legislation, as drafted, provides that the agency worker, rather than me, as hirer, will have the right to make the comparison.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien on this issue, about which I, too, have strong concerns.  I hope I will not repeat anything the Senator said.  </P>
        <P>During the Celtic tiger years high rates were paid to employees.  We should be providing in this legislation that an agency worker be paid what a new employee would be paid.  Instead, there is a doubt in terms of employers having to consider whether they should pay the rate of pay applicable to employees of the company hired during the Celtic tiger years or that paid to new employees which may be lower.  The Minister of State used the analogy of a teacher and the new conditions applicable in the education sector.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 7 attempts to address the issue by providing that where an agency worker is making a claim, he or she would be paid at the rate paid to a new employee.  I sympathise with Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien in this regard.  As stated by her, an agency worker will under the legislation have the right to be paid the same rate as a person employed by a company for the past ten years at a higher rate, based on increments and other payments since taking up employment in, say, 2002, rather than at the new rate for the job in question which has been set at a lower rate.  Businesses in Ireland will not be able to compete if they are tied to the rates they paid five years ago.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien has stated that if her company were to take on 100 employees for a few months to fulfil a contract received from abroad, it would have to pay them the same rate as that paid to employees taken on five or six years ago.  This is a flaw in the legislation and the matter needs to be addressed today.  If not, the Minister of State should undertake to reconsider it before Report Stage.  I hope he will accept the argument being made.  This will affect our ability to attract foreign direct investment and tie our hands in competing within Europe and with the rest of the world.  We should not be imposing on entrepreneurs, the creators of wealth and employers conditions not imposed on businesses in other parts of the world.  Acceptance of the amendments would allow us to pay current rates rather than the ones paid five or six years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The case for what we are trying to achieve has been well made by Senators Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien and Feargal Quinn.  As has been said, we are seeking to provide <Col N="35"/>that agency workers would be entitled to the same conditions and terms of employment as a person directly recruited by a company today.  I recall what the Minister had to say about teachers when in the House for the debate on Second Stage.  I accept that it is in order for the Government to set new rates for new teachers whose position differs from that of others who have been teaching for a number of years.  If that principle is accepted, I urge the Minister of State to take on board amendments Nos. 6 and 7 which adopt the same principle.  </P>
        <P>The amendments, as I read them, conform fully with the terms of the directive, Article 5.1 of which states the basic working and employment conditions of temporary agency workers for the duration of their assignment at a user undertaking shall be at least those that would apply if they had been recruited directly by the undertaking to occupy the same job.  Obviously, this has to be considered in the current context.  Our main argument about the drafting of the legislation is that it moves beyond the terms of the directive.  We see real dangers as a result in today&rsquo;s vulnerable and fragile employment market.  We are, therefore, asking the Minister of State to conform precisely with the terms of the directive and not move beyond them.  I hope he is prepared to take this request on board.  I had intended to press the amendment, but if the Minister of State is prepared, as suggested by Senator Feargal Quinn, to reconsider the issue before Report Stage, I will be happy not to do so.  Ultimately, our only objective is to ensure the legislation is shaped in a manner which will do the minimal amount of damage to the jobs market.</P>
        <P>The explanatory memorandum refers to derogations.  Will this legislation, when enacted, pose a threat to jobs in particular industries and the retention of particular companies in Ireland such as those mentioned by Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, of which the Minister and others have been made aware?  Am I correct from my reading of the explanatory memorandum in thinking unions at local level, or employees and their representatives, and companies may agree to do something to protect themselves and jobs which may vary the derogation process?  Would this be acceptable and conform with the legislation?  Would it be possible to do this at local rather than central level, where previously large employers engaged in anti-competitive practices in collusion with the unions?  Unfortunately, that is what social partnership ended up doing in latter years.</P>
        <P>My final question goes back to the Minister of State&rsquo;s earlier comment on amendment No. 1 with regard to jobs.  The Minister of State said he had quite good regard for the economist, Mr. Jim Power, and I would ask for some clarity on the jobs issue.  From his answer I was unsure whether the Minister of State indicated there would not be job losses as a result of this legislation, that he was unsure whether there would be job losses or that there would be job losses.  That is the core of what is motivating many contributions and amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join previous speakers in asking the Minister of State to consider this amendment, which is at the core of the problem.  Perhaps he has indicated that there is light at the end of the tunnel in that the State has been able to bring in people doing the same job on lower rates of pay.  It seems illogical and inconceivable that a company employing agency workers would have to pay people a rate higher than the current going rate if the people were hired directly.  This is where there is a potential to lose jobs.  If companies must pay agency workers at a significantly higher rate to comply with legislation, jobs will be lost in such a situation.  We must do everything possible to protect businesses throughout the country.  I know figures are possibly being plucked from the air and there is a certain amount of scaremongering about how many jobs will be lost.  There is a potential to lose some jobs, and any loss of jobs would be undesirable.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State consider the issue to see if a position similar to that taken by the State can be achieved?  It should be possible to hire people on a rate of pay which reflects our <Col N="36"/>current economic position, with agency workers paid at the rate that would apply right now if the company was to hire a direct employee and put them into employment.  I know the passion with which people who are currently employers have spoken on the issue, and it is worth considering.  Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien mentioned some companies and I am aware of their position and very real concerns.</P>
        <P>I urge Senators not to press this amendment to a vote to allow the Minister of State can to consider it further to see whether we can, in some way, bring about a position where the comparator can be with an employee hired in today&rsquo;s economic climate at today&rsquo;s rate.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Mullins who has fully briefed himself on the issues involved in the legislation.  This does not fit in with the Minister&rsquo;s action plan for jobs.  Is the Minister of State indicating that legislation should decide for a person seeking a job what the comparator should be?  That does not make sense.  In essence, the Government is determining that a hirer will not decide this issue for a person who is unemployed and seeking a job.  This is the worst legislation I have seen coming to this House and we should freeze it, consider it and revert to the Minister.  It is interpretation of an EU directive gone mad.  We talk about creating employment but another part of the Department is doing the opposite.  Does the Minister of State believe the unemployed people who are looking for jobs will thank him for this?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Grey areas and a lack of clarity have appeared this morning.  I second Senator White&rsquo;s proposal to pause this for a little longer in order that the Minister of State would have the time to consider the position.  He made an extremely good suggestion for me to go back to my three real company stories, and with all due respect, I make the same suggestion to the Minister of State.  He should go to some of the brilliant people in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, who I know very well, and ask them to carry out some focus group tasks in order that he does not have to listen to just one mad, passionate Senator.  I am only a novice in here but it might be a good idea to slow this process a bit.  As we have said, there is nothing more important than getting this right, as we are broke, in order that we are able to create jobs.  Sometimes in my company the engineers might fold their arms and tell me something cannot be done.  I call these people job prevention officers, JPOs, as a joke, and Senators or Deputies do not want to become job prevention officers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, Walsh and White have made very strong points.  I believe the Minister of State will have to go back to the D&aacute;il with this legislation if we accept his amendment No. 12.  On that basis I urge the Minister of State to indicate that he has been impressed by the case made here and will give it some thought so that, on Report Stage, I hope he will be able to accept some of the concerns expressed here.  I urge Senators not to press this to a vote in order that it can be considered on Report Stage.  It will have to return to the D&aacute;il anyway.  I could understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s reluctance to follow this process if the legislation did not have to return to the D&aacute;il, but as it does, it would be simpler to go back with a Bill that has been tweaked with these amendments.</P>

	<P>There have been a number of points.  I suppose now would be a bad time to say I am a big fan of Neuhaus Belgian chocolates.

	<P>That is fantastic.  In fairness, one must applaud the business model used by two of the Senators present and the fact that the two businesses compete at a world class level.  I am acknowledging this without pl&aacute;m&aacute;s.  I lived in Belgium for three years and I always thought Cadbury&rsquo;s was the only chocolate product until I moved to Belgium.  We can now appreciate where we are with the wonderful product ranges and the high quality of those products.</P>
        <P>Collective agreements are addressed in section 8 and the possibility is allowed for in that section of concluding local and enterprise level agreements.  The fundamental point of the legislation concerns transposition of a directive and protection of workers&rsquo; rights.  The question is what a person should be paid now.  There is no question of referring or reverting to old pay rates.  This does not arise.  Where does the Bill mention reverting to old pay rates?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>One must always have regard to what is said in the Seanad on legislation.  I accept the points made about trying to revisit the issues involved before Report Stage.  However, there was a consultation process on the legislation dating back to 2010; therefore, it is not a case of the Government trying to ram it through.  The consultation process involved the social partners and, in fairness, the Minister took all views on board.  However, we are working within the limitations of the directive which was agreed at EU level by all member states.  It is arguable that no further consultation is required because there has been full engagement.</P><Col N="38"/>
        <P>With regard to measuring the potential job losses, Senator Jim Walsh, with all due respect, is a member of Fianna F&aacute;il which was in power for the past decade.  To ask a Minister whether there will or will not be job losses and quantify the rate at which job losses will occur is a little like asking how long is a piece of string.  We do not know.</P>
        <P>I accept the point made by Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien about the derogation period in the United Kingdom.  It has only been in place for the last three months, but as of today there is no evidence of job losses.  There might be some, but that is not based on information to me from the State agencies or stakeholders such as IBEC and others.  One cannot measure exactly whether there will be job losses or whether there will be no change to employment structures as a consequence of this legislation.  Bear in mind that its purpose is implementation of the directive and that we have obligations in terms of adherence to EU law.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 6 and 7, the requirement in the directive is that agency workers enjoy at least the same basic and working conditions that they would enjoy if they had been directly recruited by the hirer to do the same job.  Section 7 aims to remain faithful, as we are bound to be, to the wording of the directive and, therefore, provides for two separate and distinct possibilities.  The first, in section 7(1)(<i>a</i>), provides for a situation where there is already in existence a comparable employee.  In this instance, close regard must be had also to section 3 which defines the criteria for establishing a comparable employee.  The criteria set down are very specific and cumulative and, in that sense, do not allow a broad interpretation to be make of a comparable employee.</P>
        <P>Separately, section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) provides for instances where there is no comparable employee, in which case the terms and conditions applicable will be the same as those to which a comparable employee would, if directly employed, be entitled.  This is compliant with the directive requirement.  It is not possible to move beyond this, as the amendments seek to do, and introduce conditionality, effectively a watering down of the provisions, as proposed, because we would run the risk of falling foul of the directive requirements.  As in the case of section 7(1)(<i>a</i>), this provision must be read in conjunction with section 3.</P>
        <P>A further amendment brought forward to assist with legal certainty on the issue is that contained in section 7(3) which provides that in respect of agency workers on assignment prior to 5 December 2011, although the assignment may end after that date, the effective date for the purpose of establishing equal treatment is 5 December 2011.  The Parliamentary Counsel has advised that the directive wording does not facilitate the inclusion of the conditionality proposed in the text of the Bill.  In this regard, we have travelled as far as we can legally with the safeguards contained in sections 3 and 7(3) which are designed to assist in the proper implementation of the provision.</P>
        <P>In the proposed amendment to section 7(2) Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien is, in effect, proposing a deeming provision to certify that an employer would be deemed to have conferred the entitlements of equal treatment on an agency worker where it was demonstrated that these were at least the same as those applicable to a comparable employee.  While understanding the rationale for the amendment, I am advised that such a provision is extraneous and not necessary.  In instances where there are comparable employees alongside agency workers it will in practice be the case that employers will seek to demonstrate that equal treatment between agency workers and comparable employees applies.  This will be useful in providing evidential proof.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and the clarification he has provided.  I appreciate his honest answer which I accept, that he does not know what the likely job losses will be and that there is no evidence in Britain of job losses.  Was any evaluation carried out or research undertaken by the Department or the Minister on the possible implications of enacting the legislation?</P>
        <P>My second question is about the consultation process.  The Minister said he had met the social partners.  What companies did he meet?  Did he meet representatives of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to discuss the implications of the legislation?  What was involved in the consultation process and how extensive was it?</P>
        <P>Third, for absolute clarity, is the Minister of State saying with regard to the amendments &mdash; the amendment we have tabled has been drafted in accordance with Article 5.1 of the directive &mdash; that he will look at it again before Report Stage or that he will not re-examine it?  That will determine whether we will call a vote on it.  I would like to think he would see some merit in at least re-examining it before Report Stage.  As it is in accordance with the directive, his earlier answer that he could not accept it because it would not be in compliance with the directive is not accurate.  I do not know whether he made that comment with regard to amendment No. 6 or No. 7.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>

	<P>Will the Minister of State indicate what representations were made by each of these bodies during the consultation process?  How many would have endorsed the shape of the legislation, and how many would have sought to amend it?  I appreciate that it is our call as to whether we press the vote on amendment No. 7, but our decision is contingent upon the Minister of State entertaining the case made by Members from all sides of the House, including those on his own, and considering it or not between now and Report Stage.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I will withdraw it but I have a question.  During the wretched years of 2008 and 2009, when everything came crashing down and the unemployment numbers started to rise to the current horrific level, how many people in permanent jobs were made redundant in order that companies would become lean and competitive and survive, and how many were taken back as temporary agency workers?  The three companies of which I have <Col N="40"/>spoken, one a meat company in County Kildare, one a multinational located in both Galway and Kildare, and the other in north Dublin, all made permanent staff redundant, which they did not want to do, and then took on agency workers on a permanent basis in order that they could compete on the world stage.  It is a question for us to consider.  We felt a bit better because the companies got a few jobs back, but they did so in order that they could become competitive.  It is so difficult in this House to feel what it is like to be in business and be worried, like I was because my house was mortgaged on my business.  I had to let go ten of my friends who had worked for me for 16 years and take on temporary staff eventually in order that I could continue to survive.</P>

We hope this will bring clarity so that no other extraneous terms and conditions are brought into the legislation.  The <Col N="42"/>Minister of State may argue that it is already covered by virtue of the fact that it is not included, but I think by inserting these words, we bring greater clarity to it.</P>
        <P>In amendment No. 15, we seek to insert the following subsection: &ldquo;No action taken by a hirer undertaking or agency in compliance with this section should be taken as evidence that a direct employment relationship exists between the hirer undertaking and the agency worker.&rdquo;  Again, we seek to bring absolute clarity to the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a complex Bill.  As Members have said, employers often may not have legal expertise within the company to interpret precisely what is meant by legislation, and I think our amendments show clearly the intention of the Bill in order that it does not act as an impediment to taking on staff.  That is very important.  The more employment legislation we heap onto the private sector, the more I hear of hesitation and reluctance on the part of employers to embrace all these regulations and obligations.  I think it would be worthwhile, therefore, to include these amendments as they would bring greater clarity to the legislation, even if some regard them as unnecessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the rationale behind these amendments.  The provision as it stands, however, lists the facilities and amenities intended.  While the list is not exhaustive, it is not intended that collective facilities and amenities would include remuneration or expenses.  There is a danger in introducing one proposed exclusion as to do so would raise other issues that could be equally proposed for exclusion.  This type of detail is more appropriate for inclusion in guidance documentation on the Bill in preparation in my Department.  For this reason, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 14.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 15, it is not suggested in the legislation nor would it be legally possible under the Bill that an agency worker could contend that there is any employment relationship between the hirer and the worker on the basis that the latter now has an entitlement to use any collective facilities in the same manner as direct employees.  The definitions make clear there is a three way relationship and the employer of the agency worker is the employment agency.  In that sense, the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On amendment No. 14, I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation and accept that if one is prescriptive in what one excludes, it could be subsequently interpreted that matters which were not prescribed could be included.  On that basis I will withdraw the amendment.  However, I am not as favourably disposed towards withdrawing amendment No. 15, which would bring clarity to the position.  While I am not contradicting the Minister of State, the addition of the amendment would not take away from the Bill but would provide additional clarification.  The primary purpose of the amendment is to increase awareness for employers.  Anybody who understands English will understand the text and, as such, the proposal would not act as an impediment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am hearing from employers, as I am sure the Minister of State is, that the large number of regulatory agreements, for instance, joint labour committees, are adding to the dole queues, even if I cannot quantify the numbers.  They are being resisted by employers.  As I indicated on Second Stage, I can identify employers who recruited people who would have been happy to work for the proposed rates of pay but decided not to proceed with the recruitment as they believed they would be open to a case being taken against them subsequently.  It is unconscionable for the State to act in this way in the current economic climate.  Unfortunately, the jobs of everyone in the public service, except politicians, are guaranteed whereas in the private sector nobody&rsquo;s job is guaranteed.  We must be conscious of this in the current climate.  I am disappointed to hear rhetoric from the Government.  When it comes to testing matters in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, the Government does not show any empathy towards the unemployed and is not making any attempt to tackle unemployment.</P><Col N="43"/>

	<P>On amendment No. 15, the guidance document could clarify the matters raised by Senator Walsh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State indicated the guidance document &ldquo;could&rdquo; provide clarification.  That is an appalling response.  Could he not at least state that the document will include clarification?  This is one of the difficulties I have with Ministers of State coming to the House.  In fairness to this Minister of State, I am sure his hands are tied by his senior Minister and he is not allowed to accept amendments in the House.  I am not making a specific point in <Col N="44"/>respect of the Minister of State as this practice has also occurred in the past, including when my party was in power.  The practice whereby Ministers of State come to the House to take legislation under instructions not to take amendments ties the hands of the House.  The import of amendment No. 15 is purely for clarification yet we do not even have confirmation that the guidance document will include it.  We are asking that the amendment be included in the legislation.  That is a minimum request, which I and the Minister of State know does nothing to dilute the Bill.  It merely inserts clarification for a layperson reading the text who may want clarity on this issue.  That is all I ask.  It is a straightforward request.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="46"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I wish to raise an issue on behalf of the Irish Institute of Naturopathic Medicine, which is located in Colliga House in County Wicklow.  This is a European award winning centre that provides a range of services and specialises in the area of suicide prevention in particular.  We all know the importance of that area, given the high levels of suicide, especially among young people, in this country.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The institute was informed in 2006 by the HSE that approval had been received from the strategic policy and reform implementation unit for the provision of &euro;25,000 in funding, with funding of &euro;50,000 agreed for 2007.  The letter stated that this national funding would support the work of the institute, was intended to cover set-up costs, and would be made through the local health manager who would link with the institute on behalf of the HSE nationally.  The letter also stated that formal allocation would be issued soon, and that the person from the HSE named in the letter would be in a position to put in place a service level agreement for the national funding at that stage.  Unfortunately, this never happened and I would like to know why not.  I also request, even at this late stage, that a service level agreement be put in place with the institute for its suicide prevention centre.</P>
        <P>In 2011, the unit in County Wicklow intervened with 2,000 individuals.  It provides an early intervention service for individuals in the areas of suicide prevention, self harm, violence, addiction, mental health issues, domestic violence and autism in children.  The IINM provides outreach suicide prevention programmes to deprived and marginalised members of the community in Ireland.  In 2010, it was the overall winner of the ICNM European award for integrated medicine for suicide prevention.  Its aim is to meet the objectives of the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy for best outcomes for all of our citizens, as well as the reduction in the rate of death from suicide, hospitalisation, violence and dependency on welfare.  The focus of the programme is on intervention for prevention and treatment of self-aggressive disorders.  All referrals are done through a GP or a psychiatrist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I mentioned, the institute was approved for funding by the strategic policy and reform implementation unit of the HSE.  I ask that it be given State support to carry on the excellent work that it has been doing to date.  I have had very strong representations from many people who have a deep interest in suicide prevention in particular.  From what I have been told, the method of treatment provided by the institute is highly effective and reputable, and I am very anxious that it be considered for State assistance to carry on its very important work, especially with the significant number of people who have had suicidal tendencies or who have self-harmed in the past.  I ask the Minister of State to have a look at this.  I also hope to meet the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Lynch, on this issue in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, who has responsibility in this area.  I thank Senator Mullins for raising this issue today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Institute of Naturopathic Medicine treatment programme provides support and holistic based therapies in addiction, autism, mental health issues and so on.  Funding was provided for the institute in 2005 and again in 2007 to support its work.  These payments were once-off supports and no arrangement was entered into by the HSE to support the institute on an ongoing basis.  Since then, the HSE has supported some individuals who wished to access services provided by the institute.  However, it is clear that these supports were of a limited nature and specific to the individuals concerned.  Given the budgetary restrictions in more recent years, it is no longer possible for the HSE to offer financial support to individuals who may wish to access services at the institute.  The institute provides a range of alternative and <Col N="47"/>complementary therapies.  These therapies are not endorsed by the HSE, and the executive does not refer clients to the institute for treatment.  For that reason, there is no basis for the HSE to enter into a service level agreement with the institute.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In these extremely difficult financial times, it is necessary for the HSE mental health services across all regions to continually review the provision of services in an effort to maximise the balance of service access within the available resources.  I assure the House that the Government is committed to the development of mental health and suicide prevention services.  This commitment was clearly shown in budget 2012, which provided for a special allocation of &euro;35 million for mental health services in line with commitments in the programme for Government.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen the community mental health teams in both adult and children&rsquo;s mental health services.  Some of the funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and response to self-harm presentations, and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes which are being developed.  Three areas in particular will be prioritised in 2012: eating disorders, early intervention in psychosis, and suicide prevention.  A fundamental principle of early intervention for any health condition is that identification, diagnosis and treatment should occur as early as possible to maximise the likelihood that interventions will successfully minimise the burden of suffering.  By strengthening community mental health teams and enhancing the capacity of primary care to deal with people with mental health issues, I hope we will go a long way towards achieving that goal.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s additional commitment to mental health services, but I am disappointed with the response I have received.  The alternative therapies that are available are worthy of consideration for funding.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, my desire for a meeting with her and with a representative from the institute at an early date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is somewhat parochial, but I ask the Minister of State to outline the impact, if any, of the &euro;900,000 cutback that has been announced for Bantry General Hospital.  I have spoken to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, on the issue on a number of occasions and he is fully aware of the significance of Bantry hospital due to its geographic location.  It is on the list of unique small hospitals to be preserved and promoted.  I accept that there must be budgetary constraints across the board.</P>
        <P>The previous Minister, through the HSE, outlined a method of reconfiguration for Bantry hospital under which consultants from Kerry General Hospital, Tralee, Mercy University Hospital, Cork, or Cork University Hospital would attend every day.  As evidence of that, one consultant, who is a plastic surgeon, comes to Bantry once a month, which is great for the people of west Cork and south Kerry.  More of this should be done.  The reconfiguration plan is still in its infancy and should be rolled out more quickly.  This development was planned four or five years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I spoke to the Minister privately a few months ago, he said there was an ongoing review of small hospitals such as Bantry, possibly including such other hospitals as the Mid-<Col N="48"/>Western Regional Hospital, Nenagh, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Ennis and Letterkenny General Hospital, after which he would be making certain decisions.  The Minister of State may not know whether that review has been concluded.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by the fact that the Minister recently visited Bantry and that he has a grasp of the geographical difficulties we face in that area.  When I hear people in Dublin arguing about whether the new children&rsquo;s hospital, which we need, should be at the Mater hospital or in Tallaght or Crumlin, I think of a woman from the Beara Peninsula who had two very sick children and used to leave at 3 a.m. to get the first train to Dublin.  It would take her 24 hours to get here.  People from west Cork, Kerry or the remote parts of Donegal hear the arguments about where the children&rsquo;s hospital should be located.  If we had our choice it would probably be in Portlaoise or somewhere closer to home, but that is not going to happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a consultant surgeon post at Bantry hospital which is occupied on a temporary contract.  The gentleman concerned recently performed a minor operation on my own son, who had a hernia removed.  We chose to go to Bantry to support the hospital.  More than &euro;2.5 million has been spent on upgrading the surgical theatre there.  The surgeon&rsquo;s contract should be put on a firmer footing.  I have raised this concern before.  We have only one consultant surgeon, although we have consultants in other specialties.  If he were to go for any reason, the consultant anaesthetist would fall with him, as it were &mdash; they follow each other &mdash; which would have a knock-on effect on patients on the medical side of the hospital, where we have one of the best intensive care units in Ireland.  That is a concern I have.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s answer may not include this, but it is something she might convey to the Minister.  There should be at least a three-year contract.  GPs are telling me they do not know from month to month whether this person will go.  I think he is an African.  He is very good, but he is here on a temporary contract.  That uncertainty creates concern in the community, and many of the GPs are saying he, or somebody else, should be put on a three or five-year contract &mdash; something more definite &mdash; in the short or medium term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  We are all aware that the health sector is facing significant funding challenges this year.  However, the Minister is determined that the impact on services will be minimised by following best practice and through reform in the way services are delivered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The service plan for this year reflects the programme for Government commitments for health and the savings targets set out in the comprehensive expenditure report 2012-14.  With the scale of the financial challenge facing the HSE, there will be an inevitable and unavoidable reduction in services, but it will not be a straight line reduction.  Bantry General Hospital, similar to other acute hospitals, must face this challenge of reduced budgets and align its 2012 activity and services with the budget allocated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This year HSE South will continue its programme of reorganising acute hospital resources in Cork and Kerry to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients.  Bantry hospital is actively participating in the clinical programmes, which will enable the hospital to maximise activity while reducing overall cost.  These programmes provide a national, strategic and co-ordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Senator&rsquo;s query on bed closures, the HSE has informed the Department of Health that there are no plans to reduce bed capacity in Bantry hospital.  The hospital management is aware of the retirement or resignation of seven whole-time equivalent staff in the hospital this year.  Work has been under way since last autumn to prepare for this reduction, and the regional service plan of HSE South takes this into account.  Furthermore, HSE South <Col N="49"/>and the hospital management are seeking to mitigate the impact of the retirements on front-line services in a number of different ways.  These include using the public service agreement to bring about greater flexibility in work practices and rosters, redeployment and other changes to achieve more efficient delivery of services.  Some limited and targeted recruitment in priority areas will take place to help limit the impact of retirements on front-line services.  Examples include a theatre nurse manager to secure the surgery service and a senior medical scientist to ensure continuity of the laboratory service.  In response to the Senator&rsquo;s third query, hospital management is not aware of any other post that will be lost in the system at this time that may adversely affect the staff of the hospital.</P>
        <P>The role of services in Bantry will be progressed as part of the Government&rsquo;s national framework for the reorganisation of small hospitals.  In developing this framework the Government is clear that there is an important future role for smaller hospitals, in which they will provide services for more patients.  The framework is expected to be submitted to the Cabinet shortly.</P>
        <P>The main focus of the reorganisation of services at Bantry is the transfer of remaining complex surgery to Cork city, with a reciprocal transfer of day case surgery to Bantry.  Surgical and medical specialties will also transfer outpatient work to Bantry.  This will broaden the range of outreach services available to patients closer to home.  A dedicated patient transport service is due to be made available in Bantry from mid-April.  I hope this addresses the issues raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and the response is, by and large, positive.  I am not being political or parochial, but since I became a councillor in 1985 Bantry General Hospital has been the backbone of my reason for being in politics.  Even when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government I did not have a problem in challenging its current leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, or the former Minister Mary Harney on certain issues.  I continue to work for the sake of the hospital.  I spoke to the Minister and I am encouraged by the fact that he has visited the hospital, is aware of what is happening there and has a grasp of what is needed.  I look forward to positive outcomes for the hospital.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter in the Minister&rsquo;s absence.  I will be glad to convey the news that, despite the financial cutbacks, the loss of jobs will be insignificant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that will be the case.  The HSE has made a huge effort in ensuring cover to ensure services can continue, particularly in critical services.  The Government sees a strong future role for Bantry General Hospital.  The framework being developed for smaller hospitals is close to completion.  While some activities, particularly the more complex work, will be transferred, there will also be movement in the other direction, including day case surgery.  There is a strong and bright future for the hospital.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to discuss the issue of the plastic bag levy on biodegradable bags.  There is a difference between biodegradable and degradable plastic bags.</P>
        <P>On 4 March 2002 the Government introduced a levy on plastic carrier bags.   It was, primarily, an anti-litter initiative to positively change consumer habits.  It was a most welcome development.  I absolutely recommend that it remain in place.</P>
        <P>The first objective has been achieved, with fewer carrier bags being sold.  However, research has shown that paper bag use has increased extensively.  These have been proved to be even more damaging to the environment than plastic bags owing to the volume and cost of their <Col N="50"/>production.  For this reason, there have been calls from several environmental groups, including Friends of the Irish Environment, for paper bags to be incorporated in the levy.</P>
        <P>The paper bag production process causes 70% more atmospheric pollution and uses 300% more energy than comparable production of plastic bags.  The House recently debated the issue of energy and I ask the Minister to take this aspect into consideration.  Paper bags that have been laminated to make them weatherproof &mdash; they have a shiny finish and we all carry them home from the shops &mdash; are not subject to the levy.  They should be.  These paper bags are supplied free of charge in retail stores.  We should consider the damage they do to the environment and include them in the levy, as the legislation states bags made wholly or partly of plastic are liable to the levy.  It should not make a difference that a bag is lined with paper.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider making this type of bag subject to the levy, given the environmental damage this covering causes.</P>
        <P>Consumer purchasing habits are changing.  Research shows that the levy has affected the sale of plastic bin liners and nappy bags which has, in turn, added extensively to the amount of plastic going to landfill.  The sale of biodegradable plastic bags has also increased since the introduction of the levy.  The issue with this type of bag is that they can contain high levels of plastic.  There are no controls over the plastic content and they may take up to five years to degrade.  This aspect must be looked at.</P>
        <P>Through the introduction of brown wheelie bins for compost waste, the Government has given the general public an outlet to recycle food waste, but this has also raised serious issues.  Rodents, flies and odours are obvious immediate problems that the public faces.  However, there is also a hidden hygienic health and safety aspect.  The bins are seldom completely emptied.  When they are collected, the residue within them is a breeding ground for bacteria and flammable gases.  To help contain this problem, waste collection companies agree that lining a brown bin with a 100% compostable liner cuts back on a high percentage of these issues.  In fact, some companies now supply these liners to their customers free of charge.  I ask the Minister, in the next tender, to ensure all companies are asked to supply them free of charge.</P>
        <P>There is a difference between a biodegradable bag and a compostable bag, despite the fact that compostable bags are considered to be biodegradable.  The prefix &ldquo;bio&rdquo; should not be used when describing compostable bags, as they take only 12 weeks to break down.  They are made from corn starch and break down in composting environments by natural means into simple elements such as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.  They are totally environmentally friendly and should be free of a levy, which is what we are looking for.</P>
        <P>On 1 January 2011 Italy introduced a ban on all plastic carrier bags, following a report that showed Italian consumers were using more than 300 bags per person per year.  Stores in Italy are now only allowed to offer fully biodegradable, cloth or paper bags.  In Italy the fully biodegradable bags are actually compostable bags.  Standard biodegradable bags take up to five years to break down.  These are the ones that featured in the court case involving Dunnes Stores.  The type of plastic bag used for fruit and vegetables should be levied and they are covered by the legislation.  Similar bans have been imposed in France, Mexico City, Australia, South Africa and Taiwan.</P>
        <P>According to a recent EuroCommerce report, Ireland did not consider compostable bags when the levy was introduced.  The reason given was most probably that it would have been almost impossible at the time to determine the difference between a compostable bag and a plastic bag when waste was being collected.  The broader concept of sustainability was also not taken into account with regard to paper bags or the life cycle assessment, LCA, of compostable bags, according to the same report.  The segregation of compostable bags and plastic bags is no <Col N="51"/>longer a problem, as every household in Ireland has, or will soon have, access to a compostable collection facility, either by brown bin, self-drop system or composting in a home composting system.  The distinction between compostable and biodegradable bags must be made and reflected in legislation. They can be recognised instead as degradable.</P>
        <P>This would not mean a huge decrease in Government revenue, but it would be a huge positive step in protecting the environment.  The profit made by SMEs would be around &euro;4 million instead of a loss of around &euro;2 million.  We all know what jobs mean to SMEs.  These savings could be used to help businesses to continue trading and increase job opportunities within the industry.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider the proposal to remove the levy on compostable bags which are fully degradable in the light of the evidence which suggests it would be a logical move.  It would be environmentally friendly, energy saving and pro-job creation.  The technology is available to differentiate between bags that have no plastic content and those that have some.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, to which I am responding on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  </P>
        <P>Since its introduction on 4 March 2002 the plastic bag levy has been an outstanding success and instrumental in changing consumer behaviour in discouraging the use of plastic bags.  The levy applies to all bags made wholly or partly of plastic, subject to specific exemptions set out in the legislation, of which the most important is that plastic bags designed for reuse are exempt from the levy, provided the retailer charges at least 70 cent for the bag.</P>
        <P>The legislation does not distinguish between biodegradable plastic bags and other plastic bags.  Biodegradable bags still take a considerable time to degrade and while their use may be preferable in a final treatment or disposal, such bags will continue to have an environmental impact for a significant period.  One of the prime objectives of the levy is to influence consumers to change their shopping practice by encouraging the use of reusable shopping bags.  I am concerned that exempting biodegradable bags from the levy could encourage retailers to change from dispensing non-biodegradable bags to dispensing biodegradable bags, thereby failing to achieve any change in consumer behaviour in terms of reuse.</P>
        <P>In addition, there would be practical difficulties for consumers, retailers and enforcement agencies in distinguishing between biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastic bags.  One of the reasons for the success of the plastic bag levy is its simplicity.  If a bag contains plastic, then it is, subject to certain limited exemptions, leviable.  Local authorities are central to the enforcement of the levy through visiting retail outlets to carry out inspections.  While it is relatively simple for an enforcement officer to determine whether a bag contains plastic, it would be extremely difficult to ascertain in the course of an on-the-spot check whether that plastic was biodegradable.  Likewise, consumers who have generally been extremely supportive of the levy would not be able to tell whether the bag with which they had been supplied was biodegradable.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the plastic bag levy was primarily introduced as an anti-litter initiative.  Data from the national litter pollution monitoring system are used to measure the impact of measures such as the plastic bag levy on litter.  While plastic bags accounted for approximately 5% of litter arisings prior to the introduction of the levy, the most recent survey data, for 2010, show that they constituted approximately 0.25% of litter pollution nationally.  Biodegradable plastic bags may take up to five years to degrade and thus cause a visible litter problem, thereby undoing much of what has been achieved in removing the blight of plastic bag litter from Ireland&rsquo;s landscape.</P><Col N="52"/>
        <P>The plastic bag levy has been an outstanding success in reducing litter and changing consumer behaviour from the use of single-use bags to reusable bags.  A national survey of the environment in 2003 indicated that 90% of shoppers were using reusable or long-life bags.  Therefore, in the interests of maintaining the simple and effective levy system in place, it is not proposed to exclude biodegradable plastic bags from the levy.</P>

	<P>I agree with much of what the Minister of State said, but it entirely missed the point of what I am trying to achieve.  To clarify, I am totally in favour of the plastic bag levy.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s main point was that it would be impossible to distinguish between a biodegradable and a non-degradable bag.  That is like saying it is impossible to ascertain how much lead is in diesel.  All I am asking is that legislation be introduced to allow for the inclusion of a symbol &mdash;  a red triangle, for example &mdash; on plastic bags that are degradable in 12 weeks.  I am fully supportive of the retention of the levy on biodegradable bags because there is plastic in them.  However, new technologies have been developed which have vastly improved the timeframe for biodegradability.  The inclusion of a symbol such as a red triangle would inform consumers of this.  In the longer term these are the only plastic bags which should be permitted to be sold.  It has been done in Italy and there is no reason it cannot be done here.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for responding to this Adjournment matter.  My objective is to ascertain the total amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money invested in the necessary and most welcome upgrading of public wastewater treatment plants in recent years.  This feeds into the current debate on private wastewater treatment systems, the owners of which the Government seems determined to oblige to replace them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any Revenue worker will say it is possible to impose a tax or levy on people so long as it is deemed to be fair and equitable.  The issue in this case, as I am sure the Minister of State&rsquo;s figures will show, is that billions of euro were spent in upgrading wastewater treatment plants in Dublin and in towns and villages throughout the State at no cost to many of the individuals who benefited from the upgrades.  Levies were imposed on developments when the developers applied for planning permission and that money met some of the cost of upgrading water treatments plants.  However, for householders in Merrion Square and elsewhere in Dublin, any future upgrading required at Poolbeg, for instance, will not involve any charge.  At the same time, taxpayers in County Kerry who receive no benefit from the service are paying for the upgrade of the facility at Poolbeg through their taxes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Government does not put in place a grants system for the upgrading of wastewater treatment facilities for private householders, there will be a significant inequity within the system.  Billions of euro have been invested in upgrading the public system at no cost to those who use it because it is the right thing to do.  Any facility that does not meet the required environmental standards must be upgraded, about which there is no argument.  However, considerably more is being asked of people with private waste water treatment facilities which were installed in accordance with the regulations at the time and at the owner&rsquo;s cost.  The Government has now changed the rules and is insisting on these facilities being upgraded to meet new standards.  I agree that where water quality is not as it should be, there is an obligation to upgrade water treatment systems to meet modern standards.  However, the owners of these facilities should be given the same treatment as people living in Dublin.</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P>The Government is meeting fierce resistance on this issue because people can see how inequitable it is.  If a person in County Kerry has a system that is not working, it is only right that he or she should be required to upgrade it.  However, while taxpayers fund the bill for the upgrading of public systems, the individual is expected to bear the cost in rural areas.  That is where the Revenue Commissioners tell the Cabinet that unless a charge or levy is equitable and fair, it will not have the support of the people.  Rural householders are entitled to grant assistance to help them in meeting the required standards.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P>I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for providing me with an opportunity to outline the improvements made in the area of wastewater treatment in the past 15 years.  More than &euro;6 billion in Exchequer resources has been invested in water services infrastructure since the early 1990s, with more than &euro;5 billion of that spent in the past decade and a half.  The focus of this investment has been on ensuring compliance with the European Union directives on both drinking water standards and urban wastewater discharges and improving water supply to keep pace with population and economic needs.  Annual Exchequer funding for wastewater infrastructure has risen steadily since 1997, at which stage &euro;116 million out of a total of &euro;181 million was spent on wastewater services, to &euro;220 million out of almost &euro;350 million of Exchequer funding in 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some &euro;3.7 billion, or 71%, of the overall &euro;6 billion has related to wastewater infrastructure investment.  Compliance with the EU urban wastewater directive has been a key driver of investment during this period, as well as the need to respond to the requirements of population growth and the needs of industry.  There are 482 agglomerations with a population greater than or equal to 500, with the two largest treatment plants in Dublin and Cork representing 55% of all public wastewater discharges from these agglomerations.  In the period 2000 to date, 341 wastewater treatment schemes and contracts have been completed.  This has led to an increase in treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of almost 3.9 million.  Some 1,250 km of sewer network have been constructed and almost 160 km of the existing network rehabilitated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is approximately 93% compliant with the 2005 deadline relating to the EU urban wastewater treatment directive, which requires secondary treatment for discharges from agglomerations above certain specified size thresholds.  This compares with a compliance rate of 25% in 2000.  Current investment plans under the water services investment plan 2010-12 will lead to the necessary infrastructure for secondary treatment in larger agglomerations being put in place by 2015.  The monitoring of the effluents discharged by wastewater treatment plants falls under the control of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The report of the agency for the period 2008 to 2009 was published recently.  While it indicates improvements in performance and compliance since the previous report, its findings indicate a need for further and more comprehensive improvement in operational performance.  It also highlights the need for continued investment in wastewater treatment infrastructure.  The EPA has listed a number of areas in which secondary treatment or secondary treatment with nutrient reduction are still required and all of these locations are included in the current water services investment programme, with contracts under way or schemes in planning with a view to completion by 2015 at the latest.</P>
        <P>The combination of investment, licensing and supervision of the sector is having a positive effect.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to work with local authorities and the EPA to ensure the investment made, combined with a continuous improvement in operations, leads to sustained improvements in compliance with standards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.  I accept that she may not have the relevant information in her possession, but I was under the impression that the EPA had indicated that 50% of current public waste water treatment units needed to be upgraded.  This is an astonishing figure.  I am somewhat confused by the fact that the report to which the Minister of State referred indicates a compliance rate of 93% in respect of the 2005 deadline.  There is obviously a slight difference between these two figures.  I would appreciate if it the Minister of State provided further information on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will certainly ask the Department to communicate further with the Senator on the matter.  However, I must take issue with him on the points he made on what was happening in the Dublin area.  It is easy for people outside the capital to point the finger and state that Dublin gets everything.  When one considers the figures, it is obvious that this is not the case.  In that context, one could highlight the significantly higher level of investment in road projects, schools, health services, etc., outside the greater Dublin area.  If one is determined to discuss these issues, one must compare like with like.</P>
