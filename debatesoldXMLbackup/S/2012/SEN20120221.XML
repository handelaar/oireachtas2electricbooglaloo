	<P Just="Left">I have received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to outline the future of the Bantry Harbour board, to confirm that there are no plans to amalgamate the Bantry port authority with that of Cork Port and if he will advise if there is any proposal to amend the jurisdiction of the Bantry Harbour board geographical area as it currently stands.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jim Walsh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to advise if he would be disposed to reopening the embassy to the Vatican on a co-location basis, with Villa Spada suitably subdivided, including separate access, address, etc., and if the Government is so prepared, whether this information has been conveyed to the Holy See.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2011 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 5.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply to the debate not later than 5.35 p.m.;  No. 2, Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee  Stage (resumed), to be taken at 6 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m., if not previously concluded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I told the House last week, a discussion on the EU fiscal compact treaty will be held on Wednesday, 14 March.  The only business I propose to take on that day will be Private Members&rsquo; time that evening.  Similar to the discussion on the action plan for jobs 2012, every Senator will be given five minutes speaking time to put forward his or her views on the subject.  To assist in the preparation for this discussion, a briefing by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service will be provided in the audio-visual room on Thursday, 8 March at 1.30 p.m.  I encourage all Members to attend this briefing.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P Just="Left">I am giving Members advance notice that we will take the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill &mdash; Second Stage on Tuesday next and Committee Stage on Thursday, 1 March.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for taking on board the views of the leaders of the groups on the debate on the fiscal compact.  I hope Members will take up the opportunity to attend the briefing meeting to be provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service in the week before the debate.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to consider extending the five minutes afforded to Senators on certain debates, if fewer Senators are offering and those who are contributing would like to speak for longer.  I agree with the Leader on the functioning of the Seanad and that time is important, but perhaps we should consider the numbers offering to determine the allocation of time.  We can perform a very important function in regard to the fiscal compact.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Government for the recent visit of Vice President Xi Jinping from China.  His visit was a success and it will help us to build our relationships with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.  To give credit where it is due, the Government performed very well over those few days, particularly in regard to agriculture.  We had a good debate on food and horticulture in this House last week with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and we must look at ways to expand our newer markets.  China will be very important.  I am pleased the Government, in its own way, confirmed that it did raise issues in regard to human rights.  I am taking the Ministers at their word and I have no reason not to do so.</P>
        <P>On 28 September 2011, the Keane report was published.  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, who took the debate in the Chamber promised to publish a full mortgage arrears implementation strategy in advance of the budget of 6 December, but that did not happen.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said it would be done before Christmas, but that deadline has not been met.  The Government&rsquo;s response so far is to publish the personal insolvency Bill which will help in some instances.  The fundamental flaw in that Bill is that it leaves the power and the decision making with the banks.  It does not go as far as we want it to go, where we propose to set up a debt settlement office.  What the Government is proposing will leave the final decision with the banks who lent the money.</P>
        <P>All Senators will be concerned to note that more than 107,000 mortgages are in difficulty.  The figures are worse given that more than 7% of residential mortgages are in difficulty.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, to attend the House next week to update members on how the Government intends to deal with the mortgage arrears crisis.  The last figures introduced by the Central Bank show that one in ten mortgages is in difficulty whereas now it is one in seven.  We cannot wait for the publication and passage of the personal insolvency Bill which has been promised for the autumn.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State, who engages well with the House, to attend the House because the mortgage arrears crisis is getting worse and the personal insolvency Bill will not deal with the fundamental issues.  The Government is missing a step and I ask what it intends to do for those in mortgage arrears.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like Senator O&rsquo;Brien, I commend the Leader for the plan for a full debate on 14 March on the EU fiscal compact treaty.  I agree with the Senator that it would be useful for us, as group leaders, to ascertain in advance the number of speakers who wish to contribute and, if necessary, the timing can be tweaked.  It will be a useful debate.</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P Just="Left">On the mortgage arrears issue, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I and other Senators are members, finished conducting public hearings on the heads of the personal insolvency Bill.  Those hearings were very instructive in terms of recommendations as to how to improve the Bill, to offer greater protection for those struggling with mortgage arrears.  Tomorrow the joint committee will discuss a draft report which will be finalised next week.  It would be useful for us then to debate the report, and to have the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes attend the House as the appropriate Minister in the context of the findings of the joint committee.  We had the benefit of hearing from a wide range of groups and organisations, such as the Free Legal Advice Service centres and New Beginnings, which is working on a front-line basis with people who are struggling with mortgage repayments and mortgage arrears.  That would inform the debate.</P>
        <P>I have called before for a debate on the development of links with China and other countries in order that we can benefit from expanding our trade links.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Brien I was delighted the visit by the Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping went off well and I am sure the issue of human rights was raised with him and the delegation.  The unfortunate fallout was the extreme level of security and lack of press contact.  I accept some of the security was necessary but the entrance to Leinster House was blocked to staff and elected representatives while the Chinese delegation visited.  Some aspects of the security arrangements were, perhaps, unnecessary and should not have been put in place for this important visit.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Brien I hope we will see the benefit of the visit in terms of renewed links with China and improved conditions for human rights campaigners in China.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to clarify if the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill will take more than an hour.</P>
        <P>I focus my substantive question for the Leader on the new relationship Ireland is developing with China and echo the remarks of Senators O&rsquo;Brien and Bacik.  There is no doubt that Ireland&rsquo;s strengthening relationship with China will bring about important opportunities for trade and investment.  I was not the only one watching as events unfolded who felt proud to be Irish in view of what was happening in terms of the developing a relationship with the Chinese.</P>
        <P>In tandem with this development &mdash; Senator Bacik has touched on it &mdash; we must engage in a respectful and robust dialogue on human rights issues.  It is disappointing that Irish authorities did not raise individual cases of human rights abuses with the Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping during his visit.  It is not unusual to raise individual cases with other nation states in the context of diplomatic and trade negotiations.  There are often opportunities to make breakthroughs on individual cases that enable the release of certain prisoners.  For example, when the Chinese delegation met our President, a noted human rights activist and poet, I could not help but think of another human rights activist and poet, Liu Xiaobo.  He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.  He is currently imprisoned there since 2009 for inciting the subversion of State power.  As many Members are aware, religious expression is also widely curtailed in China.  Such activists, as well as democracy activists and reformers, are often repressed.  Amnesty International has described human rights violation in China as staggering.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and I will get to it in a moment.  Human rights is a critical issue.  Ireland seeks election to the United Nations Human Rights Council.  As we put ourselves forward for that election UN member states will examine our dialogue with other countries. <Col N="4"/> The further development of our relationship with China is a prime opportunity to demonstrate our deftness as an honest broker and objective champion of human rights across the world.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste, or one of the other three Minsters that will travel to China later this year, to come here and have a debate on Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with China in the context of trade, investment and human rights.  One of the key roles of the Seanad is to debate such important matters in a non-partisan way and bring to the discussion our expertise from a range of sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I congratulate the Taoiseach on his knowledge of geography.  He has apparently discovered that Greece is not Ireland and that Ireland is not Greece and he is quite right.  Ireland did not build the Acropolis, the Parthenon, start the Olympic Games, invent geometry, give us the art of philosophy and I dare to mention Plato and Socrates, despite the fact that some insects from Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s grub street might take me to task for that.  The Greeks are Europeans and we need to stand in solidarity with them and to fight those institutions that corrupted them or helped them to corrupt themselves.  I think of the obscene collaboration of Goldman Sachs in cooking the books for which it got $600 million out of the Greek people.  We need to stand in solidarity with them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the light of what is going on here I ask my friends in government how will they look the ghost of James Connolly in the eye in 2016 when people are being denied palliative treatment for cancer and drugs that would save their lives.  That is the kind of question that needs to be asked.  Questions did need to be asked of Vice President Jinping.  Of course he should be welcomed and it was appropriate to treat him courteously because China is a great and ancient nation.  I heard Professor Jerusha McCormack explain the difference in its approach to human rights in a most fascinating way.  They consider it more important to serve the people rather than the individual but we put the rights on the individual.  There must be some coming together of these things.  We have betrayed our people all across Europe.  We have neglected the fact that there is an onus and primary responsibility, or a duty of care, on every government to its people.  I was ashamed, as an Irishman, that a single Tibetan was arrested because she had one little placard that read  &ldquo;Free Tibet&rdquo;.  She was arrested under section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act that states one cannot have any poster that is &ldquo;offensive, obscene or abusive&rdquo;.   What is offensive, abusive or obscene about freedom?  I do not understand the arrest.  An Irishwoman at the Cliffs of Moher, again a single individual, was denied the right to protest.</P>
        <P>I applaud Mr. Kenny&rsquo;s pursuit of trade but he should remember that it was Greece that gave us one other great benefit, democracy.  Yes, Greece had the courage to say no to Xerxes.  My distinguished college professor, Professor John Dillon, wrote an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>  stating that when the Greeks said &ldquo;No&rdquo; over 2,000 years ago to the bully Xerxes and half the states gave in, Athens and Sparta refused.  They defeated an overwhelmingly larger navy at the battle of Salamis.    They defeated Xerxes&rsquo;s army on land at Plataea.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the spirit of Europe.  That is what we should be celebrating in solidarity with the peoples of the Europe and not the institutions that are humbling and degrading us.</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to raise an issue that was doing the rounds in reports this morning in Sligo and Leitrim that the Teagasc office in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, is to close.   This purpose-built office was opened in the 1970s to give advice to farmers in the area.  Recently, staff from Teagasc&rsquo;s Sligo office were moved there and the office now employs six <Col N="5"/>people serving north Leitrim and north Sligo.  It would be a concern if the office was closed, as reports suggest, and staff moved to Ballymote or Mohill in south Leitrim.  We must do everything in our power to prevent this.  The Manorhamilton office hosts nightly discussion groups for beef farmers.  Now that farming is doing well, it is important these services are kept in place, particularly for young farmers.  We must do everything we can to ensure the Manorhamilton office remains open and the six jobs are kept there.  It would send out the wrong signal if it were to close.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader convey a message of support to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, to call a halt to the unchecked rape by the Faroe Islanders and Icelanders of the mackerel fishery?  Ireland has a mackerel quota of 70,000 to 80,000 tonnes but these two small island nations outside Europe are catching six times this per annum with no restrictions imposed by Europe.  When the Minister attends the European fisheries summit meeting soon, I urge him to convey in the strongest fashion to the EU Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries that this must be stopped.</P>
        <P>We condemned the Spaniards for years for overfishing.  These are two small islands on the periphery of Europe doing what they like with regard to the mackerel fishery.  While it is probably much more important to Donegal and the north west than to my area in the south west, mackerel is still, in financial terms, the most important quota to Irish fisherman.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue here three years ago.  I did not advert to it on the recent debate on the fishing industry and I am not asking that the Minister should attend the Seanad about it again.  However, will the Leader convey our support to the Minister to protect the Irish fishermen, and to a lesser extent their Scottish counterparts, from this overfishing?  If mackerel continue to be taken out by the Faroese and the Icelanders in an uncontrolled fashion, it will have severe repercussions on the mackerel fisheries for Irish fishermen.  It is just greed and wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Union, not Ireland, should stop it and control the waters within the Eunion's boundaries.  It is important it is done sooner rather than later because this overfishing will decimate and cause job losses in the Irish fishing industry.  I am not condemning the Minister, Deputy Coveney, but I urge the House to support him in calling for a halt to this overfishing and asking the European Commissioner responsible to intervene in this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join my colleagues who welcomed the successful visit by the Chinese Vice President.  From an economic perspective, it was a very successful visit from which Ireland will benefit.  So too will China because business is a two-way road.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also support my colleagues who expressed the view that we cannot remain silent or ignore the question of human rights abuses in China.  Members are aware of the situation in Tibet and some of us have also been in Taiwan, an issue that is not going to go away.  We must ensure the question of human rights in China remains on the international radar.  It is not our job to define what the broad spectrum of human rights should be in China.  That is a matter for the Chinese people and not simply the Chinese authorities.  We in this small country must not be silent on these basic universal human rights such as the right to life and the right to freedom of conscience and religion.</P>
        
        <P>While it is not something I normally do in the House, I must congratulate the Sinn F&eacute;in party for making its views known on and highlighting the issue of human rights in China at the weekend.  We must not remain silent when obvious difficult matters present themselves to us.  Perhaps rather than just speaking of the matter we could try to arrange a debate in the House on international human rights at some stage in the coming weeks.  While economics, trade and jobs are of considerable importance, fundamental human rights do matter also.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>This country has always had a strong record in that regard.  Perhaps it is time for us to renew some of the issues we have taken up heretofore.  There would be a strong all-party view on human rights.  The Seanad is the ideal place to have such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is with mixed feelings that I agree with Senator Bradford and previous speakers.  On the one hand I compliment the Government on the successful hosting of the Chinese Vice President.  I hope the visit will result in increased trade between this country and China.  Also on the jobs front we hear that it is likely that PayPal will announce 1,000 new jobs in Blanchardstown in the coming days, which is very welcome news, once again proving that international companies still see us an attractive place to do business and expand their operations.  It means the efforts of the Government and State agencies to create jobs are being recognised.</P>
        <P>However, it was to my utter dismay yesterday that I learned the Minister for Social Protection is determined to introduce changes to the sick pay scheme.  This was originally mooted in advance of December&rsquo;s budget but was not included in the budget.  Thank God, said I.  At that time I expressed my strong opposition to the measure and my position remains exactly the same.  Transferring the burden of the first month of sick pay to the employer rather than the State picking up the tab will result in job losses, especially among small indigenous businesses who are already struggling with commercial rates &mdash; to name only one cost which is pressing business owners to the edge of the collar at present.</P>
        <P>I am not opposed to the change for the sake of being populist, nor am I foolish enough to believe that reforms are not required in this area.  I can appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s point on larger companies in this country that run good sick pay schemes to the benefit of their employees already, as they can see the benefit to the company in the long term of having a healthy and happy workforce.  However, such schemes do not exist in smaller businesses for one reason, and one reason only; they are simply unaffordable.  If the Minister presses ahead and introduces these changes in next year&rsquo;s budget it will inevitably result in jobs being shed in small companies dotted around the country, as this additional cost will be the straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back.  I seek that the House would discuss the proposed changes as a matter of urgency to ensure that whatever reforms to sick pay are introduced are equally beneficial to business owners, employees and the State alike.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am sorry.  For the sake of clarity I checked with him on his presence last week.  I congratulate him on receiving an Irish Film Television Award for his film, &ldquo;Man on a Mission&rdquo;.  As my brother was a cameraman on the film, there is a joint celebration.</P><Col N="7"/>
        <P>The second issue I wish to raise with the Leader relates to Lifford Community Hospital.  An announcement was made on Friday that it would close with the loss of 20 beds in the community of Lifford and east Donegal.  I asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, when he was in the House last week whether he had an update on Lifford hospital.  He said he was not aware of any changes, but the HSE issued its report on Friday to say the hospital would close in three months, pending consultation with residents and families.  I ask the Leader about the possibility of raising the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a suitable matter for the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  If the matter could be raised on the Adjournment the Minister could clarify what will happen in three months time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach should excuse me if I seem a little disoriented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I first arrived in the Chamber I heard Senator Norris talking about the defeat of Xerxes at Thermopylae and then heard Senator O&rsquo;Donovan telling us that our fish had been taken by the Pharaohs.  I thought for one moment that I had strayed into a class on the classics, until I realised that he was referring to the Faroes, which are somewhat different to the ones who led the children of Israel into slavery.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is nonetheless some current relevance to this because Senator Norris was alluding to the fact that the Greeks raised an army of 300 men who stood shoulder to shoulder at Thermopylae and defeated 20,000 Persian intruders.  This is relevant to our current situation and I am not referring to any unpleasantness with Iran or anywhere else &mdash; I am referring to the health service.  It emerged in the newspapers today that there has been a 50% increase in the duration of waiting lists for patients who are awaiting day surgery.  Dr. Ronan Boland, who was one of the leaders of general practice in this country, has stated that any suggestion of shortening this is met with disbelief by GPs who are referring patients because the waiting lists are now up to four years to see an orthopaedic surgeon in his area.  Meanwhile, patients waiting for varicose vein surgery have had to wait six months.</P>
        <P>This is not the high end of a life-threatening crisis, but they are the little indicators of what is happening in the health service.  I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health something which I am sure he knows but to which he does not allude in public.  We have the smallest number of doctors per head of population for any specialty one cares to mention, and we have the longest waiting lists.  Please join up the dots.  It is not a shortage of bureaucrats that is causing our problem, it is a shortage of front line professionals.</P>
        <P>While I mean no disrespect to him, I read that Dr. Martin Connor is being hailed as the saviour of the situation.  This Leonidas of our small Spartan army of consultants is now only working part-time because he is spending half his time as a research fellow in Stanford University.  In drawing together the two strands of our conversation today, one can say that if the HSE had been in charge at Thermopylae the movie would not have been called &ldquo;300&rdquo;, it would have been called &ldquo;30&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to congratulate the Government on the success of the visit of the Chinese Vice President.  I welcome the trade agreements that have come from that visit.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy is based on reducing public debt, solving the banking crisis and creating jobs.  In that regard, I congratulate the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the IDA on today&rsquo;s announcement of 1,000 jobs for Dundalk.  The facility is based in Haggardstown and it is a red-letter day for this country when we have 1,000 jobs coming to the north east.  The IDA has told me that it is 2004 since it made such an announcement of 1,000 jobs.</P>

	<P>Last week, the Leader and I attended a meeting of community and voluntary organisations in Waterford city.  We heard at first hand the impact that cuts are having on many community organisations.  That has been quantified by a report, which was published by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, on downsizing the community sector.  It shows the true extent of those cuts.  While we have seen on average a 2.82% cut in public spending across the board, the community sector on average has seen a cut of 35% and by the end of 2013 we will see 11,000 more jobs lost in that sector.  It is not only about job losses, but the services that are being curtailed and will be lost, for example, meals on wheels for older people, community child care, youth work and drug prevention work, all of which are under threat because of cuts to funding.  The Leader was at that meeting where he heard from people who are benefiting from all the schemes provided by community development projects and voluntary organisations.  I ask him to arrange a debate to discuss this report.  It quantifies the cuts and shows in very stark terms the imbalance in how they are disproportionately affecting community and voluntary sector organisations, which are primarily aimed at disadvantaged communities.  This shows disadvantaged communities are suffering most from the cuts.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in order that we may discuss the importance of the community and voluntary sector.</P>

	<P>Does Senator O&rsquo;Brien mean that includes me?  I beg to differ on that.  I believe the Government should switch its e-mail and document services from expensive outdated servers to some sort of cloud-based system.  This proposal would save approximately &euro;10 million over five years, which incidentally is roughly the amount that would be saved by the abolition of the Seanad.  We should give serious consideration to this proposal.</P><Col N="9"/>
        <P Just="Left">I contacted Deputy Tom Hayes, the Chairman of the Joint Administration Committee, and I was told the committee would look at it.  Cloud computing would mean that we would save on software licences and energy cost overheads.  It would give us greater flexibility to create and edit documents outside the office, while also allowing us to set up e-mails in a more flexible way.  We are quite curtailed and Members who have an iPhone or BlackBerry will realise that it is subject to problems all the time.  Cloud computing would make it easier for us.  Denmark has already done this and said it had saved 70% of its Government&rsquo;s IT budget.  We need to embrace this.</P>

	<P>I wish to join others in congratulating the Government on the very professional handling of the visit to Ireland by the Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping.  It was a wonderful occasion and it will have long-term effects on trade.  A proposed trading hub for Chinese products in Athlone will create 2,500 jobs.  I hope that will go through.  The GAA played a very important role in welcoming the vice president, as was the case during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II.  The visit to Croke Park was important.  The GAA, as a major voluntary organisation, was to the fore in the role of job creation.</P>
        <P>This is just an observation, but let the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government note that the issue of registration charges for septic tanks has not gone away.  A meeting last night on this issue in Ballygar was well attended.  Rural dwellers are determined not to register until a grant scheme is put in place by the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan.  That is absolutely crucial and it obvious from the contributions that Fianna F&aacute;il has been leading the opposition to this issue.  I am now more convinced than ever that there will be a very low uptake on registration.  By registering a septic tank, one is allowing oneself to be assessed and processed.</P>

When one goes down that road one is inviting an inspection and the fact that one&rsquo;s septic tank may not be up to the standard being laid down by the Minister. </P>

	<P>I join colleagues on all sides in congratulating the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Government for the handling of the State visit of the Vice President of China at the weekend.  The visitors saw the country at its best.  I understand there was extensive television and media coverage of the visit throughout China and, hopefully, there will be enormous growth in trade and tourism as a result.  Senator Paul Bradford is correct.  It is appropriate that human rights issues would have been raised with the visitors and I understand that happened.  I agree that we should have a debate, as requested by Senator Bradford, on human rights issues throughout the world, at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Following on from the visit of Vice President Xi Jinping from China, the national jobs plan, announced last week, will drive the economy forward.  I welcome the regional dimension to the plan and congratulate Dundalk and Haggardstown on securing the 1,000 jobs announcement today.  I hope IDA Ireland will reach the 50% target of locating foreign direct investment into the regions outside Dublin and Cork.  I want to ensure that towns such as Ballinasloe, located in the centre of the country, which lost 1,000 industrial jobs being the next big location for foreign direct investment.  I congratulate the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, IDA Ireland and all associated with the major announcement for Dundalk.  We want many more of those job announcements.  That the Taoiseach is assuming responsibility for accountability in respect of the national jobs plan is welcome and, hopefully, this is the start of positive developments.</P>

	<P>I heard with interest the references to the classical world from other Senators.  As I listened to Senator John Crown refer to Leonidas I was glad neither Senator Mary White nor Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien were present to hear the rival produce placement.  <i>Horatius at the Bridge</i> did not spring to mind as I contemplated the meekness with which the T&aacute;naiste discussed Ireland&rsquo;s concern about human rights in China recently.  We are in a difficult position.  We have to be welcoming towards our guests &mdash; they were very welcome and we should try to forge whatever links we can &mdash; but that does not mean we must be silent about human rights abuses.  I support the call by Senator Zappone, Senator Bradford and others on the need for a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recall a few months ago when I brought forward a motion of gendercide, that is, the killing of young girls before and after birth particularly in India, China and in the Caucasus region, that the Government, in its amendment, saw fit to remove references to India and China and I wondered at the time whether that was about not frightening the horses.  Last week I related the story of Chen Guangcheng, a blind Chinese man and human rights activist, who had exposed the forced abortions taking place in parts of rural China and how he had suffered as a result.  The actor Christian Bale has showed much more courage than anybody in the Government so far in seeking to meet that man in order to highlight the sacrifice he is making for authentic human rights.</P>
        <P>The Government is right to put the best foot forward but it must find a way to be courageous in raising human rights abuses.  I was struck by the contrast between the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s meekness &mdash; the meek shall inherit the earth &mdash; on the subject of China and the relative truculence with which the Holy See was dealt in recent months.  The priorities may have got skewed along the way.</P>

	<P>We have heard a fair amount of classical allusions so I shall top them off with a quotation from ancient Greece.  There is a little aphorism &ldquo;<i>meden agen</i>&rdquo; which loosely translates into &ldquo;enough already&rdquo; or &ldquo;we have had enough&rdquo;. The employers of Ireland have had &ldquo;<i>meden agen</i>&rdquo; from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  I warmly support Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s comments on the proposed imposition of the first month of sick pay penalty on the employer.  It comes soon after the Government&rsquo;s decision to reduce the redundancy rebate for employers from 60% down to 15%.  As the Senator said, both these measures will cost jobs and someone must call a halt.</P>
        <P>On an urgent note, I am delighted to applaud the work that has resulted in 1,000 jobs being created in County Louth.  It is a great day for that county but in contrast it is a bad day for mine.  The Commission for Energy Regulation has issued a proposal to impose new charges on new entrants into the energy provision sector.  It will support and underpin the profits of Bord G&aacute;is and existing providers but will make it almost impossible for new people to enter the sector.  Members will have heard me speak on a number of occasions about the LNG project in Kerry on the Shannon Estuary.  The investors have put in &euro;40 million of their own money, seek no Government grants and gone through all planning and other stages.  However, the energy regulator has said to them that in order for the company to get into the sector a further &euro;10 million per annum must be paid by it to pay for the gas interconnector with the UK.  That is patently unfair and is only the decision of the regulator.</P>
        <P>Last week I raised the matter with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte.  My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, helped me to promote the project when we were councillors or in a different walk of life.   I call on the Leader to again go to him and the rest of the Government and rectify the matter immediately.  Some mechanism must be put in place to compensate the principals behind the project or they will walk away with the loss of 500 jobs, the country&rsquo;s energy security greatly threatened and the project will be a total disaster.</P>

As has often been the case in the past, the scenery and hospitality of County Clare is used to the advantage of this country.  I commend the Lynch family in Sixmilebridge whose farm the Vice President visited.  He also visited the iconic Cliffs of Moher, one of the best tourism products this country has, and I believe he was in awe of its stunning scenery.</P>
        <P>Following on from this, will the Leader organise a question and answer session with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on how to take advantage of this successful visit, watched by hundreds of millions in China, and increase Ireland&rsquo;s portion of the 38 million Chinese people who go abroad on holidays every year?  With the Taoiseach paying a return visit to China in March, a golden gateway has been opened with China which will propel Ireland to the top of the international countries which Chinese people visit.  We need to take <Col N="12"/>advantage of every opportunity to promote Ireland as a tourism destination.  I would welcome a question and answer debate on how we can capitalise on tourism from China.</P>

        <P>In the media flurry surrounding the visit of the Chinese delegation, another important initiative launched last Friday in Galway by the Minister for Health, for which I commend him, was missed.  It can only be called the pre-meeting perambulation initiative.  Due in the city for several visits on Friday, the Minister experienced at first hand the stress of having to sit in Galway traffic for an hour and a half.  Instead of sitting there and getting worked up, however, he decided the best antidote was to get out of his car and walk to the meetings.  It is handy enough to be able to do that when one has a ministerial driver but I was stuck there for the same time without having the luxury of being able to leave my car.</P>
        <P>It draws to our attention once more to the issue of Galway city traffic which has been ridiculed up until now and which I have raised here on several occasions.  I call again for a debate on this issue.  I accept it is a broad issue and that the Leader has told us we have a wonderful mayor, Hildegarde Naughton, who has brought together a discussion group on the matter.  However, the group needs to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on board as there are broader players involved such as Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as issues surrounding air access, an outer bypass and the N17 bypass.  These all contribute to traffic chaos in Galway city.  It has gone far beyond a joke and we need a debate around it.  Perhaps the Minister for Health could attend the House to give us his personal experience and advise us how to deal with the health implications of having to sit in traffic such as Galway&rsquo;s.</P>

	<P>I welcome the raising of the important issue today of human rights in China.  As I stated last week, it is also important, however, we have a balanced debate about the positives in China too.  Over 150 million people have been brought above the poverty line in less then ten years.  When I was in Shanghai some time ago, I noted over 350,000 young people were in third level education with a large number of them travelling to study outside of China.  The number of people learning English in China is far greater than in any other part of the world at the moment.  There are a lot of freedoms in China.  It is important that, when we have a debate on human rights, it is balanced.  We must also look at the positives that have been achieved in that country where more than 1.3 billion people live.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to a matter raised by Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien on making employers liable for the first four weeks of sick pay.  It is a difficult issue to deal with and it warrants a debate.  In having such a debate we should also include people in the public sector being on full pay for the first six months of sick leave and on half pay for the second six months.  It would be appropriate to debate that issue also when we debate sick pay in the private sector because it is a concern for the private sector that it would have to carry such a responsibility.</P>

	<P>The significance of the visit of the Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping cannot be overestimated.  The fact that Ireland, a small country on the periphery of Europe, was one of just three countries the vice president visited is an astonishing compliment to this country and its potential.  I fully endorse all that has been said on all sides of the House in congratulating the Taoiseach and members of the Government on the manner in which they <Col N="13"/>hosted the vice president over the three days and those who engaged with him, not least the family in County Clare and all those who came in contact with him.</P>
        <P>I also compliment Mr. Niall Gibbons of Tourism Ireland who was the first out of the traps, as it were, as one of the State agencies that will act on the advantages that have been gleaned as a result of the extraordinary coverage the visit to this country received in the Chinese media.  As a result of another Government initiative last year, China is one of the countries that will now have easy access to this country in conjunction with the upcoming Olympic Games in addition to a number of other Middle Eastern and Far Eastern countries &mdash; 17 in all &mdash; who will be able to gain visas not only to the UK, but by extension to visit this country for the next 12 months.</P>
        <P>I would like the Leader to raise an issue I brought up with the Minister for Justice and Equality in a previous debate in this House as it is timely to mention it again.  Those Chinese nationals who receive tourist visas to visit the Republic of Ireland are unable under the current regime to visit the North of Ireland.  As Members on all sides of the House are aware, this country is promoted and marketed internationally as the island of Ireland through Tourism Ireland.  The CEO of that organisation, Mr. Niall Gibbons, is doing an outstanding job in that regard.  It seems somewhat of an anomaly, in particular, as Northern Ireland has much to offer this year, in terms of the Titanic quarter and also Derry being the city of culture next year.  I urge the Leader to once again bring the issue to the attention of the relevant authorities.  It is initially a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality to extend the visas and I am aware the Minister for Justice and Equality is working hard in this regard with his UK counterparts.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Mullen about the extraordinary media coverage that the Irish visit received in the Chinese media, but I understand we were knocked off the headlines on the last day by the French who trumped us by giving two pandas to the Chinese.  The panda is the national symbol of China and it is always a major news story.  In future, the Government might be able to counter any attempt by the French to trump us by giving pandas if the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government were to act as the counterparts to the French pandas on Chinese television.  Perhaps it would help to bring more visitors to this part of the world.  I mean that in the best possible taste.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in calling for some action on the personal insolvency Bill and the tragedy of mortgage arrears, a silent crisis that is still continuing three years after it was first highlighted in this House and when solutions were debated.  There has still been no tangible action.  As the Senator stated, the latest figures show a significant increase in the number of those in mortgage arrears, yet real solutions are as elusive as ever.  An unnamed source in this morning&rsquo;s press seemed to indicate that if one bank is forced in any way to pass on concessions to people in mortgage difficulties, it will recoup that money in charges.  This would be fundamentally wrong.</P>
        <P>It is time that we act as an Oireachtas to introduce solutions.  This House has made several attempts, for example, the family home Bill and the Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill 2011, which has been left on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The heads of a personal insolvency Bill have been published and are before a committee, yet there seem to be no solutions for people.  There are all sorts of solutions for the banks and all sorts of solutions are being passed on by the EU to Ireland as a nation state, but when will we do it for the people?  They are the most important element, yet we still have had no action.  There is no shortage of suggestions from both sides of the House.  They are workable and could make a real difference quickly.  As Senator Barrett stated, the back stairs to the Department of Finance seems very much open to bankers.  This is to the detriment of struggling families.  It is time that the banks were forced to use some of the money given to them to deal with people in mortgage arrears and to help people.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader personally involve himself in the issue of the slowness of agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and single farm payments to farming families throughout the country? <Col N="15"/> Families are being given different excuses every day as to why their payments are being delayed.  Today I was phoned by family members who were reduced to tears on the telephone.  They were told that the money would be in their account last Thursday.  They made arrangements for a bank payment in line with that plan, but nothing arrived.  When I called offices to inquire on their behalf, I was told yet another story.  Surely any government should aspire to providing a professional service and to being honest with people as to when the money they are owed will be paid to them.</P>

It is great news for the north east, including the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath and north Dublin.  I congratulate everyone who was involved in bringing about this day.  In particular, I congratulate a young lady from Raheen Upper, Donaghmore, County Laois, Ms Louise Phelan, the vice president of PayPal Europe.  Ms Phelan was responsible in no small way for ensuring these jobs came to Dundalk, as well as for the 1,500 jobs that are already located in Blanchardstown.  It is worth noting that she is the sister of our late colleague, former Senator Kieran Phelan.</P>

	<P>The principal of Lauragh national school organised a public meeting on rural schools in Kerry last night.  I thank the Leader for facilitating several debates on this issue.  A positive development in this regard is the GAA&rsquo;s decision to support the issue because it realises its own vested interests are at stake.  Rural schools must be maintained if the social and sporting life of communities is to be sustainable.  I look forward to further debates in this House on issues relating to rural Ireland.  If we do not have viable communities we will not have a rural Ireland in the future.</P>
        <P>Today marks the 24th anniversary of the death of Aidan McAnespie at Aughnacloy.  He was on his way to a GAA match when he was shot and killed by British soldiers.  The former Garda deputy commissioner, Eugene Crowley, was appointed by the Government of the day to produce a report on the matter.  I call on the Leader to ask his colleagues in Cabinet to arrange for the publication of that report.  The Historical Enquiries Team in the North has stated that the version of events set out by the British army is the least likely to have occurred.  The PSNI came to similar conclusions when it stated in a report produced in 2008 that the British army&rsquo;s version of events lacked credibility.  Perhaps the Leader can ask his colleagues to publish the Irish Government&rsquo;s version of the events.</P>

	<P>In regard to the call by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, for a debate on the fiscal compact, I have no problem in extending the time allocated to Members.  We can give them all the time they want to express their opinions.</P>
        <P>On the question of mortgage arrears, obviously many people are experiencing difficulties in this regard.  Senator Bacik has indicated that the heads of the insolvency Bill have been discussed in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  When the committee&rsquo;s report is made available perhaps we can have a debate on the subject of mortgage relief and the insolvency Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and others alluded to the visit by the Chinese Vice President.  We all agree it was a wonderful visit that will provide great opportunities for both countries.  Our embassy in China reported that the Vice President&rsquo;s visit received extensive and positive coverage in the Chinese media.  It was the first item on CCTV&rsquo;s news reports and reported on the front page of most newspapers, including <i>People&rsquo;s Daily</i>,<i> China Daily </i>and <i>Beijing News.</i>  The coverage emphasised the significance of the visit in terms of deepening the friendship and <Col N="16"/>strengthening the co-operation between Ireland and China.  References are regularly made in China to Ireland&rsquo;s successful transition from an agrarian to a knowledge based economy.  The visit was also viewed in the broader context of EU-China relations.  Mr. Xi&rsquo;s comments on China&rsquo;s willingness to support Europe in addressing its debt problems have been widely reported.  It has been a very successful visit and I hope the Ministers who will travel to China in the months ahead will foster closer relationships and trade between our countries.  This will yield jobs in Ireland and create opportunities in China for many Irish companies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Bacik, Zappone, Norris, Bradford, Mullen and Mullins mentioned human rights.  It would be timely to arrange a debate on human rights not only in China but also internationally.  I hope we can arrange it in the coming weeks.  It is something that should be discussed in this House which has an excellent record in discussing human rights abuses in many countries and it is probably an opportune time to do so again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have a further hour allocated to Committee Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill today.  I believe an hour will probably suffice, but we will review it as it goes on.  We spent two hours on it last week and have another hour today.  If it is necessary to extend the time, we will review it at that time depending on the availability of the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Comiskey spoke about the closure of Teagasc offices in Manorhamilton.  I suggest that the Senator table an Adjournment motion in that regard and he might be able to get further information on the subject.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator O'Donovan spoke about the Faroe Islands and Iceland having no restrictions in mackerel fishing.  The Minister addressed this matter not last week but the previous time he was here.  He spoke of his dissatisfaction and concern in the matter.  I will certainly relay the Senator's concerns in the matter to the Minister again and I am sure he will take it up at European level. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Jim D&rsquo;Arcy, Brennan, Colm Burke and Wilson spoke about the announcement of 1,000 jobs in Dundalk, or Haggardstown to be precise, as Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy mentioned.  It is a wonderful day not only for the people of Dundalk and Haggardstown, but also for the entire region, as Senator Wilson said.  Many people thought that the days of announcements of 1,000 jobs were well and truly gone.  It is wonderful to see an announcement of so many good jobs in an area which obviously needs them.  I hope that when further announcements are being made, Waterford and the south east will be also considered as it is the greatest unemployment black spot in the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Harte spoke about Lifford Community Hospital.  Again, he might table an Adjournment motion on the matter.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Crown spoke about the 50% increase in waiting lists for day surgery and the shortage of doctors in the system.  I know he raised the issue with the Minister when he was in the House last week and I am sure the Minister will take on board what the Senator mentioned in that regard. </P><P Just="Left">Senator Cullinane spoke about cuts in the community and voluntary sector.  It is a gross exaggeration to say that many of these services will go completely.  There will certainly be cuts, which have been announced in practically every Department.  However, to suggest that these services will go as a result of the cuts is hyperbole. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Noone spoke about cloud computing and switching e-mails to embrace this technology in the Oireachtas.  I am sure the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will be very interested in saving money and it is a matter the Senator might raise with the commission.  </P><Col N="17"/><P Just="Left">Senator Leyden spoke about a grants scheme for septic tanks.  The Minister has already commented on that issueand said he would address it when the time came.</P><P Just="Left">Senators Mullins and Brennan called for a debate on the jobs plan.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has agreed to come to the House to debate the jobs plan on 6 March and we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter then. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Conway spoke about the Chinese visit and got in his promotion of the beautiful county of Clare and the benefits for tourism that may accrue from the visit.  The promotion of tourism is an important part of the visit because there are approximately 100,000 visitors from China.  As a result of the extensive, excellent coverage we got in China the number will increase significantly in the coming years and this will be of benefit to County Clare and every other county.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh commented on the use of the Irish language.  I urge people who have Irish to use it as much as possible during seachtain na Gaeilge.  I am unsure whether it would be possible to specify a particular day because people would be confined to speaking the Irish language but I urge that they use the language as much as possible, especially during seachtain na Gaeilge.</P>
        <P>The council in Galway should be capable of finding a solution to the traffic problem there but if the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is needed I am sure he will assist in the matter.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Mooney raised the issue of visas for Chinese visitors in order that when they come they can visit Northern Ireland as well.  This matter should be discussed and I understand it is a matter for discussion between the Minister for Justice and Equality and his counterparts in the United Kingdom.  Certainly, I will bring it to his attention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Eamonn Coghlan commented on the positive attitude in the USA towards this country.  We are all pleased about this and I am sure St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day will provide a further platform for Ireland to be promoted.  I share his comments on the television programme on bare knuckle fighting.  It was dreadful to see the programme and what goes on.  I note his comments on social welfare.  There is probably some abuse of the system but it does not apply to the Traveller community as a whole.  Given the large vehicles they drive and the amount of money exchanged in the programme it appears some people probably should be investigated by the Department of Social Protection.  However, I suggest the vast majority do not come under the system in the way we saw in the television programme with so much money being exchanged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry raised the issue of farm payments.  I understood farm payments were well advanced.  We had been advised by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that they were well in advance of those in previous years but I will raise the matter with the Minister.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Daly spoke about the publication of the report of the former deputy Garda Commissioner.  I will inquire about the position with the Minister for Justice and Equality. </P><P Just="Left">Order of Business agreed to.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to present the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2011 to the Seanad.  I am glad to say that this Bill, which proposes to amend the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 in a number of areas in light of experience since its adoption, was well received in the D&aacute;il and its passage through that House during the second half of last year was uncontentious.

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is being distributed now.</P>
        <P>Reflecting the fact that the Bill enjoyed support on all sides of the House, no Opposition amendment was tabled during its passage through the D&aacute;il.  However, arising from ongoing consideration within my Department and consultations between my Department and various stakeholders following publication, I proposed a total of 12 amendments by way of refining and improving the Bill.  I am glad to say that these amendments were readily agreed by all sides in the House.  Before giving an outline of the Bill, I propose to make some preliminary remarks about the context in which the Bill is being presented and the role played by veterinary practitioners, nurses and others in the treatment and care of animals.</P>
        <P>The primary role of the veterinary profession continues to be animal health care, with the greatest number of veterinarians working in this field caring for farm animals, sport animals and, increasingly, companion animals.  At farm level, vets perform a very important function in assisting farmer clients to maintain the high health status of their animals and in minimising disease risks which can have a significant impact on farm income.  Vets are also a critical part of the official inspection service, both at farm and processing levels, in terms of verifying that food is safe for consumers.  Vets are also, of course, involved in many other roles within industry, including research as part of the pharmaceutical industry, reflecting how the profession has responded to evolving demands and is prepared to participate fully in the broader economy.  Veterinarians can truly be said to be involved in the food industry from farm to fork.</P>
        <P>The veterinary profession was the first of the professions in Ireland to have its underpinning legislation significantly reformed and brought up to date.  The Veterinary Practice Act 2005 significantly overhauled regulation of the profession with regard to the make-up of its regulating body, the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  It also improved disciplinary procedures and established mandatory continuous professional development and premises accreditation schemes.  The 2005 Act also represented an important milestone in the development of the veterinary nursing profession, as a discipline in its own right, with the Act conferring formal recognition on veterinary nurses for the first time in Ireland.  This has enabled the veterinary nursing profession to develop a distinct personality.  Almost 500 nurses are now registered to practice.</P>
        <P>In the field of nurse education and training, we have moved from a situation in which most nurses had to go overseas for training to one in which five colleges in Ireland now offer approved and accredited courses.  All of these positive developments have taken place in the relatively short period since the 2005 Act came into force.  I look forward to the members of the veterinary nursing profession developing further in tandem and in co-operation with their veterinary practitioner colleagues in the years ahead.</P><Col N="19"/>
        <P>It may be useful to state at this stage that the measures involved in this legislation can be divided into two broad strands.  The first strand, which is covered in section 2, concerns mechanisms for exempting certain activities from being reserved to veterinary practitioners or veterinary nurses.  The second strand, which is covered in sections 3 to 9, relates to changes designed to streamline and improve the operation of the legislation in light of experience.  In the majority of cases, the changes proposed derive from suggestions made by the Veterinary Council of Ireland on the basis of its direct experience of implementing the 2005 Act.  The proposed amendments also take account of more recent legislation governing the regulation of the professions, particularly the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Pharmacy Act 2007.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline some of the specific elements of the Bill.  As I have indicated, section 2 is the kernel of the Bill.  My objective is to ensure that activities and services concerning animals that have traditionally been carried out by people who are neither vets nor nurses, do not become reserved to the veterinary profession.  The 2005 Act sought to address a shortcoming in the previous legislation.  It created a greater degree of legal certainty around what constitutes the practice of veterinary medicine by introducing a definition of veterinary practice.  This definition is contained in section 53 of the Act.  Since the 2005 Act came into force, however, the Veterinary Council of Ireland &mdash; the regulatory body for the profession, which is charged with day-to-day implementation of the Act &mdash; has raised concerns with my Department that the definition of veterinary practice, which, of necessity, is expressed in broad and general terms could be interpreted as embracing a range of procedures or activities that have traditionally been carried out by people with appropriate skills, training and experience.  The procedures in question include farriery, equine dentistry, bovine hoof trimming, micro-chipping of companion animals, scanning of cattle and sheep and physiotherapy.  Such day-to-day farming and animal husbandry practices should not be the sole preserve or function of vets or veterinary nurses.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The legal advice obtained by my Department indicated that in the event of legal disputes arising, there could be doubt about the status of such procedures carried out on animals.  As competitiveness is a key issue for our economy, it would be invidious if services to farmers and other animal owners were to become overly restricted, especially as that would have negative cost implications for those concerned.  Therefore, it is appropriate to address this situation.  My Department has received advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that this cannot be done in a comprehensive manner without amending the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  Under the amendments I am proposing, my office will be vested with a delegated power to make ministerial regulations, exempting specified procedures from being reserved to registered people.  The exercise of this function will be subject to appropriate principles and policies approved by this House in the primary amending legislation.  If Senators wish, we can examine these aspects in greater detail on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that there should be formal consultation on a statutory basis with the Veterinary Council of Ireland before any activity is exempted.  The Bill provides for this.  There will also be consultation with other stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The amendments also provide for any exemptions to be made subject to appropriate conditions, including education, training and skills, membership of specified bodies and so on.  The conditions to be applied to each exempted activity will be determined on a case by case basis.  The process will, in effect, build on the existing informal arrangements in place across the disparate groups.  In this respect, it will provide clients with a greater degree of quality assurance in regard to these procedures.  It will also facilitate the imposition of limits on the scope of particular procedures, where appropriate, which can be performed by non-registered persons, or non-veterinarians, which will bring a much greater degree of legal certainty to the area.</P><Col N="20"/>
        <P>My Department has consulted widely on this issue and it is fair to say that there is a general welcome it is being addressed.  Many of the groups representing the current service providers see the changes as a basis for developing their areas of activity in accordance with best practice.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the other main themes covered in this Bill.  I refer to disciplinary procedures and enforcement.  Professions, including the veterinary profession, occupy an important and somewhat privileged position in society.  Given their nature, society also places a great deal of trust in the professions.  It is critical, therefore, that society has confidence in the way the professions are regulated.  This places a particular responsibility on us, as legislators, to ensure that legislation underpinning the professions guarantees that regulation is robust, effective and transparent and that any hint of closing of ranks around colleagues is avoided.</P>
        <P>The 2005 Veterinary Practice Act brought regulation of the profession up to date in many important respects, including a greater degree of external representation at council level, an external chair of its fitness to practise committee, publication of findings of disciplinary proceedings and so on.  While the mechanisms are working well, nonetheless, based on feedback from the Veterinary Council of Ireland, I propose to adapt some provisions to further improve their effectiveness.</P>
        <P>The first amendment, which is in section 4, is designed to give the Veterinary Council of Ireland a greater range of options in terms of the sanctions it can apply where its fitness to practise committee has upheld a complaint against a veterinary practitioner or veterinary nurse.  These sanctions include striking off, suspension, attachment of conditions, etc.  Currently, under section 80 of the Act, the council is enabled to apply any of these sanctions only where the fitness to practise committee has made an explicit finding of unfitness to practise.  This is too restrictive and what I propose is that, even if does not make a finding of unfitness to practise, the council will have the discretion to impose an appropriate penalty from the range specified in the legislation where an aspect of the substantive complaint has been upheld by the fitness to practise committee.  It follows that in exercising this function, the council is required to apply penalties which are proportionate to the scale and import of the breach which has been established.</P>
        <P>I am also proposing in section 9(<i>k</i>) of the Bill to amend the definition of &ldquo;professional misconduct&rdquo;.  As Senators will appreciate, this definition is critical for the purposes of upholding standards in the profession.  As I said earlier, members of any profession must be measured to the highest standards, reflecting their role in society.</P>
        <P>I also drew attention to the fact that more recent legislation governing regulation of doctors and pharmacists has come into force since the enactment of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  I propose, therefore, to adapt the definition of professional misconduct in the current Act to align it, in so far as possible, with the equivalent provisions in more recent related legislation.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, having considered further representations from the Veterinary Council of Ireland and having taken legal advice, I obtained agreement to an amendment to further refine this definition to take greater account of the most recent case law in this area relating to the medical profession.</P>
        <P>It is also proposed in section 7 of the Bill to enhance the effectiveness of the council&rsquo;s investigative and enforcement functions.</P>
        <P>Experience, both here and elsewhere, has demonstrated the need for regulatory bodies, where necessary, to be able to investigate complaints or concerns expeditiously, for example, before evidence can be removed or destroyed.  Currently, under section 126 of the Veterinary <Col N="21"/>Practice Act 2005, authorised officers of the council are required to obtain a search warrant to enter any premises, unless the agreement of the person concerned is forthcoming.</P>
        <P>The council has expressed the view to my Department that this situation unduly inhibits its ability to investigate effectively.  Accordingly, I am proposing to enable authorised officers of the council to enter premises, where that is necessary for the purposes of carrying out an investigation, without the need to first obtain a search warrant from a District Court judge.  I stress, however, that a search warrant would continue to be necessary to enter a domestic dwelling.  In other words, we will not have investigating officers coming into people&rsquo;s homes.  That would be inappropriate without the appropriate warrant.  That is the approach followed generally in regard to the powers of entry for authorised officers and follows the approach, for example, in the Pharmacy Act 2007.</P>
        <P>A number of other minor procedural amendments are proposed in the area of disciplinary procedures which can be examined in detail on a further Stage.</P>
        <P>A requirement for indemnity insurance is not a feature of the existing Veterinary Practice Act, and the council believes this legislative opportunity should be availed of to address that.  From a public policy point of view, provision should be made to enable the Veterinary Council of Ireland ensure that clients of registered persons are protected against adverse events where civil liability attaches to the professional.  Thus, section 3 proposes the insertion of a new provision into the Act to enable the council, with the consent of the Minister, make regulations making indemnity insurance mandatory for specified types of veterinary practice.  However, the requirement will not apply to practitioners in respect of official duties.</P>
        <P>In my earlier remarks I drew attention to the fact that the 2005 Veterinary Practice Act was a major milestone in the development of the veterinary nursing profession in Ireland.  The Act, as currently structured, provides for recognition of trained nurses from Ireland and from other EU states.  The current Act also provided for transitional arrangements for nurses who had been practising as such before the legislation was contemplated by affording them a five year period to formalise their education status.  However, provision must now be made to enable the council register nurses coming from third countries.</P>
        <P>A need has also been identified by the Veterinary Council of Ireland for registration processes for persons with particular expertise in the field of veterinary nursing who are needed to be part of course delivery at the education and training establishments.  The amendments in section 6 are designed to address these issues by providing the Veterinary Council of Ireland with a broader range of recognition options in the case of veterinary nurses.  In so doing, the range of registration options for veterinary nurses is being brought into line with those currently provided for in the Act for veterinary practitioners.</P>
        <P>In the area of registration, I am availing of this legislative opportunity to remove any doubt that the registration mechanisms are capable of accommodating short-term registration, for example, of veterinary specialists from third countries who are accompanying horses from overseas participating in sporting events, which is a practical response.</P>
        <P>Regarding EU mutual recognition obligations, mutual recognition arrangements for veterinary practitioners and six other professions, including doctors and dentists, have been a reality at EU level for many years.  That is on the basis that training requirements in each member state are required to reach a common EU standard.  More recently, as part of the initiatives at EU level to make the Single Market a reality across a range of services, free movement arrangements were extended to a range of activities, including veterinary nursing, where minimum educational standards are not co-ordinated at EU level.  This process included initiatives to make it easier for veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses, as well as a host of other service providers, to provide services on a temporary basis across national borders.  At EU <Col N="22"/>level, this regime is laid down in Directive 2005/36.  Our national legislation embodies these requirements, which are contained in the European Communities (Veterinary Practice Act 2005) (Qualifications in Veterinary Medicine) Regulations 2007, S.I. No. 745 of 2007.  However, taking account of legal advice, I am proposing to consolidate the Statute Book by restating, in primary legislation, relevant provisions currently contained in that statutory instrument.  This is the purpose of section 8 of the Bill.  In addition, in order to take account of technical observations received from the European Commission on three minor aspects of S.I. No. 745 of 2007, the relevant provisions are being amended to align them more closely with the requirements of the directive.  The amendments concerned relate to the status, in the home EU state, of the veterinary practitioner or nurse wishing to provide cross-border services on a temporary basis in this country and the time limit governing such applications.  I can go into these in greater detail on Committee or Report Stages.</P>
        <P>The Bill also contains a number of other miscellaneous and consequential amendments in section 9.  These are mainly designed to facilitate greater efficiency in the carrying out of the council&rsquo;s business, including filling of casual vacancies and quorums for meetings.  In summary, this is a timely update and clarifies the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators and I will try to accommodate any concerns.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House yet again and broadly welcome the Bill.  As the Minister indicated during his speech on Second Stage, the Bill passed through the D&aacute;il without any controversy and it is interesting that a Bill dealing with a profession received such broad welcome.  We are used to hearing about restrictive practices in professions through the decades and they are loth to relinquish these practices.  In fairness to the veterinary associations and those who represent veterinary practitioners, they were involved in embracing the 2005 legislation &mdash; which was a milestone &mdash; and have actively lobbied on some of the amendments to be introduced by the Minister.  Considering the wide consultation with the stakeholders undertaken by the Department and the discussions on Second Stage and Committee Stage, I am not surprised this legislation comes to the Seanad without any great baggage.</P>
        <P>There are a number of interesting aspects that I want to tease out.  I was impressed to learn that there are almost 2,500 registered vets, and almost 500 veterinary nurses.  Based on 2008 estimates, some 61% of vets in Ireland operate in the 650 private practices registered under the premises accreditation scheme.  A noticeable feature of new vets on the register in recent years is the rise in the number of female vets.  In 1993, the profession was 90% male dominated, a figure that dropped to 74% in 2007.  The Minister has more up-to-date figures on that.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service and I acknowledge its publication of a briefing document on this Bill.  The Competition Authority noted the large influx of foreign trained vets.  Between 2001 and 2007, nearly 40% of new vets registered in Ireland qualified outside the State.  The authority expressed some concern over Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on other countries to produce vets for its needs and recommended that the number of vets being produced should be closely monitored to ensure that no shortages arise in the future.</P>
        <P>How many veterinary students are currently in our colleges?  Are the numbers sufficient?  Is there a sufficient amount of work for those who are graduating?  Unfortunately, in some other professions, particularly nursing, graduates have had to leave to find work outside the State.  I am not aware of the current situation regarding supply and demand.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to let us know about that.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>Near the end of his presentation the Minister went into detail about the registration and EU mutual recognition obligations.  I hope he is satisfied the Bill will take account of some concerns that have arisen in the medical profession.  I am not sure whether they extend to the veterinary profession.  There have been some horror stories about doctors from other countries who have not been checked by those that have employed them in our hospitals.  Is the Minister satisfied the registration process is transparent enough to ensure those who may not be up to the required standards do not slip through the net if there are shortages in the profession and people wish to come here to work?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reference to the EU is interesting.  I think I am right in saying that there is no legal requirement to vet the academic qualifications of those in the EU generally.  I am not sure how that applies to this Bill.  The Minister may wish to elaborate on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is mutual recognition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister satisfied that the mutual recognition policy will not raise any concerns about the quality of those who wish to come to the country?  I am not referring to those who may wish to come on a short-term basis but those who may wish to relocate here to work.  I recall a case in the medical profession of an applicant applying for a job in an Irish hospital.  The person came from Romania and it transpired that he or she was not up to speed.  The person conveyed that he or she had achieved certain academic qualifications which had not been checked by the hospital in question.  </P>
        <P>As the Minister correctly said, the focus of the work of vets in general is to ensure we have safe food.  It is an issue to which he referred in his presentation.  It is not directly connected to this Bill, as an amendment to the primary Bill, but it is important he put that on the record.  Ireland&rsquo;s image, as the Minister articulated so well on many occasions, as a clean food producing economy is vital to our national recovery and was particularly highlighted with the visit of the Chinese Vice President at the weekend.  The Minister was involved in the visit and I compliment him on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister will also be very proactive in ensuring potential jobs and markets are opened up for many of our agricultural products.  It is important to note that the amendment will ensure restrictive or exclusive practices pertaining to registered vets will now be extended to those who are non-vets.  Ultimately, the Minister is ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s clean image as a food producing nation will not be compromised in any way by the Bill.</P>
        <P>I refer to a measure included in the Bill which concerns costs.  I am sure other contributors will mention it.  The president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, Mr. Gabriel Gilmartin, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">All avenues must be explored to reduce running costs, and veterinary bills are near the top of farmers&rsquo; expenses.  We would also encourage the minister to look at reviewing the cost of medicines in Ireland.  Our animal medicines are hugely expensive when compared to our nearest neighbours in the North and the UK.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the Minister will know, this is not confined to veterinary but extends across a range of medical disciplines.  The issue has been discussed in this House and has been raised quite regularly.  The Minister might wish to address that.  I compliment him on introducing this legislation. He will certainly have no opposition on this side of the House.  We welcome the legislation and support fully the Minister&rsquo;s effort to ensure the agrifood business and the associated veterinary practices are in keeping with promoting the very best of Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and I am pleased to speak on Second Stage of this Bill.  I commend the Minister and his staff on their work on drafting the Bill.  As the Minister outlined, the Bill amends the principal Act of 2005.  It will make provision for the mutual recognition of qualifications and a register of individuals, and persons other than veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses will be permitted to conduct procedures.  It will allow for additional powers to be exercised by the Minister and his Department.</P>
        <P>It is very positive that the Department has responded swiftly and adequately to concerns raised by the veterinary profession.  This Bill encompasses the changes required to make the veterinary profession function better.</P>
        <P>As a farmer, I have much experience with local veterinarians and those employed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They provide a very necessary service to farmers and owners of companion pets in the home.  It would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the important contribution that veterinarians make to society.  As was stated, many Irish students study veterinary practice abroad, including in the United Kingdom and Hungary.  Compliance with the EU free-movement regulation is important in this regard.</P>
        <P>According to the Veterinary Council of Ireland, on 13 February this year there were 2,343 veterinary practitioners registered in Ireland and 381 registered veterinary nurses.  It is interesting to note that the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 overhauled the regulation of the profession in certain areas, including in regard to the composition of the regulatory body, the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  It established mandatory continuous professional development and introduced premises-accreditation schemes.  The principal Act entered into force on 1 January 2006.</P>
        <P>Let me touch briefly on some of the principal proposals of the Bill.  Its main purpose is to clarify fully the legal position established in the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 to enable the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to exclude specific activities from being reserved to veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses.  The enactment of the Bill into law will not incur any extra departmental expense.</P>
        <P>Section 2 provides for the introduction of three new sections to the principal Act and it will allow for ministerial regulation-making powers to exclude specific activities from being reserved to veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses.  Provision is being made, under section 54A, for the Minister to make special exclusion subject to appropriate conditions and to consult in advance the Veterinary Council of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Section 54B ensures that the principles and policies governing the exercise of the Minister&rsquo;s regulation-making powers under section 54C contain a standard offence clause for failure to comply with the regulations.</P>
        <P>Section 3 inserts a new provision to enable the Veterinary Council of Ireland, with the consent of the Minister, by regulation, to make indemnity insurance mandatory for specific types of veterinary practices.  This will modernise the law for veterinary practitioners in line with their counterparts in other professions.</P>
        <P>Section 4 is to modernise aspects of the disciplinary provision for veterinarians and bring them into line with recent legislation, including the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Pharmacy Act 2007.  This will give the governing body a greater menu of options to deal with disciplinary case actions, including the actions to strike off, suspend or impose conditions.</P>
        <P>As the Minister outlined, section 5 will restructure the veterinary nurses regulation.</P>
        <P>Section 6 will give the Veterinary Council the ability to recognise third country veterinary nurses.  This will ultimately allow for suitably qualified, experienced veterinary nurses from <Col N="25"/>non-EU jurisdictions to work in Ireland subject to certain conditions, including a strict language requirement.</P>
        <P>Section 7 will empower the Veterinary Council to mobilise authorised officers to enter premises, where necessary, for the purpose of an investigation.  This will not require a warrant, nor will it interfere in a homeowner&rsquo;s right to protection within his or her own dwelling.  The Minister has already referred to that important point.</P>
        <P>As previously mentioned, Irish students are pursuing veterinary practice, education and training in other EU countries and further afield.  This Bill will ensure the complete mutual recognition of foreign qualifications for admittance to the veterinary register in Ireland.  It will give students and existing veterinary practitioners legal certainty concerning the standing of their qualifications in Ireland.  This is a practical addition to the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 9 extends the definition of &ldquo;professional misconduct&rdquo; in the current Act to align it with the equivalent provision under the Pharmacy Act 2007.  This section also amends a procedural requirement in the case of a lesser sanction of advice, warning or censure which may be applied by the council.  Under this amendment the council would not be required to get High Court approval in cases where a person complained against chooses not to appeal against a proposed decision of the council to advise, warn or censure him or her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for taking the time to address the House today on the passage of this Bill.  I look forward to the Bill being enacted at an early date.  I firmly believe the proposed legislation will strengthen and enhance the veterinary profession in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He said this Bill was uncontentious in the other House and I am sure, as the Minister will have gathered, it has already reached that status here, which is good to see.</P>
        <P>I note the explanatory memorandum refers to some items of conduct, which had been inadvertently reserved for veterinary practitioners or veterinary nurses.  That is an important factor because, as the Minister said, professions have tended to be regulated in their own interests rather than those of society at large.  As the introduction to the explanatory memorandum states, that was sometimes done inadvertently.</P>
        <P>Farmers regard veterinary costs as an extremely expensive part of farming and Senator Mooney also mentioned the high cost of veterinary medicines.  We had to import a substantial number of veterinary surgeons from outside the State, which leads one to conclude that the veterinary school itself was an obstacle to the development of Irish agriculture due to limiting the number of people who could study there, although that is a goal we all share.</P>
        <P>I recall the judgment of Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy in the taxi deregulation case &mdash; that people do have a right to enter a profession or trade for which they have the skills and training, and the public has a right to the services of such persons.  As the Minister said, it is important for us to look at all of these sheltered section professions, which is part of the IMF agreement.  In this regard, the Minister is looking at vets today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The House recently agreed to deregulate the general medical service lists, while I gather the Minister for Justice and Equality will introduce legislation dealing with lawyers.  The ratio of shop price to turnover for pharmacists in the Republic of Ireland far exceeded what it was in Northern Ireland.  We still have to get to grips with the professional standards in accountancy, which is a major background to the financial collapse of Irish banks in 2008.  No legislation on accountancy, similar to the Bill before us, has come before the House.  We must ask whether the accounts of Irish banks were a true and accurate account of their finances.  Might there in fact be a right of action by the taxpayer against those accountancy firms?  To take an agricultural metaphor, did we buy a pig in a poke when we took over some of those banks on the basis of <Col N="26"/>accounts which may not stand up to much scrutiny?  This is the background.  A former Member of this House, Dr. T.K. Whitaker, referred to the disease eradication programmes as the greatest financial scandal in the history of the State.  Granted, that was in an earlier time.  However, we must watch what happens.  In the standard economic literature of Milton Friedman and Simon Kuznets on the American medical profession, they said back in the mid-1940s that if one allowed the American medical association to determine who could become a doctor or what foreign doctors could be licensed to practise in the United States, one would end up with an extremely expensive health service.  The only question among economists is whether they were right.  We need to represent the public interest, as the Minister is doing, and the consumer interest, when we regulate the professions.  Of course, we want the highest standards but there is a tradition of restrictive practices in professions, especially limiting the number of entrants.  I was glad the Minister for Health, when he was in this Chamber last week, cast doubts on the HPAT test which seemed to be designed to stop women from studying medicine.  I gather their share of places has been reduced since that test was introduced and the Minister regards that as a restrictive practice and entirely unnecessary.  I note that the veterinary profession has had an increase, as Senator Mooney told us, of up to 74%.</P>
        <P>I will now deal with the section 2(3) which states &ldquo;Before making regulations under this section the Minister shall consult with the Council.&rdquo;  Would it be a good idea if the Minister took representations from the customers and the farming organisations?  If they have views on that section, should they be formally consulted so that one gets both points of view?  I know there are user representatives on the Veterinary Council, but they are usually from producer bodies.  The farm bodies are not very reticent about coming forward and expressing views and the Minister might invite them to participate under section 2.</P>
        <P>The issue of indemnity insurance struck me as strange.  The veterinary surgeon in private practice must have this insurance but the requirement does not apply to practitioners in respect of official duties.  Again, to the outsider, why not?  Does it not matter to us if somebody makes a mistake in a disease eradication programme or in treating a Garda horse, or a horse from the Army equitation school, that this is not covered by insurance?  Should this not also be covered?</P>
        <P>We have a National Treasury Management Agency report which states on page 21 that there are &euro;786 million in medical malpractice claims outstanding against the State, so why is the State not engaging in the protection that is afforded to us as private consumers of veterinary services?  I put that proposition to the Minister for what it is worth.  I support the extended functions of veterinary nurses and other measures.</P>
        <P>Section 8 deals with the mutual recognition directive, which is based on Directive 20, 2005/36/EC.  Would the consumer have been better off if we had implemented the directive earlier?  It is now seven years since it issued and that is part of the benefit of being in the European Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 9(<i>d</i>) deals with appropriately qualified veterinary surgeons.  I ask whether the number of points required to study veterinary medicine was too high in the first instance.  Many of those who wanted to train as veterinary surgeons went to study in Hungary.  High points courses in university indicate a number of factors, one of which is that the earning levels of those in the profession were too high and it is not based on the intellectual requirement needed to study veterinary medicine.  I wish to comment further on section 9, the requirement for a number of elected veterinary practitioners and the single veterinary nurse to deal with issues.  We should require some kind of a list system of those who are eligible or who finished down the way in the election.  What we should try to avoid in that and in the next section, is that the Veterinary Council or any other body is not trying to pick a jury after a case has started.  It should be obvious that if Mr. A cannot attend, one goes down to Mr. K, Mr. L or Mr. M.</P>

	<P>The alternative of trying to scramble around to assemble a jury after a case has started revives the Munster tradition &mdash; a man was called &ldquo;Peter the packer&rdquo;, because he had to pack juries.  It is better that the list of names should be there and published, with substitutes, before any case begins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome also the amendment to the Bill.  As I am sure others have said, it is good to be in agreement and to have a Bill that gives definition to &ldquo;practise a veterinary medicine&rdquo;.  When one speaks about the Bill outside, people ask what it is about.  When we think about it seriously, the professionalisation of veterinary practice is important.  People do not always realise the crucial role that vets play.  We often think, perhaps, of a sick cat or dog but it is in the agricultural field that one is more aware of their importance and, therefore, the Bill is welcome.</P>
        <P>Allowing non-veterinary professionals to carry out their procedures without fear of anybody saying they should not do it is the essence of the Bill and will ensure that farmers can reduce costs and take advantage of the professionals they need to carry out the services required instead of, perhaps, saying he or she cannot afford the vet on this occasion and will wait until the next time and possibly put an animal at risk.  Given current costs and investment forfarmers, anything that reduces expense for them is always welcome.</P>
        <P>I welcome particularly the extensive consultation that has taken place in the preparation of the amendment.  I am aware the Minister has spoken with a wide group of people, including the farmers&rsquo; bodies, the Equine Dental Association of Ireland, Veterinary Ireland, the Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, farriers and farm relief services and so on.  That everybody has been part of the creation of the amendment is a good model.</P>
        <P>The growth in the number of veterinary nurses in Ireland adds to the professionalisation of the whole area.  It means we can see the difference between the responsibilities of vets and the responsibilities of the nurses and, together, they can grow the area and make the welfare of animals of utmost importance.  Given that I have only had experience of paring sheep&rsquo;s feet, I would not qualify under the Bill and will not be rushing out to do it again.  If the industry is to be regulated, the training must be appropriate and keep up with modern developments in veterinary practice.  It is important that our professions grow in understanding of the various changes that are occurring.</P>
        <P>It is good that the indemnity insurance will become mandatory for veterinary practitioners although I share the query raised by Senator Barrett as to why it does not apply to those in official practice.  I am sure there is a good reason it does not apply to those in official practice.  Ultimately, we will rely on growing the food industry into the future and we know Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for food is a good one.  It is a clean, green, safe environment, by and large, and, in the main, we forget to thank the vets who have been part of that chain.  The reputation we have had, that perhaps was taken for granted, will mean more to us as each year passes.  I know that issue is of concern to the Minister.  During the visit of the Chinese Vice President, Mr. Xi Jinping, at the weekend we saw how important it is to be able to show how healthy and safe our food production is and I trust a vet was on hand when the new heifer, Jinping, was born.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps that is what we are getting at.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Therefore, there was no need for a vet, thank goodness.  Following the dioxin scare in 2008, even though that had nothing to do with vets, we became aware of the danger of contamination.  Given that Irish pork was supplied to 23 countries throughout Europe and the world, one realises how intricate and complex the food chain has become and each step in the chain requires a higher professional approach with appropriate regulation.  Perhaps it is time for the vets to step forward and take a more public ownership of that as they have been very much in the background and not recognised for the part they play in keeping food safe.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland also has a clear role in the area and that the Irish system of official food control is regulated by the authority and the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The importance of food safety is recognised at a senior level but I wonder if our vets have hidden their light under a bush.  As the industry becomes more complex the need for vets and good regulation &mdash; no more than we would have liked to have seen it in the banking system &mdash; is welcome.  Today, with the introduction of such regulation, there will be clarity on veterinary responsibilities.  Can the Minister tell me how much co-operation there has been?  Is there room for greater co-operation, particularly in the area of training, between the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and vets and veterinary nurses?  Agriculture is such a professional sector but is there a way for both sectors to work more closely together?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to comment on the Bill.  I was at the CPP meeting and missed the Minister&rsquo;s speech but I have read his script.  For once the explanation note on the back of the Bill is accurate when it states it is an Act to enable persons other than veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses to carry out certain procedures.  That is what the Bill must be about and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s strong statement in that regard.</P>
        <P>Irish agriculture and farming families have had a strong and positive relationship with their veterinary surgeons down the years.  I am sure that many of us watched the old television series, &ldquo;A Country Practice&rdquo;, and while not based in Ireland it set the tone for how Irish people thought of their vet.  There was, and is, a very strong link, not just a professional one.  In many cases a friendship exists between the vet and farmer.  On many occasions we have discussed the state of the health service in both Houses and we sometimes reflect that it is impossible to contact a doctor to tend to a sick child, adult or elderly person whereas a vet never says &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The vet has a positive link with his or her client by which the agricultural industry and economy has benefitted enormously.  We must ensure that link continues.</P>
        <P>The Minister has said on many occasions that we need to ensure competitiveness is at the core of the new Irish agricultural sector.  Part of that is keeping costs to a minimum and the Bill strikes the right balance between on the one hand, what a vet must do, being prescriptive and regulated, and on the other hand, what veterinary nurses, farmers or agricultural practitioners can do.  The legislation also allows for proper exemptions.  The Minister said the Bill ensures that only high end functions are reserved for veterinary practitioners and that is appropriate.  In Ireland most farmers are well trained, not just by farming but by holding a green certificate and studying courses in agriculture, AI and so on, many of which are college based.  They can carry out most of the duties that were once reserved for veterinarians and in the process save themselves money.  Everybody benefits.</P>
        <P>I am interested in what the legislation provides for in respect of veterinary nurses.  The Minister stated that approximately 500 veterinary nurses are now qualified and that there are five colleges or places of education that facilitate such training.  It is a fascinating career for many people and one that has great potential.  Perhaps it is not well advertised.  I was struck by the Minister&rsquo;s statistic that five colleges provide training because I was unaware they existed.</P><Col N="29"/>
        <P>As we continue to develop agriculture, animal husbandry and animal welfare, there will be many more opportunities for veterinary nurses and, accordingly, it should be advertised more as a career for school leavers.  The veterinary business is no longer just about the cow, the bullock or the horse.  Small animal clinics have grown across the country and people are taking care of dogs and cats to a level which was not the case heretofore, which should be welcomed and encouraged.  There are also many exotic pets in the country, sometimes causing difficulties.  When there is such investment in smaller animals, veterinary practitioners and nurses have a major role to play in their welfare.</P>
        <P>The Minister described section 2 with its exemptions as the kernel of the Bill.  Again, it is a question of common sense legislation and getting the balance right.  I welcome this legislation as it will strengthen the role of the veterinary surgeon and nurse and their link with agriculture.  It will allow farmers and other animal owners to carry out necessary interventions where practical and possible and in an economical fashion.  I look forward to the enactment of the Bill as it can only do good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Mar aon leis na hurlabhraithe &oacute; na p&aacute;irtithe eile, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go bhfuil mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; ag tac&uacute; leis an mBille praitici&uacute;il, ciallmhar agus tr&aacute;th&uacute;il seo.  D&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; leas do na hainmhithe agus na feirmeoir&iacute; araon.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in agrees with the broad thrust of the Bill and will support its passage.  We see it represents a sensible way forward for agriculture.  While it is not a perfect Bill, we note separate animal health and welfare legislation is forthcoming which should deal with any outstanding issues.  At the weekend, the Minister&rsquo;s counterpart in the North, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, visited Galway where she spoke of developing animal health and welfare legislation.  I am sure there is much tick-tacking going on in this area, as there must be strong and close all-island co-operation in the area of animal welfare.  The Fortress Ireland initiative is an example of such an all-island approach.</P>
        <P>The primary function of the Bill is to exempt certain functions and activities from being reserved to veterinary practitioners or nurses.  Given that there is a cost for the services of a veterinarian, it is sensible to allow for such functions as farriery, equine dentistry, bovine hoof trimming, microchipping of companion animals, scanning of cattle and sheep and animal physiotherapy to be carried out by people other than by a vet.  The Bill also provides for regulation which is sensible and valuable to animal welfare.  This is a good approach which strikes a balance between the need to be practical and allow for flexibility while keeping animal welfare in mind.</P>
        <P>On that matter, I am glad the Irish Farmers Association has seen fit to support this legislation.  I take that as a positive indication of farmers&rsquo; attitudes towards it.  At the same time, I note Veterinary Ireland has some concerns about section 2 and has sought further clarification along with the introduction of primary legislation to regulate the classes of persons suitable to carry out functions which are not considered to require veterinary expertise.  I know the Minister will consider this, particularly in light of the forthcoming animal health and welfare Bill.</P>
        <P>Veterinary Ireland also suggested the regulation of such persons should be carried out independently rather than by the Department.  I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s views on this.  Veterinary Ireland&rsquo;s views must be considered given the significant role it plays in supporting agriculture.  Proper regulation is needed due to the possibilities that otherwise the work of veterinary practitioners could be undercut and undermined.  It is important it is financially viable for vets to operate as the loss of a vet to an isolated rural community can be damaging to vets and farmers.  I have had experience of this in Connemara where we find it difficult to attract vets to settle down.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>We have a limited number of vets who are able to practise there.  It did not help that there was a support scheme available through the Department responsible for the Gaeltacht previously, which the previous Government abolished, that made it a little more viable for a vet to practise in those areas because they find it very difficult if they are based in Clifden to go on a call out to Lettermore and then perhaps another one over as far as Oughterard.  The amount of time spent on the road makes it very difficult for them to make an honest living.  I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on how vets can be supported in rural areas to ensure that it is worthwhile for them to be based there.</P>
        <P>I note that Senator Bradford mentioned that sometimes it is easier to access a vet than a doctor in a rural area but it can be the opposite as well.  That is certainly the case in areas such as Connemara where it can be difficult at times to get a vet, even though they are fantastic and give a wonderful service and come out at all times of the day or night.  The time factor involved in them travelling from their base to wherever they are needed can be crucial to the delivery of a quality service.  We cannot contemplate that it would not be viable for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take the opportunity to recognise the important role that is played both by veterinary practitioners and those who carry out the functions and activities vets cannot provide.  There is a role for both categories and we need to find a middle way.  The agriculture sector is healthy and vibrant and those who tend our livestock can take no small amount of credit for that, as they provide a world-class service.  However, it is crucial that the area is properly regulated.</P>
        <P>I would welcome clarity on a number of issues relating to the Bill.  Will the House be supplied with the list of procedures that can be carried out by unregistered practitioners?  Could we have access to a list of the procedures the Minister intends to designate as non-prescribed procedures?  We will continue to support the legislation.  We will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but there may be a need to amend it on Committee Stage.  The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is valuable and commendable and we welcome it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I echo the thoughts of Senator Mooney on the cost of medicines.  That is an area on which it would be important to have North-South co-operation as the proximity of the two markets can impinge on each other.  I would welcome all that could be done to ensure the cost of medicines is as competitive as possible because it will reduce the price to the final end-user, namely, the farmer or owner of an animal.  Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go bhfuil muid ag tac&uacute; leis an Aire agus tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis as an gcur chuige at&aacute; t&oacute;gtha aige sa ch&aacute;s seo.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  He was in my county at the weekend doing very important business.  It was an extremely successful visit, in particular from the point of view of agriculture.  We will see the rewards from the visit in the future.  I commend the Minister on it.</P>
        <P>The legislation is non-contentious and is supported by all sides of the House.  It is a question of common sense prevailing.  We are fortunate in this country that previous Governments, which includes Senator Mooney&rsquo;s party, invested in the education of young farmers.  We now have a new generation of farmers who are exceptionally competent.  They know medicines inside out.  They know all about antibiotics and the care and treatment of animals.  The Bill ensures that they can continue to provide the necessary care for their animals and that we will not face restrictions in that regard in future.</P>
        <P>Regulation is important in all walks of life and constant reform is essential.  We have seen proposals from the Minister for Justice and Equality that are not as universally acceptable as the proposals before us, but at least he is bringing forward legislation that will foster debate and discussion.  The person who will win at the end of the day is the consumer.  That is the <Col N="31"/>objective of all of us, and that is the case with the legislation with which we are currently dealing because it will ensure that there is proper competition.  Senator Bradford and others referred to veterinary nurses.  These matters are important in terms of keeping costs down and ensuring that the unit costs for farmers availing of services is kept at a reasonable level.  If this is done, the farmer will never hesitate to contact a veterinary surgeon when an intervention is required to ensure an animal&rsquo;s welfare is protected.  I take on board the point made by my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, regarding availability.  It is a difficulty I have experienced.  Although I am not from a farming background, I have acquired a great deal of knowledge from neighbours and friends.  Sometimes, access can be a problem.  A farmer should never hesitate to retain a necessary service, particularly from a financial point of view.</P>
        <P>When farmers and the people around them are competent in, for example, dosing cattle and other animals, the Bill will allow them to do so.  Since they will have the training, they will not require the services of veterinary surgeons unless necessary.</P>
        <P>In recent years, particularly the past year and a half or so, there have been significant advances in agriculture and it has become a career about which young people will be excited and in which they will engage.  They can see a livelihood in it for themselves.  There have been improvements in methodologies and ways of doing business.  Farming has been professionalised in the past decade.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the animal welfare Bill, which is necessary.  While the Bill before us is important, it is just a baby step.  The Minister&rsquo;s stewardship will ensure the welfare of animals and the farming profession.  He will also ensure that the potential of our exports will be realised and that significant new jobs will be created in farming and farming-related industries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for taking a keen interest in this legislation. I will try to answer some of their questions and reply to a number of comments.</P>
        <P>The point of this legislation is to enable the Minister to put the list of procedures together.  We are debating the legalities involved.  The list can be changed, but there will be ongoing consultation with stakeholders in that regard.  Whether it is equine dentistry, hoof paring or microchipping a horse or dog, we will consider the skill set required in a function to determine whether confining that function to a veterinary practitioner or veterinary nurse as opposed to an unlicensed or unregistered person is appropriate.</P>
        <P>Senators mentioned the animal welfare Bill, on which my Department has worked hard for the past six months.  I received it back from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office today and we should be in a position to publish it.  It is approximately 120 pages long.  I made significant additions to the draft Bill that was ready when I entered into government.  I have strong opinions on animal welfare matters that need to be addressed in legislation.  People will see that when the Bill is published.  I look forward to a significant engagement with this House on the question of animal welfare.  A number of Senators have a specific interest in this area.</P>
        <P>We are still operating on the basis of animal welfare legislation that is approximately 80 years old.  It is outdated.  For example, we cannot comprehensively deal with organised dog fights, the mutilation of horses or donkeys in family feuds, etc.  That all needs to end.  We must put legislation in place that can allow the Garda to address these problems properly.</P>
        <P>As the Senator probably knows, I have got to know my counterpart in the Northern Executive very well.  I work with her on a series of matters from CAP to CFP and in particular on the cross-Border mechanisms available to us.  We are working on a common approach to animal health and welfare, and in particular for practical reasons on disease control given that the <Col N="32"/>spread of disease does not respect borders.  We need to have a fortress Ireland approach to keeping out of Ireland diseases that can be prevented from coming here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are some risks because of the excitement about agriculture particularly owing to the pricing of beef and lamb.  Young animals are being brought into Ireland from the UK in particular and from other parts of Europe as farmers try to get their hands on calves to build up their herd sizes.  That causes a particularly difficult enforcement problem for us in ferry ports and so on given that there is the right to free movement of animals as well as the free movement of people around the European Union.  For example, in the south and south west of Britain the cattle disease that is being spread by midges needs to be kept away from this island.  That is a particular challenge and we need to do everything we can to enforce it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I take the opportunity to get a message to vets generally.  We have an ongoing discussion with vets at the moment over their supervisory role in meat factories.  Vets perform a very important standard control role within factories.  We are reviewing that role at the moment because it is my responsibility to get the best value for money we can.  There is a perception among some vets that I am somehow trying to remove vets from factories, which is not the case.  We have a panel of approximately 400 private vets whom we pay approximately &euro;18 million for their inspection and active supervision role in factories, which is very important.  We are trying to get better value for money for that service at the moment and we are talking to representatives of Veterinary Ireland.  While it is taking time to get agreement, I encourage it to talk to us in a proactive way.</P>
        <P>On indemnity insurance I was asked why there is a difference between a vet acting in a private capacity and a vet working for the Department.  The reason is that when a vet is acting in a private capacity he or she is generally performing a service for a client, for example calving or dealing with a fallen animal in a field.  If the vet makes a blunder from which the client has suffered financial loss and if there is a complaint resulting in a civil case, there needs to be indemnity to ensure that those debts can be paid.  If a vet is acting in an official capacity it normally relates to inspection or supervision and is acting on behalf of somebody else.  In those cases if there is a civil action it would normally be against the employer, which is the State or the Minister and there is no need for that vet to have legal indemnity.  That is the difference between the two.  Senators might like to look more closely at the legislation and we can return to it on Committee Stage if necessary.</P>
        <P>A number of speakers made pointed reference to the role of vets in the modernisation of farming, which is true.  For example, a few weeks ago in Kilkenny mart I launched a new initiative, which is costing us &euro;5 million this year, to encourage beef farmers, particularly suckler beef farmers, to participate in what is called a discussion group structure whereby they would challenge each other and be exposed to new, better and more profitable ways of running their business.  They would be required to take on new practices, some involving vets working with farmers to help put better commercial and animal husbandry practices in place.  They would consider matters such as stocking rates, disease control, fertility and a range of other practical measures to allow farmers become more efficient in what they do and get more from their animals and from their herds.</P>
        <P>That is the kind of proactive role from which vets can not only make a living but can also make a significant contribution to raising the overall standard of agriculture and particularly beef farming where there is a chasm between the beef farmers who do a particularly good commercial job in getting a return from the market from their herds and those who do not.  I could bore the Senators for many hours with the figures on that because I am fascinated by it. <Col N="33"/> I have responsibility to try to close that gap and move everybody in a more efficient direction, which we will do in time.</P>
      
	<P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of the cost of medicines.  I do not have any direct control over this.  The main driver behind this legislation is the cost competitiveness of farming.  It seeks to ensure that farmers do not need to pay vets to do things that farmers are more than qualified to do themselves.  If there is any evidence to suggest there is some kind of cartel developing between vets in the provision of medicines, we need to hear about it.  The Competition Authority needs to hear about it, as does the regulatory authority.</P>
        <P>In recent years we have tried to introduce more competition into the provision of veterinary medicines by, for example, allowing veterinary medicine to be sold through pharmacies, which was not the case in the past.  There is more competition and awareness of different pricing structures among farmers than there has been in the past but more work probably remains to be done.</P>
        <P>I do not have the figure for the number of veterinary places in Irish colleges, but we can give the Senator that detail.  I know that many vets in Ireland would have studied abroad, particularly in the UK.  It may be something we need to review.  The reality is that the agrifood business is growing in the midst of recession and, if I have my way, will continue to grow rapidly between now and 2020.  I want to increase the herd size from a beef and dairy point of view.  We have seen a decline every year for the past five years in the beef cattle herd, although not in the dairy herd.  The sheep flock has, however, stabilised this year and in fact it increased by 6.5% in the past 12 months.  This is the first time in a decade that we have not seen a year-on-year decrease in the national flock of sheep.  Again, this is driven by higher prices forlamb.</P>
        <P>Something is changing for the better in the agri-food sector and it is driven by commodity prices for meat and dairy products.  We are modernising agriculture to allow us to add value to products carrying the Irish label in terms of the sustainability, safety, disease control and animal husbandry that Irish food can promise.  This is allowing us to target premium markets in new areas, such as China.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are entering into a period of sustained growth in agriculture and agri-food which will continue for the next five to ten years.  There will be ups and downs along the way from a pricing point of view but the trend will be in one direction.  That means veterinary practitioners and nurses will continue to play a significant role and an increasing number of these professionals will be required to service the industry as we become more advanced and scientific in our production techniques.  That is good news for the veterinary profession.  This Bill puts in place the appropriate legislative framework to ensure the profession is properly regulated and to define in law the roles that veterinary nurses and practitioners can play.</P>
        <P>I look forward to working with the House on improving the legislation if Members put forward amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Government amendment No. 30:</P>

	<P el="0">This amendment will provide for decreases as well as increases in Civil Service pay to be applied in future to the fund disbursed annually under the Electoral Acts to qualifying political parties.  Part 3 of the Electoral Act 1997 provides for payments to be made to qualifying political parties from the Central Fund.  Given that changes are being made to section 17 of the Electoral Act 1997 to link payment to qualifying political parties to the achievement of a general balance in the candidate selection, I am taking this opportunity to introduce a further amendment which I believe is in order.</P>
        <P>Section 17(2)(<i>b</i>)(i) of that Act provides that the amount to be disbursed to qualifying parties should be linked to a general increase in remuneration.  There is no scope to apply a decrease in Civil Service pay to the fund.  Providing for an upward-only change in Exchequer funding to political parties is anomalous in the context of prevailing economic conditions and recent trends in public sector pay.  This matter was raised through an amendment by Deputy Catherine Murphy on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il during the passage of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2011 in July 2011.</P>
        <P>I did not accept the amendment at the time but I undertook to give it further consideration in consultation with Government colleagues during the preparation of this Bill.  Having given the matter consideration, the amendment is now being brought forward as part of this Bill.  The effect of the amendment will be to enable any future general decreases as well as increases in Civil Service pay to be applied to the fund.  However, the decreases that have occurred since 2008 will not be retrospectively implemented.</P>

	<P>I compliment Deputy Catherine Murphy for moving this amendment in the D&aacute;il and I compliment the Minister for accepting it.  It shows an openness, especially since it allows for a decrease in moneys to be made available and I welcome this aspect of it.  This shows that when amendments are put forward by Opposition Members, they will be accepted when they are reasonable.  I thank the Minister for doing this and I hope the public purse will be better off after the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 25, line 35, to delete &ldquo;30 per cent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;40 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Since we last spoke on this issue the representation in our Independent group has gone up by 10%.  This is a unique fact about women&rsquo;s representation in Irish politics.  Of the total number of 1,620 Seanad seats filled between 1922 and 2009, fewer than 10% have been filled by women.  Since the first D&aacute;il in 1919, there have been only 91 women Oireachtas Members.  Conse<Col N="35"/>quently, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has never had less than 85% of the women.  In the last general election only 86 of the 566 candidates were women.  Despite the number of female Deputies rising somewhat since 1997, the overall percentage of women standing at general elections has decreased.</P>
        <P>The National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland has estimated that at the current rate it will take 370 years before gender parity in political representation is achieved.  We welcome the Bill but the Independent group believes we can go further.  It is clear that women are not disinterested in politics and from my work in civil society groups I know that there are passionate, committed women working tirelessly throughout the country.  Women play a significant role in each of the political parties.  It is interesting to note the membership of the parties.  For example, Fine Gael has 42% female membership, the Labour Party has 37%, Fianna F&aacute;il has 34% and Sinn F&eacute;in has 24% female membership.  I welcome the attempts being made in the Bill but I cannot help but wonder why we are delaying the introduction of the 40% quota.  If we wait for the natural electoral cycle and, as the Government may wish, until the full term of the Parliament, it could be more than ten years before we get to a 40% quota.  The figure of 30% is the bare minimum recommended and it does nothing but delay the inevitable.  We are putting forward the amendment because it will take more than a decade to reach the 40% quota which has been recommended by the Council of Europe Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men as the minimum level of gender parity one should expect in the political sphere.</P>
        <P>As I remarked on Second Stage, I am no cheerleader for quotas and more than anything I look forward to the day when they are no longer necessary.  However, deferring the introduction of a 40% level of gender parity until one decade from now will do nothing more than place another barrier in the way of achieving a truly representative democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Regretfully, I oppose the amendment although my gut is with Senator van Turnhout.  As the Minister pointed out, in the report I authored for the justice committee on women&rsquo;s participation in politics in 2009, from which we have all been quoting, the model recommended was the original Belgian model derived from the 1994 Smet-Tobback law which stipulated a figure of one third.  At the time the recommendation seemed relatively radical and it is great to be debating against a more radical alternative of 40% now.  However, the Belgian model provides us with a useful starting point.  I am glad the figure will rise to 40% in Belgium and it took quite some time to rise to the current status of 50% following the 2002 law.  However, Belgium has had a quota of 30% in place since 1994 and it has had the desired effect in moving the numbers upwards.</P>
        <P>A strong report published by the Interparliamentary Union on gender sensitive parliaments examined this topic and referred to some countries which have moved to a figure of 50%.  I am keen to see us going in that direction.  As the leader of a group in the Seanad with 50% women representation and as a member of a party with 100% female MEPs, that is, all three of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; the target of 30% is not especially radical for the Labour Party and perhaps it will be a little too easy for us.  However, it is different for other parties and this was why the conference of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was so important.  The conference concluded that it will be quite a challenge for other parties to reach 30%.  We want this to be realistic.  As the Interparliamentary Union report noted, the key point is that sanctions are in place, that the teeth are in the legislation and that parties which do not meet <Col N="36"/>the required target of 30% rising to 40% will be subject to sanction.  This will make the legislation effective.  While I appreciate the sentiment with which Deputy van Turnhout brings forward the amendment and I have a good deal of instinctive support for it, I believe the version of the Bill before us recommended in 2009 is a more practical and workable model.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to support our group amendment.  I welcome the Minister and congratulate him and the Government on driving this historic Bill through.  The reason I am a little cranky with regard to sticking to 40% has to do with an amendment we will probably raise on Report Stage with regard to the magical seven years.  I know this concerns a different section, but it has to do with my reason for pressing this amendment.  Section 27(<i>b</i>)(ii) states: &ldquo;ceases to have effect on the polling day at the general election held next after expiration of 7 years from the polling day . . .&rdquo;.  While we hope for political stability in our Republic for the next couple of years, this could mean three or more general elections between increasing to 40%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>There were three in the period 1981-2.  There appears to be a reluctance in the Bill to go from 30% to 40% as quickly as possible.  Therefore, I regretfully disagree with Senator Bacik.  We could be waiting quite a long time to jump from 30% to 40%,as the 40% would be introduced seven years after the next general election.  I am open to correction on this and will be happy to be corrected.  It is for that reason that I support going to 40% immediately rather than waiting for what could be 13 or 14 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like Senator Bacik, as a woman I would like to see 50:50 representation straight away rather than by 2020.  However, we must recognise that we must crawl before we walk and cannot run at this all guns blazing.  I presume when the legislation was being drawn up cognisance was taken of the recommendation by the 2009 sub-committee on women&rsquo;s participation in politics, which was chaired by Senator Bacik, for 30%.  That recommendation obviously had a great bearing on the decisions being made and consideration would have been taken of who held seats, where they were held, gender and so on.  We must look forward.  As the Minister pointed out, the legislation recommends at least 30% women candidates within the seven years.  I would like to see the seven year period reduced and hope there may be a way to consider that on Report Stage.  Perhaps when an election is called, we should look at that issue.</P>
        <P>The legislation states &ldquo;at least 30%&rdquo;, but we do not have to stick at 30%.  It could be 40%.  We must recognise that the legislation only provides for putting women on the ticket and does not mean that they must get that percentage of seats.  As I have said before, I have not been a fan of quotas, but I realise they are inevitable and that we will not have the representation without them.  As Senator van Turnhout has said, it would take years if we did not set a quota.  Therefore, quotas are necessary.</P>
        <P>I oppose the amendment.  I compliment the Minister on being the first Minister to advance this.  We have had many Governments and much talk about it, but he has taken up the issue and run with it.  We should be thankful for small mercies, 30% is better than 0%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for being present again.  Nothing succeeds like success.  Therefore, if we can achieve the 30% that germ of success will create further success and encourage other women to come forward.  The idea of pushing the quota to 40% may make it more like a chore, a task or struggle or something to argue about and therefore take some of the goodness from it.  I echo Senator Bacik&rsquo;s reluctance to make it 40%, although I would like that in theory.  Women are known for their realism and this is a time they need to be realists and to accept the figure of &ldquo;at least 30%&rdquo; is a reasonable objective.  There are many people for whom the idea of putting a quota in place is difficult, so that debate must still take place.  There are many women around the country who are interested in becoming involved in political and public life, but we will need some time to persuade them to be involved.  We must show this works and that it can bring in women in a measured and organised way and in a way that is sustainable for political parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I too attended the conference held by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It is clear that finding women candidates will be a greater struggle for some parties.  I do not wish to see parties paying penalties, but would prefer to see parties succeeding.  If we get at least 30%, we are well on the road to the 40% and, ultimately, to 50:50 by 2020, although that might be slightly further away.  That is what I strive for and advocate.  Nothing succeeds like success and this legislation, as it is framed, is a realistic and good approach to a difficult issue that will give rise to discussion for many months to come.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue as I was unsuccessful in my attempt to speak on two previous occasions because we ran out of time.  I support this initiative and believe the recommendation of the committee for 30% representation is realistic and should be supported.  We spoke about achieving a cultural change in Irish politics and this is as much about achieving that cultural change as it is about imposing quotas.  If we move cautiously towards achieving success in this regard, that will, as Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe said, breed further success.  Seeing concrete examples of a successful initiative will surely encourage all the political parties and those involved to buy into this important initiative.  Reluctantly therefore, I will be unable to support the amendment because moving cautiously and slowly towards achieving cultural change is more important for the longer term than an immediate and unsustainable short term success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that 30%, or three out of ten, is a small amount.  The problem is that we are starting at 15% and trying to double that.  While that is a marginal level of progress, it will be a significant challenge.  I welcome the legislation, but my concern is that we should not only ensure that 30% of candidates are women, but that we should ensure that percentage is elected.  The real challenge will be to ensure that women who run are not turned off by the process and that they get the support they need from their respective parties.  I welcome the fact that groups like Women for Election and non-partisan groups will get behind female candidates of all parties and help them get elected.  My concern is that if we set <Col N="38"/>the quota at 40% straight away &mdash; I wish this was not the overly high target it is &mdash; we might make it harder to get more people elected.  I would rather see the quota set at 30% and for us to achieve representation of 30% in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I strongly agree with the point made by Senator Mac Conghail in respect of the length of time between getting to the 40% from 30%.  I would like to see that gap narrowed and perhaps that could be looked at on Report Stage.  Going straight to 40% would be too much, although I wish not.  If we can achieve the 30%, double what we have now, and can get women elected to the D&aacute;il, that will be fantastic.  We can then move towards the 40% as quickly as possible.  I agree on the substantive point, that it will take too long to get to 40%.  We should start at 30% and then get to 40% as quickly as possible.  Perhaps we can look at a different amendment in that regard on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The debate has moved onto whether the quota should be 40% or 30%.  Thank God we are back to item No. 1 on the Irish political agenda; namely, the split.  The former Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, once suggested that a piece of political research might work in practice, but questioned whether it would work in theory.  We are debating whether a piece of political theory will work in practice by making a genuine difference.</P>
        <P>We all agree with Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s remark that women are not disinterested in politics.  I wonder whether we are trying to bring about a perfect form of politics.  Have we decided that perfect politics means absolute equality of representation between the sexes, the generations, the socioeconomic sectors of society and urban and rural areas?  I do not think politics can be perfect.  That is why this legislation will pose as many questions as it will answer.  Politics is a bit like life in the sense that there are no clear, sharp or black and white definitions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Thousands of men and women in this country are hugely interested in politics but do not wish to be elected politicians.  They are happy to be political party officers, researchers, press office officials, branch or cumann members, canvassers or organisers.  They are politicians who have chosen not to put their names on a ballot paper.  I wonder whether we are getting it wrong in our desire to develop perfect politics with what we believe to be total equality.  The design of perfect politics should start with a review of our electoral system.  It should include a review of the operation of the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and local government.  All of that will have to feed into the development of perfect politics.  We are addressing a small portion of it.</P>
     
	<P>This debate has been concluded in the sense that this legislation will be voted through and the 30% candidate quota will come into effect.  I understand that amendments proposing that the 40% quota be introduced more quickly, or proposing its removal, are to be tabled.  I hope it will disappear as quickly as possible.  It is more important for us to take steps to facilitate more women to stand for politics, as Senator Gilroy said when he spoke about the culture of politics in this country.  Such measures could address our working hours and our electoral system, for example.</P>
        <P>I understand that the constitutional commission is considering a review of our electoral system.  If some type of list system were to be introduced, as has been done in most European countries and democracies worldwide, the Bill before the House would not be needed.  When the party bosses produce their candidate lists, they take account of what they consider to be equality.  That would be one way of bringing about equality, if we are absolutely serious about it.  If a list system is introduced as part of our electoral process, each party could ensure men and women are equally represented on the top echelons of its list.  We seem set to design a <Col N="39"/>form of perfect politics that requires 50% women and 50% men.  If we absolutely believe in it, we could do it through a list system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This debate needs to be much more holistic, rather than focusing on gender or candidate quotas.  We have to look far and wide when we consider how we practise politics in this country and what constitutes our political class.  The Minister knows I have believed for a long time that any action in this regard must begin and end with an evaluation of the electoral system in this country, which is a political joke.  Obviously, I believe that most of the political blame for the economic mess the country is in rests with a single political party.  As a society, however, we are very lucky that we have survived as long as we have with the sort of political system we have.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If one wants to be a success as a national politician and to remain a national politician, one has to practise as a local politician.  If a business was run in the way we try to run the political system in this country, it would not survive for very long.  We do not have good politics.  We do not have thinking politics.  We do not have debating politics.  We do not have a politics that puts a premium on Members coming into this House and the other House to propose ideas, amendments and suggestions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Whip system, the electoral system and the party system are absolutely out of date and not fit for purpose.  We should be praying novenas of thanks that this country did not go down the tubes earlier than it did as a result of what we call politics in this country.  When we finally draw a dividing line between local politics and national politics and review our electoral system, that is when we will begin to make real political progress.  When we change the system of government in this country in order that it is no longer the case that 15 of the Members of the other House have all the power and the other 150 Deputies might as well stay at home, that is when we will send a message to the public that politics matters.</P>
        <P>We need to ensure that backbenchers in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad have a say in the running of this country.  That is much more important than how many Members of the Oireachtas are male or female, or how many of them are under or over the age of 25.  We should bear in mind that approximately 40% of the electorate are under the age of 35.  Equally, in the coming years those over the age of 65 will comprise a more substantial proportion of the electorate.  Therefore, we should consider whether we need a quota for senior citizens in this country, who will almost comprise a majority of the electorate in the near future.  Do we need a quota for people under the age of 35, who will have to foot the bill for our economic distress for generations to come?  Do we need a quota for other marginalised people?  This debate is fairly endless.  To use an awful political phrase, however, we are where we are and the 30% candidate quota is likely to be voted through.  I hope we will move beyond it as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister has a huge interest in politics in its broadest formats.  I would love to see him come to this House over the next three or four years with a reform of politics Bill.  Perhaps that will emerge from the constitutional convention.  I hope the Minister will try to impress some of his ideas on the convention.  We need to make progress with an examination of how politics works in this country.  We need to reflect on the fact that what we call politics is not much more than localism.  It is in this context that real progress can be made.  I hope we will move beyond this short-term thinking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although this measure might be necessary &mdash; other measures have not worked as well as they should have &mdash; we need to ask ourselves how women are treated by this House, the other <Col N="40"/>House and politics in general.  The same questions apply to other social groups.  Young people and the elderly are very removed from politics.  We have to answer many questions of this kind.  This is the beginning of the much broader debate that is needed if we want to ensure that politics in this country is real and meaningful.  We should stop rubber-stamping the Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Jack-in-the-Box politics whereby one gets away with it, bizarrely, when one says one thing in government and the very opposite in opposition six months later.  That is what we need to change.</P>

He picked up where he left off on Second Stage by saying some things that really need to be said.  We should be grateful to him for opening up the debate in this way.  I have listened with interest to the responses to the proposal made by Senators van Turnhout and Mac Conghail that the required percentage should be 40% rather than 30%.  I hope Senator Power will forgive me when I say I was a little amused to hear her say she is not ready to go that far just yet.

	<P>Indeed, as she always does.  Senator Bradford picked up on the point Senator van Turnhout made about women not being disinterested in politics.  That is absolutely true.  Women are not disinterested in politics.  They are affected by politics as much as men are.  That is why it is important for women to be well represented in politics.  Their particular insights should be heard in the political arena.  The concerns of women should always be ventilated at the highest level.  That did not happen for many years.  Despite not having achieved equal representation for women in politics or even anything like equal representation, much has changed on that front.  Undoubtedly, there is still some way to go and I have talked on Second Stage about the changes I think are really necessary.  I do not like the tokenism nor the intrusiveness of what is proposed in this legislation.  I think it interposes between the people and the political system in a way that is quite inappropriate and this is why I referred to it on Second Stage as social engineering.  I do not resile from that opinion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking to that amendment.  I was about to say that while women are certainly not disinterested in politics, many of them may be uninterested in the particular role of running for election and perhaps that is part of the story as to why we do not have the representation that we would like.  The question is whether we should try to force the system forward a little by creating disincentives for those political parties who would not have a certain percentage of female candidates on their lists or whether we should try to promote &mdash; as Senator Bradford has said &mdash; a more healthy political system that is more attractive to people to become involved.  I am speaking to the amendment on this.</P>
        <P>I know many people who watch our debates and they hear the conflict-based nature of much of what passes for debate in these Houses.  They report that this really turns them off more than anything else from either getting involved in politics themselves and running for election or even from taking an interest in politics.  I have no doubt there are many women among those who are turned off and who become uninterested as distinct from disinterested in that way.  Those are the real problems that we need to address.  What Senator Bradford has to say is very much on point when he talks about the current inequities of the political system and what really needs to change.  Having listened to Senator Bradford, we all know that if it were left to a free vote, he would be voting against this Bill in its current form.  I hope I am not speaking out of turn but that is certainly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I come here with a certain amount of baggage.  I reminded myself that when I was a member of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe, I published a report through the Committee on Equality Opportunities for Women and Men which went <Col N="45"/>through the assembly in 2004.  In the context of the amendment, one of the comments was that the under-representation of women in elected office hampers the full democratic development of most Council of Europe member states.  In the context of the earlier remarks about extending this amendment to other minority groups, we are talking here about increasing the representation of women in Parliament.</P>
        <P>The report went on to state that we all have a duty to ensure European standards within the democratic election process are met and that women are given a fair chance to both freely elect the candidate of their choice and to be elected themselves.  Rather interestingly, one of the recommendations I made at that time &mdash; there were approximately 14 recommendations &mdash; referred to taking action through the public funding of political parties in order to encourage them to promote gender equality, which is precisely what this legislation is about.</P>
        <P>The report also pointed out that in order to achieve critical mass, the aspiration should be for 40%.  It went on to state that there is a time limit in this regard.  Keeping in mind that this report was adopted in 2004, the aspiration was that by 2020, there would be 40% representation in the Parliament.  On that basis, the Government is finding a middle way here.  It is going for a realistic aspiration in opting for 30%.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the action it is contemplating in regard to public funding will concentrate minds.</P>
        <P>In the context of the amendment, I am sure the Minister will agree it is not sufficient just to put in a legislative model or legislative benchmark and state that everything will flow from that and that there will be quality and quantity as result of it.  As the report recommended, the Minister should also be of a mind to undertake awareness raising measures in order to bring about a lasting change of attitudes and traditions throughout Europe and not just in Ireland to ensure the full participation of women in elections at all levels and in all respects.  In that context, the recommendations went on to recommend that specific training and publicity packages should be developed to encourage women to contest elections.</P>
        <P>Even in the context of the Council of European report, which looked for 40%, and even at that time, there was a realistic assessment of where we were.  Six or seven years later and given where we are now, it seems the Government is striking a reasonably realistic balance, as my colleague Senator Power said.  She put it very well in one of her interjections that she would much prefer if we were moving closer to more than 30% rather than falling short of 40%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the lateness of the hour, I shall resist the temptation to give a disposition on the Immaculate Conception which Senator Mooney so tantalisingly drew for us.  If logically followed, which no piece of dogmatic theology ever is, it leads to the complete destruction of the notion of original sin.  However, putting that to one side, may I say that I am in favour of a general reflection of the population?  If one is going to have a mathematical reflection of the population, one should look for 51% because, as I understand, women are in the peculiar situation of being in the majority.</P>
        <P>Given that he has certain views about this House, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the fact that this House has certainly had one woman Cathaoirleach or I think two women Cathaoirligh whereas his House has never had a woman Ceann Comhairle.  We are an advance and we also have higher participation by women.  We are a little bit further along the way the Minister appears to wish to push the country rather than his House, so perhaps he could take a little bit of a lesson from us.</P>
        <P>This is social engineering but I do not have Senator Mullen&rsquo;s problem with it.  When issues of social benefit do not move fast enough, they must be given a discrete nudge but, at the same time, that sometimes means people get bruised in the process.  If I were in a political party and <Col N="46"/>were a male candidate who was passed over simply because of a gender quota by somebody who I regarded as my intellectual, moral and physical inferior, I would feel really upset if this person was selected simply because she was female.  I hope this will be a transition period and that it will wither away.  I hope also we will not be kind of nitpicking about it.</P>
        <P>Maybe it would be great if there was gay representation because gay people comprise approximately 10% of the population.  There is an even greater discrimination there because we know people are afraid to reveal themselves but there is an increase as there are now openly gay Members in both Houses.  That is a very welcome development.  One of them is a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee.  That shows we are growing up as a country, which is terrific.  There was not all that much social engineering, except the nomination by the Taoiseach, and I honour and respect him for it.  However, I do not think the person I am thinking of &mdash; it would be invidious to name anybody &mdash; who is a very distinguished public figure was nominated simply because of her sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>I have a couple of observations on the bland generalisations which have come from all sides of the House, such as women are more realistic than men.  Are they?  Some are but some are wonderfully unrealistic dreamers, thank God.  Some of them conceal their essential nastiness under a guise of realism just as some men do.  I am pretty bloody realistic because I know that despite the fact that everybody says this is a great amendment, they will not vote for it, so it will not get through.  Let us cut the crap, get on with it and vote on the amendment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another generalisation is that not only are women realists, which some of them are, but that they are interested in politics and are not disinterested in it.  Many of them are interested in politics but I have bad news for the House.  The vast majority of the population of this country are uninterested in politics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>We have really good debates in this House but I do not think generalisations help even if they are well intentioned.  Poor old Albert Reynolds, who at the end of the day was a decent man, got into frightful trouble for an off the cuff remark &mdash; &ldquo;Sure that is women for you&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Generalisation can be dangerous because they always conceal a complex situation.  This is an attempt to create a situation where we have a more general reflection of the population and, as such, I can only regard it as democratic.  I will support the amendment but let us get on with it and vote on it because that is the realistic thing to do.  All of us are either women or not realistic or whatever.  Let us be realistic and get on with it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment in the names of Senators Mac Conghail and van Turnhout and others relates to section 27 and proposes changing the requirement which we have been discussing for political parties to have at least 30% women and 30% men to 40% men and 40% women.  The section to which the amendment relates facilitates the general increase in participation of women in national politics.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the people to decide whether they want to vote for men or women.</P>
        <P>This is about participation.  The Bill amends section 17 of the Electoral Act 1997 to provide that political parties will have their funding cut unless at least 30% of their candidates are women and at least 30% are men.  No political party will be stopped from having a proportion greater than 30% if it wishes.  Parties will have their funding cut if they do not take the provision <Col N="47"/>seriously.  The same is not required of Independents.  The requirement to have quotas of 40% for men and 40% for women will be considered after a specified period, but no sooner than seven years after the general election to which the legislation will first apply.</P>
        <P>In the Bill, we have adopted a very ambitious approach.  Despite our having made a radical proposal potentially doubling the participation of women in elections, the amendment suggests this is not enough.  Some 15.19% of candidates at the February 2011 election were women.  The 30% requirement I propose will effectively double the rate of participation by women and, potentially, their electoral success rate at the next general election.</P>
        <P>We all recall it was this section of the Bill that received the most attention during Second Stage, notwithstanding the importance of all the other provisions.  In responding to that debate, during which many suggested the Bill should go further, I stated the legislation was a significant step and that its provisions represented a seismic shift in our approach to gender equality.  I stated we must be mindful of how far the provisions of the Bill actually go.  It will be a challenge to meet the 30% requirement.  I hope this challenge will be met by the political parties and those involved in politics.  They will know the consequences if it is not.</P>
        <P>I have tried to examine this matter in the context of what is practical and pragmatic in regard to the cultural shift to which Senator Gilroy quite rightly referred and in regard to setting the bar too high initially.  It is not a matter of penalising people for not achieving a very reasonable proposition to enhance the participation of women in politics.</P>

	<P>Senator Mullen was very academic and theoretical regarding the argument but he does not understand the practical realities on the ground facing political parties and how difficult is sometimes is for a large party to enhance the number of female participants in the political system.  It is not as easy as the Senator believes.  This Bill is about enhancing the opportunity of women to become involved in politics.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The State funding provided for political parties under the electoral legislation is to be used, in part, to enhance and promote participation by women in political activity.  The taxpayer is already doing a bit, although it may not be noticed.</P>
        <P>It is a matter also for the political parties to do more.  I do not want to be prescriptive in legislation and hammer political parties financially in the short term on foot of doubling, to 30%, potential representation by women in the national Parliament.  That is ultimately a matter for the people to decide democratically.  The Government is providing people with an opportunity to decide whether they want more gender equality.  Some of the musings I heard on political reform and quotas in respect of other aspects of life were completely wide of the mark.  This is about political participation.  The political system has failed to have broader female representation in the Oireachtas.</P>

Anybody who believes that is not a reasonable and pragmatic approach does not understand the practical reality of what happens on the ground in regard to political parties ensuring they have a sufficient numbers necessary to meet the requirements.</P>
        <P>The Independent Senators should note that this amendment, by stipulating a figure of 40%, could be a little opportunistic considering that I am already achieving 100% more than has been achieved to date.</P>

I was very encouraged to hear so many supporting the view that even 40% is not enough and that we should aim for a ratio of 50:50 by 2020.  My colleague, Senator Mullen, agreed with the principle of increasing female representation in politics and this is extremely encouraging.</P>
        <P>The Bill is welcome and has the capacity to achieve transformation.  However, this is not a new issue for us.  In 2001, the European Parliament passed a resolution seeking a proportion <Col N="49"/>of 40%.  In 2003, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Committee of Ministers adopted a resolution stating representation of either women or men in any decision-making in political or public life should not fall below 40%.  In 2008, the European Parliament showed that gender quotas have led to dramatic, remarkable and rapid increases in female representation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My apologies to the Minister.  I left the House to get a message, presuming there would be a vote but that did not happen.  </P>
	<P Just="Left">Bantry Harbour has a viable harbour board, which is self-sufficient in that it costs the State little or no money.  I am a former member of the board.  There has been a sizeable income for the harbour board for the past 15 or 20 years, primarily due to the input of funds from ConocoPhillips.  There was a proposal from the Minister's predecessor, Noel Dempsey, to amalgamate Bantry Harbour with Cork Port.  I resisted this because of my knowledge of Bantry Bay and the area.  Former and current members of Cork Port inform me that they do not want the proposal to take place.  Apart from Whiddy Island, there are many intricacies in Bantry.  It is designated as a tourist hub, there is inshore fishing and fish farming in the bay.  Garnish Island is nearby and people are living on Whiddy Ireland.  The Bantry Harbour Board area comprises 80% of Bantry Bay, from Bere Island to Ardnagashel and across the bay. </P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Bantry Harbour board was set up because of an appalling oil spillage in the bay in 1974.  The then Minister, Peter Barry, decided to set up a harbour board because of shipping and the oil reserves on Whiddy Ireland.  The board has been run successfully and much money has been spent within the harbour board area by the existing board.  The board provided a slipway on Whiddy Ireland, with support from the council and the Government, and a slipway on the mainland.  For the first time in my life, there is a roll-on roll-off service onto the island, which can be used by an ambulance or a fire brigade.  Having been in town on the night of the Whiddy Ireland disaster, I remember the appalling loss of life and that many mistakes were made.  On the basis of providing funds or providing a proper service for the island, ConocoPhillips, shipping in the bay and tourism services, including yachting, there is a mixed grill of facilities in the bay.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>Bantry Harbour is self-financing and should stand alone on its merits.  When I was a member of the harbour board, we were presented with the option of being taken over by Cork County Council, going down the road of corporatisation &mdash; which was my preference &mdash; or being taken over by Cork Port.  The views of the people in the area, by a large majority, and the near-unanimous view of the harbour board members over the past 20 years is that the least acceptable option is to succumb to Cork Port taking over the board.  There may be good commercial reasons for it.  I had a four and a half hour debate, which some may call filibustering, where I took issue with the former Minister, Noel Dempsey, about the port authority and a compromise was reached whereby there would be full and proper consultation with the inshore fishermen, the islanders, the tourism organisations and other facets of Bantry Bay before that should happen.  Bantry Bay is a unique harbour and I am sure the Minister is aware of the situation.  I am worried that the same catalyst for change that existed four years ago is still in the Department.  The proposal to amalgamate harbours works in some cases and does not in others, but Bantry is unique.  I urge the Minister to leave us as we are.  The notion of being taken over by Cork Port is the least acceptable option and one that will be strongly resisted, even by Deputies and councillors of the Government parties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The existing policy on regional harbours is as published in the 2005 ports policy statement, namely, that the continued operation of harbours under the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance.  It proposed that harbours would best achieve their potential through a transfer to local authority ownership or, in the case where harbours had significant commercial traffic; that consideration would be given to bring them under the control of a port company.  My Department has worked with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government over the past number of years to progress the transfers.  The transfer of harbours is consistent with the objectives of a reduction in the number of State agencies, strengthening corporate governance of significant State assets, unlocking amenity value of the assets to the benefit of local communities, and enabling the repeal of the Harbours Act 1946.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 12 out of a total of 13 harbours have now transferred.  In the past few months, Fenit Harbour transferred to Kerry County Council while Baltimore, Kinsale and Arklow harbours transferred to local authorities on 1 January 2012.  Bantry Bay Harbour is now the only remaining harbour operating under the Harbours Act 1946.  The core business of Bantry Harbour is the oil storage and transhipment terminal on Whiddy Island.  The ConocoPhillips oil facilities on Whiddy Island are privately owned.  Aquaculture, fishing and tourism are prevalent in the harbour and a small number of cruise liners also visit the harbour each year.  The KPMG review of regional ports and harbours published in 1999 first recommended that the harbour authority merge with the Port of Cork.  Amalgamation with Cork would provide access to port expertise, marketing, strategic development, planning and the skills required for the regulation of navigation, ship and port security requirements, pilotage, safety, emergency response and pollution etc.  Provision was included in the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2009 to allow the amalgamation of Bantry Harbour with the Port of Cork.  The Act provides that public consultation must be completed before the transfer can take place and outlines how that consultation should take place in section 18(2)(<i>d</i>).</P>
        <P Just="Left">Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners is the responsible authority under the Harbours Act 1946 for the control, operation and development of Bantry Harbour.  Its main role relates to jurisdiction over the waters, for example, responsibility for safety, navigation and pilotage etc.  The operation of large oil tankers, bulk carriers and cruise liners in and out of the bay requires <Col N="51"/>specific expertise.  The Port of Cork company currently provides a harbourmaster service on a contract basis to assist in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Work commenced earlier this year to examine the requirements to amalgamate the harbour with the Port of Cork.  The process is complex and will include meetings with the Port of Cork and the harbour commissioners, due diligence on Bantry Harbour and an examination of a range of issues, including remedial works, foreshore issues, staff, legal cases and financial accounts, to name but a few.  A meeting was held recently between my Department and the Port of Cork, which is positive about the transfer and willing to work with the Department and the harbour towards this objective.  Cork already has a very good professional relationship with ConocoPhillips through the oil refinery in Cork Harbour.  The Port of Cork also has a contractual arrangement with Bantry to provide professional expertise and a harbour master to bring in large oil tankers and cruise liners into the bay.  This is an absolute requirement by the company to operate their business in Whiddy to help mitigate the risks of maritime accidents and environmental damage.  A general discussion also took place between my Department and the chairman of the harbour commissioners on a range of issues that will have to be dealt with before any transfer can take place.  It is likely that the harbour commissioners will raise a number of issues relating to the proposed transfer and my Department will work closely with the harbour commissioners and with the Port of Cork to address any concerns raised.  I will pay close attention to local views on the matter and engage with all stakeholders.  There are no proposals to amend the jurisdiction of the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners geographical area as it stands.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his frank response.  I am aware of the KPMG report, one of eight dealing with the future of Bantry Harbour.  The most recent report was carried out by Ray Burke &mdash; not the politician &mdash; and suggested Bantry might be better served as a stand alone harbour.  When the gun is put to the Minister&rsquo;s head on the point of amalgamation, I hope he will take into consideration the diverse local concerns.  Someone from the Port of Cork authority, whose name I will not reveal, told me not so long ago that it is fine to take over responsibility for ConocoPhillips and the operation of Whiddy Ireland, which may increase its capacity and revenue and would be a win-win but the takeover would also involve fish farming and its problems in the bay, tourism, Whiddy Island, liners and other issues.  It is a complex area and the Port of Cork will walk away from a takeover unless it is forced to act because the takeover would cause more problems than the Port of Cork would like.  It is not as simple as taking over the Whiddy Ireland project and the ConocoPhillips project, which is important to Bantry, the south of Ireland and the State.  I thank the Minister for his response.  I had the same arguments with the previous Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the issue and he can be assured I will listen to local views.  No rushed decision will be made and the provisions in the legislation on public consultation must be followed.  The issue arises because this is the last of 13 harbours and the only one operating under the Harbours Act 1946, which must be repealed sooner rather than later.  The Senator mentioned that Bantry Harbour is self-financing, which is true in regard to operating costs, but it requires capital from the State, which will not be forthcoming forever.  While corporatisation as an independent port company could be considered as an alternative to a merger with the Port of Cork, questions must be answered in that regard.  We have a number of port companies that are not doing very well, one of which is Dundalk, which failed last year.  Corporatisation brings costs and obligations that may be difficult.  It is not right <Col N="52"/>to rule out corporatisation as an option but there are significant risks in going down that road as an alternative.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.  This issue has been amplified in this House and elsewhere over a period of time.  I note that the recent communication from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade showed a direct saving from closing the Vatican Embassy of &euro;400,000 and another saving from transferring the Italian Embassy.  I recognise that in the current climate there is a need for all Departments to cut costs.  I understand the embassy in the Vatican was one of the most cost-effective, with an ambassador, a Third Secretary and local administration assistance.</P>
        <P>We should examine the salaries paid to ambassadors.  I was very surprised to discover, many years ago, that some ambassadors are on a salary commensurate with the position of Secretary General of a Department and all others are paid at assistant secretary level.  Given that most expenses are covered, perhaps these salary levels feed into costs and restrict our footprint.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste stated, at the joint committee meeting and in the Seanad, that if a more cost-effective solution was found he would consider it.  He mentioned co-location as a possibility and it would assist in changing the decision and reopening the embassy.  Ireland Stand Up appeared before the joint committee today and made some very reasonable points.  It would be a pity if the issue became political because it is not about that.  Some people in my party, some people in Fine Gael and some people in the Labour Party feel strongly about it.  The focus has come upon the latter because the T&aacute;naiste is the leader of the Labour Party.  Many people would like to see the situation revert to the <i>status quo</i> since 1929.  We have a long-established relationship with the Vatican, which was the fourth mission established abroad following our independence.  After the Lateran Treaty, when the Vatican state was established, Ireland was one of the first to establish an embassy.  Up to that point, we had representation at the League of Nations, someone in London and someone in Washington.  It was good for us because it provided recognition and, as a strongly Catholic country, it was appropriate and reasonable.</P>
        <P>Last July, the T&aacute;naiste stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Consideration of proposals to reduce our diplomatic network must balance any potential financial savings against the operational and reputational costs that would be incurred, including undermining our ability to influence the policies of the State in question and writing off investments made over years in the bilateral relationships with the countries in question.  At a time when Ireland needs as much international support and co-operation as possible, it is important to get these decisions right.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister of State and, I am sure, the T&aacute;naiste will know Ireland has always placed considerable emphasis on pursuing its human rights agenda in other countries and at home.  The Minister of State will acknowledge the Vatican was a great ally in that regard.  Freedom of speech, assembly and religion, and measures against intolerance and discrimination, are all very much featured by the Vatican.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like us to consider the subdivision of the Villa Spada.  I understand this can be done as I was there once.  As there are a number of entrances, there could be a separate entrance and, perhaps, a separate wing of the building dedicated to an embassy to the Vatican.  There would be no rental cost and the moneys would already have been saved owing to the rental <Col N="53"/>associated with the Italian Embassy.  There would be a small incremental cost attached.  There is obviously a cost attached to having a non-resident ambassador.  The incremental cost would be reasonable.</P>
        <P>I would like to believe we could consider my proposal prior to the Eucharistic Congress.  Many people will be attending the congress in Ireland in June.  I hope the Vatican can be asked directly about co-location.  It should be told that we would consider the option favourably and try to achieve agreement with it in that regard.  I encourage the State to make this known.  If it did, there would be a positive response from the Vatican to enable my proposal to be implemented.  Many people feel very hurt over what has occurred.  I would like to believe this proposal will be taken on board in the spirit in which I am making it.  I hope it will lead to a resolution.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  The decision to close Ireland&rsquo;s resident embassy to the Holy See, in addition to our embassy in Tehran and mission in Timor-Leste, was taken by the Government in response to budgetary pressures and on the recommendation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which sought to assess where budgetary cuts would least affect the national interest at this time of economic crisis.</P>
        <P>In addition to the immediate financial savings, the nature of the responsibilities of the embassy to the Holy See, particularly the fact that it is not involved in consular work or trade promotion, makes it more suitable than most embassies to be covered by non-resident accreditation.  Nobody pretends this is an ideal arrangement, but it is the most cost-effective in the current budgetary situation.</P>
        <P>The total cost saving in a full year from the closure is estimated at &euro;845,000.  Some &euro;400,000 of this will come from the closure of the resident embassy to the Holy See.  An additional &euro;445,000 in savings will come from the transfer of Ireland&rsquo;s embassy to Italy from its previous, rented premises to the State-owned Villa Spada.</P>
        <P>For what I understand are historical reasons, the Holy See does not accept accreditation from a resident embassy that is also accredited to Italy.  It is not acceptable for one ambassador to be accredited to both states, nor is it acceptable for embassies to the Italian Republic and the Holy See to operate from the same address.  It would not be possible for the Villa Spada, as presently configured, to accommodate both embassies in different buildings with separate addresses.</P>
        <P>The Holy See has agreed to the nomination of the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. David Cooney, as our non-resident ambassador to the Holy See.  It is expected that he will present his credentials to Pope Benedict in May.  Mr. Cooney has travelled to Rome three times since his nomination for meetings with Vatican officials, and will continue to travel there regularly.</P>
        <P>The decision to close the resident embassy to the Holy See will not be reversed in the immediate term.  The unavoidable budgetary cuts and the reduction in staff numbers that necessitated the closure are still in effect and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has neither the staff nor the financial resources to reverse the mission closures decided upon by the Government last November.  However, as the economic circumstances improve, and in the context of the regular review of our diplomatic network, it may be possible to revisit the matter at some time in the future.  If the Vatican is prepared to relax its current requirements so as to allow the State-owned Villa Spada to serve as a location for our embassies to both Italy and the Holy See, that can be taken into account in any future considerations.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="54"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two points.  I welcome the last sentence of the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  This issue was brought to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs and he rejected the concept of closure.  The overall budget for the Department is &euro;150 million.  The saving was quite small, therefore.  If the Department considers financial and staffing resources, it should be possible for it to do as I propose if there is a relaxation of the Vatican&rsquo;s current requirements.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to encourage the T&aacute;naiste to initiate discussions with the Holy See with a view to resolving this matter.  There are many doors in the Villa Spada and, therefore, my proposal could work.  I am aware the Holy See would seek a separate address from that of the Italian embassy but that could obviously be done quite easily by using a separate entrance, subdividing the building and retaining the small staff that was in place.  I urge the Minister of State to determine whether this issue can be resolved.  It will not go away.  It has caused angst among many people and the campaign will only grow.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I will certainly take on board what the Senator said.  I will inform the T&aacute;naiste of his views on the last paragraph of my response.  I will certainly clarify the matter for the Senator.</P>
