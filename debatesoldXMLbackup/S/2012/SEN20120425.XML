	<P>I have received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to include the new schools building projects for Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Gort a&rsquo; Choirce, County Donegal and St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Stranorlar, County Donegal in the Department&rsquo;s five year capital programme given that so much detailed preparatory work has taken place to date.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Martin Conway of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline when he plans to build a community school in Ennistymon, County Clare to replace the three existing second level schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kathryn Reilly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to discuss the progress made to date to establish the panel for hearing and determining appeals on turf cutting and harvesting rights, the timetable for its establishment, when the panel will begin its work and when appeals will be heard.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Denis Landy of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Defence to provide information on the reasons for delays in the provision of premises for the Reserve Defence Force to meet and carry out weekly training in Clonmel and Mullingar and to advise when premises will be provided at both locations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a distinct lack of Fine Gael Members this morning.  Is there truth to the rumour that we have an event in Punchestown today?  I hope our colleagues have brought their wellies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on at 4 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>This brings us back to when we discussed the issue of corporate donations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not too sure how appropriate this is to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I think it is appropriate, because the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government came into this House two weeks ago and explained to Members why it is not appropriate to ban corporate donations.  We have found out in the interim that the Fine Gael Party has been going around the country hoovering up the last of the corporate donations it will be able to receive, such as in my own town of Malahide this Friday, Punchestown today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They have huge hoovers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret the weather has not been kind to the party, but it is appropriate we revisit this and have a look at the advice the Minister gave to this House when he said it was unconstitutional to ban corporate donations.  In fairness, we have heard certain rebuttals from different Ministers who have said they will do what they like at the moment because the legislation has not changed.  That is for another day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate on the Croke Park agreement?  I noted with interest comments by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday, and in recent months a divide appears to have formed between the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party on where they stand on this issue.  The Croke Park agreement is an arrangement in which we firmly believe.  It was castigated by the Government parties when they were in opposition.  It should be given time to allow those savings come through.  The message being sent out by the Government is that everything is on the table.  I heard the chairperson of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party say on radio this morning that increments are up for grabs and that parts of the Croke Park agreement will be torn up.  I also heard Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n of Sinn F&eacute;in say this morning saying that his party does not support the agreement.  That was a departure.  Our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues might have to answer for that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important we provide time to discuss the Croke Park agreement, to look at the savings that have been made within the agreement, to look at other work that can and should be done, and to review it properly in this House in order that we can figure out where changes and additional savings need to be made.  We should do this properly.  People are working hard to try to change how they work with fewer resources.  It would be a worthwhile debate.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, my party leader, Deputy Martin, my colleague, Councillor Eoghan O&rsquo;Brien, and I were canvassing in Malahide on the European treaty.  Much work needs to be done to get this treaty passed.  I welcome the fact the Government is issuing information notes to every household.  I would appeal to all parties advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to ensure we knock on as many doors as possible and as early as possible.  We should take down the queries now.  We have six weeks to the referendum and this will not be a long time coming.  I got a sense yesterday evening that other matters such as water charges, household taxes and so on are coming into the mix.  We need to divorce our views on them from the matter of the treaty itself and what we in Fianna F&aacute;il see as its importance for this country.  Much work needs to be done on this.</P>
        <P>Has any work been done on the scheduling of business in the Seanad in the run-up to the referendum to allow Senators participate fully in the campaign itself, regardless of whether they are for or against the treaty?  I ask the Deputy Leader to look at the schedule.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other main issue raised yesterday with me and my party leader was water charges, and the confusion around it.  I once again propose an amendment to the Order of Business this morning to call on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to this House to explain how much people are going to pay, what the free allowance of water will be, who will pay for the meters and how they will be paid for.  As a few people in Seabury, Malahide, said to me last night, "We did not pay for a gas meter or an ESB meter, so why should we pay for a water meter?"</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I know there was an installation fee, but we did not pay for the meter.  We certainly did not pay for it over 20 years at a 6% interest rate, which is what the Government is proposing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business to allow the Minister to come to the House today to outline the Government position on water charges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to raise the issue of absenteeism in the health service.  It may have been raised previously but I would like to raise it again because it is important at a time when there is much difficulty in making ends meet in the health service.  There was a 19% absenteeism rate in one hospital for the month of January.  One out of every five workers was not at work when they should have been.  The interesting figure is that the absenteeism of junior doctors was only 1.24%, and these are people who work up to 80 hours per week.  There is now a name for it, &ldquo;duvet day&rdquo;, when people feel it is inappropriate to get out of bed to come into work.  It is a real issue that must be looked at and tackled.  If it is a problem in a particular hospital or unit of the health service, the reason for it should be examined and a clear message sent that we, as taxpayers, cannot afford to allow it to continue.  We need a debate on how we provide for full pay for persons on sick leave.  It is part of a debate we should have with the Minister, particularly when we consider all of the money collected in income tax last year did not cover the full cost of the health care service.  This year we will also have a difficulty with the amount collected in income tax not covering the health care budget.  It is an extremely important issue.  It costs every taxpayer and puts lives at risk when people stay away from work when there is not a genuine reason for it.  It is an issue we should debate the next time the Minister for Health appears in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It should include absenteeism in the House also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Today eight months is Christmas Day.  As a shopkeeper I am always reminded of how many shopping days remain until Christmas Day.  The work we need to do to achieve the goals of the Government&rsquo;s programme for this year does not seem to be taking place; there are distractions and it is being put on the long finger.  We must, however, make sure we do it.</P>
        <P>Today is supported employment day, organised by the Irish Association of Supported Employment.  I heard Senator David Norris on radio this morning talking about the great work being done.  I have been involved with this organisation for a number of years and it is doing a great job.  It encourages those who otherwise would not have had a job because of difficulties with a disability and gives them an opportunity to take the first step on the employment ladder.</P>
        <P>Could we do something about the report published today by the Institute of Directors of Ireland?  This is a serious issue.  The directors of State agencies believe not enough skills are sought from those appointed to State boards.  I have had some experience of State boards and have seen some valuable individuals serving on them.  They have committed themselves to the work and done it well.  I also know there have been failures and political appointments, about which I am concerned.  The institute has checked with all of its members who are members of State boards and they say the skills needed are not included and that transparency and openness in appointments to State boards are lacking.  We have had successful semi-State operations since the 1920s and it would be a shame if people were appointed to boards in a non-transparent manner and without investigating their skills to ensure the right people are appointed.</P>
        <P>There was a reminder today of the need for defibrillators.  A number of years ago there was a campaign to ensure people who might suffer a heart attack would have a defibrillator available, but we have not gone nearly far enough.  There was an incident yesterday when a person had a heart attack, but luckily someone was passing by and the person concerned was saved.  We must invest in defibrillators around the country and training to be able to use them.  This will save lives and the onus is on us to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the students from Greenhill secondary school, Carrick-on-Suir, my home town.  I thank Ms Greene for waiting outside until I rose to speak.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise the issue of loan availability to small businesses.  On the last occasion the Labour Party tabled a motion during Private Members&rsquo; business I led a debate on the provision of funding for small business.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, took the debate and was forthcoming in his support for small business.  However, I have since come across many small businesses in my area which are still having difficulties with the banks, which are not being given loans or which are being offered loans with terms that are so prohibitive that they cannot draw them down.  Will the Leader ask the Minister of State to bring representatives of both Bank of Ireland and AIB into the audiovisual room for a formal session on the loan systems they have in place and a question and answer session with Members of both Houses?  This is essential in terms of the recovery of the country and the economy.  The Minister of State has outlined that there is &euro;7 billion available in 2012 for small and medium-sized enterprises.  However, unless something happens, less than 50% of this will be drawn down.  As we are now the custodians of the banks, I am calling on the Deputy Leader to request the Minister of State not to ask but to instruct the banks to come here for a question and answer session with all Oireachtas Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I follow Senator Denis Landy by referring to news reports today that highlight the epidemic of house repossessions.  There are now two per day and over one year into the term of office of the Government, despite many promises, we have made no progress.  Solutions have been put forward on all sides of the House; this side has tabled two Bills, but there has not been any action and still the people wonder.  Senator Denis Landy has eloquently pointed out that we are now the custodians of the banks; we are supposed to control them as large shareholders on behalf of the people, but in reality, what are we doing?  Senator Sean D. Barrett mentioned the backstairs in the Department of Finance for the exclusive use of bankers.  We are failing the people day by day.  While the IMF can easily secure &euro;325 billion to support governments, what is the Government doing to support families in Ireland?  We introduced the Family Home Bill and the Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Bill, while a proposed Government Bill to address the issue has been left sitting on Committee Stage with no action being taken, largely because it does not suit the bankers who are concerned about what the markets might say.  I do not care about the markets, I care about people.  I know Senator Denis Landy and other Members of the Houses care about them also.  If the Whip was removed and that basic question was put, 99.9% of Members would vote in favour of the people receiving the support they need.  Unless action is taken quickly, we will reintroduce the Family Home Bill which would provide a solution that might be judicial, but it could be put in place quickly to ensure families are kept in their homes, rather than allowing two families per day to be put out on the street.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I draw the attention of the Deputy Leader and the House to the recent Northern Executive and Assembly initiative whereby a levy is being placed on large retail properties with sizeable retail valuations, with the proceeds to be used to reduce rates for smaller businesses.  We have heard Senator Denis Landy and many others speak about this issue in the recent past and all know how businesses are suffering.  There is serious concern about the effect out-of-town stores are having on businesses in town centres and traditional retail zones.  We must find ways to make town centres more attractive.  Out-of-town stores should make a contribution to the cost of town centre regeneration.  We have seen the drift. All provincial towns are suffering. Much of this is the result of bad planning over the years. In the drift out of town, where the infrastructure was not in place it had to be put in place at great cost to local authorities. We are aware of the investment in town centres, with paving, footpaths, piping and so on. We have allowed that to suffer, very stupidly, through bad planning. Action must now be taken to redress the situation we have allowed to develop all over the country.  I encourage the Deputy Leader to look at this issue and, appropriately, to bring it to the attention of the Government. </P>
        
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  It is extraordinary that the gas company is going to install water meters.  One can buy electricity from the gas company.  Why do we not merge them all into one?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have been asked for a debate on absenteeism.  I glanced around the House.  We started ten minutes late.  I was the first person in the Chamber this morning and for the majority of the time I have been here there were 12 Members present.  That represents a rate of absenteeism of 80%.  We should look to ourselves on this, particularly if we wish this House to continue in existence.  That may relate to another matter which I ask the Deputy Leader to bring to the attention of the broadcasting section. It is extraordinary that when the House sits on its own, as it does sometimes and during which periods it sometimes addresses important matters, it is never reported on RTE. There is a programme called&rdquo; Oireachtas Report&rdquo; but it only broadcasts when both Houses are sitting or when the D&aacute;il is sitting on its own. RTE should be reminded that the Oireachtas consists of both Houses. In order for this point to be made effectively we need to show more support for this House. </P><P Just="Left">Two entire groups are completely unrepresented in the House this morning. Not a single Member of Sinn F&eacute;in or the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees is here. </P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  I would be delighted.</P>
        <P>I note the condemnation of the Government&rsquo;s provision of information on the referendum.  The previous referendum failed.  A survey conducted on that referendum and surveys conducted on referendums in England demonstrate the strength of the old adage, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know, vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We must ensure that people are informed.</P>
        <P>At a conference of political studies, Professor Paul Wheatley from Essex clearly showed, using statistics from throughout Europe, that lack of information was a key factor in the British referendum on electoral reform.  A survey done in Ireland found that 47% of people felt they were ill-informed about the referendum on Oireachtas inquiries.  This was true even of people who intended to vote.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties was right to condemn the previous Government for not doing enough to inform the people.  The Government was very cagey, knowing it would be criticised if it informed the people, and equally if it did not.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties also criticised the Referendum Commission for not doing enough to inform the people.</P>
        <P>Elected representatives must not fall between a rock and a hard place because of the McKenna judgment.  We must go out and give factual information.  The Constitution, which we all admire, is a blunt instrument.  It is difficult to decipher complex information and decide whether to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The people must be given factual information.  There is a requirement that the Government not spend public money on promoting one side or another in a referendum.  The people need factual information.  Throwing a copy of the fiscal treaty, as it is written, in someone&rsquo;s doorway is not giving factual information.  The Government should be entitled to explain what the treaty says in plain and simple language and not expected to list the reasons for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Any Government is entitled to do that.</P>
        <P>I would like the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to make recommendations, because I admire that body.  If it criticised the previous Government for not doing enough to inform the people I would like it to get involved with the Government and say how the treaty should be explained to the people.  Public representatives should get out and consult the people, listen to their views and come back to the Government.  We have a duty of care.  I am delighted to see most Opposition Members are helping the Government in its effort.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien and the rest of us are out canvassing for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
        <P>I ask the House to recommend that factual information be given.  Listing reasons to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; is not giving factual information.  If I were required to do that I would have to make up good reasons to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That would not be fact.  It would be my fiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Social Protection to come to the House to discuss the issue of social welfare payments to assist people with mortgage interest payments.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Senator Daly can ask her then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked through the normal channels if there is any proof that payments given to people to pay mortgage interest are being passed on to the banks.  If people are given a choice between feeding their families, keeping the lights on or keeping the house warm and paying the bank, no one will blame them if they fail to pay the bank.  We must find different mechanisms to assist people who find themselves in that difficulty.  However, we need an assurance that people who are receiving assistance to make mortgage interest payments do pass the money on to the bank.   People who use those funds for food, fuel or lighting should get the necessary assistance.</P>
        <P>I support my colleague, Senator Coghlan, on the issue of rates.  In Northern Ireland out of town centres pay higher rates than businesses in the centre of towns.  That is something the Deputy Leader might look at.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the positive contribution made by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien this morning in calling for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and compliment him on being actively out on the stump already and canvassing.  This is one of the most important decisions for the country that we will make and it will have an impact for many decades to come.  The treaty must be passed in the interests of job retention and job creation and I very much welcome the fact that chambers of commerce, farmers&rsquo; organisations and employers have come out strongly in support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is to make a decision today.  I call on it to reflect strongly on that decision.  It represents employees.  I always thought that the main priority of any trade union was to protect employment and to create employment. At a time when there are 445,000 unemployed, we need every opportunity and support we can get to create employment and to bring about confidence in order that people will invest in the country. The trade union movement has a significant role to play. As I stated here yesterday, those who oppose the treaty have not come up with one advantage to the country of voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but there are certainly very many advantages to voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I strongly urge ICTU to come on board and support this referendum.</P><P Just="Left">One point I would make to Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien is that there will be no water charges until 2014. There is one decision made, namely, that Bord G&aacute;is Energy will be the vehicle that will secure our water supply in the future. </P>

	<P Just="Left">All I am asking is that the Government up its game a little more because the sands are shifting in Europe.  If one reads any of the newspapers and any of the economic commentaries over the past week on the fiscal treaty, there are various changes taking place in Europe with various governments in various countries and an attitude across Europe of anti-austerity sentiment.  If that will be translated into the Irish electorate, voters will say to themselves that they do not really fully understand this treaty because the Government has not really outlined it.  In fairness to the Government, we all agree it is not quite as simple and straightforward as has been teased out in debate here.  All I am saying is that I would welcome the Deputy Leader ensuring that there would be ongoing and regular updates on the campaign on the fiscal treaty.  This House should continue to highlight the positives in that regard.  We have an obligation to do so.</P>

	<P>In the six weeks left before the referendum, we can get caught up in much unnecessary tittle-tattle.  We need to micromanage the message properly and give people the facts.  In the first instance, what is being distributed to the 1.6 million households explains a treaty.  It is up to the people then to decide whether they will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that we do not know what the consequences for this country will be if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Nobody has told us what will happen if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I want to hear what the alternative of those advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; is.  It is easy to shout and roar and say &ldquo;Vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; against austerity, against the European Union and against what is happening.&rdquo;  One may blame bankers, water meters, septic tanks and what one likes, but what is the alternative?  I want to hear the alternative.  I want to hear a comprehensive rebuttal of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  All I have heard up until now is ill-informed and ill-advised, and what I would describe as &ldquo;subversive soundbites&rdquo;.  I have not heard one positive contribution on an alternative from the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  This morning I challenge one person from the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side to get up and give us an alternative because I think we need that.</P>

	<P>Obviously, it was the wrong day to do that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Institute of Directors for the report it released today on appointments to State boards.  It is interesting that almost half of those appointed are appointed because they know about it, either through word of mouth or with contact with the Minister or the Minister&rsquo;s office.  Obviously, this is of concern.  It is the case that we would like to see all of these appointments made through public advertisement and through proper public interview.</P>
        <P>Of more concern is the finding that directors themselves consider there is not enough communication from Ministers and that Ministers do not outline their long-term vision for what they want the board to do.  That is coming from those who sit on State boards.  This is a concern.  If one adds to that the fact that the directors think that the skills mix on the board is wrong, and that at the outset 40% of them believe that the skills requirements were not outlined to them when they took up the job, obviously there is a big deficit in the State boards at a time when we need State boards to work even harder.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At least the Institute of Directors has done the work.  I commend it for that and for pointing to the difficulties.  I want to ask for a debate on this matter and the associated specific point the institute made at the end of its report, which is that it believes that directors on State boards are not paid well enough.  The Institute of Directors&rsquo; chief executive, Ms Maura Quinn, stated today that she believes that they should be paid well.  I suspect that within this House there would be quite a level of disagreement as to how that pay should be given to directors who work in this capacity.  I call for a debate on that matter and the appointment of directors to State boards.</P>

	<P>A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum is critical for the stability of the country and will allow us to get on with addressing the issues of most concern to the people.  I spent the last two days at a meeting attended by representatives of all 27 European Union member states at which it was clear youth unemployment was the major concern throughout Europe, just as it was in Ireland.  If we are serious about tackling this problem, we must provide a stable environment for the economy to grow.  All of the evidence suggests the next growth spurt will emerge from the digital agenda.  In fact, it is estimated that e-commerce is growing at such a rate as to provide up to 30,000 new jobs a year across the European Union.  The problem, however, is that neither Ireland nor the Union as a whole is ready for this development, with demand already outstripping supply in terms of the availability of information technology professionals.  A truly shocking figure is that by 2015 there will be a shortage of such professionals to the tune of some 700,000.  We must work together to address this skills shortfall.  We must be prepared to meet developments in this area, as a Government and as a country, for the sake of our young people.  Will the Deputy Leader facilitate a debate on the digital agenda, including a discussion of the reasons broadband penetration in the State remains below the EU average?  The Minister for Education and Skills should also be invited to the Chamber to discuss the implications for universities and institutes of technology of the projected shortfall in the number of IT professionals.  Every business and marketing course should include a core component on information technology, digital marketing and social media, but that is not being done.  In the absence of a proactive approach, it is our young people who will lose out.  The great news is that the digital world is one that appeals to them.</P>

	<P>I agree with colleagues that the work of the Seanad is not reflected fairly and equitably in the media. We have heard many calls in the House for RTE to devote a greater portion of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; to proceedings in the Upper House.  The Seanad is sitting five days this week, yet that programme is being shown only on the days on which the D&aacute;il is in session.  We must have a debate on the need for greater parity in media coverage of the work of the two Houses.  The excellent work being done in this Chamber is often glossed over.  On last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, for instance, the important debates on the fiscal treaty and the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report in which we engaged yesterday were barely mentioned.</P>
        <P>Senator David Norris commented on attendance rates in the House and claimed none of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees was in attendance today.  I remind him that I am one of those nominees and I am here every morning.  Observers who see an almost empty Chamber might conclude there are few Senators in the vicinity of Leinster House.

	<P>It saddens and angers me greatly to observe the ongoing debate on the domiciliary care allowance.  The problems in this regard are clear to me from speaking to nurses with the Jack and Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation.  We have 288 families under our wing, including babies whose development has been severely delayed as a result of brain damage, many of whom are adversely affected by delays of up to eight months in the processing of domiciliary care allowance applications.  Furthermore, the processing of applications for carer&rsquo;s allowance and medical cards is intertwined with the payment of domiciliary care allowance.  It is utterly shocking that the Health Service Executive continues to request that families we assist submit domiciliary care allowance review forms in the knowledge that the children concerned will not get better.  These children will never bake brown bread or kick a ball and, in most cases, their condition is terminal.  I was convinced that my husband, Mr. Jonathan Irwin, who is chief executive officer of the foundation was mistaken when he told me what was happening.  To my dismay, however, I discovered that it was very much the case.</P>
        <P>As if that were not bad enough, what is truly appalling is that payment of domiciliary care allowance is withheld for the duration of the review process which takes, on average, eight months.  This is bureaucracy gone mad and totally unfair.  Severely disabled children and their parents are being treated with complete disrespect and their lives made more difficult than they already are.  I call on the Minister for Health, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Finance to resolve this crisis and rectify the delay in the processing of claims for carer&rsquo;s allowance and medical cards.  I am also asking Government Senators to step up to the plate by lobbying to have this issue resolved.  Our purpose must be to safeguard the most vulnerable in our society, to which category the people to whom I refer unquestionably belong.  Children and their parents deserve better and no politician can hide behind the excuse of there being no money available.  Addressing these issues will ultimately result in a cost saving.</P>

        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the legislation to facilitate the holding of the referendum on the fiscal treaty was useful and proactive.

In particular, I commend Mandate, UNITE and the Technical, Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU, for their call for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  SIPTU, meanwhile, has released a statement indicating that it will consider advising its members to support the treaty in the event of an undertaking from the Government to implement a stimulus programme.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My question relates to the tourism industry, particular in the south of the country, in advance of the impending tourism season.  The potential for job creation in the tourism sector in counties such as that in which I live, namely, the kingdom of Kerry, is enormous.  In the short to medium term, the best prospects for growth in local economies is to exploit the solid product that exists in tourism hotspots.  Between December and February, trips to Ireland were up by 2.7%.  Some 1.15 million people from overseas visited the country during those three months.  However, Shannon Airport has lost 2 million passengers since 2007 and is understood to have a long-standing debt of &euro;100 million.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, previously stated that Shannon will be the first of the State airports to have certainty about its future and that he would make a recommendation to Cabinet by Easter on the best option for its future viability.  I do not believe the Minister has made that decision or has delivered his recommendations to the Cabinet.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to invite him to come before the House in order that we might discuss the future viability of Shannon Airport, the tourism product in this country and the possibilities in the context of creating employment in the tourism sector.</P>

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, put in a first-class performance on last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.  The person speaking on behalf of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign was also excellent.  There is a need for organisations such as the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland to get on the airwaves and, in the context of foreign direct investment here, to state how important it is for Ireland to be at the centre of Europe and that Ireland is a full and passionate supporter of the EU.  As stated yesterday, the only jobs that have been created since January &mdash; some 2,300 &mdash; came about as a result of foreign direct investment.  As former member of the Federated Workers Union of Ireland, FWUI and like Senator Mullins, I am of the view that it all comes down to jobs.  What is happening is beyond belief and because the numbers are dwindling, certain individuals are being opportunistic in the context of frightening people.  It behoves all of us to knock on people&rsquo;s doors and inform them of the fact that the treaty relates to jobs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am seeking a debate on an issue relevant to Donegal which was the subject of an report in the Irish Independent.  I refer to Donegal County Council paying out almost &euro;3 million to a private consultancy firm.  I was a member of the council at the time and I am in a position to state that we were not made aware of this payment until the public auditor highlighted it and the internal auditor clarified the position.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government should come before the House and inform Senators as to how local authorities throughout the country have paid out in consultancy fees and to indicate what is the future with regard to consultancy contracts.  The internal auditor informed the Irish Independent that the information provided by the consultants in question to Donegal County Council could have been downloaded free of charge from the Internet.  Instead, these individuals were paid &euro;30,000 per month to provide it.  The council was still paying the gentlemen involved up to last year.  This matter is still under review and, in such circumstances, I request that the Minister come to the House to inform us where matters stand in the context of local authorities paying consultancy fees. Local authority budgets are becoming increasingly tight. </P>

      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader impress upon the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the need for the Government to use its influence with the banks, particularly those which are in State ownership, to encourage them to take part in the resolution process relating to the residents of Priory Hall?  She will be aware that the process, which is being chaired by Mr. Justice Finnegan, was announced on Friday last.  The residents and Dublin City Council welcomed the process and have indicated that they will take part in it.  In the absence of the mortgage lenders involved, there is not much point in the process proceeding because it will not be possible to reach any kind of resolution.  I raised the matter of the position of Priory Hall residents <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> their mortgages on a number of occasions in the House.  I did so for the first time on 20 October of last year, just after the residents had been evacuated from their homes.</P>
        <P>As Members are aware, this is a special situation.  I appreciate that there are general provisions in respect of people who have difficulty paying their mortgages as a result of a loss of or reduction in income or of being made unemployed.  However, the residents of Priory Hall are in an entirely different category.  This matter has nothing to do with a loss of income, it relates to the fact that their homes are uninhabitable.  These people are being asked to pay mortgages on properties in which they cannot live.  In fact, they do not know whether they will ever be able to return to those properties.  There has been a complete lack of a co-ordinated response to this matter to date.  Some mortgage lenders have paused people&rsquo;s repayments while others have not.  Those who have had their repayments paused are not paying their mortgages on a monthly basis but the interest on those mortgages is still accruing.  As a result, the amount owed on such mortgages is increasing on a monthly basis.  In addition to all of the other stresses they are experiencing, the residents could be faced where, in a year or two, the amount of interest due on their mortgages may have risen by &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As stated, I have raised this matter in the House on previous occasions.  I wrote to the Taoiseach almost a month ago and requested that at the Economic Management Council&rsquo;s meeting with the banks, the Government should ask that there be a co-ordinated response, under the auspices of the Irish Banking Federation or some other group, to ensure that a fair and consistent approach is taken by the banks.  All I received in respect of the correspondence to which I refer was an acknowledgement.  I ask that the Deputy Leader use her good offices and her influence with members of the Cabinet to ensure the Government uses its influence on this issue in order that a fair solution might be arrived at.  There is concern about this matter on all sides of the House and it has been raised by other Members in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I concur with the comments made by Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien in respect of the domiciliary care allowance system and chaos to which the administrative blockage therein has given rise.  The House should demand a positive and quick response from the relevant Minister on this matter.  I thank the Senator for hosting a most powerful, evocative and emotional meeting last Thursday evening in the audiovisual room.  Her friends in the Jack and Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation presented their case and modest requests to us for support and funding.  Out of all the lobbying meetings I have attended through the years in Leinster House it stood out for its humanity and purpose and the generosity of the people who made the case.</P>
        <P>It is important we continue to debate the merits of the treaty in the House.  I welcome the fact the public will be getting direct information from the Government and Referendum Commission.  Issues and questions will arise over the course of the campaign and the Houses of the Oireachtas should have a debate one day a week on the ongoing developments in the treaty referendum campaign.  It would be helpful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This week, as is the case every week, the Government will go to the European banklink machine with its credit card and have to withdraw &euro;300 or &euro;400 million of European money to pay our teachers, nurses, social welfare allowances and pensions.  That is the core of the debate, namely, how we fund and continue to fund the country.  We must keep that very much to the fore when we ask the people, in a generous, positive and calm way, to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to secure the future financial viability of our nation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to small schools and the loss of teachers.  The issue has been greatly exaggerated.  There was talk of hundreds of schools losing teachers because of budget changes, but this is not the case. There will be very little change to small schools this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>Only 39.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was not sure if the figures had been released to the public.  I understand 39 schools will lose a teacher this year.  I do not want to become involved in a political argument.  If the other schools who appealed and were not successful at this stage have the numbers in September, they say their teachers will be reinstated.  There may be little or no loss.  The point that the issue was greatly exaggerated has been proved.</P>

	<P>The Senator called for a debate on the Croke Park agreement.  I have no difficulty with that and called for one previously.  We had a debate on 9 February on progress on the Croke Park agreement.  Disappointingly, no more than 15 Senators took part.  I would be happy to ask the Leader for a debate but it should take place later in the year.  If there is a lack of Senators willing to come forward when debates are called for, we should not have one so soon after the last one.</P>
        <P>I understand Senator O&rsquo;Brien said there was some division between Fine Gael and the Labour Party on the Croke Park agreement.  There is not.  We are both committed to making it work.  The Labour Party never castigated it when in opposition.</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien also raised the referendum on the stability treaty.  It was the theme of the Order of Business because it was also raised by Senators Keane, Mullins, Mooney, Conway, Healy Eames, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, White, Harte and Bradford.  I will try to address some of the points raised.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Brien on the need for individual members of the parties supporting the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to get out and canvass. His point about the scheduling of business is important and I will raise it with the Leader.</P>
        <P>As colleagues are aware, the House is not sitting tomorrow due to difficulties with the scheduling of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  We are sitting on Friday and Monday.  We should use the time to go out and canvass.  If anybody is interested in joining me I will be canvassing for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on College Green with members of the Trinity College branch of the Labour Party.  Many of us will be using the time to canvass.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Many speakers referred to the Government&rsquo;s information campaign.  Clearly, there is an obligation on the Government to inform the public about the text of the treaty in a neutral manner.  That is what is being done and the Government is committed to sending copies of the treaty to every household, which is very important.  As we know, the Referendum Commission is also engaged in an information campaign.</P>
        <P>I have gone on the record as saying that I hope ICTU will support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote or will not campaign for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  I agree with Senator White it is patently in the interests of trade union members that the treaty is passed for job retention and creation.  Large numbers of jobs have been created through foreign direct investment, as she pointed out, including 1,000 jobs in PayPal, 500 in Apple Computers, 500 in Eli Lilly in Cork and 500 in Mylan in north Dublin.  There was a $130 million investment by Microsoft, 280 jobs were created in Galway and Kildare by HP and 175 jobs were created by Abbott Pharmaceuticals in Sligo.  A large number of job announcements in recent months are a direct result of our continued involvement in Europe and the eurozone.  That is why the referendum is so important.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A number of Senators referred to growth.  We are all in agreement on the need for a commitment to a growth agenda within the terms of the fiscal compact.  Ireland was at the forefront of the countries seeking to prioritise growth in the treaty.  It is on the first page of the treaty, where there is a reference to ensuring growth and taking growth enhancing initiatives.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the position taken by SIPTU on the treaty.  On Monday I spoke on Second Stage about that and said I thought it was an unhelpful position for it to take.  I understand it has imposed a condition of an EU package of &euro;10 billion which is not within the power of any national Government to deliver on.  I cannot speak for the SIPTU position.  Later today we will hear what position ICTU has taken.  Public sector and teaching unions have taken a decision not to press for a vote for or against the treaty.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators referred to the Institute of Directors report on the appointment of directors to State boards.  The issue was raised by Senators Feargal Quinn and Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I would be very willing to ask the Leader for a debate on that.  Some of the issues raised in the report were important and deserve a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Burke sought a debate on absenteeism in the health service.  We can consider facilitating a debate on that issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to defibrillators, which are important.  Incidents occur regularly which highlight the need for defibrillators.</P>
        <P>Senator Landy referred to the availability of credit for small businesses, which was raised in a Labour Party motion in the House recently.  He called on the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, to bring the two lead banks to the audiovisual room for a question and answer session with Members of both Houses.  That would be very helpful and I am willing to assist the Senator in seeking to do that.  We have had banking representatives in before committees but it would be very useful to have a more general forum where banking representatives could meet Members of both Houses.  We should seek to progress that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry called for a debate on repossessions and the issue of those dealing with mortgage arrears.  I will follow the Leader&rsquo;s example in not answering colleagues who are not present.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Paul Coghlan raised the issue of the contribution that out-of-town stores should make to in-town regeneration.  This is an important issue we might debate. </P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of absenteeism in the House.  Senator Moran pointed out that quite a number of Senators who may not be present in the Chamber are, of course, engaged on Oireachtas business or engaged on business elsewhere in Leinster House.  We are sitting five days this week and on Monday of next week.  Many of us are here in the Chamber on what feels like a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On the issue of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; not being broadcast by RTE when the Seanad alone is sitting, I understand the Leader has already raised that issue in writing with RTE and I will see if we can take it up again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have dealt with the issue raised by Senator Keane, who spoke about the referendum.  Senator Daly sought a debate on social welfare payments.  We will have the Minister for Social Protection in the House on Friday and Monday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Mullins, Mooney and Conway also raised the issue of the referendum, with which I have dealt.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe called for a debate on State boards, an issue with which I have dealt.  Senator Healy Eames dealt with the referendum and the issue of growth, which I agree is an important issue which we must stress in the campaign.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Moran raised the issue of Seanad coverage, with which I have dealt.  She also asked for a debate on the Irish Prison Service in light of the immediate news that there have been further escapes from Loughan House.  We had a debate on that issue in the justice committee when we called in the head of the Irish Prison Service in the context of the most recent escape.  It would be useful to have a fuller debate in the House on these issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien called for a debate on the domiciliary care allowance.  I was concerned to hear of the delays of which she spoke and the difficulties recipients have experienced.  It is an issue on which we might have a debate.  Equally, it might be worth raising as a matter on the Adjournment directly with the Ministers concerned.  As the Senator said, the issue cuts across a number of Departments but might be appropriate to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of the referendum, with which I have dealt.  Senator Sheahan called for a debate on tourism.  I point out we had a debate recently in the House on that issue.  I have already responded to Senator White.  Senator Harte raised an issue within Donegal County Council which, again, might be raised as a matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>Senator Power raised the issue of Priory Hall, which she has raised in the House on many occasions.  I was glad to hear of the resolution process.  I believe we would all agree we want to see a coherent and co-ordinated response to the dreadful position of the residents.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford raised the issue of the referendum.  Senator D&rsquo;Arcy raised the issue of small schools, although he did not call for a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien called for an amendment on the issue of water charges, to which a number of Senators referred.  I am not willing to accede to it.  We have raised this issue on the Order of Business on a number of days.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 5, lines 7 to 17, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;may,&rdquo; in line 7 down to and including &ldquo;specified.&rdquo;,&rdquo; in line 17 and substitute the following:</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">As it stands, the Competition Authority has no remedy available to it other than declaratory relief and injustice relief.  There is no provision in the 2002 Act for civil fines and penalties for breach of competition law, the advantage of the civil route being that the burden of proof is lower than that required in criminal law, and the problem of juries in criminal trials trying to get their heads around the complexities and nuances of competition law is removed. The Bill has no provisions for civil fines or pecuniary penalties. Section 14A of the principal Act provides for the same reliefs in the form of other declaratory relief or inductive relief. </P>

	<P>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Is bre&aacute; an rud go bhfuil Gaeilge ag an duine sa chathaoir sin agus gur f&eacute;idir linn c&uacute;pla focal Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id agus muid ag pl&eacute; na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta seo.  Go ginear&aacute;lta, t&aacute; Sinn F&eacute;in i bhf&aacute;bhar an Bhille seo, mar a bh&iacute;omar ar na C&eacute;imeanna roimhe seo.  An t-aon locht at&aacute; againn ar an mBille n&aacute; nach dt&eacute;ann s&eacute; s&aacute;ch fada agus nach dt&oacute;gann s&eacute; ar bord na tuairim&iacute; at&aacute; luaite ag an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Ioma&iacute;ochta, n&oacute; an Competition Authority.  Maidir leis na leasuithe at&aacute; curtha chun cinn ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir White, t&aacute;imid ar son dtabhairt isteach f&iacute;ne&aacute;lacha sibhialta sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the introduction of civil fines in the legislation.  We do not accept the argument put forward that this would be unconstitutional.  The major flaw in the Bill, which critically undermines it, is the lack of provision for civil fines as requested by the Competition Authority.  The Minister of State will be aware of that.  The Competition Authority sought the provision of civil fines to deal with the abuses of the so-called hard core infringement.  Central to that is the abuse of the dominant market share, including the refusal to supply, predatory pricing and exclusivity agreements.   We remain concerned that the absence of a provision for civil fines will impact on the ability to deal with those types of abuses.  The development and implementation of a civil fines section would be a mechanism to deal with the abuse of a dominant position.  It would strengthen the provisions of the Bill and further safeguard the consumer and local business.  The role of civil fines is to punish corrupt practices where the burden of proof is too onerous to reach.  They are a medium strength weapon that should be utilised.  I hope the Minister of State will revisit this suggestion and amend the Bill to provide for civil fines to tackle corrupt practices alongside the more stringent provisions he has outlined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have been in discussion with a number of groups on the issue, some of whose members are in the Visitors Gallery and whom I welcome.  The Competition Authority would state only two of a number of findings it has made over the years have been substantial in dealing in any way with some of the anti-competitive practices in the State.  Part of the problem is that we do not have a civil fines regime.  The burden of proof is onerous when it comes to a criminal prosecution whereas the burden of proof in a civil case is not as onerous.  That must be taken on board because as outlined in this Chamber on a number of occasions and according to reports from the Competition Authority, practices in a number of industries in this State, especially in the cement industry although we have seen it in the fuel industry and elsewhere, are resulting in the squeezing out of smaller businesses.  We have seen golden circles in practice, price fixing, predatory pricing and the use of so-called hello money.  Smaller players in the marketplace are not getting fair play.  Anything this State can do to tackle that must be done.  It is very difficult for those smaller businesses to be competitive when the wider economic situation is taken into consideration. For example, a huge number of shops on the high street in Clifden, County Galway, have closed as a result of competition issues. One could also link it to the current economic situation. For example, when people have less money in their pockets to do their weekly shopping, they are more likely to buy their groceries in the bigger multiple shops, but those large multiples are squeezing out the smaller local grocers. We are all aware of that from the experience in our own constituencies. </P>
        
        <P>The reality is that if people had a little more money in their pockets, they would be more likely to spend more in their local shops and the local traders would be more likely to get fair play if the broader aspects of the economy were dealt with.  Smaller businesses are receiving a double whammy of competition from large multinational players, some of which we fear are engaging in these anti-competitive practices, and the criminal sanctions in place not tackling the issue.  Civil fines would make it easier for those who are being penalised in the system to take a case and might act as a deterrent to those engaging in these activities.  We believe the proposal put forward is modest and we ask the Minister of State to reconsider the situation ar na chostais sibhialta seo n&oacute; na p&iacute;on&oacute;is sibhialta seo.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht na tuairim&iacute; a nochtaigh s&eacute;.  Is mian liom freagra a thabhairt i mB&eacute;arla i dtosach don Seanad&oacute;ir.  As Senator White&rsquo;s amendments have been grouped, my responses will cover the proposed amendment in respect of both sections 3 and 4.</P>
        <P>The first part of Senator White&rsquo;s amendment, paragraph (<i>a</i>), substitutes provisions relating to the actions that a court may order in regard to an abuse of a dominant position.  The text of the amending Bill provides that the court may require the undertaking to discontinue the abuse or to adopt measures for the purpose of it ceasing to be in a dominant position or securing an adjustment of that position.  Such measures can include the sale of the undertaking&rsquo;s assets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator White is proposing that the court may order &ldquo;(i) that the undertaking shall discontinue the abuse, or (ii) that the undertaking shall adopt such measures for the purpose of securing an adjustment of that dominant position&rdquo;.  The sale of the undertaking&rsquo;s assets is also provided for.  In effect, it would appear that the main difference between what Senator White is proposing and what is in the legislation is that the Bill permits the court to order the adoption of measures to ensure the cessation of a dominant position whereas this option is not included in the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.  In her proposed paragraph (<i>b</i>), she seeks to introduce in civil proceedings a fine not exceeding a class A fine, that is, a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000. A class A fine is a fine imposed in criminal proceedings. The amendment seeks to apply a criminal sanction to civil proceedings. </P>
        
        <P>Mar ad&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir, m&aacute; t&aacute; f&iacute;ne&aacute;il sibhialta le bheith ann, caithfear athr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh sa Bhunreacht.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir f&iacute;ne&aacute;il sibhialta a leagaint amach muna ndeireann Oifig an Ard-Aighne gur f&eacute;idir sin a dh&eacute;anamh go dleathach.  C&eacute; gur luaigh gach &eacute;inne sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sa Seanad agus sa D&aacute;il gur c&oacute;ir go mbeadh f&iacute;ne&aacute;il sibhialta ann, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir sin a dh&eacute;anamh gan an Bunreacht a athr&uacute;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Notwithstanding the debate both in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il on civil fines and the views expressed by many bodies, including the Competition Authority and the troika initially, the legal position and the advice the Government has on the provision for such fines is that there would be legal difficulties, having regard to Article 38.1 of the Constitution, which provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.  As the Minister, Deputy Bruton, advised on Second Stage, civil fines cannot be introduced from a legal perspective.  That is the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Competition Authority has called for the introduction of civil fines as a means to strengthen the enforcement of competition law.  I understand this issue has been the subject of extensive consideration both by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, and by competition law practitioners in general.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Senator stated, the matter attracted the attention of the troika which called for the introduction of legislation to strengthen competition law.  The European Commission&rsquo;s intent in seeking this commitment arose from its desire to see the introduction of civil fines in the area of competition law.  While the authority argued the case strongly for such fines, ultimately, given certain constitutional protections afforded to accused persons by Article 38.1, it has not proved possible to introduce the concept of civil fines as espoused by the authority.  Both the authority and the troika accept this position, and together with the Department and the Office of the Attorney General, they have worked to produce the suite of alternative enforcement provisions contained in this Bill.  Combined with the already substantial monetary and custodial penalties available under the Competition Act 2002, following enactment of the Bill, Ireland will have a robust and effective competition law enforcement regime.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to enact legislation to ban unfair practices in the retail sector.  The Government will give effect to this commitment by including specific enabling provisions to deal with this issue in legislation being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  It is expected this legislation will be published later this year.  The Government is strongly committed to ensuring Ireland continues to have vibrant agrifood and retail sectors, especially given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The Government therefore considers it important there is a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and is determined to achieve a balance which takes account of the interests of all the stakeholders in the grocery trade sector, including the interests of the consumer, and the need to ensure there is no impediment to passing on lower prices to consumers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In light of the above, the Minister does not intend to accept Senator White&rsquo;s amendments either in respect of section 3 or section 4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Bill is well intended and the intention is to increase fines and imprisonment where convictions are delivered.  I am also aware that the Bill forms part of structural reforms agreed under the EU and IMF memorandum of understanding.  Is it enough and will it deal with the issue?  I am not sure of this, but I appreciate it sets out to strengthen our position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Competition Authority was formed in 1991 and in the 21 years since, there have only been 32 convictions, while no custodial sentence has been handed down.  I went on the record years ago to say that I thought cocaine use was rife in rural Ireland, but the evidence today is that cartels are rife in Ireland.  Adequate funding needs to be given to the Competition Authority which only has two garda&iacute; operating.  According to a former head of the Competition Authority, Dr. John Fingleton, anti-competitive practices cost the Irish economy &euro;4 billion per annum.  That is a major issue and could turn the economy around if we were able to tackle it adequately.</P>
        <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by other Senators that we should look at introducing civil fines.  I appreciate we have advice from the Attorney General that we cannot do it, but surely the Supreme Court could ultimately decide whether we can do it.  The Office of Fair Trading in the UK provides whistleblowers with &pound;100,000 to come up with information that brings about convictions.  I suggest we consider something like this.  We could give &euro;150,000 to a whistleblower to provide information that would, ultimately, assist the consumers of Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is impossible for an ordinary person affected by sharp practices to take a case against companies found liable and who go through the courts system.  I am aware of one man who has been trying for 16 years to sue a company that has been convicted of anti-competitive practices.  The system is not in place to permit people to take cases in such situations.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt this Bill will pass in its current form, but we should put a time limit on it and see how effective it has been.  If we only have another 32 convictions in 21 years and if the system proves to be as ineffective as it was, we should look at the measures I am suggesting, namely, civil fines and rewards for whistleblowers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Kelly has said.  I welcome the Minister of State.  N&iacute;l an Ghaeilge chomh l&iacute;ofa agam agus at&aacute; ag an Aire St&aacute;it f&eacute;in agus ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh, but it is nice to listen to it.  We had a very good debate on this the previous day.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, was quoting Adam Smith and so on.  I thought he would come back with much more radical things.  This is a serious problem arising from the troika.  Senator Kelly mentioned the cost of &euro;4 billion as outlined by Dr. John Fingleton, and I will be talking about that in my own amendments later.  There is a Bill due which will amalgamate the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, and it may give us an opportunity to be more radical.  The impression we got when the Minster was in the House the previous day was that he was taking on board many comments.  They were all good, but he should do more.  I was disappointed to see the same Bill come back to us and I would echo those sentiments.  Perhaps the Minister of State should relay them to the Minister and the Department.</P>
        <P>This is a serious problem.  The sheltered sector is targeted by the troika and the IMF and it is doing a lot of damage in the country.  I will be referring to it later in my own amendments, but I agree strongly with the general principles that Senator Kelly has outlined.  We must have a Competition Authority that is up and about and protecting the consumer.  There are far too few penalties for white collar crime in Ireland.  People are able to collude with one another, with Departments and with regulators.  To take the Minister of State&rsquo;s other area of responsibility, we now know, thanks to PricewaterhouseCoopers, that we had a water system which had an operating expenditure way ahead of Northern Ireland and multiples of what it cost in Scotland.  We have to say that the regulator of the water industry in Ireland has not been doing his job up to now.  That is true across a wide range of sectors and when we add them all up, the competitiveness of Ireland as a place to do business is seriously reduced.</P>
        <P>I welcome what Senator Kelly said.  If the Minister of State wants to be more radical, he will find that there will be much support in this House for more radical measures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The very words I was going to use have been used by both Senators Kelly and Barrett.  It seems we have a chance.  The next Bill coming through will be to amalgamate the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  At least two steps should be taken at that stage.  I imagine it is far too late to take them now.  There is a necessity to have civil fines and to provide a reward for whistleblowers.  We have brought that up on a number of occasions in recent times, but those two steps will give teeth to the Competition Authority.  The authority does not have the manpower that it needs.  It certainly does not have it in respect of Garda enforcement.  I am told two garda&iacute; work with the Competition Authority.  I am not sure if that is correct, but that is what I am told.  If that is so, it is not possible to enforce what is needed, and there is a real need for it.  We can do something about it, if not in this Bill, certainly in the Bill that is due before us soon.</P>

        <P>Just for the benefit of other Senators, I think there is broad agreement that the civil fines principle is the way to go on this Bill.  That seems to be from where the Competition Authority was coming.  I appreciate and respect the view of the Attorney General.  Surely if we can impose civil fines upon citizens for other misdemeanours, would the Government not agree that in principle the civil fines route is a good route to go down?  How can that be done?  The issue seems to be that the present system, after 32 years, has only secured 32 convictions, with only two of those carrying any substantial result, one on price fixing in the fuel industry and the other on motor sales.  Does the Minister of State agree with this principle and, if so, can we find a mechanism to introduce civil fines at a lower level that would not be unconstitutional?  Would the Minister of State be willing to introduce an amendment on Report Stage that would reflect that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the views expressed by Senators Kelly, Barrett, Quinn and &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  Sticking to the civil issue, the advice to all Governments from Attorneys General has always been that we would be in breach of any provision in the Constitution if we did so; that is why there will not be civil fines.  The Competition Authority and the troika both wanted civil fines but they are happy with this legislation.  While it does not give us everything we might argue for right now, it is much stronger.  The penalties now allow for imprisonment for up to ten years for a serious breach of this legislation.  Someone thinking about anti-competitive activity will spend a lot longer in jail and the provision will apply to everyone in a company who may have had or acted upon direct knowledge of such activity.  The legislation is much stronger than what went before it.  It has taken account of all the views that have been raised by the parties, the statutory agency and the troika.  This is the best way to get the results the Senators want, or at least significantly increased penalties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators might already have a summary of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s enforcement record since 2000.  There have been 33 convictions, 14 for Citroen cars, comprising eight individuals and six undertakings, and a conviction against Ford.  Home heating oil investigations led to 17 convictions.  There has been one conviction for petrol price fixing and hedge cutting, three were found not guilty, with eight acquittals for Mayo waste cases.  Two civil cases have been won involving the Licensed Vintners Association and the Beef Industry Development Society.  A case was lost against the Irish League of Credit Unions following an appeal of a High Court decision.  Three other cases were settled.</P>
        <P>Senators asked what increases there would be in the authority&rsquo;s resources.  Since the Second Stage debate, a review of the resourcing of the authority has been undertaken and in accordance with the EU-IMF commitment in this area, a report on whether resourcing is sufficient to allow adequate enforcement capacity of the legislative framework has been compiled.  On foot of this review, I am pleased to announce the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has approved an additional ten staff for the enforcement function of the authority.  The current staffing level stands at 39.  The necessary steps to fill these posts are being undertaken within the Department and authority in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  There have been convictions but how many people have ended up behind bars?  The answer is none.  That is the crux of the issue.  There is a sense in some industries that the Bill is surrounded by optics.  I appreciate the Minister of State is coming from the right place but are we dealing with the issue?  The difference between a criminal and a civil case is the burden of proof is so much higher in a criminal case, making it much more difficult for a potential whistleblower.  In Britain there is compensation for whistleblowers of up to &pound;100,000 and that is an incentive.  In this state we had the case of Louise Bayliss in the HSE, where she blew the whistle and it was clear from that how hard it was for a person to come out because of potential ostracism and scapegoating, and the subsequent loss of earnings if he or she cannot find a job.</P>
        <P>We must do more to encourage those who want to end these practices.  There is a sense that the perpetrators are getting off lightly.  They are losing the cases but they do not end up behind bars.  The civil route, therefore, is the way to go.  Would the Government agree the civil route is the way to go if we can find a mechanism to do that?   If it means a constitutional amendment is necessary, should we consider that?  There is a great sense that this will not solve the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the staffing issue, we agree that it is hard for the Competition Authority to do what it needs to do with current staffing levels.  I welcome the increase in staffing from 39 to 49 but it previously had 59 staff.  Therefore, it is still understaffed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad we agree the penalties should be increased when the Bill is passed and that the penalties for those who break the law are much tougher.  Imprisonment of a person for ten years is very serious.  The legislation allows for the doubling of the penalty from five to ten years.  That must be paramount in the mind of anyone considering breaking the law.</P>
        <P>I worked with a whistleblower, Eugene McErlean, who did a tremendous service by revealing overcharging by the banks.  The protection of whistleblowers, particularly on where they work and the fact they might be fired if they speak out, is paramount and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is working on whistleblower legislation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">There are arguments both for and against financial benefits for whistleblowing.  An argument that could be used is that in a significant case where a person being charged could face up to ten years in jail, if the evidence was being given by a whistleblower who had been paid for whistleblowing, it could be more difficult to secure a conviction than if the whistleblower was protected in his or her place of work.  The risk being taken would not lead to financial benefit but neither would it lead to a loss of employment.  The issues surrounding whistleblowing are very important and I am confident all of the issues related to it will be looked at in the forthcoming Bill.  However, the Minister is of the view that there will not be a payment for whistleblowing.</P>

	<P>Governments have always been great for telling us why they are doing things.  The Government looks across the Irish Sea and says it is doing something because the British are doing it.  Now the British are doing this so I suggest some research is done into how effective the whistleblowing legislation is there.  Has it saved money?  It has to be worthwhile to pay a whistleblower &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000 if he or she saves the Exchequer tens of millions of euro.  We should not rule it out.  I appreciate that the Minister of State thinks ten years imprisonment might deter much of this.  </P>

	<P Just="Left">It might deter the Minister of State - me too - but it may not deter people who are making millions of euro from their involvement in cartels.</P>
        <P>When the Bill is passed we should keep it under constant review.  If it is proved to be ineffective we must deal with that with a hard hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation but I would like the Minister of State to give us an undertaking that if this does not prove to be effective we will revisit it at an early stage.  It is worrying that there have been only 32 convictions in 21 years and that no one has gone to prison.  We are all conscious of anti-competitive practices.  Everything we do must be in the interest of the consumer.</P>
        <P>A situation was brought to my attention after Christmas.  A large supermarket chain forced its suppliers to stack shelves to a high level and provide vast stock which was not sold over the Christmas period.  The supplier was forced to take the goods back and did not get paid.  That is an uncompetitive practice.  Much of the food was perishable and went to landfill.  That is outrageous.  Such a practice forces small shops out of business because they cannot compete and it imposes huge costs on suppliers who are struggling to survive.  They are forced to supply vast amounts of perishable goods and are not paid if the goods are not sold.  We must be conscious of anti-competitive practices.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is right when he says many small shops are being forced out of business because they cannot compete.  I recently spoke to a small shopkeeper who told me he cannot buy goods from producers for the price at which they are being sold in supermarkets.  He was buying goods in large multiples and selling them at a small profit in his shop.  It was cheaper for him to do that than to buy directly from a producer.  That is anti-competitive and we must tackle it.</P>
        <P>There is a job of work to be done.  We need to keep a close eye on how this legislation is working.  If it is not successful we will need to revisit it.</P>
        <P>I strongly support Senator Kelly with regard to the whistleblower system.  If it is working in the United Kingdom we should look at what is working in other jurisdictions and take it on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I agree with Senator Kelly about whistleblowers.  We are paying some bankers &euro;500,000 per annum to tell us what we already know.  If someone were paid &euro;500,000 to clear up cartels it would be money well spent, rather than going to a banker.  The case for providing extra resources to the Competition Authority is a good one.  We should put more resources into this area.  Cartels cost money and jobs.</P>
        <P>One of the benefits of the Border is that when Asda arrived in Northern Ireland large supermarkets south of the Border dropped their prices.  The arrival of Asda gave multiples in the South a kick up the ass.  Some multiples in County Donegal dropped their prices because people were flowing across the Border to Asda.  The arrival of Asda was good for Donegal, even if we did not shop there because it forced the big multiples to reduce their prices.  The same may be true of the Minister of State&rsquo;s county.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in may not agree but there is a practical advantage to having the Border.  If this was a 32-county state there would be more scope for cartels.  When anti-cartel legislation is enacted no company in Ireland should be able to manipulate the market.  I assure Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh that I do not use this example for any reason except to say the more competition we have the more our cost base is reduced.</P>
        <P>The whistleblower idea would be a step forward.  We should monitor the effectiveness of the UK whistleblower system.  We should not rule that out.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  There seems to be agreement on both sides of the House that the Bill is not adequate.  Disappointment on the Government side is more diplomatic and expressed in nice soft tones.  Senator Kelly&rsquo;s way of speaking was very gentle.</P>

The Bill is fine in principle but it is not up to scratch.</P>

        <P>We are, undoubtedly, facing serious difficulties in regard to competitiveness, as discussed.  An issue not yet referred to is the low-cost sale of alcohol in supermarkets which is having a detrimental impact on local shops and pubs.  There are also issues for the hospitality industry, with hotel bedrooms, for instance, being sold at prices which make it almost impossible for smaller, family-run businesses to compete.  An industry that has never been tackled by the Competition Authority is the concrete industry.  Incidentally, a former chairman of the authority, Dr. John Fingleton, who is now working in a similar role in Britain has been very critical of its approach as not going far enough.</P>
        <P>We have had a broad discussion in this House on civil penalties, which is another issue to consider.  They have been introduced in Britain, as I understand it, where civil and criminal cases can run in parallel.  A headline case was taken recently against British Airways, for instance, which resulted in a multi-million pound settlement for the individual citizen who took it.  If such a system can operate in Britain, surely we can introduce a similar regime in this country.  We are all in favour of the imposition of civil penalties, where possible, because criminal penalties do not seem to be working, as evidenced by the fact that we have had 32 convictions, but nobody has ended up behind bars in 21 years.  That record is not much of a disincentive to multi-million pound cartels and golden circles &mdash; call them what one may &mdash; to indulge in anti-competitive practices.  I expect the Minister of State will probably respond to my proposal with the standard line on advice from the Attorney General.  Will he outline the rationale in this regard?  Is it based on the level of the fine?  If so and if the level of the fine was reduced in a civil case scenario, would that serve to overcome the constitutional impediment?  Assuming that is the case, it might well be the route we should pursue.</P>
        <P>Whenever the Government and the troika talk about competitiveness, there always seems to be an associated assault on low-paid workers.  This is something to which my party is completely opposed.  While bona fide traders will always be willing to pay a decent wage for a decent day&rsquo;s work, some of the larger multinational companies, in particular, can sometimes force the competitiveness issue, which leads to calls from unscrupulous employers for reductions in the pay of workers at the lower end of the scale.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not buy into this.  Many of the difficulties in regard to competitiveness are a result not of wage pressures but of other issues such as upward-only rent reviews.  Most of the business people to whom I have spoken who are finding it difficult to trade identify the inability to renegotiate their rental agreement as one of the most significant factors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We welcome the Bill as a step in dealing with the issues that undermine competitiveness, but, unfortunately, it does not go far enough.  Cartels will continue to abuse their market dominance and thus undermine the economy.  I could not let Senator Jimmy Harte&rsquo;s comments on the retention of the Border go without some comment.  It is the most ludicrous argument I have heard for retaining partition that an all-Ireland economy would increase the scope for cartels.  That is an absolutely preposterous scenario to bring forward.  On the contrary, the opposite would be the case.  For most of the businesses such as the Senator&rsquo;s own which deal in the Border region, a 32-county economy would lead to a reduction in the volume of paperwork because they would be dealing with one jurisdiction instead of two.  Many of the Senator&rsquo;s Government colleagues have commented on the lower cost of petrol and diesel in the North.  In an all-Ireland economy there would be scope to harmonise these costs and even to argue for a smaller Government take on motor fuels.  There would be only one Executive, perhaps one Seanad and one D&aacute;il, which would lead to substantial savings on an all-island basis.  This might be one of the arguments for the retention of the Seanad, that we could amalgamate it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I appreciate that.  However, overhead costs are of particular concern to most businesses.  As such, Senator Michael Mullins is correct that we must address the question of water charges.

	<P Just="Left">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  The argument that we reduce costs and red tape is an argument in favour of adopting a 32-county approach to the economy.  Anyone who lives along the Border will attest to that fact.  Having one tourism authority, as opposed to three, would certainly make matters much better for the hospitality industry.  Waterways Ireland and the IRFU have proved what I describe can be done.  Perhaps Senator Jimmy Harte might have a word with his colleagues in the respective soccer associations to see if they could work towards adopting an all-Ireland approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the serious matter under discussion, on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il my party called for the insertion into the Bill of the ability to take civil proceedings in order to expedite matters in respect of anti-competitive practices.  However, the Government opposed our proposals in this regard, which is a shame.  We request that this matter be reconsidered.  The modest amendment we have tabled in this House requests that the Government and those which succeed it respond to proposals brought forward by the Competition Authority.  We will be engaging in further contact with the authority to ascertain where it stands on this issue.  I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s indication that it is now broadly in favour of what is set down in the Bill which has not changed since Second Stage.  We will, however, be contacting it to seek further clarification on the matter.</P>
        <P>We are not calling on the Government to act on recommendations but rather to respond to the Competition Authority and explain the action it either will or will not take in respect of anti-competitive practices.  The basic issue is that amendment No. 3 is designed to facilitate the introduction of civil penalties.  Perhaps the Minister of State might indicate whether the amendment would remain unconstitutional if the level of the penalties was lowered.  Does he agree, in principle, that if something of this nature can be introduced in the United Kingdom &mdash; by the former head of the authority in this country who stated it would be a good idea if it were implemented in Ireland &mdash; and even if a constitutional amendment of some kind was necessary, we should proceed with what is envisaged in the amendment in order that the competitiveness issues raised can be tackled?</P>

	<P>Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute;, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; cheana, gurb &iacute; tuairim an Ard-Aighne nach f&eacute;idir &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh, mar a luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir, gan reafrainn a bheith ann.  T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir gur f&eacute;idir f&iacute;ne&aacute;il a ghearradh sa ch&uacute;irt, ach n&iacute; f&eacute;idir l&rsquo;aon fhoras seachas na Revenue Commissioners thaobh civil fine a ghearradh.  Is f&eacute;idir f&iacute;ne&aacute;il a fh&aacute;il uathu si&uacute;d.  As simple as it might appear, even a minor traffic offence, in respect of which a court hands down a fine, is still a criminal offence and falls into this category.  I accept, however, that it will not appear on one&rsquo;s record in the same way other fines might.  As stated, the clear advice to the Government is that there should not be civil fines.  As the Senator acknowledged, the Competition Authority and the troika are satisfied that what is envisaged represents significant progress.</P>
        <P>It appears amendment No. 3 would give the Competition Authority the power to investigate an action by a Department.  A Department acts as an undertaking only when engaged for gain in the supply of goods or the provision of services.  Departments rarely act as undertakings and are, therefore, outside the scope of the Competition Act.  The authority has no power to investigate an action or the activities of non-undertakings.  The amendment would also appear to give the authority the power to recommend to Departments that they reconsider their actions, take certain steps to remedy alleged contraventions and account to it for their actions.  It would further appear to give the authority the right to act where actions do not contravene competition law but do adversely affect a person.  Such a power would divert the authority from its actual function, namely, the investigation of breaches of competition law.</P>
        <P>More generally, section 30 gives the Competition Authority a statutory advisory role in respect of proposals for legislation and the implications for competition in markets for goods and services of such proposals.  The authority may and has on many occasions reported on how competition is working in different sectors and made recommendations to improve how competition works in these sectors.  Such recommendations are addressed to the relevant Minister or public body, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The key point is that if new legislation is proposed, the sponsoring Department will send a memo to the Government.  Such memos are automatically circulated to the Competition Authority and those responsible for consumer affairs.  Their advice will be included in the memo to the Government.  In other words, before action is taken, any issue relating to competition or consumer affairs is commented upon.  The authority is party to any memos on these issues.  Legislation is proofed in respect of any anti-competitive measures it may contain before it is the subject of a Cabinet decision.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has engaged in a process to report on progress made in implementing Competition Authority recommendations to date.  Of the 170 plus recommendations made between 2004 and 2010, only 13, or 7%, remain under active consideration.  The vast majority have either been accepted and implemented, accepted in principle but not yet implemented, rejected or overtaken by other policy developments.  The Government has considered these and Ministers have been urged to accelerate their consideration and implementation, where appropriate, of the relevant outstanding recommendations in the context of enhancing competitiveness within the economy.</P>
        <P>In respect of future Competition Authority recommendations, the Minister with relevant policy responsibility must within nine months of the publication of such recommendations bring a report to the Government in which he or she outlines his or her position on their implementation.  The next such report is expected to arise in the context of the action plan for jobs which calls on the authority to identify any sheltered areas of the economy in which competition is restricted and to commission studies in such areas, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>Requiring a Department of State to report to the Competition Authority on its response to recommendations made by the authority gives considerable power to an unelected statutory body.  While the authority may be expert in the area of competition, it does not have the wider public policy role of Departments of State.  The Government, Ministers and Departments must consider issues from more than one policy perspective.  As stated, however, all legislation is proofed in respect of anti-competitiveness measures it may contain.  I hope I have satisfied some of the arguments brought forward by the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister of State has described is the theory involved.  However, if one considers the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, the Department said nothing.  This is recorded in the screening regulatory impact analysis of the legislation which indicates that the Department either said nothing or broadly approved.  That legislation was highly anti-competitive in nature, particularly as it was sponsored by a Department which was supposed to be promoting entrepreneurship.  Where Ministers and Departments infringe the principles of competition policy, the Competition Authority should indicate this fact.  I do not see a case for granting exemptions in this regard.</P>
        <P>We are concerned that two individuals might decide to sell ice cream on Bull Island or in Blackrock in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency on the same Sunday afternoon and at the same price.  As stated on Second Stage, however, most collusion occurs between Departments and around the Cabinet table.  In recent times Paul Gorecki produced a most interesting paper in which he pointed out that the previous Government was moving against competition, engaging in increasing levels of ministerial interference and rigging markets.  I will provide a long list in this regard when we come to discuss the amendments tabled in my name.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the protection to which the Minister of State referred is adequate.  I do not care who &mdash; whether it be Ministers or civil servants &mdash; is restricting competition in the economy.  The Competition Authority should promote competition.  I do not know whether we should transfer everything to the Department of Justice and Equality and, as is the case with the American system, make those who engage in the collusion to which I refer subject to penalties.  The current system is too cosy.  Some people have what is called &ldquo;regulatory capture&rdquo;, which ought to be a matter of concern.  The Competition Authority must represent every citizen who is in favour of competition against anybody &mdash; regardless of who he or she may be &mdash; who is preventing competition.  Given that in many cases Departments have a record of engaging in restrictive practices and preventing competition, they should not be exempt.</P>
        <P>In a recent case in the United Kingdom both the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission judged that the Civil Aviation Authority in Britain was a little too chummy with the British Airports Authority.  The solution arrived at was to force the latter to divest itself of its airports.  It sold Gatwick and in the past week Edinburgh airports.  The British competition authority did not say these are civil servants getting together in the national interest so it could not possibly investigate them.  In fact, they may be more dangerous than two people rigging the price of ice cream on a sunny Sunday afternoon in Blackrock, County Louth, and a real competition policy would have to target that issue.</P>

	<P>Taca&iacute;m leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag mo chomhleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Barrett.  The aim of the amendment is to give the Bill more teeth.  Best practice across Europe places responsibility on a government to respond to a report by the relevant competition authority within a specified timescale.  In Italy, for example, the relevant competition authority has the ability to table legislation for consideration.  In this State there is no obligation to consider, let alone act, on the recommendations of the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P>If the Government is serious with regard to dealing with corrupt practices, it should include the clause on the obligation to respond to recommendations of the authority, one which must outline the Government&rsquo;s proposed actions with regard to each recommendation.  We see no reason this gaping hole in the legislation cannot be amended.  If there is a form of collusion between a State apparatus and a private sector operator in any area, it must be tackled and the Competition Authority must be given the powers needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The definition of &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; in the Bill includes a person, an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production or supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service.  If any one of those entities acts in an anti-competitive manner, the Competition Authority has to pursue them under this legislation.  While I appreciate Senator Barrett&rsquo;s point, the advice I have is that no one can avoid the rigours of the law should the Competition Authority believe they should pursue them legally for anti-competitive trading.  Departments are not expressly included in the Bill because they are not undertakings as such.  Notwithstanding that fact, if a portion of their activity is deemed to be an undertaking, they then are the subject of the law.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;6.&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Subsection (1) of section 30 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following paragraphs after paragraph (<i>g</i>)&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;(<i>h</i>) to study and analyse any practice or method of competition or decision with implications for competition in markets for goods and services that has its origins in a decision or action by a body working with or on behalf of a Minister of Government or Agency of Government;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>i</i>) to analyse the actions and practices of all regulatory agencies, statutory bodies and ministerial departments of the State for violations of Part 1 of this Act;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>j</i>) the right to publish to the public-at-large non-commercially sensitive findings and analyses of firms, regulators, agencies and sectors that that Authority has conducted as part of this Act;&rdquo;,</P>
        <P LI="2">and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (4), by the substitution of &ldquo;section 14A&rdquo; for &ldquo;section 14&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I believe section 14A was proposed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  Perhaps it was a typing mistake or a drafting error that got them mixed up.  There has been no collusion between myself and the Minister, considering we are speaking about joint practices.</P>
        <P>I want the Competition Authority to play a more dynamic role, a point alluded to by Members on all sides of the House.  I hope we will get a date of when the next competition legislation comes through.  As the Minister will note, there is more appetite for competition policy in the Seanad than was previously thought.</P>
        <P>We need someone to regulate the regulators.  There have been many unsatisfactory procedures in the past.  Paul Gorecki of the ESRI drew attention to these in a recent paper.  Energy prices, for example, have been pushed up because a former energy Minister interfered by imposing, as the OECD stated, unrealistic wind-farm targets on the energy sector.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, was pretty well destroyed by the then transport Minister, Noel Dempsey, who ordered it to increase charges by 41% so that the entire cost of the over-investment in two terminals at Dublin Airport was borne by the user and not the organisation.  Interestingly, the orders for this appeared on the CAR website far sooner than they appeared on the then Department of Transport website.  There was interference in the independence of that regulator.</P>
        <P>Did we confuse the objectives of bank regulation by seeing the Central Bank and Financial Services Regulatory Authority as a promotional body for the IFSC and lost sight of regulation?  When a sector costs the economy 40% of GDP when it has to be rescued, one has to question the competence of the regulators in charge of the sector.  Everyone on all sides of the House has questioned that competence in the case of banking regulation.  The Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board, CARB, has still not reported on what kind of accounts were prepared for these banks and on which the State was induced to invest in them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Public Transport Regulation Act gave the entire bus system a direct award contract to deliberately avoid competitive tendering.  That was sent to every Department in the screening regulatory impact analysis and all either said nothing or agreed.  Accordingly, there is no protection for the consumer or potential new entrants.  Someone had to take the school bus contract to court to know why it is not open to competitive tendering.  There have been problems with refuse collection and the belief among some local authorities that it should be given to chosen companies rather than be determined by competition in which the consumer would decide.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon criticised how the then Department of Transport conducted itself in the awarding of the Swords Express bus licence by stating it had usurped the functions given to it in trust by the Oireachtas.  There was a similar judgment by the Chief Justice, John Murray, on the way the Department of Health conducted itself with regard to controlling the market in health insurance, stating it had tried to usurp the functions of the Legislature.</P>
        <P>All of what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and others have raised seems to happen every day.  They are seriously damaging the competitiveness of the economy and they are anti-competitive in their intentions.  I am sure the Department of Transport deliberately held up the Swords Express licence for two and a half years and then gave it to CIE in five days.  Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon commented adversely on how the Department conducted itself.</P>
        <P>No one should be exempt from being investigated by the Competition Authority.  The British Civil Aviation Authority got too cosy with the operators of the UK&rsquo;s airports.  Dr. John Fingleton, a former Trinity College Dublin colleague, and now head of the Office of Fair Trading, intervened to make a better market substitute for that system of failed regulation.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposes to analyse the actions and practices of all regulatory agencies, statutory bodies and Departments for violations.  The favourable treatment of the pharmaceutical industry in the Republic of Ireland meant there was a massive difference in the price of pharmaceuticals North and South of the Border as there was a much stricter regulatory regime for pharmaceuticals.  We have come back a bit from that.</P>
        <P>The amendment mentions &ldquo;the right to publish to the public at large non-commercially sensitive findings and analyses of firms, regulators, agencies and sectors that the authority has conducted as part of this Act.&rdquo;  In other words, I do not want the emphasis to be in relatively small instances &mdash; home heating oil and car prices were mentioned &mdash; and we should go for the entire gamut of public and consumer expenditure, with a much more dynamic Competition Authority acting on behalf of the consumer.  There is a paper supporting what I am saying by Mr. Pat Massey and presented at the Kenmare conference on 15 October 2011.  The World Economic Forum ranks Ireland as 25th out of 139 countries in the effectiveness of competition policy, and Mr. Massey indicated this put Ireland behind most of its EU partners and OECD countries, suggesting considerable scope for improvement.  We mentioned this to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on the last occasion, and the purpose of the amendment as proposed is to create a competition policy with teeth.</P>
        <P>We are not satisfied with the very small number of prosecutions mentioned by the Minister of State.  This is an attempt to introduce some kind of dynamic to the process.  We were elected &mdash; in the case of the Seanad it was this time last year &mdash; to reform, and the public made that decision to change the vast majority of people in the D&aacute;il, with 42 new Senators.  Established institutions must be reformed and competition policy should be far more energetic and active.  If the Minister of State cannot accept this amendment today, I ask that it be considered when the next competition Bill comes to the House.  It should be done quickly because this is not, according to the World Economic Forum, one of our shining lights.  I presume that the long tradition of protectionism has led to certain firms of solicitors and other people getting certain imports banned and tariffs or quotas imposed.  That cosy relationship between insiders and outsiders in the Irish economy has come into existence but has not been properly tackled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Senator Barrett that the solicitors in the country are not the cause of anti-competitive practice.  As proof, the first case taken to a European court relating to anti-competitive practice was dealt with by a firm of Cork solicitors against Comhlacht Si&uacute;cra &Eacute;ireann, which refused to sell sugar to distributors and decided to sell directly to shops.  That was one of the first cases taken to a European court dealing with anti-competitive practice.  That court made a judgment against Comhlacht Si&uacute;cra &Eacute;ireann in that case.  We had just joined the European Community and there was a new forum available to ensure competition in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will raise an issue relating to health care, particularly VHI and the role it is playing in the area.  I have filed a complaint with the Competition Authority with regard to the following matter.  In the past 95 years we have no new private hospital built or opened in Cork.  Those behind the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin are prepared to come to Cork and offer private health care, and two of the health insurers are prepared to provide cover for patients and pay for care in the proposed new hospital.  However, VHI has decided otherwise, which is anti-competitive for two reasons.  First, VHI is prepared to quote under the cost of the existing health care providers in Cork and, second, the fewer beds there are in the private health care centre, the fewer consultants who can practise.  The charges are therefore set in stone.</P>
        <P>I have repeatedly raised the need to reduce the cost of health care.  Last year we spent &euro;13.4 billion on health care and we got &euro;13.317 billion in income tax.  If there is any sector that needs a reduction in cost it is health care.  This commercial State company has decided it will not allow competition, which is absolutely disgraceful.  Its role is not to decide how many private beds are used; it should instead ensure that the people to whom it provides cover get an adequate standard of cover and are prepared to pay for that cost.  The company seems to be taking on a totally new role which is to regulate who can open private health care facilities.  That area should be carefully examined.  I accept that the Minister does not have a direct role in how VHI arrives at its decisions but the company&rsquo;s role is not to control the number of available facilities.  The issue must be dealt with in taking into account the cost of health care.  I understand the company is hiding behind a case pending in the courts that deals with a different issue.  It is the wrong way to arrive at a decision and now, more than ever, we must have competition in that area.  We must tackle the problem.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett&rsquo;s proposal should be kept in mind in dealing with this issue and the role of State agencies.  We must ensure that any anti-competitive practice is not allowed to continue in certain areas, and serious consideration should be given to the matter.</P>

	<P>T&aacute;im ag &eacute;ir&iacute; le tac&uacute; leis an leas&uacute; at&aacute; &aacute; chur chun cinn ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Barrett.  Aonta&iacute;onn Sinn F&eacute;in leis an mbun-phrionsabal &aacute;t&aacute; s&eacute; &aacute; chur chun &mdash; n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir go mbeimis ag glacadh le haicme &aacute;irithe den phobal at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh go maith agus iad ag f&aacute;g&aacute;il daoine eile faoi chois ar bhealach aicmi&uacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the amendment from my colleague, Senator Barrett, and we agree with the thrust of his argument.  Sinn F&eacute;in policy is to ensure that all people are treated equally and everybody gets a fair crack at the whip.  In no state should there be a position where the citizens are put in second place to an elite group, cartel or golden circle of any sort.  Considering the Moriarty, McCracken and Mahon tribunal findings, there is a sense in the community and among people in general that this has been happening.  We often get castigated by more conservative economic groups about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s economic policy but our idea is to examine the levels of pay in the Civil Service, bring them to more equitable levels and tax people who make more money in order to bring down their level of pay.  We also wish to introduce wealth taxes, etc.</P>
        <P>We note some of the reasons given by the Government, for example, for having to pay so much to chief executives in the likes of Bank of Ireland, such as a fear that they could go to a public sector job that would pay as much.  We could debate the amount paid to certain heads of semi-State organisations, with some being paid up to &euro;500,000 per year.  We are told if those people went to the private sector, they would find pay of equal standing.  If we followed Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policy, which includes introducing a 48% tax rate or taxing those with more than &euro;1 million in wealth, it would make this State much more competitive.  Most importantly, it would bring down overheads for citizens and the cost of business.  Leaving the citizens at the heart of the argument is vital in this debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett is absolutely correct in saying that any activity of this sort, which is detrimental to the citizen, creates an elite or a position where people are locked out of a market or prices increase to suit an elite, must be tackled.  The Competition Authority must be given the wherewithal to do that on our behalf, and the Government should move on the actions of the authority.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a useful and informative debate and I am learning from the constructive engagement between all the parties in the House.  I accept the points raised and, in particular, the issue raised by Senator Barrett regarding different entities.  If an entity is an undertaking as defined in the Act, then no matter what it does, it will be subject to competition law and it will be subject, therefore, to the decision of the Competition Authority should it decide to pursue the entity regarding a breach of competition law.  I acknowledge the contracts mentioned by the Senator.</P>
        <P>When I was Opposition spokesperson on transport, there were two major issues.  When the previous Government opened up competition on the Maynooth bus route, a private contractor commenced a service.  I submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act regarding this and the report was interesting.  On the first day the private bus operator serviced the route, the departmental officials commented that no matter where he went, a bus operated by Dublin Bus was either behind him or in front of him and he could not park or pick up passengers because it meant two buses were waiting to do so.  Dublin Bus denied all of that.  The Senator is correct that we must have competition and the regulator is the Competition Authority.  Any person or entity deemed to be an undertaking will be subject to the full rigours of the law should the authority so decide.  Given these are criminal offences, it is important that the Minister of the day does not interfere with the right of the authority to make decisions.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue raised by Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Burke, the authority considers enforcement of the law to be a priority.  It can investigate alleged breaches of the legislation and, at the end of 2011, it was engaged in seven active investigations into alleged hardcore breaches of the Act and three active civil investigations into non-hardcore activities.  The authority, as the statutory independent body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State, has received information relating to alleged anti-competitive behaviour in the concrete industry and a private action is under way in the courts.  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the authority, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has no direct function in this matter and, therefore, it is not appropriate to comment further on such matters.  I hope I have addressed the issues raised by Senator Barrett.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The departmental officials have taken note of all the issues raised by Senators.  The new legislation is expected to be published before the end of the year.  I have no doubt that, where possible, the views expressed by Senators will be incorporated following due process and testing of the legalities of the provisions.  An opportunity will be available soon to take on board the issues raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  The strong message from the House is that there should be more power to the collective elbows.  We must get this right because this is undermining the competitiveness of the economy, particularly at a time 14.5% of the population is unemployed.  It seemed to happen subconsciously.  People in the circles we have mentioned will always collude and never compete and this is not in the public interest.  A much more active and assertive Competition Authority and competition policy are needed.  Whether or not the authority can take cases, it should put information in the media.  The media would be delighted if the authority said X sector is behaving in an anti-competitive manner and is costing every consumer, for example, &euro;100 a week or a year.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Burke.  We agree frequently on the need for competition in the health insurance market.  There is a message of consolation for him.  Towards the end of Pat Massey&rsquo;s paper on Irish competition policy for the Kenmare conference he states, &ldquo;Measures to increase competition in energy and transport might be more important in terms of competitiveness than proposed reforms of the legal profession&rdquo;.   I agree with the Senator on the legal profession because, in the absence of an assertive competition policy, the legal profession won the taxi deregulation case before Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy and the judicial review under Mr. Justice Paul Carney.  Lawyers took the case and the judgment was that one was entitled to enter a sector for which one has the skills and training and the public has the right to the services of such persons.  We went from 4,000 taxis to 28,000 taxis and Goodbody&rsquo;s estimated that saved &euro;750 million a year in waiting time for the customers.  The industry is worth &euro;1.5 billion now and one does not have to stand out in the rain on a day like this waiting for a taxi.  The limited bus deregulation has taken solicitors in places such as Galway to take court cases.  It is a tribute to the legal profession that they have done that but the Competition Authority exists in statute to do it and I hope we embolden its staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to health insurance, the Milliman report examined the cost base of VHI.  It is protected by the Department of Health and this is unwarranted.  It found that procedures after which people should have been out of hospital within 3.7 days were taking 11.6 days in Ireland because the monopoly health insurance sector works on behalf of the sector and does not promote competition within it.  There is a serious lack of competitiveness in the market and, as Senator Burke said, there is a serious high cost problem in the health service.  The unwillingness of the Department to allow competition in that area comes back to tame, emasculated sectoral regulators such as the one in charge of airports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Insurance Authority never seems to consider the consumer interest.  It is totally defensive of an existing State company.  It is difficult if a Minister owns a company and is a member of the Cabinet.  He will naturally be influenced to defend the company but under competition law he cannot do that.  Whether he is an undertaking, if he acts in an anti-competitive manner, he should come under the surveillance of the Competition Authority.   Compared with its UK counterpart, the authority has a lack of commitment and energy for the fight.  It will not take up the cudgels except in minor cases such as those relating to car sales and home heating oil.  Much larger sectors should be targeted.</P>
        <P>This is also one of the criticisms of the National Asset Management Agency.  Too many of the people who caused the problems in the financial sector are working for the agency.  We need competitive tendering for all aspects of public procurement.  If there is not competition, the authority should at least explain why.  Perhaps those responsible may not want to take much notice but the public would be grateful if some agency went to bat on their behalf on occasion.  I am delighted that the Minister of State said he is being influenced by the debate and that we will revisit the new legislation before Christmas.  I will not, therefore, press the amendment but all sides of the House will be disappointed if the lack of progression on this legislation between Second Stage and Committee Stage is repeated with the new Bill.  There has to be more commitment, energy and drive in the next Bill to address cartels, monopolies and restrictive practices.  The reason we tabled the amendments was not much progress had been made between Second and Committee Stages.  The troika and everybody else wants progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation is poor because the people who drafted it do not have a clue what it is like to compete in a market.  Every time I see the airport bus I think of the number of years it took to get it and break the competition with CIE and the introduction of private buses to the country.  The economy is dragged, kicking and screaming to become competitive.  I do not the blame the Minister of State, it is not his fault.  The employment figures for Europe indicate that the efficient countries do not have high rates of unemployment.  It was not just about the property bubble, although it made a huge contribution.  Ireland is inefficient in many areas.  As Senator Barrett said there is a lack of drive and want.  When competing in the private sector one has to be efficient.  In Germany, when the car industry came under pressure its economy was able to cut back to the bone and become efficient as that is its culture.  I exclude the private sector in this as it is gone if it cannot survive.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Landy said on the Order of Business that the two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, should be instructed to come in here to answer why they are not giving money to small and medium-sized companies.  The Minister&rsquo;s comment this morning was ridiculous.  We have been putting the screws on the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, relentlessly, week in, week out but he is not listening to the small and medium-sized business.  Instead, he is listening to the banks who say they are giving out the money.  I ask the Minister of State to urge the banks to wake up.  I exclude the personnel here from a different Department and while I do not wish to make enemies in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in the previous Government I had serious problems with that Department.  There was a lack of experience and a cut off from what it is like in the outside world and what it is like to compete.  All of us, as individuals, are here because we want to improve the position.</P>
        <P>The Bill is disappointing.  I had hoped the Minister would be proactive on delivering jobs but the first issue is to get the money.  If people do not have the money they cannot grow their businesses.  The only way that can be done is by creating employment.  All Senators are of the same mind in respect of the Bill.  I looked up the article by Patrick Massey, referred to by Senator Barrett, which contains much information by people who are authorities on it.  They gave the hard facts on the lack of competition, which is part of the reason there is so much unemployment.  I do not blame this Government but past Governments also.  We just have to wake up.</P>

We want to ensure the best possible outcomes for the consumer.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has given an indication that the contributions made here will be taken on board when future legislation is being drafted.

	<P>Constructive suggestions have been made and they will all be listened to.  New legislation will be published before the end of the year and debated in the House with the intention of allowing everybody to put their ideas on the table in order that they can be properly debated.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has done a very good job in respect of this legislation.  I wish to summarise some of the issues.  Major changes have been made.  That one can go to jail for up to ten years instead of five will soften the cough of anybody who is considering breaking the law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It has to be implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a significant change.  That maximum fines have been increased from &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million is significant.  The fact that the daily or <i>per diem</i> fines have been increased is also significant.  The Probation of Offenders Act shall not apply in respect of offences committed under sections 6 or 7, until now it could be applied by the courts.  That will no longer apply.  If one is convicted in court, it is a criminal conviction, and even if one does not go to jail it is on one&rsquo;s record and will have implications down the road.  The Probation of Offenders Act did not necessarily apply previously.  There are serious issues here which are being dealt with.  The changes are significant.  If a month ago, one was considering anti-competitive activities and the penalties one would face, when the Bill is passed the penalties will be much more negative if convicted in court.  The Bill is tougher and more forceful and takes away the Probation of Offenders Act which was relied on in terms of a conviction.  We are prepared to listen to what everybody has to say and introduce stronger legislation which will be published by the end of the year.  Much progress has been made.  The Bill is being dealt with by an effective and efficient Minister who is committed to changing the law to make it tougher on those who want to abuse their dominant position or to carry out activities which are anti-competitive.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) The Minister, having considered the information notified under this subsection, shall respond within 28 days.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment arises from our very useful discussion the last time we debated the Bill.  It refers to items the Minister was taking back for consideration over the weekend and referred to people in the western province of the island.  Have there been developments in that regard?  If there are, I would be willing to support the Minister&rsquo;s amendments.  One issue was the period in which the Department would reply to applications.  The Minister said he was open to considering that issue.  Other matters were issues underlying regulatory risk rating and the legal and other problems that might arise.  If the Minister has thoughts on what has happened since we last met I am happy to cede the floor to him.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment arises from our previous discussion.  I perceived a door was ajar rather than shut.</P>
        <P>Important commercial decisions need to made and people need a response.  When I spoke to the Minister he did not, in principle, have a problem with the response time.  He referred to a different number of days, something which I am willing to accommodate.  My concerns arise in regard to getting responses and improving procedures.  I refer to the Swords Express case.  The judgment was handed down by Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon on 20 July 2010.</P>
        <P>One application arrived in the Department on 19 April 2005 and was awarded on 30 October 2007.  Another application was lodged in February 2008 and was rejected in July 2010.  The tradition of sitting on applications is not what we need as we try to reform the country after the IMF had to rescue us.  The Minister has requirements that when he corresponds with people they should reply.</P>
        <P>Without labouring the point or discussing the judgment of Mr. Justice McMahon too much, we have to respond more quickly.  Part of his worries about the case were that a Dublin Bus application was submitted on 5 June 2008 and was responded to by 12 June 2008.  Undoubtedly, the treatment of the application, as Mr. Justice McMahon said, doubly disadvantaged the applicant.  Let us have a simple system to deal with applications and a prompt system of responding to them.</P>
        <P>We should not have to cite the judgment of the court in the House again.  We should be so famed for promptly turning around applications and requests that the issue will never again arise in court or become controversial.  We all have lots of other things to do to reform the country, move from the IMF rescue programme and recover our sovereignty.  It is a simple administrative matter, about which I do not know if I need to say much more.</P>
        <P>The track record is not good and should be better.  We want a highly professional and safe bus and road fleet.  We broadly have that, as we saw from the data.  There is about one bus fatality and 70 truck fatalities per year.  Let us make the system as professional as possible.  The professionals who invest hundreds of thousands of euro in vehicles should deal with a professional Department.  Unhappy cases such as those described should not arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue the Senator raises in his contribution relates to private bus operators applying for licences to operate a route.  That was certainly the case in regard to Swords Express and, while that is not pertinent to this legislation, I share his view in that regard.  Since that function has been transferred from my Department to the NTA and the system has been changed and resources improved, by and large, licence applications are dealt with pretty efficiently.  Certainly, in my period as Minister, I can count on one finger of one hand the number of complaints I have received about licences not being adjudicated upon quickly enough.  While I have had a number of complaints about licences being refused and people not being happy they did not get a licence, I have seen only one with regard to turnover time being an issue.  Things have improved since the transfer to the NTA, which is an independent regulator as opposed to the Department of Transport, which has a more intimate relationship with CIE, being the parent Department.</P>
        <P>I understand the philosophy behind the Senator&rsquo;s proposal.  He said on the last occasion that if the Government requires people to send information in to deadlines, then it is only reasonable the Government should also stick to deadlines.  That is the reason I wanted to accept the amendment, in principle at least.  What I had hoped to do was to insert the term &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; but I was advised by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; has no meaning in this context and would have knock-on effects for other amendments.</P>
        <P>With regard to the period of 28 days, the RSA told me it would not be sufficient time for it to turn around and check information.  For example, if information has been given about a past conviction or other matters, the RSA does not believe 28 days is a sufficient turnaround time in this regard.  For that reason, I will not accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment that all bodies under his aegis should promptly reply to correspondence, particularly where people are seeking to invest, given we are trying to get this country going again.  Has the RSA suggested a period longer than 28 days or do we know what it has in mind?  Investors would like to have some prospect, when they seek to invest in this very important area, that there will be a response.  While we know from the Minister&rsquo;s reply it will not happen within 28 days, we have to set a target. We have to develop a dynamic, competitive economy. Delays in responding to applications, as in the unhappy historic situation the Minister described, which has now been transferred to the NTA with a dramatic reduction in response rate, are not acceptable. Should we not require prompt responses? The RSA can always plead there are special circumstances for not reaching the target but should it not have a performance target in terms of good governance? </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I am sorry the Attorney General advised against what we had hoped would happen.  As he was also advising against measures to promote competition policy, which we were discussing with the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, earlier, it seems the Attorney General is already working on the abolition of the Seanad and is certainly not interested in any ideas that come out of here.  I would like to have the Minister&rsquo;s response on whether there is some idea of a time limit.  Have we any idea if a different number was substituted for 28 days?  The RSA presumably wants these powers and successfully persuaded local authorities and the Minister to transfer them from the local authorities.  Therefore, it must have had some idea how it would exercise the duties it is seeking in this Bill and how it would respond to people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senators this is Report Stage and it is not usually a case of back and forth questioning.  As an exception, if the Minister is willing, I will allow him to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is fine.  I appreciate the fact Senator Barrett is trying to improve the legislation, which is why I am happy to debate the point back and forth.  The RSA did not give me a timeframe &mdash; perhaps I should have asked for one but I did not.  It said it does not want to be tied to 28 days in legislation because that would put it in a position where it would have to make a decision within 28 days and it might not necessarily be the right one.  If the period was 28 days, it would then need a mechanism in legislation to give a reason for it taking longer than 28 days.  To take the example of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it has a period of 18 weeks to make a decision but there is then provision in legislation for it to look for more time.  That would need to be written in also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator&rsquo;s point about having a target is well made.  What I am willing to do in that regard is to write to the chair and CEO of the RSA setting a target of six weeks for reply.  If we find this becomes a problem, we can then legislate for it in future.  As I am rapidly learning, there is road traffic legislation all the time; therefore, there will be plenty of opportunity to do so if the target cannot be achieved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  I withdraw the amendment.  The Minister can say to the RSA he met some very awkward Senators who kept on insisting on a date and that is why he had to overrule the advice that this should not be time-limited.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 30, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">(10) The Authority will ensure that all data generated by the &ldquo;risk rating system&rdquo; is maintained as confidential and that an up-to-date list of data controllers and data processors is provided to the Minister.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment concerns risk rating, which we discussed twice before, with the better contribution on the last occasion being made by the Minister rather than by me.  The Bill introduces, as I see it, three verdicts in Irish law &mdash; guilty, not guilty and risk rated.  There is no procedure for appeal and my informal advice is that to do this without an appeal procedure risks a constitutional challenge.  I do not know whether our friend, the Attorney General, has given the Minister advice on that, but this could be seriously damaging to firms that are given risk rating.</P>
        <P>While I have no problem with keeping lists of what people are actually convicted of, this has commercial implications and may have implications for the State if we give a very high risk rating to somebody and it damages his or her ability to carry out business, or give a very low risk rating to somebody who subsequently has an accident.  I do not know why we embarked on this path except that it came under an EU directive.  We should have discussed the issue of whether we can do this to people under our type of Constitution and also what is the point of doing so.</P>
        <P>The people targeted are professional bus operators, who have their relationships with insurance companies to keep them safe.  In addition, they do not want to be prosecuted.  To have a risk rating made by an administrative body about people in commerce is a minefield.  It is not a very accurate actuarial science and the fact one thinks somebody might be involved in an accident does not mean it will happen.  The scientific basis of this measure seems to be open to question.  As I said, I am legally informed that to do it without any appeal procedure risks a constitutional challenge.</P>
        <P>I would not bother with risk rating as I believe it is done in the industry by the insurance companies.  We walked into the commitment due to an EU directive.  If we have to do this, steps should be taken to ensure it does not damage the financial investments of those who have a good safety record and a good bus operating record by assembling such a risk rating about perfectly normal commercial businesses which do not have any offences or convictions against them.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator formally moving the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I put forward the amendment based on my concerns about risk rating in general.  If it must be done, it should be highly confidential and retained within the Road Safety Authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with the official advice before I move on to the meaty stuff.  The advice we have from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General is that the terms &ldquo;data controllers&rdquo; and &ldquo;data processors&rdquo; are not defined and do not appear anywhere else in the Bill.  Therefore, we cannot accept the amendment.  It refers to two sets of people, data controllers and data processors, who are not defined.  There is a difficulty with the term &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; since it is envisaged that information will be shared with licensing authorities in other member states.  That is a difficulty.</P>
        <P>There was a useful debate on risk rating last week.  On foot of the debate I endeavoured to spend some time examining the matter further to reassure myself and the House in respect of some of the issues raised.  I hope I will do so.  The rating system is part of the commercial operator vehicle information system, COVIS.  Access to the system will be confined to authorised personnel from the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  The RSA will be able to share information with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the road transport licensing section of the Department of Transport.  The information can also be exchanged with licensing authorities in other member states on request.  The authority is not required to do so but the information can be shared with other members states.  These are the only people who will have access to the information.  The regulations made will enable those being rated to have sight of the data, which will show how their rating was determined.  It will be based on a range of information.</P>
        <P>During the last debate I suggested that soft information would be used.  In fact, hard information and factual findings will be used.  These findings are in the legislation and they are the result of commercial vehicle roadworthiness, CVR, tests, roadside inspections, convictions, the accuracy of annual declarations and the detention of vehicles.  All of this is in the legislation.  It is not soft information but data on findings, convictions and facts.  These are the factors that build up one&rsquo;s risk rating.  The Minister can add other matters but these are the matters in the legislation.</P>
        <P>Some other issues were raised during the last debate.  The point of this measure is to allow the authorities to focus enforcement on those who have a history of non-compliance.  Rather than carry out random checks on everyone, they will be able to focus their checks and enforcement, which is limited given resource issues, on those who have a history of non-compliance and against whom there are factual findings.</P>
        <P>The risk rating system will not be accessible to the public.  However, the Senator raises a good point which we should bear in mind.  There is nothing preventing consignors, those who wish to avail of the services of transport operators, from seeking the information.  There is a possibility that consignors and potential clients could ask transport operators to make the information available voluntarily.  I imagine those with a low risk rating would be willing to do so and those with a high rating would not.  That is the only potential commercial concern.  The upside is that this will encourage operators and others to maintain a low risk rating under the system, to be compliant and not to have findings against them.  I stated during the last debate that the information cannot be used in court.</P>
        <P>The Senator made an argument about the actuarial accuracy of these things.  It is numerical but it is based on factual findings and not grey area issues or soft information.  Under this system one&rsquo;s status will be classified as red, amber or green, corresponding to representing a very serious risk, a serious risk or a minor risk.  This is not dissimilar to the Senator&rsquo;s proposal last week that people should be categorised on the basis of above average, average and below average.</P>
        <P>The requirement for a risk rating system derives from European law, specifically Article 9 of Directive 2006/22/EC.  This obliges member states to introduce a risk rating system for transport undertakings based on the relative number and severity of tachograph and driver hour infringements that individual undertakings have committed.  We are going a little further by extending risk rating to encompass the results of annual roadworthiness and premises checks.  Some people argue that we are taking a European regulation, gold-plating it and taking it too far.  My view is to the contrary in that this risk rating system makes sense.  It is only based on real findings of fact against the people concerned.  It is confidential and cannot be used in court.  Crucially, it will allow the RSA to focus its enforcement on operators, drivers and vehicles with a history of non-compliance and adverse findings rather than spending a great deal of time and resources doing random checks, especially on operators with a good record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a certain irony in a bankrupt State carrying out risk ratings on those in a private sector who are trying to make a living.  The principle that State agencies can apply risk rating to other sectors without a right of appeal is one I am reluctant to accept.  Are we to risk-rate doctors, economists or engineers next?  It is bizarre.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s distinction between hard and soft information.  Hard information may or may not result in convictions.  The other data appear to be intrusions on the basis of statistical risk which may not have any great validity.</P>
        <P>I am unsure what weightings will be used.  The original proposal was to come up with a number.  Some offences are so serious that they result in a conviction.  Could one accumulate a series of minor penalty points?  Will we use the penalty points system?  How will the information be presented?  What plans does the RSA have in mind?  Since it is such a serious matter, consideration should be given to some appeal mechanism against risk rating.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>These are professional businesses which do not feature prominently in accidents.  They are not boy racers or speeding motorcyclists.  There will be much discussion on those fields in the next round of the road safety strategy.  These are professional and insured drivers.  They carry 99% of the freight and 95% of the passengers, the railway share having declined remarkably in both markets.  The idea that we have almost a secret police assembling files on people who have not committed a crime, on the basis that they might sometime and on the basis that the data are good predictors that they will, causes me unhappiness.  I appreciate the Minister has taken out the soft information.  I appreciate his work on confidentiality.  I appreciate that the data cannot be used in court and assessment is based on real findings of fact.  This brings the debate back to the question of whether these people have a criminal record.  That matter has been tested in the courts.</P>
        <P>I am unhappy with this development.  I would be unhappy were it targeted at the wrong sector.  I would be most unhappy were it to be extended to other areas of Irish life to the point where civil servants assembled risk ratings about people without having to prove anything before an independent panel or court.  The Bill has improved and I have made my points against risk rating in general.  The approach probably comes from continental law rather than common law in this jurisdiction.  I thank the Minister for what he has taken on board.  It is legitimate for Senators to express concerns when these developments take place.  I will not press the amendment.</P>

    <Title>Transport Issues: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We now have statements on transport.  Group spokespersons will have six minutes.  The contribution of one Sinn F&eacute;in Senator will be two minutes.  All other Senators will have one minute for questions, and statements are to conclude by 5 p.m.  I call the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline the contribution that transport is making to the Government&rsquo;s overall objective, which is to secure economic recovery and fiscal sustainability in a way that supports job creation in the economy.  In the transport sector, this involves continued investment, albeit on a reduced scale.  It also involves ensuring that the policies and regulatory frameworks across land, sea and air transport provide the most supportive environment for a competitive economy.</P>
        <P>I will begin by giving an overview of the transport capital programme for 2012 to 2016.  The capital programme in that period amounts to &euro;4.5 billion, and continues to be the biggest of the Government&rsquo;s capital programmes, but the scale is very much less than it would have been if we had not experienced a crisis in the public finances.  Projects that have had to be postponed include road projects such as the Cork-Limerick motorway and large public transport projects for the greater Dublin area such as metro north and metro west.  DART underground had already been postponed by the previous Government under the national recovery plan.  Some of these projects were being developed as public private partnerships, PPPs, but also required very significant commitments from the Exchequer and therefore had to be postponed.  The PPP market also has been very difficult for Ireland as private sources are reluctant to lend for large projects which are dependent on the Exchequer for repayments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was very interested in recent days to hear calls from some political groups and trade unions for an off-balance sheet stimulus plan supported by funding from the European Investment Bank, pension funds and the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF.  I am very sympathetic to this viewpoint and want to see more investment in transport.  However, investor enthusiasm is muted due to a number of concerns on their part, the first of which is about Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the euro and whether long-term contracts concluded in euro will be repaid in euro.  Second, they are concerned about Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to pay investors back over 30 years given our budget deficit and calls for default from some quarters.  There are also concerns about the strength of Ireland&rsquo;s financial institutions.  I deal with the European Investment Bank, meet the National Treasury Management Agency and the NPRF and deal with pension funds and other potential investors and what they say to me is clear.  They want to know that if I sign a contract to invest in a road or rail project whether they will be paid back in euro.  They ask if the Irish people are committed to the euro.  They also look at the contract and say, as with many transport projects, that these are 30 year deals but that we have a big budget deficit of more than 9% of GDP.  They want to know if the Irish people and the Irish Government are committed to staying the course and getting their deficit under control or will they default on people who are investing in their economy.  They want a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer to those questions.  Those are the fundamental questions the country must ask later next month.  That is the reason, in my view, a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum would undermine our aspiration of getting a stimulus plan in place because it will heighten uncertainty about Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the euro and our uncertainty about our willingness to repay creditors.  It is my view, therefore, that any effort to link the need for a stimulus plan to a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote is somewhat off the mark and based on a poor understanding of the reality we face.  Unfortunately, a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote is likely to mean deeper, quicker and more brutal austerity, with no scope for stimulus.  Having said that, I favour a stimulus policy with greater investment in infrastructure funded by the NPRF, the European Investment Bank and private investors.  It is a good idea.  It would create jobs, increase the economic growth and increase competitiveness but making it happen will be very difficult.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the postponed projects, I wish to state clearly that these will all be considered again in advance of the next capital programme which will be drawn up in 2015.  I am conscious that considerable funds have been spent already on advance planning and design and I will be seeking to ensure that as much as possible of this is not wasted.  I should also say that there is a pipeline of shovel-ready, good projects ready to proceed should any additional funding become available.  In considering new projects, the key criteria from now on will be affordability, support for economic recovery and job creation and the potential to add value to existing transport infrastructure.</P>
        <P>With regard to public transport investment, a project which serves as a good example of that is Luas Broombridge or Luas BXD.  That project will link the existing Luas Red and Green lines with a new line that will extend through the city centre to Cabra, Broombridge, thereby improving cross-city access and reducing the reliance on private car usage in the city.  The business case for the Luas BXD is strong and it could create, directly and indirectly, approximately 800 jobs in the construction period.  Subject to the granting of a railway order this year, essential pre-construction works could begin next year, with the main works scheduled to begin in 2015.  Funding will be provided for other key public infrastructure programmes such as bus fleet replacement for public service obligation, PSO, routes, four new rail stations on existing lines, the Marlborough Street public transport bridge, and traffic management programmes including quality bus corridor, QBC, upgrades.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Funding is also being provided for traffic management projects, including QBCs in regional cities and I recently announced a programme of works amounting to &euro;14 million for Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford in 2012.  I will be keeping specific funds for an agreed programme of works in these cities to 2016.  Each year there is also an allocation of approximately &euro;100 million for the railway safety programme.  Given the scale of this commitment, a review of the programme is about to begin.  We must ensure that our railways are safe but it is also important to ensure that we make the most efficient and effective use of scarce resources.</P>
        <P>Some of the most significant recent investment in public transport has not been in physical infrastructure but in technology to enhance the customer&rsquo;s experience and therefore to increase the attractiveness of public transport as a commuting option.  I am very pleased with the initial impact of the Leap card.  Real-time passenger information at bus stops has been a good success in Dublin.  A pilot scheme has been launched in Cork and that will be extended to other cities later in the year.</P>
        <P>As regards roads investment, one might feel we were fortunate to get the major interurban motorways completed when we did.  Though the road network is not so good if one is not on or near the motorway network, some important bypasses have commenced construction.  It is hoped to award a design-build contract for the Ballaghaderreen bypass before the end of 2012.  The National Roads Authority, NRA, continues to seek to complete the contract award of the PPP scheme which provides for the upgrade of Newlands Cross and the section of the N11 between Arklow and Rathnew.  Beyond these schemes, and a few improvement schemes here and there, there are no major new starts planned for the next few years.  These are simply not affordable.  Instead, the emphasis will be to focus available moneys on maintenance, rehabilitation and safety works.  Innovative technology will be used to predict when and where roads will require maintenance, respond to incidents or accidents on our motorway network, provide real-time information to motorists, and identify accident prone locations and deal with them efficiently and cost effectively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to the capital programme to 2016, the Government has also published current expenditure frameworks to 2014, and my Department is required to achieve savings of in or around 5% in each of the three years 2012, 2013 and 2014.  These measures will be implemented and have emerged from the comprehensive expenditure review that was carried out across all Departments.  I am under no illusions about the consequences of some of the choices we have had to make, not just in my Department but across all areas of Government.  After several years of tough budgets, the low-lying fruit has already been picked.  We will get every possible dividend from further efficiencies but the level of savings I will have to deliver next year makes it unavoidable that there will be further reductions in the allocations for public transport subventions and for road maintenance simply because those two items together make up 60% of my entire current budget.  The public transport companies have to find ways of delivering those savings in whatever way is least detrimental to services.  This will be very challenging given the difficult state of the CIE finances.  Similarly, the NRA and the local authorities have to deliver their savings in whatever way is least detrimental to the road network.  I am fully aware that there are no easy answers but similar hard questions present themselves across all areas of Government.  The bottom line is that there is a very strict limit on the total quantum of public spending, and that will continue to be the case until we regain our financial independence and rebuild the economy.</P>
        <P>With regard to bus and rail regulation, my first nine months in office were dominated by the need to put the new fiscal framework in place and to bring clarity to the capital and current funding would be available for each sector.  I have dealt with that in the first part of my statement but my job is not just about money.  Now that funding decisions have been taken, there is time and space to focus on policy issues which are just as important to economic growth, competitiveness and sustainability.  For example, the issue of bus competition and rail regulation will be addressed in the coming year.  The programme for Government recognises the need to rebalance transport policy in favour public transport.  In this context, the Cabinet committee on infrastructure will explore the benefits to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision and specifically the opening up of some public service obligation, PSO, bus services to tender.</P>
        <P>The bus market in Ireland is composed of a variety of markets such as the Dublin market, provincial city and town services, commuter services, rural services and the long distance interurban market.  The latter has had a diverse range of providers for many years now, while the core public service obligation market has been operated on a direct award contract basis by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The current direct award contracts expire at the end of 2014.  In examining the options for more diverse bus provision, the needs of public transport customers will be at the centre of the considerations of Government.  We are committed, notwithstanding the financial challenges we face, to explore how we can provide a better service to the bus user, many of whom do not have alternative means of transport.</P>
        <P>On rail regulation, the main policy change in the coming year arises from the decision not to seek a renewal of Ireland&rsquo;s derogation from some of the more onerous administrative requirements contained in the first railway package.  The derogation will expire on 14 March 2013 and, significantly, will require some restructuring of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  To this end, larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is already carrying out some preparatory work by examining how to minimise the transaction costs of the structural changes necessary and availing of the opportunity of restructuring to encourage greater efficiency and transparency in our rail sector.  These changes will help prepare Ireland for the challenge presented by the future liberalisation of the domestic rail market, proposals for which are expected to be presented by the European Commission towards the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>Persuading people to travel smarter is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s transport policy.  Helping people to make smarter choices about their personal travel habits &mdash; choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport rather than taking the car for every journey &mdash; can be sidelined in the transport debate.  For example, persuading more people to cycle more often is not as straightforward a deliverable as a new stretch of motorway or a fleet of trains.  No one disagrees with the idea that increased walking and cycling or active travel is a good thing.  What we need to accept as a nation is that a move to active travel is fast becoming a necessity.  Active travel is necessary to improve the nation&rsquo;s health, make communities more liveable and reduce our emission outputs and energy use.  A sustained shift to more active travel modes will contribute to our national competitiveness as well as our well-being.  Greater cycling and walking increases the health and fitness levels of the workforce, while a less congested road network improves the movement of goods and people.  Towns which are not blocked with traffic are more attractive places to live and do business.</P>
        <P>My Department has taken a two-pronged approach to promoting active travel, namely, improving cycling and walking infrastructure around the country to make it safer and more attractive to walk and cycle and promoting active travel to persuade people out of their cars.  The National Transport Authority is working in co-operation with my Department to fund a rolling nationwide investment programme for smarter travel infrastructure.  Funds are being made available to local authorities under a range of strategic programmes to develop infrastructure in cities, towns and villages to support sustainable transport, such as cycle tracks, bike lanes and improved pedestrian facilities.  We then need to encourage people to use these facilities.  We do this in many ways, in particular through support of the smarter travel workplaces programme, green schools initiative and promotion of cycling though the annual bike week.  While investment in smarter travel is not a luxury, especially in the times we live in, the availability of investment funding is constrained.  All funding decisions are taken with careful consideration of value for money.  We need to ensure projects are carefully evaluated, both before award of funding and on completion to ensure that they provide a real return, particularly in terms of increased use of active travel modes.</P>
        <P>Since coming to office, aviation is one of the areas in my Department which I have prioritised as it is an engine for economic growth.  My policy focus is on building safe and competitive links between Ireland and its business and tourism destinations.  While this drives a myriad of initiatives, I will focus today on airports which are of particular importance as gateways into and out of the country.  At the top of my list is reviewing the separation of the State airports.  I have made no secret of my belief that the current halfway house arrangement, which has been in place since 2004, whereby Cork and Shannon airports have separate boards but have limited autonomy from the Dublin Airport Authority, cannot continue indefinitely.  Nor can the position continue whereby losses at Cork and Shannon airports are absorbed by the DAA group.  It is time to make firm decisions on the future of Cork and Shannon airports.</P>
        <P>As a first step in this process, I consulted the Dublin, Cork and Shannon airport authorities on separation and their unanimous view is that there is no support for separation as originally envisaged under the State Airports Act 2004, either now or in the immediate future.  Taking account of these responses and following a public procurement process, I commissioned Booz and Company to identify and analyse all likely options regarding the ownership and operation of Cork and Shannon airports and make clear recommendations as to the optimal ownership and operational structures for the airports.  The consultants, who are experts in aviation matters with international experience, were asked to consult as widely as possible with stakeholders in Cork and Shannon airports on sustainable options for the two airports.  They reported back to me last December.  Their report analyses the viability and sustainability of Cork and Shannon airports and on that basis makes two recommended approaches with regard to their future.  It is clear from the report that significant changes in strategic direction are required, particularly in the case of Shannon Airport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since receiving the report my Department has been involved in detailed engagement with all relevant stakeholders on the issues involved.  That process has been concluded and I will shortly bring proposals to Government on future policy regarding the separation of the State airports.  These will centre on the potential of providing an independent structure for Shannon Airport in conjunction with elements of Shannon Development.  Such a structure could be better placed to maximise the benefits for the region and country as a whole.  In particular, it could provide the foundation for an exciting and valuable aero-industrial development in the region.  While I do not underestimate the difficulties in working through the details, I am convinced it is a unique opportunity that must be seized.  Any decision taken will be mindful of the key objective of aviation policy, which is to ensure that the aviation sector supports Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social goals in a safe, competitive, cost-effective and sustainable manner and to ensure maximum connectivity with the rest of the world. This is of particular importance to tourism which, while outside the scope of today&rsquo;s debate, is an important part of my brief and a key driver of job creation and economic recovery across the country. </P>
        
        <P>On the regional airports, with the agreement of Government I have set very clear policy on future Exchequer support for these airports with allocations decided for the coming years.  The number of airports being supported has been reduced for a number of reasons, not least because we no longer have the money.  I have also made clear to the remaining four regional airports that are in receipt of Exchequer support that they need to work towards achieving viability as Government funding is on a downward trajectory.</P>
        <P>I am keenly aware of the importance of our ports as vital facilitators of trade and commerce.  They are critical to our economic recovery.  Recent years have been difficult for the ports, particularly the smaller ones.  However, the sector returned to modest growth in 2010 and year end figures for 2011 should indicate further stabilisation.  As with all transport infrastructure, the development of port capacity requires a long-term perspective.  In that regard, I am heartened by the responsible approach taken by the major ports in planning for their future development.  I recently launched Dublin Port Company&rsquo;s master plan, which sets out the vision for the port over the next 30 years.  The Port of Cork published a similar strategic plan in 2010 and a master planning exercise is under way in Shannon Foynes Port.  This type of long-term planning is in line with international best practice and can only aid the development of a more integrated approach to transport planning generally.</P>
        <P>At a policy level, my advisory officials and I are working on a revised ports policy statement, which I hope to publish later this year.  The ports sector is highly diverse and it is clear our commercial ports face differing challenges and opportunities.  My intention is that the revised policy statement will provide a clear framework within which all of our ports can develop in the manner that most suits their particular circumstances.</P>
        <P>The haulage industry is also vital to the efficient functioning of the economy.  I am aware it is hurting in the current economic climate, particularly with the collapse in demand from the construction sector and sharp increases in fuel prices.  For obvious reasons, the Government has little scope at present to reduce taxes or duties, as the industry has sought.  Similarly, the open internal market for the haulage sector means keen competition is a fact of life.  However, there are supports we can give, for example, supporting competitiveness by enforcing the law against illegal or non-compliant operators, rationalising speed limits, as I have done in recent weeks, disavowing new tolls and allowing heavier vehicles to use our roads, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>In the time available I have been able to give only a short overview of what is a wide-ranging sector that is facing significant challenges but also significant opportunities.  While the resources available to me are greatly reduced from the levels of recent years, I am determined they will be used to maximum effect to support economic recovery and job creation.  I thank Senators again for giving me the opportunity to set out the Government&rsquo;s plans in the transport sector and I look forward to hearing their contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister back to the House.  He deserves a gold medal for best ministerial visitor to the Seanad during the first year of the Government&rsquo;s term.  As the House has had a number of Bills and debates on transport, I do not propose to go over all the ground.  I will focus instead on one or two of the points raised by the Minister in his welcome contribution.  I wholeheartedly endorse his statement on the importance of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to secure infrastructure investment from the private sector. The Minister makes the point very cogently and I would like to see that message getting out. The people on all sides of this House who are in favour of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote have much work to do. That is a key point that should be made. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is very fortunate as he said himself that so much good work was done by the last Government in the area of roads infrastructure.  That is just as well, because the major projects are being shelved.  I also want to endorse our party&rsquo;s full support for the Minister&rsquo;s road safety programme, another stage of which has just finished up.  He will get the full support of every Member of this House for his continued work to reduce road fatalities, in which, thankfully, he is succeeding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s statement ignores the big elephant in the room, which is the continued shocking rise in fuel prices.  Whereas the Minister has to take a macroeconomic approach in his statement to the House, I would like to zone in on the issue on a micro basis.  We are facing a crisis in fuel prices.  Petrol and diesel are probably the greatest single worry facing the public right now, including the ordinary motorist, the businessman and the farmer.  We have seen a rise in both petrol and diesel by 70% since 2009, and there is no sign of any immediate relief.  Prices are as high as &euro;1.69 per litre and &euro;1.65 per litre for petrol and diesel, respectively.  Much of this is clearly outside the control of the Government and outside the control of individual nations, because we are subject to continual fluctuation in oil prices and uncertainty in the geopolitical situation in the Middle East and so on.  That said, Government excise policy is clearly having an upward impact in the ever-increasing cost of fuel.  There have been five separate increases in the tax on petrol and diesel since the budget of October 2008, totalling an accumulated additional cost to the consumer of 22 cent per litre.  The Exchequer is taking in 57.3% of the price of fuel, and this is clearly far too high in an environment of increasing fuel prices.  The Government must adopt a far more flexible attitude on this issue. We should be moving from the annual budget review on excise duties to quarterly reviews. This would be a more immediate hands-on situation whereby we could monitor and cover the needs of the public. I know this goes against EU policy frameworks which have been reaffirmed on a number of occasions, but I call on the Government to be far more proactive and to have this question readdressed in Europe. We are running out of time. </P>
        <P>The Government must adopt a far more flexible attitude on this.  We should be moving from the annual budget review on excise duties to quarterly reviews.  This would be a more immediate hands-on situation whereby we could monitor and cover the needs of the public.  I know this goes against EU policy frameworks which have been reaffirmed on a number of occasions, but I call on the Government to be far more proactive and to have this question readdressed in Europe.  We are running out of time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill on emergency relief for the motorist envisages the Government dropping 4% from the revenue take which, when we take the VAT adjustment into consideration, will effectively mean a drop of 5 cent per litre in the forecourt.  This is not a populist move.  If we wanted to be populist, we would be calling for the price to be dropped by 50 cent.  We are realistic about this and have tried to be constructive in opposition.  I am disappointed at the way the debate has progressed in the D&aacute;il, but that is their business.  The AA calculates that this 5 cent drop would amount to &euro;90 per year to the average motorist.  The plan would be cost neutral, because the additional spending power in the public&rsquo;s pockets would engender additional income revenue for the Government anyway.  This is borne out by the study of the FairFuelUK campaign in Britain, which calculates that a 2.5p reduction in fuel prices in England would save 1,000 jobs.  This has been echoed by Mr. John Whelan, the chief executive officer of the Irish Exporters Association, who stated that a cut in fuel duty of 4% would save &euro;48 million per annum for the export sector, would create 1,800 additional jobs and would add 0.3% to our GDP.  Motorists are contributing a great deal to the general income of the State: &euro;1 billion in VAT, &euro;1 billion in motor tax and &euro;2 billion in excise duties.  The motorist needs a break.  It is the big issue and I ask the Minister to work with his Government colleagues to do something about this urgently.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am a little nervous about where the Minister is going with Shannon Airport, but we await further information.  I believe the issue was raised on the Order of Business by the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, Senator Sheahan.  I would share his concern on that issue.  Where are we in respect of the sell-off of the so-called golden share in Aer Lingus?  My party is not happy with this.  The Minister has stated he does not see Aer Lingus as a key State asset.  I tend to disagree with him.  He also stated the Heathrow slots are not as important as they used to be.  We have 23 of those slots which guarantee flights out of Heathrow to Shannon, Dublin and Cork airports.  I disagree with the Minister in that respect.  They are very important and must be protected.  I would like to hear from the Minister on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is very unlucky.  He has the largest expenditure for capital programmes, at &euro;4.5 billion, but in better times the Minister with responsibility for transport would normally be spending the most money in all the Departments.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposed savings in the Department through greater efficiencies will only help us in future when times get better and this country is back on its feet.  The efficiencies he will have created in his Department will stand to us and one hopes they will work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The beginning of the Minister's speech is very important.  The message should go out to the people of Ireland about our commitment to the euro, and whether long-term contracts concluded in euro will be repaid in euro.  This is very important and the fact unions have called for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming treaty referendum is disgraceful.  They want a stimulus package and as the Minister has pointed out, unless we are committed we will not get one.  This treaty is the one thing that will prove we are committed to the euro.  It is very important the people of this country vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 31 May.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am delighted to welcome the Minister to the Upper House in my capacity as Fine Gael spokesperson on transport.  As Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan stated, I am beginning to think the Minister prefers this House to the D&aacute;il as we have had the pleasure of his company on many occasions since he assumed office.  It is a little over a year since the change of Government, but we have seen a significant number of initiatives in the transport area in that time.  Road safety has been at the core of much legislation, and the falling rate of road fatalities suggests this programme is bearing fruit.  As a Senator from a rural area, I am especially concerned with rural roads and rural transport issues.  We have been unfortunate in bearing the brunt of quite severe weather in recent times.  This week&rsquo;s forecasts predict a biblical deluge.  This harsh weather has had a terrible effect on many country roads and in rural areas there is a great concern that funding will not be there to make vital repairs.  It is important we continue to maintain our rural roads.  Any period of neglect will only mean a greater challenge in the future.  The rural economy and the morale of people in rural areas requires a continued investment in rural roads, irrespective of the economic climate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My other area of concern is rural transport.  This matter has been discussed in this House on a number of occasions.  I was pleased funding for the rural transport programme was maintained at 92% of the 2011 allocation, despite the pressure on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to slash funding in every programme.  What is particularly welcome is that &euro;10 million allocated to rural transport this year is not allocated in an unstructured way.  Under this Government there is a drive to make rural transport more cohesive and to share government funded transport programmes in rural areas in a rational way.  In our general election manifesto, Fine Gael committed to integrating school transport, non-emergency HSE transport and the rural transport programme.  The programme for Government reflects this Fine Gael policy, which states the rural transport network is vital for rural communities as a reliable and sustainable transport service.  We will maintain and extend the rural transport programme with other local transport services as much as is practicable.  I am delighted steps have been taken to implement this policy in the last year.  In particular, I welcome the review of the rural transport programme that has taken place.  The National Transport Authority has assumed a national role for integrated local and rural transport and is taking responsibility for the rural transport programme.  Such an initiative will protect the programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Programmes that are <i>ad hoc</i> and not part of a co-ordinated policy by the Government are more vulnerable to cuts in a time of economic difficulty.  During the years such programmes have been seen as a soft touch and punished because previous Governments failed to locate initiatives within a coherent policy framework.  The Government is different.  It will address the issues of duplication and poor value for money but not in an arbitrary or blunt way.  We will prioritise the core values of a programme and ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent carefully and sensibly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The rural transport programme serves an important purpose.  It ensures those living in rural areas who are unable to run cars are not cut off from their local village or town, a particular problem for elderly people.  For vulnerable older persons, the programme means they can have a prescription filled, buy food and fuel, visit the doctor, call to the post office or simply get out of the house.  I have referred previously to a study by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which reports loneliness is the biggest problem faced by older people. Sadly, in the world in which we live, neighbours do not assume a duty of care for one another, as they might have done in times past. While we must do all we can as a Government to foster a spirit of community, voluntarism and neighbourliness, we must also do all we can within our limited resources to provide a rural transport service that ensures people living in rural areas are not cut off simply because they cannot run a car. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">On the last occasion this issue was discussed in the Seanad I referred to the need for rural transport providers to publicise their services more, as well as to the need for a cultural change.  The rural transport services available are of particular importance to the elderly, but the fact is the services are open to all.  I would be very interested to see statistics for the profile of the typical user.  Last year a CSO survey found that over 50% of people living in rural areas thought there was no transport service available to them.  There is, therefore, a clear need to do more to encourage people of all ages to avail of the services provided.  People living in rural Ireland who drive are very attached to their cars, but, with the increasing success of road safety initiatives, there is a real need for a rural transport service to facilitate those who want to go out to the pub. The local pub is a focal point for small communities; people do not necessarily go there to drink; they go to play a game of cards and see their neighbours. Obviously, because of the changes to the drink driving limits, rural pubs have seen a decline in trade. This is also a factor in rural isolation. There is a role for a rural transport service in this regard. </P>
        
        <P>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned fuel costs.  This is a major burden for haulage companies and those running cars, but with the euro so weak against the dollar and sanctions in place against Iran, such costs have increased.  It is a major problem.</P>
        <P>That is an outline of my concerns about transport issues.  I commend the Minister for his work to date and wish him continued success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and commend him for the extensive update he has given to Members on the work he has done in his portfolio.  I share some of the concerns expressed by Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill.  Unfortunately, he lives in County Kilkenny, but he is close to me in County Tipperary.  We come from similar communities and on occasion we teach them how to play hurling.  His analysis of the need for the road infrastructure in rural Ireland to be kept in a serviceable condition to ensure people can go about their daily business is accurate.  It takes up most of the Minister&rsquo;s budget for road maintenance, whether it be regional or secondary roads.  I ask the Minister to examine the value for money we are getting in this regard.  As someone who served on a local authority for 25 years, I have seen money being blatantly wasted and do not believe we are getting the best possible value for money in the work we do and the methods we use, particularly in seeking to protect rural roads.  We literally tend to put a coat of paint on them when more money is needed.  Allocating it would prove better value in the long term.</P>
        <P>We have an excellent national road network.  When I leave my home to come here, I travel for approximately 20 minutes on rural roads.  For the rest of the journey I am on the Waterford to Dublin motorway which is absolutely fantastic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is very welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator took the words out of my mouth.  I recognise the work done by the previous Government when times were good and money was available.  In this instance, it was spent properly on the national road network, although we must maintain it.  We are a little way along the road &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; in this regard, which must be recognised.</P>
        <P>Safety is paramount.  The provision of real time signage on the M50, for example, allows people who have an appointment to keep to judge the time they need to spend on the road and slow down.  As Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill said, we have the fifth best road safety record in the European Union, an excellent position, although obviously we want to be first.  This is to be commended and a result of such an initiative which does not cost a lot but which is of practical assistance in letting people know the time they need to allow, be it five or 20 minutes, depending on the volume of traffic, to get from A to B.</P>
        <P>I will be parochial.  There is in the middle of my town a railway crossing which closes for up to 20 minutes each time a train passes.  Last week an ambulance was stuck for 15 minutes while travelling to attend to someone who had suffered a heart attack in an estate on the other side.  Issues such as this must be tackled and there is the will to do so and to spend money where it is needed but not to waste it.</P>
        <P>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan, my colleague from County Kerry, referred to Shannon Airport.  I believe in regional policy and governance and the equal promotion of every area.  Shannon Airport is a great resource for the south west and an area extending into north Tipperary.  While I accept the Minister&rsquo;s remarks that entities such as Shannon Airport must be viable, we must be careful about the solution.  I do not share Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s immediate concern about the 25% share in Aer Lingus because I understand it will not be sold in a fire sale.  We will wait until the market is correct and obtain proper value for money for that State asset.  I, therefore, suggest the Senator not get over-excited.</P>
        <P>Money has been well spent on the provision of cycling infrastructure, but there is a challenge; it is not enough to have a bicycle promotion week to get people out of cars and onto bicycles.  It might help, but bike week will not change the attitude of Irish people.  We must put more effort into the matter and come up with other ideas.  They do not need to come directly from the Department but can come from communities.  We must see the infrastructure in place being used by cyclists.</P>
        <P>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill dealt with the issue of rural transport.  I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, has done a lot of work in this regard, but I want to reach the next stage when the lady who does not have transport can get on the school bus in the morning to go into town to do her shopping and then come home in the evening with her children from school, if necessary, or make a medical appointment, instead of having to use three services running through rural areas in getting from A to B.  There is much goodwill in rural Ireland for the development of such a service.  Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill spoke about the social side of transport which is extremely important in rural Ireland.  We can save money and make progress in this way.  I would like to see the matter progressed.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister.  This debate has been enlightening for me as I am not my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on transport.  I am standing in for my colleague, Senator James Heffernan, who has just arrived from a committee meeting.  I welcome the work of the Minister with which I wish him well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister who brings vision, energy and great ability to his portfolio.  I look forward to the House working with him during his term of office.  He mentioned the big projects &mdash; metro north, metro west and DART underground, a project postponed by the previous Government.  There was a phase during the Celtic tiger years when these very expensive projects were promoted by the beneficiaries but not independently evaluated.  We need a mechanism by which they can be independently evaluated and a cost benefit analysis published and left in place for one year in order that we can see if they are of benefit to society as a whole or simply to the promoters.  The Governor of the Central Bank has pointed out that the publication of a cost-benefit analysis by the promoters of a project is a useless exercise, except for public relations purposes.  That is what they came to be used for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recall having a discussion with the Minister&rsquo;s late constituency colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who asked why two tunnels, one rail and one road, were needed in Swords.  The port tunnel afforded very fast public transport access to Swords and he considered it was superfluous to have two.  The DART underground project has always amazed me.  In the departure lounge at Connolly Station the history of the project is charted, with an underground line running from Connolly Station to Heuston Station through Phibsborough, Drumcondra and Cabra.  The Minister for Social Protection is a major proponent of this project, but why build an underground line when there is already an overground line?  Sometimes a railway company is more interested in adding new infrastructure than using existing infrastructure.  The line is there.  Why not give it a try?  Trains could be run from Connolly Station to Heuston Station, linking services to Drogheda and Newbridge.  There is no need for heavy infrastructural investment, for which we will not have the money.  Let us, therefore, make better use of existing infrastructure.</P>
        <P>When Mr. Harry Crosbie ran the Point Depot, he said he got tired of asking the railways to run trains to it.  It was the location of an old railway station.  The same is true of connecting services Navan to Drogheda.  The line is used for freight transport.  Why not run passenger trains on it?</P>
        <P>I appreciate what Senators Denis Landy and Pat O&rsquo;Neill said.  It is time to look at the entire bus fleet.  Goodbody analysed the independent bus fleet in 2003.  It comprised about 80% of the vehicles and about 44% of the receipts, some &euro;307 million.  The independent sector is running school buses with which it can bring people into towns.  Historically, we have been strongly opposed to these transport entrepreneurs being allowed to do anything, but we need their services in which they have invested.  I am impressed by the people who operate buses in Waterford, Tipperary and Kilkenny.  There used be a monopoly, with one bus running each day between Dublin and Galway.  Today there are 45 and the service has developed hugely.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Edinburgh Airport was sold in the past seven days.  We should have competition between the three State airports.  If people wanted to buy them, I would sell them separately.  I would, perhaps, retain one terminal for the Dublin Airport Authority, but I would sell the other.  Toronto Airport operated a regime of competing terminals.  We need to have competition in the sector.  During the debate on competition I said bypassing the Commission for Aviation Regulation to secure a 41% increase in airport charges to pay for Terminal 2 was wrong.  We need more competition.  We need strict assessment of the capital and operating expenditure efficiency of airports.  Before the legislation was changed in 2004 to favour the Dublin Airport Authority, rather than the customer, the results showed there was scope for efficiency improvements at airports.  The experience on the adjoining island is that one can have competing airport systems.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on ports.  In the Culliton report it was recommended that Larne, then the most efficient and competitive port in the country, be used.  It is, however, to the credit of Dublin Port that it emulated what was being done at Larne.</P>
        <P>I share the Minister&rsquo;s doubts about the rail safety programme.  Based on the costings he presented to the House on the previous occasion, it should help to prevent about 40 fatalities, at &euro;2.5 million per fatality.  I seriously wondered about this in the case of the Malahide railway viaduct problem.  I gather the programme was based in Connolly Station when the viaduct fell down.  Happily, owing to the vigilance of drivers, there were no fatalities.  A safety programme that missed that problem should cause concern.</P>
        <P>From surveys my students have conducted, they are not optimistic about the new Leap card which they say conflicts with other smart cards.  I also understand it cost about &euro;55 million to introduce.  I wonder if that was a good use of public money.</P>
        <P>I welcome the vision shown, the greater rigour in the expenditure of public moneys and the looking at different options to solve our transport problems, particularly the investment programme for quality bus corridors, QBCs, to provincial cities.  Can the QBCs in Dublin be used more?  They are valuable unfrastructure, but I sometimes wonder why nothing is happening on the inside lane.  They are used by taxis, but are enough buses using this valuable infrastructure to get us around the city very fast?  The QBC between Chapelizod and Heuston Station enable people to move faster than either the Luas or the DART.  There is a possibility of using QBCs much more intensively than they have up until now.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister.  I like his vision and enthusiasm.  I assure him that he will receive co-operation from this side of the House as he develops the sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak briefly and will not mention the treaty or the referendum.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister tell the House  what progress is being made in the review of the Bus &Eacute;ireann network in the greater Dublin area being undertaken by the National Transport Authority?  The level of service provided is being reviewed.  I have drawn the attention of Bus &Eacute;ireann to the frequency of feeder services to the main commuter corridors, with special recognition being given to the No. 108 Kells to Bailieborough service to the main No. 109 Cavan to Dublin commuter service corridor.  Was the review being undertaken by the network planners initiated with a view to reducing the level of service provided?  The Minister said:</P>
        <P LI="1">In examining the options for more diverse bus provision the needs of public transport customers will be at the centre of the considerations of the Government.  We are committed, notwithstanding the financial challenges we face, to explore how we can provide a better service for bus users, many of whom do not have alternative means of transport.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I raise this issue because it is not long since I was a student and I know what it was like to get the bus to college.  I was fortunate to live on a main commuter route, but I know of the difficulty in having to get a bus to the main commuter route.  Students returning to Dublin on a Sunday evening must rely on the 6.30 p.m. bus service to Kells to connect with the main commuter route service.  If there is a problem with the service to Kells or if the No. 109 bus to Dublin is full, students are faced with a problem in getting back to Dublin.</P>
        <P>Now that we are in uncertain economic times, fewer people have cars or alternative means and the demand for the services is higher.  People cannot even rely on their parents to get lifts to the other towns to chase the bus up the road.  There are longer waiting times in between the two services which can be exacerbated by delays in that respect.  Could the Minister advise of progress being made in the services reviewed by the National Transport Authority?  Does he know when it will report and when any possible changes will take effect?</P>
        <P>On another synecdoche on the taxi industry before I finish, what plans has Minister to legislate on issues relating to the taxi industry?  If there are any, what plans would there be to consult taxi drivers and their representatives about any upcoming legislation?</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister again go the House.  He gave a comprehensive report on his brief in his contribution.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned that ports and airports are vital facilitators for commerce and trade, and, indeed, tourism, and I would fully agree with that remark.  Is there a mechanism in place whereby State-appointed directors on these boards can report back to the Minister on any difficulties that may arise from time to time or that may be coming down the line?  If such a mechanism is not in place, it should be.  The Minister needs to know the problems well in advance rather than have them land on his desk.</P>
        <P>On an area that would be close to my heart, is the Minister aware of any marketing strategy in place with CIE to attract more freight business onto rail and remove many of the HGVs from towns and villages?  There should be much more traffic going by rail rather than road.  Insufficient emphasis is being put on this by CIE.  I do not believe it has ever existed.  Has the position improved since I have gone from the business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much we could talk about today.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan outlined the difficulties motorists and everybody who buys petrol and diesel are experiencing.  It is the elephant in the room.  If it is not tackled, it will lead to inflation in the economy.  I hope the Minister can bring about steps to alleviate the difficulties motorists and everyone purchasing fuel is experiencing because it is the topic being talked about by many motorists.  In the overall context, motorists provide approximately &euro;4 billion to the economy through VAT, excise duties, etc. each year.  That must be taken on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have two issues.  There were two major projects removed from the Department&rsquo;s overall capital programme for roads, the first of which was the road to the north west linking Dublin to Donegal and Derry.  Approximately &euro;435 million was committed by the previous Government under the St. Andrews Agreement for that project.  It is the last motorway project linking any region because there are the major inter-urban routes linking Waterford, Cork, Galway and Sligo.  The north-west one to Donegal was the last one.  I appreciate we are in difficult economic times but when a commitment is given, it should be honoured.  The Minister has gone back to the drawing board and is looking at providing &euro;50 million to be spent in the next few years, but it is far short of the &euro;435 million committed.  It is a project of importance to the north west, a region which will never realise its full potential until that project is delivered.  The Minister might outline what steps can be taken to re-commit to that project.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  He must enjoy that chair.  He certainly fills it well.</P>
        <P>There is much to be welcomed in developments in transport in the past 12 months or so, such as the Luas extension to Citywest and the &euro;379.5 million investment programme for local and regional roads.  I would like to see a little more progress on the rural transport issue.  A start has been made and there are many strands attached to it that need to be worked through, but it is a work in progress.  It is getting there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  I flicked through his address on Shannon Airport, which I was unfortunate to miss, and I will give it further consideration when I get a chance.</P>

He did so and he was a tremendous canvasser during the election.  Those powers of persuasion were certainly found lacking when I got up this morning. I am not the first to mention being clamped, a matter which has arisen previously in this House. This morning, I woke up and decided it would do the right thing and get a parking ticket for my car for two hours, but I was caught short by approximately ten minutes. Given the rain and the conditions, I thought the clampers would hardly be out this morning. When I went down, sure enough, my car was clamped and I had no choice but to pay the &euro;80 and go away with my tail between my legs. That brings me on to the question. Certain recommendations have been taken into account and are being considered with the clamping Bill. When will that legislation come before the House as I might have amendments to make to it? </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on motorway service areas?  I refer specifically about the construction of a motorway service area at the end of a motorway, which, in my view, is bad value for money.  There has been significant discussion here today about bringing value for money to the Exchequer.  I refer to the motorway service area due to be constructed on the N11 on the Gorey bypass.  The bypass ends approximately seven miles away and there is a village approximately three miles beyond the end of the motorway.  It is the height of madness that there is land to be bought, a motorway service area to be constructed and an arrangement to be put in place with the operator about turnover, and yet seven or eight miles down the road there is a village with all of those services available.</P>
        <P>I want to correct Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  There is a stretch of motorway still to be constructed, namely, the M11 all the way down to Rosslare.  Like the project to which he referred, it is not happening at present.  It may happen at some stage.  I would agree wholeheartedly with the construction of this motorway service area if the road were going ahead, but all this will do is take trade from two villages which are only down the road, Camolin and Ferns.  It is money poorly spent.  I am aware of the Minister&rsquo;s view on spending money well and wisely and would like to hear his views on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister again.  Much has been happening in transport in recent years.  I agree with Senator Heffernan about clamping.  It happened to me in Dublin one Saturday at 7.55 a.m. when I thought one could sleep in until 8 a.m.  It is ridiculous that some areas charge 7.55 a.m. on a Saturday.  However, I had to pay it.</P>
        
        <P>The Minister may be aware of an issue that causes confusion for motorists travelling from Belfast to Dublin, namely, the fact that there is an M1 in the North and also in the South.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I have encountered that problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knows what I am talking about.  It is a difficulty that many people have encountered.  On a recent car journey from Belfast to Dublin, I was chatting with my son and before I knew it I was almost at Ballygawley, on the Letterkenny to Dublin road.  Tourists driving from Dublin to Belfast, or even Donegal people like myself who are not used to the roads, may assume they should stay on the Northern M1, on the logical assumption that it will continue on to the M1 into Dublin.  If one does so, however, one ends up in mid-Tyrone.  Perhaps the Minister might discuss with his counterpart in the North whether the two motorways might be designated as the &ldquo;M1A&rdquo; and &ldquo;M1B&rdquo;, for example, or if another way can be found to signal clearly how motorists should proceed to access the  M1 to Dublin.  It is frustrating when one is in a rush to end up back in Tyrone.  On the occasion to which referred I might well have been home to Donegal for my tea and back again by the time I realised my error.  It is an issue I have raised before.  There must be a clearer system for directing people straight to Dublin from Belfast and <i>vice versa</i> in order to eliminate the confusion arising from the coincidence of names for the motorways in either jurisdiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, who is doing a good job and proving himself most accessible to people.  I apologise for missing his opening statement but I was attending a committee meeting.  I welcome his comments in regard to Shannon Airport.  The uncertainty in that regard has gone on for five or six years but at least decisions are finally being made.  The worst that could happen would be for nothing at all to happen.  We would all accept that the airport cannot continue to lose &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million per year.  Confidence in the region is being battered in the absence of a coherent plan for its future.  Now we can at least have confidence that the Government intends to lodge and implement a plan.  I have no doubt that the proposal will not please everybody, but at least there is a plan and some action will be taken.  I have had private discussions with the Minister on this matter and am aware that he intends to travel to the region frequently in the coming months in order to ensure the plan is implemented and that as many as possible of the stakeholders are brought along.</P>

	<P>The western rail corridor was opened to much fanfare by the previous Government, but one might question now whether or not it was the right thing to do, because it seems to be losing a fortune.  We will probably have to spend more money on it in order to make it a success.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s thinking in this regard?  What is the timeframe for the construction of Crusheen railway station?  There must be a plan in place to make the service work rather than having a situation continue where it requires to be subsidised at great cost.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am very conscious of the situation in regard to fuel prices, something which is brought to my attention, by hauliers in particular, all the time.  I am very aware of it in respect of CIE, whose accounts show it is impacting very seriously on the company&rsquo;s costs and its business plan.  I am aware of it myself, not having a State car.  Like everybody else, I look at petrol stations as I drive past and see the numbers going up and up, which is quite frightening.  To clarify, of the 20 cent or so that has been added to the cost of petrol since early December, only 4 or 5 cent is accounted for by Government measures, with most of the increase arising from factors beyond our control.  The reason I did not dwell on this in my speech is that it is a taxation issue and, as such, a matter for the Minister for Finance.  While I am certainly aware of its impact on transport, tourism and aviation, I do not wish to take responsibility for something that is not within my remit or make commitments I cannot deliver.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance and I meet from time to time and this is one of the issues we discussed at our bilateral this morning.  A working group has been established involving the Department of Finance, the haulage industry and others to review the options that might be available, although they are limited in many ways.  Much as I would like to say that reductions in excise would be self-funding, we all know that is not the case.  Fossil fuel prices will always go up and down, but the overall trend is upward.  We must plan for an economy in ten or 15 years time where fuel prices are much higher than they are now, even if no taxes were imposed.  We must also bear in mind that fossil fuels are imported and that money is going out of the country every time one fills one&rsquo;s vehicle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To clarify what I have said before in regard to Aer Lingus, it is not accurate to describe the airline as a State asset.  It is a public limited company in which the Government owns 25% of the shares.  That shareholding is certainly a State asset, but the company itself is not.  Contrary to popular opinion &mdash; it is a myth I have apparently failed to destroy &mdash; the Heathrow Airport slots are not protected by the Government&rsquo;s 25% stake and there is nothing to prevent Aer Lingus from leasing some of those slots to other companies, which it already does.  A sale would require a resolution of the board and 30% of votes are necessary to block any such sale, which the Government does not have.  Other shareholders might take the same view as us in such a scenario, but that is not guaranteed.  The slots at Heathrow Airport remain very important to the State in terms of access, but not as important as they were in the past.  As a frequent air traveller I find myself flying more and more through Schiphol, Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Paris and even Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  Nevertheless, this is not to say that the connections at Heathrow are not extremely important.  They are also very profitable, with airlines making a great deal of money on those routes.  I am not sure Aer Lingus would walk away from the Dublin-London route as quickly as people might assume.  I am very keen to ensure the Cork-Heathrow and Shannon-Heathrow routes are retained.</P>
        <P>On the question of selling the Government stake in Aer Lingus, in the past that was linked, to some extent, to issues relating to the employee share ownership plan and pension fund.  I had hoped these issues could be sorted out, in which case the value of the stake would rise and we would get a better price for it.  Given that the progress in this regard is slow, that matter is now decoupled and we are no longer waiting for a solution before selling the stake.  The sale is being handled by NewERA and it is important to note, as Senator Denis Landy observed earlier, that there will be no fire sale.  The stake will be sold for a good price, at the right time and with the right conditions.  It would be wrong of me to name a price or time because that is not how one proceeds in any sale.</P>
        <P>On rural transport, we have a plan to integrate transport in rural areas.  It is a logical approach which involves pulling together transport services provided by the Health Service Executive, rural transport schemes and school transport services.  It makes great sense on paper, but making it happen is very complicated.  There will be six pilot areas initially and the project is being headed up by the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is also reviewing the issue of rural taxi services.</P>
        <P>In regard to road maintenance, many people have made the point to me about value for money.  It is an issue I will have to examine further.  Now that funding for road maintenance is falling, we must ensure local authorities are getting bang for their buck.  People sometimes see roads being resurfaced and then, six months later, they are in disrepair once again.  However, there is often a reason for this, namely, that the road in question needs to be reconstructed rather than merely resurfaced.  Unfortunately, restoration is very costly and therefore unfeasible in many cases.  Instead, a patch-up resurfacing is done which only lasts for eight or nine months.  It is not the case, therefore, that authorities are wasting money but rather that they do not have sufficient funds to undertake the full restoration that is required.  Many roads were not built properly in the first place.  Members from my part of the city will know that the main road in the Phoenix Park had, until now, to be resurfaced every year.  It was only this year, 250 years after it was built, that it was constructed properly from the bottom up.  I am very grateful to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, for providing the funding for that.  Of course I would never dream of providing funding for it from my own Department.</P>

        <P>Senator Barrett raised the issue of cost benefit analyses and promoter bias.  He is right about that because one must be a little cautious about cost-benefit analyses being put forward by those who are promoting a project.  They, together with their consultants of course always will be a little biased in favour of that project.  While Ministers can be highly sceptical of lobby groups that present them with figures showing this or that is a great project, they are not sceptical enough when their own agencies and companies suggest to them that X or Y is a great project.  On the public transport side, it is useful that the National Transport Authority, NTA, is now in place because it is not a promoter and does not build or run anything itself.  As a result, one can rely on the NTA, which is not a promoter, to assess projects on the public transport side and with regard to some road questions.  The Government also must make better use of the ESRI and other bodies when it comes to cost-benefit analyses.  There have been incidences in the past of Governments ignoring such cost-benefit analyses.  Two occasions when this occurred under the previous Administration were the first phase of the western rail corridor, for which the cost-benefit analysis was highly negative, and the section of the motorway between Carlow and Waterford, for which the cost-benefit analysis also was negative.  People have different views as to whether Ministers made the right call as to whether these projects should have been built at all or could have been built more cheaply.  However, they now are in place and one must make them work, which is a subject to which I will return a little later.</P>
        <P>One of the first things I did as Minister was to take the train from Heuston Station to Connolly Station via the Phoenix Park tunnel and around the way.  It is a very long route, on which it takes almost 25 minutes to get from Heuston to Connolly.  The route goes under the Phoenix Park, around through Cabra and then back around again towards Connolly.  Were one to take a train from Kildare that terminated at Heuston, would one really wish to spend 25 minutes going around that route when one could instead take the Luas, which already links together Connolly and Heuston stations?  In addition, it would be expensive to bring the tunnel up to the requisite standard.  It was a possibility that I had hoped would be a cheap answer to our problems but having travelled on the route and having studied it, I am unconvinced that it can be used for much.</P>
        <P>As for the bypassing of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, in respect of the price cap on aviation and airport charges, that certainly is not something I intend to do.  I have made it clear to both the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and the CAR that they will not get ministerial directions from me to raise airport charges.  I believe they have got the message in that regard.  I must have a good think about terminal competition.  On one level, I consider it to be a great idea but on another level, I can envisage airlines ripping off both terminals and the Government then being asked to intervene and rescue whichever terminal goes bankrupt first.  I believe this to be the nature of the aviation business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Leap card is just starting to operate.  While it cost more than &euro;55 million, that was over ten years.  Only approximately &euro;10 million was spent during the lifetime of the present Government and it is now actually available.  As I understand the Oyster card cost &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million to develop and was launched 17 times, these things never are straightforward.  When Deputy Alan Kelly and I took over control of the transport portfolio, what we did was to tell those concerned to launch it by Christmas or we would get rid of it.  Subsequently, it was launched by Christmas and other features now are being added to it.  For example, student passes will be added to it before September and the Taxsaver scheme will be added before the end of the year.  An important phase of the project, which will happen within the next few months or certainly this year, relates to fare integration.  The Leap card simply is an e-purse and one does not save any money by using the Luas and then the bus or the bus and then the train.  Consequently, discounts will be introduced this year for those who, for example, use both the train and the Luas.  Thereafter, probably next year, something similar will be introduced for buses, thereby putting in place a single price within Dublin.  In a practice called fare capping, one will simply pay a maximum fare no matter how many modes of transport one uses and this will make the Leap card even more attractive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Reilly asked about the Bus &Eacute;ireann route network review.  While it is under way, I do not know when it will be completed or when it will be published.  However, provisionally it shows some inefficiencies on the current routes that may need to be straightened out.  As for taxi regulation, there will be legislation in this regard and it is on list C of the legislative programme.  While I would like to have it in place this year, I cannot promise that because of the manner in which legislation is prioritised.  Financial legislation gets first priority and the IMF legislation gets second priority.  Anything that involves a court case or a European regulation gets third priority and everything else comes fourth, which is the reason legislation frequently is delayed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cummins asked about State-appointed directors reporting directly to me.  The normal process is the chairman reports to me, which is the best way to do it.  There are approximately 30 State agencies or companies within my remit and while having 30 people report to me is doable, having 300 so do is not.  The normal process is such entities report to me through their chairs and this is done on a regular basis.  The Department and I meet most of the companies and agencies two or three times a year and they also report to me in writing.  On occasions, directors who believe that something is extremely serious and has not been dealt with by the board or who are not confident the chair has dealt with a matter properly approach me directly.  When this happens, I obviously pay attention to what they have to say.  However, when such directors approach me, this very often turns out not to be the case and they have ulterior motives.  Consequently, the process is to go through the chair.  If someone wishes to report to me directly, it really must be for a very good reason such as having lost confidence in the chair or the chief executive officer for some reason and effectively acting as a whistleblower.</P>
        <P>Rail freight used to be extremely unprofitable and was largely abandoned by Irish Rail.  The latter has taken it up again and it now is highly profitable and many external operators are working on that front.  Although more can be done to expand rail freight somewhat and market it somewhat better, the capacity for this mode of transport is limited.  It works well for bulk cargoes such as lumber and materials from mines and so on, that is, products that are not obliged to get anywhere quickly and are bulky.  It does not work for many other items because one should bear in mind that if one wishes to move something by freight, one usually must get it on a truck first to get to the train station and one often must get a truck to pick it up at the other end.  While some ports are connected to railways and there is scope to grow rail freight, were its share to increase from 2% or 3% to 5% or 6%, more than 90% of goods still would be transported by road and I do not envisage this changing dramatically.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of the A5, the commitment made by the previous Government arose from the St. Andrews Agreement but was not actually in the Agreement.  Unfortunately, like many commitments made at the time, it was unfunded and the money did not appear for it in the national recovery programme, for example.  While the commitment was there, the money was not and it was never intended to come out of the transport budget.  Instead, it was intended to come out of a North-South co-operation budget that also never was available.  That said, contributions have been made to the A5 project.  I believe the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport already has contributed &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million, mostly pertaining to the planning and design of the road.  The authorities in the North are going ahead with two sections, namely, from Derry to Strabane and from Omagh to Ballygawley.  These sections are going ahead and it is expected they will be completed by 2016.  The Government will contribute &pound;25 million in both 2015 and 2016 to those parts of the road, which will improve journey times considerably between Derry, Letterkenny and Dublin.  While some people have doubts about that route, of all the sections thereof the aforementioned parts are those that are most worth doing.  The Government remains committed to completing the other sections, namely, from Letterkenny to Strabane and those segments on our side of the Border.  However, the Government has informed the Northern authorities that while it still is committed to contributing to the cost and taking its share of the cost of building that road, it cannot make commitments beyond 2016 at this point.  Moreover, this is not something that applies to Northern Ireland alone.  It applies to absolutely everyone because the country simply is not in a position to make commitments beyond 2016.  However, the Government will revert to this issue in 2015.  The positive point is the aforementioned two sections will be built and this will make a real difference for the north west sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>As for private clamping, the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht has done a great job on listening to different interest groups and reporting back to me on what such groups believe should be included in the forthcoming legislation.  The latter now has been included in the legislative programme and I hope to introduce legislation on private clamping this year or next year.  However, like everything else, it is in the queue for the legislative programme.  On motorway service areas, I support them as a concept and note customers like them and use them.  They also are important for safety and in particular for parking trucks, coaches and so on overnight.  Moreover, notwithstanding the costs involved they are profitable and the National Roads Authority, NRA, makes money out of the existing service areas.  While I will double-check, I am 99% certain the service area it is intended to build at Gorey is linked to the N11 contract.  In other words, it will not be built unless the Rathnew section of the N11 is completed.  I understand it is linked to this project and this is the basis on which it will be constructed.  I note the location is decided by the NRA and not by me.  I am not qualified to decide where road service stations should be located but I am 99% certain the Gorey service station is part of the contract for the Arklow to Rathnew section and cannot proceed without it.</P>
        <P>Senator Conway stated that the western rail corridor is losing money.  That is certainly the case.  A railway losing money is not unusual; they all lose money.  The western rail corridor is not losing the most money but it is losing a great deal.  Making a railway work is very difficult because the only railways that ever break even are those on which large numbers of people are transported either between big cities or around cities.  I am not aware of a single example from around the world of a railway which connects towns or cities with populations of 50,000, 60,000 or 70,000 and which makes money.  It is very difficult to identify what one could do to turn around matters in respect of the western rail corridor.  We will have to do our best in terms of making people aware of the service and in proceeding with the work on the Oranmore railway station project.  As far as I am aware, construction on the latter is due to commence in June or July.  This project will also have benefits for Galway commuters.  The project atCrusheen is very much linked to the developer and the development arrangements that apply.  However, it is still planned to proceed with the project.</P>
        <P>I have had the same experience as Senator Harte in respect of the M1.  The latter is the road from Dublin to Belfast and is known as the A1 in the North.  The M1 north of the Border is a completely different road and it runs south of Lough Neagh and off into County Tyrone.  The position is extremely confusing and the signage is not good.  I have placed this on the list of matters to raise with the North&rsquo;s Minister for Regional Development, Danny Kennedy, MLA, when next I see him.  I am not sure the authorities in the north will change the names of their roads to satisfy us.  However, they might provide some proper signage.  It is very easy to follow signs for the M1 and then find oneself halfway to Tyrone or Fermanagh.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to the fact that money will be prioritised in the context of road maintenance, rehabilitation and safety.  I am pleased the quality of material being used on road projects is much improved and that road surfaces are much better as a result.  Local authorities are concerned that in the context of funding, 10% is going to be taken off the top.  If &euro;100,000 is allocated in respect of a road project, some 10% will be designated for health and safety purposes.  What efforts are being made to obtain better value for money and to reduce the proportion of funding designated for health and safety purposes?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome what the Minister said in respect of the use by tourists of discounted tickets on the Luas and on buses in Dublin.  I hope huge numbers of tourists will visit Dublin this year but I also hope it will be possible to encourage them to visit the regions in order that the entire country might benefit from their presence.  Will the Minister consider providing discounted bus and rail tickets for tourists?  This would not be difficult to organise.  For example, a person would need only produce his or her airline ticket or ferry pass to prove he or she is a tourist.  Tourists must be encouraged to explore the natural beauty of all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>My final question is parochial in nature.  As the Minister is aware, there is a fine rail service from Galway city to Dublin.  The trains on this service run frequently throughout the day.  There is a small rural station where I live &mdash; Woodlawn &mdash; from which an excellent service runs west into Galway.  However, the service running east is very poor in nature.  I discussed this matter on a previous occasion with the Minister and with the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly.  I urge the Minister to exert pressure on Irish Rail, when next it is reviewing its timetables, to ensure that at least one additional train will stop at Woodlawn at an appropriate time each morning in order that people might travel to Dublin to carry out their business, attend hospital appointments, do some shopping or whatever.  At present, only the 5 a.m. train from Galway stops at Woodlawn.  It is the afternoon before the next train to Dublin stops there.  If possible, Irish Rail should take steps to adjust its timetable in this regard.  I have received positive indications that it is likely to happen but I ask the Minister to continue to exert pressure on Irish Rail to have a second train to Dublin stop at Woodlawn station each morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Mullins for his questions.  I am not sure about the 10% of road funding being designated for health and safety purposes.  Perhaps the Senator might return to me with further details in respect of that matter.  I am not sure from where his information comes.  I would be concerned if 10% of the maintenance budget was being spent on health and safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 10% of road budgets is being spent on health and safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>In what way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>If, as Senator Mullins indicated, &euro;100,000 is allocated in respect of a road project, only &euro;90,000 is spent on it because the other &euro;10,000 goes on health and safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator referring to the costs relating to health and safety?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems excessive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if it is 10% across the board.  I will be obliged to obtain further information on this matter.  We must, of course, be conscious of health and safety concerns.  In the past there were many accidents involving road construction and maintenance.  Perhaps that is the reason for this money being set aside.</P>
        <P>We can certainly give consideration to the issue of discounted tickets for tourists.  However, providing such tickets costs money and the financial position of CIE is fairly precarious.  I am, therefore, seeking to raise revenues rather than offering discounts.</P>
        <P>I have no involvement with timetables.  However, I am aware of the issue to which Senator Mullins refers in respect of the Galway to Dublin line and I have engaged in correspondence in that regard with Irish Rail.  I understand the company would be willing to have a further train stop at Woodlawn but has stated there are technical issues with regard to whether this will be possible.  I will certainly pursue the matter further.  The difficulty with the Galway to Dublin line is that the service is very slow.  For example, it takes approximately three hours to travel from Galway to Dublin and <i>vice versa</i>.  In addition, the service is under-patronised.  Private coaches are killing the service because they can get people to their destinations much more quickly and at lesser expense.  In addition, it is possible to access WiFi on these coaches and they are also probably somewhat more comfortable.  Furthermore, they do not stop in all the towns along the way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motorways are great and I am glad they were built.  However, I am not sure anyone considered what would be their impact on the railways and the regional airports.  The position with regard to the Dublin to Waterford &mdash; I have often sat on my own in a carriage on this service &mdash; and the Dublin to Belfast lines is similar.  I wonder whether those involved gave full consideration to what would be the consequences for the railways and the airports when the motorways were built.  The latter are now the subject of heavy use, particularly by some extremely efficient coach services.  However, the railways are not being used as much and the regional airports are in serious trouble.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to ensure there will be an additional stop in order that extra passengers might use the train.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> requests the Minister for Health in the review of the undergraduate nursing degree to give serious consideration to the proposal that the degree programme should include more training in the area of gerontology, sociology of ageing, dementia and quality of care aspects for older people;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recalls that the review of Nurse Training is due to conclude its findings in September this year and that it will report on (<i>a</i>) the content of undergraduate programmes and (<i>b</i>) the structure of the current degree programmes including the separate points of entry, clinical placement requirements and governance arrangements;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> is mindful that Nursing Home Ireland (NHI) has called for increased incorporation of Gerontology into nursing programmes, eg. specifically the sociology of ageing, quality of care aspects and person centred care;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that there are specific training courses for those who wish to qualify in the area of psychiatric care which said qualification is recognised;</P>
       <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recognises that there are a significant amount of vacancies in private nursing homes for qualified nurses and that there is a poor uptake of these vacancies by newly qualified nurses;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that according to a report published by the All Ireland Gerontological Nurses Association that:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /> the care needs of residents are becoming increasingly complex which means that a skilled workforce is required;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /> the relationship between quality of care in nursing homes and factors such as workforce structure are inextricably linked;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /> most older people in residential settings live with multiple pathologies and the range of medical diagnoses for people currently in residential care is extensive;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recalls that private nursing homes provide care for over 21,000 residents and that there are over 8,000 residential care beds in public nursing homes;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that under the HIQA guidelines, each nursing home is required to have a set number of nurses on call depending on the number of patients in residence in the nursing home;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recalls the recently published Law Reform Commission Report on Professional Home Care and is mindful of the findings that:</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> the majority of people aged over 65 wish to continue living in their own homes for as long as possible;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> the proportion of people living in Ireland that are over 65 has been increasing in recent years and is projected to increase at an even greater rate over the next two decades;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that the 2011 Census indicates that the total number of people in Ireland over the age of 65 is 535,393;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recognises the urgent need to introduce a streamlined training course specifically for elderly care nursing at all levels so that health care graduates can access the care professional labour market without difficulty;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that by taking measures to ensure that there are more suitably qualified carers in Ireland this will reduce the burden of front line services in Hospitals and other primary care units.</P>
        <P LI="1">Calls on the Minister for Health to consider options of:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> that the current general nursing degree programme should include more training in the area of gerontology, sociology of ageing, dementia and quality of care aspects for older people;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> introducing a specific Elderly Care (Gerontological) Nursing Degree Course in third level colleges;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> that clear guidelines on the codes of practice required for care assistants working in nursing homes be established; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> review how care workers can provide the best care possible for elderly people outside of hospitals.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to the House and thank her for setting aside time in her busy schedule for dealing with this motion.</P>
        <P>Thirteen higher education institutes deliver 44 undergraduate degree programmes in partnership with 57 main health care agencies.  This accounts for 1,570 places in nursing and midwifery at pre-registration level.  The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, has placed nursing and midwifery undergraduate programmes at level 8, honours bachelor degree with bachelor of science, BSc, as the academic award.  Five programmes are delivered at undergraduate degree level.  There are degree courses for children&rsquo;s and general nursing with 100 places, general nursing with 860 places, intellectual disability nursing with 180 places, midwifery with 140 places and psychiatric nursing with 290 places.  There is no specific degree course designed for elderly care, however.  According to the 2011 census, there are over 535,393 people aged over 65 years of age.  This will continue to increase and over the next 20 to 25 years this figure will reach over 1 million.  The greatest growth is going to be in the age group over 80 and we now need to start planning to cater for their needs.</P>
        <P>In the motion I have outlined the difficulty that many private nursing homes are having in recruiting qualified nurses.  In August 2011, there were over 500 vacancies in private nursing homes and Nursing Homes Ireland organised a national recruitment seminar to deal with this shortfall.  In a survey carried out, it indicated that 61% of the nursing homes surveyed had one or more nursing vacancies while 71% said they would be in a position to offer nursing employment in the next 12 months.  Those surveyed indicated they would require 1,364 fully qualified nurses over the following 12 months.</P>
        <P>The private nursing home sector caters for over 21,000 residents with a further 8,000 residential care beds in public nursing homes.  This clearly sets out the demands that exist and also the urgent need to review current training practices.  A review group was established by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, in 2011 and it is to report to him on or before September 2012.  Its role is to oversee the review of nursing and midwifery programmes having regard to the objectives of the health reform programme, the future workforce needs of the health system and the need to achieve value for money.  The review is to examine the content of the undergraduate programmes and examine the structure of the current degree programmes, including the separate points of entry, clinical placement requirements and governance arrangements.  It will also analyse the number of student places required to ensure sufficient numbers of nurses and midwife graduates for the new patterns of service delivery in the public health system.</P>
        <P>This review, I hope, will also take into account the needs of the private health care area and, in particular, the requirements of private nursing homes.  It is acknowledged that Irish graduates are recognised as being well qualified and this is evidenced by the number of overseas recruitment agencies which visit Ireland annually.  However, those who are involved in the elderly care area have a strong view that there is insufficient exposure to appropriate person-centred gerontology or older-person-specific environments and limited exposure to private health care environments particularly private and voluntary nursing homes.  It is the view of some people that the co-ordination of clinical placements and the overuse of public placements, predominately in acute settings, does not provide ample opportunity to prepare graduates for employment in primary or community care settings where the focus is on preventive health care, chronic disease management and palliative care.</P>
        <P>General nurse graduates commonly have poor knowledge of the process and elements of medication management to include prescribing, supply, storage, administration, stock control and the disposal of unused or out-of-date medicines.  Again, this is predominately due to the majority of clinical placements being acute or hospital focused.  I have already referred to the demographic changes that will occur.  In addition, the dementia advisory committee report, Creating Excellence in Dementia Care 2012, projects that up to 140,580 people will be living with dementia in Ireland by 2040.  These demographic changes in the population of older people and those living with dementia indicate the general nursing undergraduate programme must be adapted accordingly.  Many of the people who are already working in this area are of the view that general nursing graduates are ill-equipped in accessing and care planning, recognising and responding to symptoms of dementia and communication with patients who have varying degrees of cognitive impairment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having consulted several people who specialise in this area, they have suggested the following changes in the nurse undergraduate programme.  It must incorporate more gerontology, sociology of ageing, quality of care and person-centred care.  It should include a greater emphasis on mental health conditions, particularly neurological conditions such as dementia.  There also needs to be an increased understanding and awareness of the role and function of allied health professionals, such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, etc, to enable rehabilitation needs and potential of residents to be recognised and to continue the delivery of therapies outside of specialist inputs.  Those clinical placements should include experience in gerontological nursing including caring for those with dementia and more private and public nursing homes should be utilised for clinical placement.  The nursing home care sector is highly regulated and therefore it could be argued that the standard of nursing care in these settings is being monitored and approved on a more frequent basis than in acute hospital settings.</P>
        <P>The timing of placements should be carefully examined and, for example, should students have a placement in the care of an older person in their first or second year when they do not have the requisite nursing skills or confidence to engage in the full range of nursing duties?  In some cases this can result in a poor experience and contribute to a negative view of nursing of the elderly.  It is suggested that these placements should not occur until the third or fourth year of the degree programme.  The academic year runs from September to June, thus reducing the time available for placement, so should placement take place during the summer months?  There should be more direct monitoring during the internship placement to make sure that students are gaining the maximum experience and that they are not being used as a resource to reduce labour costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are some of the issues which require careful examination in the review of the undergraduate nursing degree programme.  It is now accepted that we will require over 2,650 additional nurses in the elderly care area in the next ten years.  Now is the time to plan to accommodate the changes that are required in existing training programmes and, if necessary, to develop new programmes of education to accommodate the needs of those involved in the elderly care area.  We will need growth in the numbers in the next few years.  I thank the Minister of State for taking the time with us in dealing with this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second Senator Colm Burke&rsquo;s motion on elderly care qualifications.  I would also like to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for being with us and dedicating the time to take this motion in the Seanad.  It is very important that our third level education system caters for appropriate elderly care qualifications.  There are many other specific nursing courses, including paediatric nursing, psychiatric nursing, midwifery nursing and disability nursing, etc.  Given that people over the age of 65 often require specific care needs it would be very timely to introduce an elderly care nursing course.</P>
        <P>As mentioned by Senator Burke, there are over 500 vacancies in private nursing homes for suitably qualified nurses.  If an elderly care nursing course was introduced it would show potential students that care of the elderly is a viable and rewarding career path and that there are many career opportunities available.  Given that there is enormous pressure on hospitals it would be worthwhile to engage in constructive planning for health care education that would be targeted at elderly care.</P>
        <P>I have examined the review of undergraduate nursing and midwifery degree submission by Nursing Homes Ireland and I have noted some interesting points.  I was struck by the fact that the report indicates &ldquo;it is felt that person-centred assessment and care planning standards are generally poor throughout the nursing programme&rdquo;.  Graduates are ill-equipped to assess psychosocial needs and to incorporate consultation and participation and personal preferences in planning.  Furthermore it was highlighted in the submission that the HSE 2012 service plan cites the need to move services into primary care and, where possible, to treat patients in the community, thereby reducing inappropriate hospital admissions.  We all agree that it is very important to treat people in their own community and homes.</P>
        <P>Nursing Homes Ireland held a specific recruitment seminar focusing on elderly care nursing last August.  The organisation has argued that elderly care nursing is a specialty in its own right, and to be a specialist elderly care nurse requires an advanced set of knowledge skills and expertise particular to meeting the complex health and social care needs of older people.  Nurses who possess these attributes and qualities need to proudly present themselves as care nurses.  The chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, Mr. Tadhg Daly, has stated that &ldquo;we want nurses to be aware that nursing homes are offering challenging and rewarding employment opportunities in their local communities.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>It has been previously mentioned that there are over 500,000 people in Ireland over the age of 65.  This is a significant proportion of our population and it is imperative that we have skilled nurses in our health care workforce that will be able to meet the demands of elderly care in a compassionate and skilful manner.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister of State to the House, as always.  I am glad of the opportunity to make a few points.  With regard to the ordering of business for the House, we had an amendment but I was late in submitting it.  I thought the deadline was 11 a.m. the day before the debate but it is 11 a.m. two days before the debate.  I am sure the Minister of State and the Leader of the House would agree that 24 hours is more than enough time to prepare for an Opposition amendment.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and our side will support their amendment.</P>
        <P>Speaking about equipping staff in a way necessary to deal with rising challenges is important, and my constituency colleague, Senator Comiskey, pointed out very well the statistics on the ageing population of Ireland.  Approximately 11% of people are over 65 years and interestingly, where Senator Comiskey and I come from, 26% of people are over 65 and the number is rising.  I will come back to that issue in a few minutes and particularly how we should consider budgets and plan for the future.</P>
        <P>Nobody would ever doubt the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to schemes such as A Vision for Change and providing for more care in the community in the mental health sector.  I know she is also committed to elderly care, as it must be a priority for us to ensure people can be maintained in their homes for as long as is humanly possible and for all of life if it can be done.  I know that is challenging in the face of budgetary restraints on home care packages, and I am sure we will have many political arguments about cuts in that regard and how best to avoid them.</P>
        <P>I agree with the training context of the Government motion.  It is preferable to have more training but that should be practical rather than driven by content.  That is not to say we should be abusing student nurses and medical staff in the way we have been by using them as cheap labour.  That is wrong and it is unproductive.  If one goes to see a consultant in the mental health sector or across most of the health service, the first person one sees after the GP is probably the most junior of qualified people, such as a registrar.  Perhaps it would be better for people to see the most qualified person initially before working back so somebody who is less qualified or learning a trade can apply the treatment as diagnosed and determined by the most qualified person.  That is drifting slightly from the subject but it is a point we should consider in the training context.  One&rsquo;s training should not consist of being sent to diagnose problems.  Experts should be doing this and teaching junior personnel how to deal with problems.  We must take that on board with nursing in particular.</P>
        <P>As with any profession, nursing has more glamorous aspects, with certain areas being more attractive.  Perhaps gerontology and care of the elderly is not as appealing as other areas.  People may be able to discuss the metrics of the profession but I would assume gerontology is not the most glamorous area.  We may need to do more to incentivise people who are considering a career in medicine to look at this area and make it more attractive for them.  I do not know if this can be achieved through resources, salaries, holidays or other conditions of employment.</P>
        <P>We support the guidelines and codes of practice referred to in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  There is not much to disagree with in that aspect of the motion.  However, it would be remiss of Opposition politicians not to use every opportunity to raise issues of particular concern.  I mean no disrespect to the Minster of State, but throughout society people are questioning where we are going in the health service.  It has a huge budget with a significant pay bill, yet services are being cut across the board.  Some 178,000 are on outpatient waiting lists which is high relative to the numbers on the lists going back to 2004.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned cuts in specific areas which have been applied nationally.  This cannot be done because one size does not fit all in the health service, geographically or across disciplines.  The Minister must take on board needs in different areas.  For example, 26% of the population in the north west are aged over 65 years, yet the funding of services for the elderly in the region is not proportionate.  I will have the opportunity to meet the Minister of State with other Oireachtas colleagues following the debate to discuss an issue in my constituency, the Wisdom Services delivered by Sisters of La Segesse at Cregg House in Sligo since 1955.  At the request of the State, they have provided services for people with profound and severe intellectual disabilities since.  I cannot impress enough on the Minister of State the essential nature of examining cases individually.  One size does not fit all.   The budget for the Sligo-Leitrim-west Cavan area is &euro;43 million, of which &euro;39 million is allocated for disability services.  Historically Cregg House received a large proportion of that allocation.  Unless we are prepared to examine its case on an individual basis, it will not be possible for the Sisters of La Segesse to maintain this service.  I hope this might condition the Minister of State&rsquo;s thoughts for our meeting later.  I thank her for coming to the House and Fine Gael colleagues for tabling the motion, but we will support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I am delighted to contribute to the debate on this important motion and grateful to Senator Colm Burke and his Fine Gael colleagues for giving us the opportunity to do so.  It is a wide ranging motion and I probably have an opinion on every element of it, but I will confine myself to the issue of nurse training.  It is appropriate at this time to recognise the important work the nursing profession carries out quietly, diligently and effectively.  There are few people in the country who have not had reason to be thankful to the profession at some point in their lives and when one speaks to patients, they all say how lucky they were to have received such good care.  However, it has nothing to do with luck.</P>
        <P>Behind this pleasant exterior, nursing is not always a pleasant job.  People are at their most vulnerable in sickness, following an accident and near death.  Even though people always speak about how nice nurses are, there is a professionalism at the heart of nursing that makes Irish trained nurses the most sought after in the world.  I spent 27 years as a mental health nurse and recognise how rewarding and challenging the job can be.  If we are to do nurses one favour today, I ask my colleagues to resist the temptation of referring to nursing as a vocation.  Every time someone uses the word &ldquo;vocation&rdquo; in the context of nursing, every nurse in the country cringes.  The perception of nursing as a vocation has retarded its growth and development as a profession.  It is among the most important professions in the State and it has changed immeasurably since I was trained.  A new graduate scheme has been developed, thanks in the main to a few forward looking nurses who realised that the international direction for nursing was to develop a theory and evidence-based graduate course.</P>
        <P>Armed with this new outlook, nursing has become a self-confident, vibrant and vital part of the decision-making apparatus in the health service.  Today there are nurse prescribers, clinical nurse specialists, advanced nurse practitioners and significant numbers of practising nurses with masters degrees and PhDs.  Many of our nurses have higher competency levels than junior doctors who spend six months on the wards with them.  Many junior doctors are reliant on the knowledge and experience of senior nurses during their six month placements.  To have effected this radical changeover in training pathways for nurses with minimum of fuss or dislocation to services is testament to the capacity of nurses for innovation, adaptation and professionalism.</P>
        <P>The motion calls for a review of training opportunities and the creation of a new specialty of gerontology in nursing.  Currently, there are five main specialties, if midwifery is included.  The others are children, general, mental health and intellectual disability.  The basic pathway in training is diverse and equips newly trained nurses with the full range of skills necessary to practise in a wide variety of settings, which include full competency in the care of our ageing population.  The types of morbidity encountered in caring for older people are not unique to them and the specialty of general nursing is well adapted to care for this cohort.  Allied to this is a wide number of postgraduate specialties which include gerontology, care of the elderly and other associated disciplines.  I am a little concerned that the call for a review of nurse training is being considered in the context of staff shortages in the private nursing home sector.  Perhaps the shortage might be better addressed by examining the reasons highly trained professionals are not taking up these positions such as pay and conditions, professional autonomy, workload, skills mix and employers&rsquo; expectations.</P>
        <P>Every nurse I know favours improvements in nursing education.  Notwithstanding the ministerial review under way, I wonder whether it is appropriate to call for changes to be made to a system that has served and is serving communities, even with a shortage of staff in private nursing homes.  We would be better off examining the issues I have outlined.  I am not sure the industry would call for a change to the training of other health care professionals such as doctors, for example, in response to industry shortages.  Other issues should be examined first.  Last year when services faced a staffing crisis with regard to medics, there was not a single call for changes to training, but all efforts were made, including the introduction of emergency legislation in the House, to facilitate the recruitment of more doctors.</P>
        <P>A great number of measures can be taken to ensure there are sufficient nurses in the State.  Each year more of our newly qualified nurses leave the country.   Therefore, instead of calling for a levelling out in the quality of nurse training, we should look to improve their career pathways by expanding nursing roles to include more clinical nurse specialists, nurse prescribers and advanced nurse practitioners and perhaps remove from nurses some of the duties now not considered to be part of core nursing duties.  The expansion of the skills mix is an important step in achieving this, but I worry sometimes that the role of nurses is becoming more and more absorbed in managerial and non-clinical duties.</P>
        <P>I thank Fine Gael for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue and hope that in the current difficult economic climate we will retain and expand the vital role played by nurses in the health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Colm Burke for tabling the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State, as I always enjoy listening to her when she addresses the House.  </P>
        <P>According to the Department of Health&rsquo;s key trends, 35,993 nurses were employed in the health service in 2011, an increase of 7.8% compared with the figure for 2002.  The OECD Health at a Glance report points to a large complement of nurses in Ireland.  I am surprised that the ratio is 16.5 per 1,000 of population compared to 4.5 in the United Kingdom, 8.3 in the United States and ten generally in the OECD.  Nurses are, therefore, a major element of the health service workforce.</P>
        <P>Senator John Gilroy outlined his experience of working in the sector, which was interesting.  I asked people in our health section what they thought of the motion and they supported it in the context of nursing education.  They say that the work in gerontology should include nurses who tend to people in their homes and also nurses who come from abroad.  The international nurses may not have this qualification but the qualification is seen as eminently desirable.  As stated in Senator Burke&rsquo;s motion, they would like those who would not have had this opportunity to obtain a postgraduate certificate.  It would be useful for those qualified as nurses to have a postgraduate qualification in this area.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware of what is called the red herring argument to the effect that health service budgets do not necessarily have to increase because the population ages.  There is much literature on that issue, disputing the previously commonly held view that as the population got older, the health budget would inexorably increase.  Even taking both sides of the argument, the issues in the motion are important in that we need to ask how we look after old people in the best way possible at a time when resources are constrained.  Recently, I saw a book in the Brookings Institute, <i>Can We Say No?  The Challenge of Rationing Health Care.  </i>It states the cost could take up the entire GDP.  We will not do that, but neither do we want people to be ill unnecessarily.</P>
        <P>In addition to the care the motion implies, we should consider later retirement age.  How many old people do we know who deteriorate rapidly when they are forced to retire?  They want to work as that is where they relate to people socially and form friendships.  Does retirement cause some of the problems?</P>
        <P>When I visit nursing homes, I am caused to worry about institutionalisation and the dehumanising of the people there.  Can we have half-way houses, provide people with more services in their own homes and develop care in the community to enable them keep their independence?  All the studies show they want to be independent and have the visitors Senator Burke&rsquo;s motion implies but not to be placed in an institution.  It is clear from the Milliman report that we tend to institutionalise.  It estimates that VHI keeps people in hospital for 11.6 days for a procedure which they think should be 3.7 days in other countries.  That is expensive, costing approximately &euro;1,000 per night, and is probably bad for the people.  There must be new ways of looking after old people in a way that is based on what they think.  I am aware the Leader has dialogues with people outside the House on what old people want.  They want the care set out in the motion, and many want to retire later and live in their own houses for as long as possible.</P>
        <P>Having put all those issues together, it is a good idea to review what is in nurse education.  There is a view that there are too many places providing qualifications in nursing and that is unnecessarily expensive.  Perhaps some rationalisation is possible.  I look forward to reading the review when it becomes available in September.</P>
        <P>We must remember that Louis le Brocquy, who died today at the age of 95, was painting Bono&rsquo;s portrait just a few years ago.  He remained young at heart for very long.  The red herring school says we do not have to resign ourselves to putting lots of old people into hospitals and leaving them there for many expensive and probably unhappy years for them.  Everything Senator Burke has put before the House is well worth considering.  I thank the Minister of State and look forward to hearing her address later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the motion to the House.  The discourse around older people and care of our elderly citizens is one of the most important in the health care system.  We must recognise their enormous contribution to society and it is the duty of the State, therefore, to ensure public policy reflects the needs of older people and is underpinned by the need to protect the health services required by them and ensure they are second to none.</P>
        <P>The motion calls for some changes that must be considered by the Minister of State in respect of the care and approach to care of the elderly by nursing professionals and care assistants in and outside the institutional context.  The recent Seanad Public Consultation Committee report on the rights of older people found that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Medical advances of the past twenty years have extended life expectancy significantly across all first world countries. That extension brings with it an urgent requirement, not just to plan for the needs of older people, but to recognise that new needs will emerge because people will be living longer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a new need that must be recognised in the gerontology training of nurses.</P>
        <P>When people live longer, they encounter more medical and health problems.  Public policy objectives must ensure older people have fair access to health services and people are adequately trained to provide those services and facilities.  As the nursing profession and care assistants deliver care to elderly people, apart from family members, it is paramount that practices and approaches to this care-giving are analysed and reviewed regularly.  As stated in the motion, the care needs of the elderly are ever-changing as patterns of life expectancy change.  As the life span of older people extends into years not experienced by previous generations, a minority are affected by illness and disabilities associated with ageing that require special care.  That special care needs to be catered for in training.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motion is timely as the health care system is undergoing significant reform with a focus on patient care and patient safety.  This review aims to build on the excellence of the current nursing and midwifery programmes in place.  We acknowledge that and the work being done by the nurses and care-givers who provide the services and deliver health care to meet changing patient needs.</P>
        <P>The review group is due to conclude its deliberations in September this year and make findings on undergraduate programme content and the structure of current degree programmes. The motion is timely in that it can feed into the review process.  Following the submission of the review group findings, the Department and the Higher Education Authority are to lead any changes required in the delivery of nursing and midwifery programmes within the higher education system.</P>
        <P>Nursing Homes Ireland made a submission to the Department in January as part of the review on the nurse training process.  It states there is insufficient exposure of nursing students to appropriate person-centred gerontology and limited exposure to private health care environments, especially private and voluntary nursing homes.</P>
        <P>Gerontology is distinct from geriatrics which is the most universally acknowledged brand in medicine that deals with diagnosis and treatment of disease and problems specific to the aged.  This is different from the scientific study and analysis in gerontology which includes a whole sector of care for older people.  Nursing Homes Ireland has stated that while general nursing graduates have many strengths in terms of academic and clinical knowledge, they are lacking in person care assessment and care planning skills, are ill-equipped to assess psycho-social needs and to include participation and personal preferences in care planning.  Members will, no doubt, have read an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>  last week on care of the elderly.  I am citing Nursing Homes Ireland because it is a body that deals efficiently with care of the elderly.  It believes that not enough time is spent in older person specific environments by undergraduate general nurses and, instead, the internship-practical elements of the degree are overly hospital focused.  This must change.  We are all aware of the benefits of practical training in the field.  The result is nurses who are ill-equipped to provide the required care specific to older people and a lack of newly qualified nursing candidates to fill vacancies in private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>A new kind of care for people with dementia involves a homely environment where staff take the butterfly approach, being colourful, capturing attention and creating moments of attention.  This type of care, as set out in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, is being implemented in some nursing homes in Ireland.  It is an approach that encapsulates gerontology and encompasses the person as a person rather than a sick, elderly person.  The type of care is distinct from the type of care delivered by nurses in a hospital setting and is based on the idea that people with dementia have become primarily emotional beings.</P>
        <P>The nursing syllabus needs to be amended to include more gerontology input dealing with the sociology of ageing, quality of care and person-centred care.  There is potential to establish a course that would specifically cover elderly nursing care similar to the specialised psychiatric and intellectual disabilities courses on the CAO course list.</P>
        <P>To use one example from the UK in regard to gerontological care, in Scotland, the nursing of older people has been perceived as having a lower status and participants reported in that survey that a positive reframing of gerontological nursing was needed.  The same would hold true for Ireland if a survey were conducted here.  A description and underlying principles were developed by nurses and used as a lens to shape best practice statements.  A description enables a person-centred enabling approach to evidence-based gerontological nursing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Sweden a survey was carried out and among its findings were that psychosocial theories of ageing covered different aspects of the ageing process but did not address crucial issues regarding the attitudes and structures of good nursing care.  These theories provide no clear guidance on how to care for older people or how to support them in the ageing process.  However, the analysis showed that the theories contained underlying values that influenced society and staff as regards their views on the ageing process.  Nursing interventions to support ageing will be quite different depending on the theoretical perspectives given at training and taken by nursing homes in general.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the motion.  It is very important that it is incorporated into any further training to be developed for nursing homes.  It should be incorporated into the national strategy for the elderly.  The Minister of State might make a statement on that issue because Older and Bolder, the co-ordinating group for all the agencies for the elderly, is most anxious that the national strategy be progressed.  The spirit of the motion could be incorporated into that strategy.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this important topic.  I will not discuss all the issues listed on the motion because there are many.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">We are concerned about the closure of community hospitals.  There is one in my town of Kenmare.  It might be the last hospital built for a decade and is a new 40-bed hospital.  Given that some 900 beds in community nursing homes are being closed this year alone, 40 beds are a drop in the ocean.  Privatisation appears to be happening.  The Minister of State spoke on radio this week about the fair deal scheme and its problems.</P>
        <P>No system is perfect on the first day it is put in place.  Sometimes things do not work the way they were intended or the way we thought they would and therefore have to be re-examined, not just because of the changed economic climate but because the number of families signing up to the property element of the scheme is not the same as what was planned.  Nonetheless, we are concerned that 1,000 elderly people will lose their home helps.  As we all know, it is much cheaper to keep people in the community in their own homes and proper care packages should be in place.  A cut of 630 beds means an increase in waiting times for the fair deal scheme.  Many people are on a long waiting list which is not as it should be.  People are sitting in hospitals taking up wards in acute care centres.  People are left waiting for operations they badly need.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on privatisation by the back door, which we are concerned about.  I know from her background and beliefs it is not something with which she agrees.  We are closing community hospitals, as we have seen in Abbeyleix and other areas.  If community hospitals are closed it is up to the private sector to look after nursing homes.  HIQA has outrageous standards for nursing home centres.  We need adequate standards but we do not want private nursing homes which are providing excellent services being closed down.  Is privatisation by the back door happening?  When will we have clarification on the fair deal scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The issue of nurses providing care for elderly patients is something which is important to everyone, particularly the patients and their families.  The care being provided across the public hospital sector in this country in community hospitals and regional or general hospitals is second to none.  The care being provided by nurses is excellent.  Very often they go far beyond the call of duty in the delivery of services.  I support any efforts made by way of review or otherwise to provide nursing staff with additional educational advancement to allow them to fulfil their duties in a more appropriate and meaningful manner, if that is possible because of the work they already undertake.  I would not question the quality or quantity of the work they are undertaking.</P>
        <P>On the broader issue of care in the community for people who require it, in private nursing homes or at home, at all times we should try to advance, as far as possible, the life of the person in his or her own home.  That can only be done through packages such as the carer&rsquo;s allowance, home support packages and home helps.  Unfortunately, the funding for some schemes has been greatly reduced.  It is not exclusive to this year; it happened in previous years.  This year home help hours are being reduced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government, irrespective of which party is in government, needs to take stock of the financial decisions it is taking to cut packages to keep people at home.  Housing grants, which allowed people to stay at home longer, have been cut.  The cost to the State of having someone in a public nursing home is at least &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 per week and perhaps more.  The care provided by carers at home who receive the full rate of &euro;200 per week is a no brainer.</P>
        <P>Carers and home help provision should be supported.  Today we met representatives from the Centres for Independent Living.  They are very concerned about the cuts of at least 3% to the PAs and the constant reviews they and Centres for Independent Living are under from the HSE.  They are living in fear.  We met people today who are so disabled they would draw a tear from a stone.  I ask the Minister of State to make sure there are no further cuts imposed on people who are making a genuine effort to continue living in their homes.</P>
        <P>There is an argument about nursing homes.  The Government is progressing with the cuts to 800 to 1,000 nursing home beds under the HSE service plan this year, which is very wrong.  To force people to be unable to continue to live in their homes through cuts to packages which are important to them is very wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Colm Burke and the Fine Gael Senators for tabling the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  She is always very welcome and I look forward to hearing her speak.</P>
        <P>I looked through the syllabus for the BSc degree programme in general nursing in UCD, which is over four years.  In second year there is a module called &ldquo;nursing the older adult and other populations&rdquo; which is studied for a couple of hours a week for one semester.  It is not an exclusive study of the care of the older person but also includes the study of persons with altered mental health, others in the community, children, mothers and babies and adults in the perioperative period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In second or third year the student nurse undertakes a clinical placement for about six weeks in a care of the elderly setting.  Out of a total of four years study in clinical placement, it would seem only a small proportion of time is spent studying the area of gerontology in proportion to the total amount of time spent in nurse education.  We need to examine this.  It is clear from the available statistics that there is a great need for nurses who are qualified in the care of the elderly.  Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative organisation for the private and voluntary nursing homes sector, ran a recruitment event last autumn.  Before the event it stated there were at least 500 nursing vacancies in private and voluntary nursing homes, with some homes finding it very difficult to recruit nurses, particularly newly qualified nurses.</P>
        <P>Why is this happening in these economic times?  A nurse working in a nursing home specialising in care of the elderly will have to deal with patients with a wide range of disabilities and medical conditions, usually without the assistance of a doctor on site.  There will often be only one registered nurse on duty at night, with responsibility for up to 50 patients, assisted by care staff.  Not only this, they are also expected to carry out other duties such as washing dishes or cleaning, apart from their nursing duties.  This is a challenging prospect for an experienced nurse, not to mention someone who has just come out of college with little experience of the discipline.</P>
        <P>In view of the fact the number of people aged over 65 has increased by 7.3% since 2002, there are now over 500,000 people in that age group in Ireland, and almost 30,000 residents of private and public nursing homes.  The demand for nurses and care assistants in care of the elderly is set to increase and there is an urgent need to attract qualified personnel into the discipline.  There is a lack of dedicated undergraduate nurse education in gerontology, compared with paediatrics, intellectual disability, psychiatry and midwifery.  At present, thousands of elderly people are being cared for in nursing homes and community hospitals by nurses who are professional and dedicated, but who are unlikely to have a specific qualification ingerontology.</P>
        <P>We also need to look at why there are so many vacancies for nurses in nursing homes at a time of high unemployment.  Is there adequate remuneration for these nurses?  What are their possibilities for promotion?  Are there opportunities for professional development?  What are the staffing levels and why are the staffing levels in private nursing homes much lower compared with the staffing levels in public hospitals?  With the embargo on recruitment in the public sector, why is the private sector not attracting more nurses?</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to examine closely the review of nurse training due out in September and, in particular, to question the current situation regarding education in the care of the elderly.  We are all agreed we owe it to our senior citizens to ensure they have the best possible care when they need it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It would be remiss of me not to comment on a remark made earlier by Senator MacSharry, who is no longer present, in regard to those with intellectual disabilities.  I am on the record as having stated in the past that fine budgets are handed to intellectual disability groups up and down this country.  Perhaps they should look at managing those more effectively and we might have a better service for those in care and in day services.  We will come to that, however, and the Minister of State has outlined to me that we will have a report on value for money in a couple of months.</P>
        <P>I wish to read an excerpt from &ldquo;The role and contribution of the registered nurse in residential care settings for older people in Ireland: A national study&rdquo;, in which 200 nurses took part, as it is important to put it on the record of the House.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Older people living in residential settings have highly complex care needs.  The high complexity of care need in the population currently living in residential care is a strong theme in all the [...] group discussions [that took place].  The older residents are identified as being mostly 80-100 years old with frailty and &lsquo;a plethora of ageing issues&rsquo; including medical and surgical problems.  Most need help with many aspects of their health and daily living, including care for nutrition, skin integrity, fluids.  A large proportion have &lsquo;little mobility&rsquo;.  Many residents currently have some degree of dementia and-or are unable to communicate.</P>
        <P LI="1">Most older people in residential settings live with multiple pathologies and the range of medical diagnoses for people currently in residential care is extensive.  Those mentioned in the focus groups include: cerebral vascular accident (CVA), all forms of dementia, cancer, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, leg ulcers. . . Friedreich&rsquo;s Ataxia.</P>
        <P LI="2">&lsquo;The complexity of care has been greatly increased as people are living longer.  The type of residents we are getting are the older old.  They are sicker and sicker . . . five medical conditions is not unusual&rsquo;. . .</P>
        <P LI="2">&lsquo;People live after strokes now so get other things, whereas years ago they would have died from the stroke&rsquo;. . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is important to put the current position in context.  I have spoken with the Minister of State in the past and have great confidence in her.  I also compliment Senator Colm Burke for putting forward the motion.  We have a very difficult job, with funds being short.  It is critical we put measures in place to deal with the increased numbers of those in need of a service.  I agree with Senator Burke when he says a care of the elderly module must be part of the training programme for nursing students.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised a good point.  I do not see any reason this area could not be integrated into supporting the home care service for the elderly and we need to consider this.</P>
        <P>We are short of funds.  It is not a matter of firing money at the problem and we have to come up with some other solution in trying to deal with this issue.  I support the motion and ask the Minister of State to consider it and the points I have made.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I add my welcome for the motion. There is a need for vigorous debate about the way we care for the elderly. I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s presence and her attention. I am a gentleman at heart so I will not say what I normally say when Ministers come in and we discuss age-related issues. I have been known to quote the age of some of the Ministers coming in and to inform them that if they were working in the health service, they would have had mandatory retirement. That is to make the point, and I am sure it does not apply in the Minister of State&rsquo;s case. She has a long way to go. </P><P Just="Left">The reality is we need to have a fundamental rethink of how we, as a society, handle the ageing process. It is a given there is a large body of very serious thought about the way we handle birth and that we have to stop abnormalising birth. Although I must admit I have some reservations in some cases with respect to home birth and so on, we have to regard birth as part of the normal life cycle. </P><P Just="Left">Ageing is the same. Everything about ageing is not just medicine, health, decline and decay. There are many other aspects to ageing to which we need to give a focus. That is why I will get in my little dig here, namely, as I have said, we need to have a real and serious look at the antiquated notion of mandatory retirement at the age of 65, or at any age. </P><P Just="Left">We should consider that the laws on mandatory retirement and pension policy were effectively drawn up by Bismarck in 1870, at a time when the average age of death in Germany was about 44 and where the average person who lived to be 65 lived between three and five years longer. We now know that somebody who lives to be 65 in a western country like Ireland will on average live approximately 20 years longer and, of course, will live with better health than would have been the case in those grimmer times. There is not only a social and medical but also an economic imperative for us to look at this notion of mandatory retirement. </P>
        <P>To move on to the specifics of the motion, I welcome and urge implementation of an increased curricular emphasis on gerontology, geriatric medicine and nursing, and care of the elderly.  This is critically important not only in nursing care but also in medical care &mdash; I believe it is fundamental.  My colleagues in their carefully crafted motion have used the precedent of psychiatric nursing, which has followed a somewhat unique model in the sense that at the time one starts one&rsquo;s first day of nursing school, one is either designated to be studying psychiatric nursing, adult nursing or children&rsquo;s nursing, whereas in other areas, such as sub-speciality diplomas or, indeed, in the big area of midwifery, people do general nursing first, get their degree and then go on to a postgraduate qualification.  I believe that is the way gerontological or geriatric nursing should be structured.  It would be a real mistake to separate it off from the first day in college as a separate degree course.  It should be something people do at a more senior, diploma or master&rsquo;s, level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The way to make those courses attractive is to follow what has happened in oncology, namely, to make the possession of that course mandatory to work in the area.  In oncology, strict rules are drawn up about the number of trained oncology nurses that have to be present to give recognised cancer care.  The same should apply in specialised units for the elderly.  It should be mandatory, especially for those in nursing leadership positions, to have postgraduate qualifications. That is how these qualifications attract esteem and how to attract more people to these positions. </P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is a difficulty in recruiting staff to work in this area, but it should be acknowledged that it is a difficult area in which to work compared with other areas of nursing.  A special skills set is required to work in the environment and with people who, as my colleagues have stated, often have complex medical and social needs.  There are other issues of physical and mental decline which make it a challenging working environment.  We must devise ways to encourage people to take up such positions.  More generally, we should consider the negative effects on morale in nursing.  Nurses are forced to do many jobs for which they are overtrained.  It is important that the skilled and professional aspects of nursing are held in esteem.  Part of the esteem building process involves bringing in more people at the level of nursing assistant and care assistant, etc. who, under the guidance of an expert, trained and experienced nurse, can in a competent and compassionate way do much supportive work.  This would free up nurses to undertake the more professionally demanding parts of their job in terms of medication supervision, social interaction and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the motion to the House and call on the Minister of State and her colleagues to consider it carefully.  We must increase the attention we give to the care of the elderly in Ireland in graduate nursing courses.  We should develop specific postgraduate courses in care of the elderly at either diploma or Masters degree level.  However, the Minister of State should think carefully before embarking on a policy of having separate primary degree courses.  I am unsure whether that would be the right way to proceed.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise one lesson learned by doctors who work in specialist areas.  In many cases, regardless of the specialist area involved, the specialist nurse is usually the most competent person to advise and guide a doctor rather than the junior doctors in training.  This is said with no disrespect to the junior doctors in training, as they are there to train.  We should make an investment which would be good not only from the point of view of health care but which would also make great economic sense.  We should expand the grade of advanced nurse practitioner who can perform many of the jobs doctors currently perform and can do so just as well and as competently as they can.</P>
        <P>We hope to hear back from the Minister in the coming weeks on an unrelated issue, that is, the legislation due before the House to amend the smoking Bill to extend the ban on smoking to cars in which children are travelling.  We expect to receive enthusiastic support from the Minister for Health and the relevant Ministers of State on this issue.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &lsquo;&lsquo;hospitals and other primary care units&rsquo;&rsquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that recently published waiting lists show that waiting times for orthapaedic and opthalmology services are among the longest, a fact likely to have significant repercussions for care of older people;</P>

       <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> condemns the Government&rsquo;s cuts to health care funding, amounting to &euro;750 million, announced in the national service plan, which will likely damage the delivery of care services for older people, including cuts to home help hours.</P>
        <P LI="1">Calls on the Minister for Health to consider:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte ar&iacute;s roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, is deas &eacute; a fheice&aacute;il ar ais anseo.  Ba mhaith liom an leas&uacute; at&aacute; againn a thairiscint go hoifigi&uacute;il agus treasl&uacute; leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Burke.  T&aacute; r&uacute;n an-mhaith curtha le ch&eacute;ile aige, t&aacute; s&eacute; an-chuimsitheach agus t&aacute; go leor sonra&iacute; ann, agus t&aacute; ard-mholadh ag dul d&oacute; as an m&eacute;id sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  I commend Senator Colm Burke and his colleagues for putting together the motion which is both good and detailed.  We support all that is included in it, save the end of it.</P>
        <P>I note the expertise Senator John Gilroy brings to the debate.  I imagine he has found his experience useful in some of the other debates held in the House.  It is good to have people with such experience participating in such debates.</P>
        <P>We recognise all that is good in the motion.  However, I prefer the amendment brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  We support much of what is included in the motion, but it is ironic that it has fine aspirations but neglects to recognise the reality of care provision for the elderly.  I have no wish to be negative, but we must recognise the reality.</P>
        <P>The Government has a poor record on care for the elderly.  Such provision has been hit hard by successive Governments.  Much of the time they have abdicated responsibility to private groups and families.  While credit is due to families for the remarkable efforts made by them in caring for elderly relatives, where the State is not providing an adequate level of care standards will suffer.  I agree with the remarks of Seanad&oacute;r Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and other Senators who have recognised the remarkable work done by all those involved in the caring professions, especially nurses.  They do a remarkable amount of work which should recognised by Members on all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>The first obvious example of when Government policy on care for the elderly went awry was in May 2011 with the suspension of the fair deal programme.  This caused considerable concern and worry for many people and their families.  It was a deeply regrettable episode.  While I accept the programme was resumed &mdash; a great relief to many &mdash; it did not augur well for the Government.  In fact, things got worse.  The HSE national service plan for this year states up to 898 community nursing home beds will be closed.  This will probably include a number of beds in a home in my constituency, namely, St. Francis Home, although we are running a strong campaign to try to ensure the decision is reversed.</P>
        <P>We were disappointed recently following a meeting with the powers that be in HSE West.  A delegation from St. Francis Home met the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  The local Oireachtas representatives were also present at the meeting.  We were given a promise by the Minister that the decision would not go ahead without a review being held.  At a recent meeting with HSE personnel we were informed that the decision would go ahead.  We were most disappointed by this.  I urge the Minister of State to approach the Minister to have the matter reassessed, even in the context of the motion.  St. Francis Home is the only community facility available to people living in Galway city.  The Independent councillor Catherine Connolly has done an amount of work in the campaign, as have those involved in St. Francis Home.  This issue affects other places also, including the nursing home in Crooksling, Abbeyleix, St. Felim&rsquo;s in County Cavan and others.</P>
        <P>It is well and good for the Government to refer to codes of practice and the education of nurses.  These are important, but there is only so much they can do to compensate for a wholesale loss of beds in nursing homes.  As Minister is aware, traditionally the sector is chronically underfunded and the Government has done no better than any of its predecessors.  It has been shown that the State, through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, has negotiated unfavourable deals with private providers.  Money has been wasted.</P>
        <P>Things are not much better in hospitals.  Recently published figures show that orthopaedic and ophthalmology waiting lists &mdash; largely for cataract-related procedures &mdash; are among the longest.  These services are most likely to be availed of by the elderly.  Therefore, they are facing some of these long waiting times.</P>
        <P>When the time comes for elderly patients to leave hospital, it is often not possible for them to leave owing to the complete lack of appropriate convalescent, respite and step-down care facilities.  This has added to the problem of the highly inefficient use of acute hospital beds.  The Government&rsquo;s inability to address the issue has meant that so-called bed blockers, through no fault of their own, are unnecessarily occupying hospital beds at the expense of other needy patients.  All the while the waiting lists lengthen and the quality of care disimproves.  Surely, this calls into question the decision to reduce the number of community nursing beds.  The Government&rsquo;s approach has been entirely wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What happens when patients return home?  There is no question but that there is an army of relatives and friends who do a wonderful job in caring for elderly relatives and they are assisted by many committed and caring home workers.  However, the Government is making things even harder at home.  Seanad&oacute;r Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill alluded to this.  The number of home help hours will be cut this year by 500,000 compared with the figure for 2011, further depriving older people of much needed support and care.</P>
        <P>None of this has been helped by the loss of so many staff under the public sector early retirement scheme.  It has also been compounded by the recruitment embargo.  On the idea that more can be done for less &mdash; this is what is being asked of health care workers &mdash; this is simply not possible.  These changes will impact on front-line staff.</P>
        <P>There is much in the motion with which to commend it.  We support the references to gerontological modules and specific courses.  However, they should not amount to another barrier to prevent people from working in such places.  The proper standards should be observed.  We support the setting of standards of care for care assistants and agree with many of the observations made in the first part of the motion.  It would be remiss of me, however, not to note at least that the care for the elderly sector is in less than full health and the Government must take more responsibility for some of that, especially the reduction in the number of workers and the loss of beds and home help hours.  I call on the Minister of State to examine those matters.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator Keane&rsquo;s comments on the public consultation that took place in the Seanad, which was a positive engagement, but I was disappointed with the report published because it did not call on the Minister of State to publish her national positive ageing strategy.  We met the Older and Bolder organisation recently.  Will the Minister of State to give Members a commitment in this debate that the national positive ageing strategy will be published and launched before the end of the year?  It is important.  We do not want to hear it will be launched at some stage.  It should be launched before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill on the cuts in the number of personal assistants, PAs, highlighted by the centres for independent living.  T&aacute;im ag cur chun cinn an leas&uacute; seo mar s&iacute;lim go dtugann s&eacute; l&eacute;argas n&iacute;os cruinne ar staid na banaltrachta f&eacute; l&aacute;thair.

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I will be brief.  When I was in college I took a regulation course.  An area I examined and on which I wrote one of my assignments was nursing home regulation in the United States and Australia.  I found the difference was in the standards used.  A rules-based approach was taken in the US which was clinical, detailed and by the book.  Everything was written down, including temperatures and so on, whereas Australia had a standards-based system.  They took a more broad approach and said there had to be a home-like environment.  The studies done found there were better standards and quality of care in Australia.  That is an area we should examine in terms of the way we train nurses and treat our care workers, not just for the nursing home environment but also when we examine the issue of home care.  That is important, and the motion stresses the importance of home help hours.</P>
        <P>In terms of the care we must provide for the elderly, we are giving them holistic treatment but they are not patients.  They are people.  When I examined the Australian experience I was struck by the fact they said people should have a home-like experience in nursing homes.</P>
        <P>In terms of some of the figures that stand out in the motion, there are 21,000 residents in private nursing homes and 8,000 residential care beds.  That does not include all the elderly people being cared for at home who are fortunate to have family or friends looking after them.  That is reflected in the Law Reform Commission report which states the majority of people over the age of 65 wish to continue living in their homes for as long as possible.</P>
        <P>We have proposed an amendment but we also support aspects of the motion, especially the reference to more training in the areas of gerontology, the sociology of ageing, dementia and quality of care in the nursing degree programme, because it is critical we are not just providing the basics in terms of care.  It can no longer be that kind of exercise.  We must ensure we provide a high quality of care and people enjoy the best quality of life from cradle to grave.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Unlike the previous speaker, I have never written a paper on the comparison of nursing services in different countries and lack the expertise of some of my colleagues on both sides of the House who have direct experience as professionals in the area.  As a politician, however, I have frequently raised health issues, as the Minister of State is aware.  I want to raise specific issues in this debate but I will preface my contribution by making some general remarks.</P>
        <P>I was very moved when I heard my colleague, Senator Barrett, refer to the death of Louis le Brocquy, one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest artists and, I am proud to say, an old friend of mine.  His wife, Anne Madden, who is also an extremely distinguished painter, organised a rota of people to keep him company on this journey towards his end.  One should salute her as being representative of the many carers within families who are prepared to make that extraordinary sacrifice.  I felt I should say that preparatory to whatever else I say in my contribution.</P>
        <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator Crown said about getting older being part of the natural process, and he mentioned home birth.  That is an interesting area, although there are certain problems with it which were examined in legislative terms in the previous session, a job which is not finished yet.  Ageing is a natural process.  I know that.  I am nearly 68 and I have got to the point where I am proud of being old.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator does not look it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I tell people I am nearly 70 because it brings forth wonderful comments such as that I am marvellous for my age, but it is a natural process.</P>
        <P>We often see in nursing homes large rooms with people drooling in front of a loud television set.  What they lack is stimulation and the kind of proper care about which Senator Barrett and Senator Crown spoke.  People quickly regress when they are old if they are not given that kind of treatment.</P>
        <P>One of the most significant points made by Senator Crown was that the inclusion of people with professional expertise in this area should be a requirement because that would heighten the respect.  The motion states the current general nursing degree programme should include more training and so on, but that must be more specific.  We must consult directly with the nursing schools in the universities.  There is one in Trinity College.  It is located in a most wonderful building, one of the three greatest buildings from the Art Deco period, which is the old Gas Company building in D&rsquo;Olier Street.  They do fine work there.  We must take into account also the profession, the hospitals and the academic nursing programmes.  Introducing a gerontological nursing degree course in third level colleges would also be welcome.</P>
        <P>I have sympathy with what was said by my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in.  I do not believe they will put it to a vote because their amendment is close to the motion, and in any case they do not have the numbers.  They will be asked to stand but they will not have the numbers and, therefore, I am sure they will be content to accept that the Minister of State will take into consideration what has been said.</P>
        <P>To be parochial, although the son of an Englishman, I am essentially a midlands person and I raised with the then Senator John Paul Phelan a situation in Bethany House in Carlow.  I advise the Minister of State to be suspicious of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, because places are being closed for the lack of a lick of paint.  I know that, and Bethany House is one of them.  It is very disturbing for elderly people to be moved.</P>
        <P>I am not a natural hospital candidate.  I do it, not off the top of my head but when there is clear, factual evidence.  I raise the question of Valentia hospital.  I was visiting a friend, Bob Joyce, who is with me here today, who has a house in Valentia.  The local people came to see me and asked me to get involved with the hospital there.  I told them I do not get involved in hospital issues because too often they become political footballs and that is not fair.  They asked me to visit the hospital, which I did, and I saw a community in action.  There were 20 people in the hospital, which gave employment.  Each one of those 20 people had a visitor because it was a Sunday, except for two and they were visited by the other people.  The proposal, which would have cost the Exchequer money, was to separate them and locate them a minimum of 70 km away.  They would have lost their own company and the company of their friends and neighbours.  I raise that issue because I will talk at a meeting in Abbeyleix on Sunday about the situation in there which I ask the Minister of State to take carefully under review.  The position in that area is changing.</P>
        <P>As an Independent, I am not taking a party political approach.  County Laois is my home and there is a strong possibility, owing to the demographic shift, that there will be two separate constituencies of Laois and Offaly, respectively.  Even if the Seanad is abolished, I would not have the remotest intention of standing for the D&aacute;il.  The demographics are also interesting because the population of County Laois has increased by 20% to more than 80,000 over the past four or five years, while the number of persons aged over 60 years has increased by 14%.  The community hospital in Abbeyleix is a resource with which people are happy.  When Senator Whelan on the Government side raised this matter a number of weeks ago, a man by the name of Phelan, who is obviously from the same clan as the Senator despite the slightly differently spelling of his surname, was celebrating his 100th birthday.  He was perfectly happy in the hospital, as was another man of 96 years.  If the facility is closed in circumstances in which more rather than fewer beds will be required in the county, the elderly people affected will be dispersed.  Such moves can cause major and sometimes fatal trauma to people.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to return to the Department with the message that while health care staff must be properly and professionally trained, they also need to be employed and deployed in the types of resources that pay community dividends.  The community hospital in Abbeyleix, as is the case with the facility on Valentia Island, is a classic example of such a resource.  I do not say this as someone who wants to spend money all over the place, believes in hospital candidates distorting the political scene or has any political ambitions outside this House.  Should the Seanad be sacrificed to the rather strange ideas of the current leader of the Government, I will not stand for further office.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the matters I raise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The speech I have with me has probably been delivered by at least Senators.  I thank the proposers of the motion and everyone who contributed to the debate.  As with all debates, while all the contributions were worthwhile, some were more worthwhile than others.</P>
        <P>One cannot argue with certain statistics and facts.  We are spending &euro;1.5 million on older people, a term I hate to use because I am not certain what the correct language is.  Home help hours will be reduced from 11.2 million to 10.7 million this year, which is not a dramatic decrease.  An additional 2,500 people will receive home care packages this year.  This is the type of change we are and should be making.</P>
        <P>On the motion, the Department is reviewing how training is delivered to nurses.  I concur with Senator Crown on the need to introduce a recognised master&rsquo;s degree for those who have completed a general nursing degree.  I will make that point when I speak to the Minister.</P>
        <P>We will have to take account of changing demographics, and gerontology must become part and parcel of what we do.  My mother was sick for one week before her death at the age of 84 years.  She was bright and hale and hearty woman who fed us all and did all the usual things.</P>
        <P>I have a different view of later life than many other people.  The figures show that only 4.5% of the older population eventually end up in long-term care.  While it is necessary to have this type of intensive care setting for some people, namely, those who have greater care needs towards the end of their lives, we must also bear in mind that 95% of us will probably die in our own beds.  This is an important statistic.  Someone once said the only people who should be sent to war are politicians and old men because they are constantly looking for war.  By the same token, the only people who should be sent to nursing homes are politicians because they are the only people who continually talk about them.  We have to move away from that type of attitude and thinking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I repeatedly point out, I have responsibility for four areas.  I do not need to discuss the area of women because women always look after themselves.  The other three are mental health, disability and older people.  In the areas of mental health and disability I am charged with removing people from institutions.  The constant cry I hear about older people is that we must place them in institutions.  If I were an older person, I would be depressed by the level of debate on what will happen to people as they age.  We need to send a message that people live long and healthy lives in their communities.  While some people may not be able to live in their homes, we can ensure that they continue to live in their communities. Rather than focusing solely on step-down care, we need to focus on step-up care and assisted, supported housing. </P><P Just="Left">Senator Daly made a remarkable contribution. He chose not to speak to the motion but instead to ask me whether the Government was engaging in privatisation by the back door. I am not certain what was meant by the question. My job is not about providing support for placing people in nursing homes, whether private or public. The Government is reviewing State-owned and operated community nursing homes because we need to give serious thought to whether we can put right the problems in particular units where they are caused by the environment rather than the care provided. That is what we are doing. </P><P Just="Left">If I had a sibling, parent, husband or child in a nursing home or institution, I would thank God every day for the Health Information and Quality Authority because it has set the bar. HIQA also insists that health care providers reach that bar in respect of both care and the environment in which it is provided. We have reached a point where we must examine how we can change things around. People want to live in their communities. I do not know any older person whose aim in life is to eventually end up in a nursing home. That is definitely not my aim in life and we must ensure people have an option of living in the community. </P><P Just="Left">I spoke today to representatives of Genio, an incredible organisation which runs various projects on living with dementia in the community. These involve providing trained personnel who will assist people to live well in their community. I also spoke today to representatives of another group that is involved in the area of acquired brain injury. They told me something that needs to happen and which can happen right across the range, which is to produce a leaflet that gives carers information necessary to recognise the condition and how to deal with it. These are very simple things. It does not always have to be the high-tech stuff, although the Louth County Council development in respect of high-tech and older people is an example we need to visit, a block of apartments for older people that is so high-tech that they know whether a person&rsquo;s sleep pattern has been disturbed. If we can do that while still allowing people the freedom to live within their own communities, that is where we need to be. </P><P Just="Left">When we look at nurse training, surely it needs to be about community rather than institutions. I was listening to some of the contributions about the embargo and people leaving the service and so on. The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, has responsibility for primary care but primary care essentially is about delivering a service in the community, and that is how she sees it. She has managed to get an additional 350 new posts for the community. That is where we need to be investing our resources. We have managed to breach the recruitment embargo in the area of mental health and get 420 new posts for community psychiatric teams. These will include physiotherapists, speech therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists and nurses. If anyone tells me that as we age, we do not have the same care needs as other people within the community, then I do not believe that. When it comes to caring in the community for someone who has a disability, a mental health issue or needs in respect of how they age, they are not that different. Those needs are not that different, nor is the way we deliver that care. Perhaps older people have more sense than to watch us debating these issues, but if they are watching us, we need to send out a far more positive message than we are currently doing. As we age in life, 95% of us will be able to do that either within our communities or homes until the end of our lives. That is the message we need to send. </P><P Just="Left">I thank Members for organising this debate. I never walk away from a situation without having learned something, and I most definitely have learned something today. I will take their concerns back to the Minister. </P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and all those who contributed to this debate.  In moving this motion, I was highlighting a particular area where there has been a difficulty in filling posts.  It is not just about training, which is one of the concerns.  Pay and conditions also explain why some of those posts are not filled.  There are several different issues; it is just not one.  Once we are reviewing the nurse training programme, which has been in place since 2002 which is why it is appropriate to review it, whatever decision is made by the review at the end of September or by the Minister will put in place what will be available over the next ten to 15 years.  It is important there is an open debate on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the Minister of State there must be more emphasis on keeping people at home longer, and putting people into nursing homes should be the last option.  The best example of all is my mother-in-law who has been in a wheelchair for the past four or five years.  She lives on her own and wants to stay that way.  She is fully able to manage and work away on her own, and that is the way she wants it.  There are many more like her who want to continue to live at home.  It is very important we give the support to people who want to do that, but it is also important we have the health care professionals who can provide that backup for those who want to live at home. That is why we need to focus on that area in the training programmes. I know people doing community nursing go through their own training programme which incorporates care of the elderly. That is a very well run and well thought out course and qualification. </P>
        
        <P>We have a growing elderly population.  People are living longer and the average life expectancy in Ireland is above the EU average.  This is very welcome and is evidence of the standard of health care in this country.  People may be critical of certain aspects of the system but we have invested a great deal of money and effort into developing a health care sector.  We now have to ensure we get value for money and improve services, whether they are for people living at home or for people who, unfortunately, cannot any longer and need extra support in nursing homes.  It is important the standard of care they get is of the best possible quality and that we have the people with the necessary qualifications and skills to provide it.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State and all my colleagues for taking part in this debate.  I look forward to the review and the changes when they are decided upon by the Minister.</P>

Of course we want people to stay at home, but there is a reality for those forced into care.

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to the need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to discuss the progress made to date to establish a panel to hear and determine appeals on turf cutting and harvesting rights, the timeframe for its establishment, when it will begin its work and appeals will be heard.  Under the provisions of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000, the carrying out of certain works in national heritage areas, including the extraction of turf, cannot take place without the consent of the Minister.  The Department is in contact with the General Council of the Bar of Ireland and the Law Society of Ireland about establishing a panel to draw upon in hearing and determining appeals in that regard.</P>
        <P>Under section 19 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, people are eligible to appeal the Minister&rsquo;s decision to an independent arbitrator.  I am anxious to establish what progress has been made to date in establishing the panel.  A number of people have approached me about this issue.  They made appeals one year ago, but they have not received any word about when the appeals will be heard because the panel has not yet been established.  Will the Minister report on progress to date with the General Council of the Bar of Ireland and the Law Society of Ireland in establishing a panel and indicate when they will start work on the appeals made?  It is particularly pertinent because there are many impatient people who are anxious to harvest turf.  Given the seasonal nature of turf cutting, it must happen as soon as possible.  They made their appeals over one year ago, but they have not heard anything about them since.  Will the Minister update the House on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I am glad to have the opportunity to bring her up to date on the establishment of the appeals board and the timeline for it.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a particular responsibility to look after its peatland heritage.  Our raised bogs are rare ecosystems and a high proportion of the remaining raised bogs in western Europe are to be found in Ireland.  We also have extensive areas of blanket bog along the western seaboard and on all our uplands which are a defining feature of the Irish landscape.  Further to its obligations under the EU habitats directive, Ireland has designated a total of 53 raised bog special areas of conservation, SACs.  We have also designated 75 raised bogs as natural heritage areas under the Wildlife Acts.  Many of our best blanket bogs are also designated as special areas of conservation or natural heritage areas.</P>
        <P>Raised bogs are particularly sensitive to drainage and turf cutting, which is why we have had to take steps to end cutting on our raised bog SACs.  Blanket bogs are more robust and can withstand extraction where properly managed.  However, they can also be adversely affected by cutting where it is carried out in the wrong place, on a large scale or using inappropriate equipment such as &ldquo;sausage machines&rdquo;.  For these reasons, both the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 require my consent for specified operations or activities within the designated sites, unless otherwise consented to, for example, under planning permission.  The extraction of turf is one such activity requiring consent.  Where I believe an activity might have an adverse effect on the natural habitat of a designated site, I am generally required to refuse consent.  In these cases, the applicant is entitled to appeal the decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of a natural heritage area, the Wildlife (Amendment Act) 2000 requires that I appoint a person &ldquo;who shall be a barrister or solicitor of not less than 7 years standing, for the purpose of determining an appeal...&rdquo;.  In the case of a special area of conservation, the Birds and Natural Habitats Regulations 2011 require that I appoint &ldquo;a person or persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to consider appeals...&rdquo;.  To date, no appeals have been heard relating to a refusal of consent in natural heritage areas or special areas of conservation.  My Department has been in contact with the General Council of the Bar of Ireland and the Law Society of Ireland about establishing a panel to be drawn upon in hearing and determining such appeals.  I expect to be in a position to establish the panel within the next two weeks and any appeals will then be heard at the earliest possible date.  I also intend to add persons with ecological expertise to the panel as soon as possible.  That will be good news for the Senator. There is a commitment on the part of the Department to establish the panel in the next two weeks. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for being late.  I was at a meeting with a charity group and it ran over time a little.  I am glad to see my friend and colleague, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, looking so fit despite holding ministerial office.  He still keeps in shape and is looking fresh and fit.</P>
        <P>The subject of this debate is two primary schools in my constituency, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Gort a Choirce in my village and St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Stranorlar, County Donegal.  Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Gort a Choirce has been the subject of much debate since approximately 2001 when the board of management sought a new school building.  After much campaigning, approval was given in 2006-07 to proceed through the architectural planning stages and design to site acquisition and so forth.  Unfortunately, however, the process of site acquisition ran into problems due to planning issues.  Subsequently, the board of management sent a further recommendation to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, but, unfortunately, that recommendation did not receive favourable consideration and the school is not included in the five year capital programme to 2017.</P>
        <P>The same can be said of St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Stranorlar.  The planning application for a school on a new site is going through the planning process in Donegal County Council.  It is at the further information stage and that information is being gathered and due to be submitted to the council.  I hope the application receives favourable consideration from it.  However, it appears that even if it does receive permission, the project has effectively been dropped from the capital works programme, even though it was approved in the 2011 capital programme.   It is not included in the 2012-16 programme.  The expectation, therefore, is that both schools will be left out until at least 2017.</P>
        <P>I am raising the matter in the hope there will be some clarity.  I appreciate that the Minister is not responsible for the Department of Education and Skills, but I look forward to hearing the response provided by the Department.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, is unavoidably absent and sends his apologies.  On his behalf, I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides an opportunity to clarify the current position on the application for new school buildings for Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Gort a Choirce and St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Stranorlar.</P>
        <P>The Senator may find it helpful if I set out the context within which decisions relating to meeting the accommodation needs of schools must be considered in the coming years.  He will be aware of the demographic challenge we are facing.  Total enrolment is expected to grow by around 70,000 students between now and 2018 &mdash; by over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary level.  Second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.  In view of the need to ensure every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus of capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The five year programme announced recently is focused on meeting these demographic needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For purposes of the five-year plan, new schools building projects, as well as major extensions, have been identified and prioritised on the basis of meeting future demographic needs in areas in which such needs have been identified.  Owing to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of school accommodation to meet demographic requirements, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.</P>
        <P>In the case of scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Ghort a&rsquo; Choirce, the brief for the project is to provide a new school building.  While preliminary work to acquire a greenfield site was undertaken, planning permission has been refused in respect of this proposed site.  Department officials have been in contact with the school authorities in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Department is in the process of acquiring a site for St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Stranorlar.  Acquisition of the site is dependent on a grant of planning permission, an application for which has been submitted to the local authority.  The Department is currently preparing a response to a request for further information from the local authority and has also, concurrently, commenced the tender process for the appointment of a design team.</P>
        <P>However, in the context of the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of additional school accommodation, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression to construction of these school projects at this time.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, I thank the Senator again for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for being late.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, for whom I have enormous respect and regard, to the House.  It is great to see him in the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I tabled this matter down for discussion on the Adjournment because I attended one of these schools, Ennistymon CBS, in the early 1990s.  At that time there was speculation that a community school would be built to facilitate the young people in the parish of Ennistymon and the surrounding areas and to provide the best possible services, facilities and education.  Unfortunately, 20 years have elapsed since I was a pupil there and there are now three schools providing education, support and services to, at a maximum, 500 or 600 students.</P>
        <P>The teaching quality in all three schools is particularly good but the students must go from one school to another to avail of an optimal choice of subjects.  Children are going from one side of the town to another for history and geography classes, <i>vice versa</i> for science and to yet another part of the town for woodwork, mechanical drawing and so forth.  This is in spite of inclement weather and involves the supervision of children crossing roads and so forth.</P>
        <P>It is unacceptable that a community like Ennistymon would have three secondary schools, providing education to such a small number of pupils.  The Minister for Education and Skills has asked for proposals for streamlining services, achieving the best bang for the buck and providing a cost effective education without compromising its quality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Building this school is a no brainer.  Not alone would it provide for the educational needs of the children of the area but it would also achieve economies of scale.  Everything would be under one roof and the best science and computer facilities and good quality teaching could be provided.  I hope the Minister will have some good news in that regard.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who sends his apologies for not being present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and to clarify the current position on the application for major capital funding for a proposed community school in Ennistymon.  As the Senator is aware and as he will have heard in my previous reply to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, the Department of Education and Skills is forecasting an increase of over 25,000 post-primary pupils by the start of the 2018 school year. This will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary level.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of schoolgoing children, the Department must establish new schools, as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified. The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department&rsquo;s budget for the coming years. </P>
        
        
        <P Just="Left">The five-year programme announced in March will provide over 100,000 permanent school places, of which over 80,000 will be new school places. The remainder will be the replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The five-year programme is focused on meeting those demographic needs. In that context, it was not possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">In the case of the three post-primary schools referred to by the Senator, they have agreed to amalgamate to form a new community school.  The amalgamation will proceed when a new school building has been provided.  The project requires a suitable site in order to progress.  The transfer of a property to the Department is at contract stage and being progressed on the Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.  When the site for the proposed school is secured the building project will be considered for progression in the context of the available funding. However, in light of current competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible at this time to give an indicative timeframe for the progression to construction of the project.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. </P>
        
        
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, the current position on the request for funding towards a building project for a proposed community school in Ennistymon.  I am disappointed that the news is not more positive.  At least it brings the Senator up to date on the present position.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is, at least, honest.

At some stage, maybe in the lifetime of the Government, I hope we will see some movement forward. I thank the Minister for his reply. </P>

If there is a sale of State assets, for example, some of that money could be ring-fenced for schools.  There are possibilities if the economy grows.  My advice to the Senator is to ensure that all the technical work is done and that the project is ready, if money becomes available. </P>
        
        <P>I taught in an amalgamated comprehensive school.  Such a school certainly provides more equal opportunities in circumstances such as the Senator described.  An amalgamated school provides a broad curriculum where students have a range and choice of subjects and better opportunities to reach further education and to choose the career of their choice, because they are exposed to such a wide variety of subjects.  The case for Ennistymon is clear in that respect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad.  I followed the Minister&rsquo;s career on the playing pitch.  It was always good to note that Kerry people, generally, supported Tipperary hurling and Tipperary people supported Kerry football.  Long may that continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise the issue of the closure of four Army barracks in Castlebar, Clonmel, Mullingar and Cavan and the commitments  given by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, regarding the provision of services required in those locations by the Reserve Defence Force.  There are approximately 5,200 Reserve personnel.     While their role may not be as great as it once was, as a former member of the FCA in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I know we had a big role to play within the country.  Members of the Reserve were called up because many Army personnel were on Border duty, while others were in the Lebanon.  I was a part-time soldier for a short period in Clonmel Barracks.</P>
        <P>Some 500 Defence Forces personnel have been displaced as a result of the closure of four barracks.  Much as I was saddened by the closure of Clonmel Barracks in my constituency, much work was done by the Department to ensure personnel were relocated and had their expenses paid.  I understand from my colleague, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, who was involved in this issue with me, that premises have been found in Cavan for the Reserve Defence Force.  The outstanding issues concern the availability of premises in Mullingar and Clonmel.  The Minister proceeded with advertisements seeking suitable premises which I understand were found in both places.  Engineering reports were sought on the suitability of handling live ammunition and weapons in these premises and they have been sent to the Department, but I strongly suspect it is a case of it not tidying up in this last piece of work, rather than the Minister not being vigilant in the matter.  The Minister gave strong commitments to Deputy Tom Hayes and me at a meeting in his office with representatives from Clonmel.  He said this was one of the issues that would be dealt with.  I hope he will have good news for me.</P>
        <P>On the broader issue of the Reserve Defence Force, to which I will return at a later stage, we need to examine its whole structure.  Since 2009 only 400 have been recruited.  The numbers have dropped by 2,000 since and currently stand at 5,200.  The Department&rsquo;s policy on the force needs to be examined, but that is for another day.</P>
        <P>The Minister started off well with positive news for Senator Kathryn Reilly, but his performance has dipped a little since.  I hope he can finish on a high point and send me home happy to Tipperary tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an historic connection between County Tipperary and County Kerry &mdash; we both suffer from a superiority complex when it comes to hurling and football that is the envy of everybody.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  Following the Government&rsquo;s decision to further consolidate Defence Forces personnel in fewer locations, four military barracks &mdash; Clonmel, Cavan, Mullingar and Castlebar &mdash; closed on 30 March.  As a result, military personnel who were occupied in performing security and support functions within these installations were released for operational duties, leading to substantial efficiency gains.  In addition, there are direct savings in terms of utilities, maintenance and security duty allowances in the four barracks.</P>
        <P>When the Government took the decision to close a number of military barracks, my colleague, the Minister for Defence, asked his Department to enter into discussions with other Departments, local authorities, State agencies and community groups on the possible purchase of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures.  To this end, officials from the Department of Defence have met officials from the various agencies and relevant local authorities and the discussions are ongoing.  Every effort will be made to dispose of the barracks to maximise the benefits to the local community.</P>
        <P>As a result of the closure of the four barracks, there is a need to provide alternative accommodation for the local Reserve Defence Force units.  In this regard, the Department of Defence placed advertisements in relevant local newspapers seeking tenders for the provision of suitable accommodation.  This is a normal arrangement for reserve units in other locations around the country.  The Department has ten permanent rentals and 30 part-time rentals in place, including the part-time use of parish and community halls, as well as some commercial premises.  The total annual cost for all 40 premises is less than &euro;100,000.  I am sure the House will agree that, based on what I have said, the renting locally of alternative accommodation for Reserve Defence Force units is the most appropriate course of action.  There is no economic argument for keeping a full barracks open to cater for a reserve unit which may only train for a few hours once or twice a week when alternative rented accommodation can be provided for a small fraction of the cost.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of the tenders, the Department and the military authorities undertook an examination of the proposals received.  This process included, among other matters, an assessment of the accommodation offered, particularly its suitability to meet the needs of the local Reserve Defence Force units and compliance with health and safety requirements.  In addition, discussions with the owners of the properties on terms and conditions and what alterations might be required were also undertaken.  As a result, I am pleased to say suitable alternative accommodation has been identified in the various locations, including Clonmel and Mullingar.  The necessary documentation, including tax clearance certificates, has been requested from the owners of the properties.  The Department has been advised that it should be submitted in the next few days.  When it is received, formal lease agreements will be entered into and the local reserve units can take possession of their new training accommodation.</P>
        <P>I think the Senator has received positive news.  I started on a positive note and end on one also.  Perhaps I should come here more often and be the bearer of such good tidings.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister and I am pleased with his reply.  I highlight the fact that all Reserve Defence Force members receive no pay; they do the work on a voluntary basis.  We need these individuals and the work they do helps to build character in young men and women in the Reserve Defence Force.   The Minister has given good news and I will be glad to relay it to those concerned.  I hope, therefore, I will not have to raise the matter again.  The people concerned want to be part of an important voluntary body in the service of the State.  I am glad the process is nearly at an end.  No less than in the 1970s when I watched him playing football for Kerry, the Minister always had a good finish.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for his comments.  I served as Opposition spokesperson on defence for almost three years during which time I learned a lot about the Defence Forces.  Owing to that experience, I grew to respect the important work done by the Defence Forces.  The Reserve Defence Force also has a key role to play.  Economic conditions were somewhat better in 2007 and 2008 when I raised such issues as Defence Forces numbers.  The best training anyone can get is with the Reserve Defence Force as it is character building and there is great emphasis on physical fitness.  It was no coincidence that, when the concept behind Operation Transformation was being developed, the organisers went to the Defence Forces for advice.  There has been a proliferation of boot camps throughout the country which are mainly run by ex-Defence Forces instructors.  The Defence Forces play a very important role.  Luckily for us, their services are not required to the extent they were heretofore, which is welcome.  Nonetheless, they are always required abroad.  I can also see a role for the Reserve Defence Force abroad in certain capacities.  </P>
        <P>As regards the Senator&rsquo;s Adjournment matter, I hope what is being committed to will be provided for in the next few weeks.</P>
