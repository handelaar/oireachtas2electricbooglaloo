	<P>I have received notice from Senator Jim Walsh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to make a statement urging the French Government to accept the ruling of a French court to extradite Claude Muhayimana to Rwanda under an international arrest warrant to face charges for taking part in genocide and crimes against humanity.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to review the Garda superintendent scheme in order to provide justice and fairness for a number of former members, 81 in total, who have been deprived of their preserved retirement benefits owing to the fact that they left or were dismissed from service prior to 1 October 1976.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide additional resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop and fully resource the drugs unit within County Donegal, given the societal challenges of drug abuse and drug pushing in the county.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">An g&aacute; at&aacute; leis an Aire Dl&iacute; agus Cirt agus Comhionannais a thabhairt sonra&iacute; maidir le l&iacute;on na nGarda&iacute; at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; sna st&aacute;isi&uacute;n sna ceantair Ghaeltachta i nGaillimh, Muigh Eo, D&uacute;n na nGall, an Mh&iacute;, Corcaigh, Ciarra&iacute; agus Port L&aacute;irge i gcompar&aacute;id le c&uacute;ig agus deich mbliain &oacute; shoin agus an l&iacute;on acu at&aacute; &aacute;balta a gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh tr&eacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Bill 2012 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 5.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 5.35 p.m.; and No. 21, Private Members&rsquo; business, motion No. 8, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, with the time allocated for this debate not to exceed two hours.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I give advance notice to the House that we will be sitting on Monday, 23 April, at 2.30 p.m. to commence the debate on the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union) Bill 2012.  We will continue with the remaining Stages of the Bill on Tuesday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remind the House that on Tuesday there will be statements on the Mahon tribunal, as we had indicated prior to the adjournment, which will be scheduled from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.  If further time is necessary for the debate on this topic, I will arrange a discussion on the following Tuesday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I give advance notice, prior to the response of the Leader of the Opposition, of a debate I have scheduled with the Minister of State at the Department of Fiance, Deputy Brian Hayes, on the subject of mortgage arrears, which will take place on Tuesday, 15 May.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It has taken the Leader only six months to tell the House the arrangements he has made for a discussion on mortgages.  I was going to raise this issue again.  While I might be boring, I am at least consistent, because what we have seen in the most recent mortgage figures is that close to 10% of all residential mortgages on principal private residences are in arrears for more than 90 days.  I am glad the Minister of State is coming to the House and I hope he tells us clearly what the Government will do and not what it is planning to do.  I hope he will not just set up another committee, because I believe both the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach have a committee which has been working urgently on the mortgage arrears crisis since the publication of the Keane report last September.  I do not think that degree of urgency is acceptable to the vast majority of people.  That follows very clearly from the report of the Irish League of Credit Unions published yesterday which makes stark reading for everybody in this House.  Everybody should be concerned that nearly 60% of people have less than &euro;100 per month of disposable income after they have paid all their bills.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have seen a very substantial decrease in the value of our exports.  I am not blaming the Government specifically for that but the economic policies that have been followed by the Government and the European Union are having a negative effect on any chance we have to grow out of this recession.  It is not working and we need to have a proper debate on this issue on another day.  It is of great concern when one in ten people, probably more like one in seven, struggle to pay their mortgages.  I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s return because he did say the Government would publish a report before the budget last December but that has not happened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  In the past two to three days we have seen the sequel to the horror show that was the household charge, &ldquo;The Nightmare in the Custom House.&rdquo;  We have seen the nightmare in the Custom House II, starring the Minister, on the proposed water charges.  Who is going to pay?  When are they going to pay?  How are they going to pay?  Who will install the water meters?  Is the National Pensions Reserve Fund going to pay for it?  Are we going to have to pay for it over 20 years?  How much will it cost?  How much free water supply are people going to get?  The Government gave mixed messages on the matter.</P>
        <P>It concerns me that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, said a number of weeks ago that he was concerned about referenda and that the referendums would not be about the things that they should be, the fiscal compact and the 30th amendment to the Constitution which I have clearly stated here that my party and I will support.  I am particularly worried that the ongoing confusion emanating from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and other Departments.  I am worried by the fact that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, went on the national airwaves and said that the vast majority of people had paid the household charge, 56% is not a vast majority.  I am also worried by the fact that we cannot even be clear on how water charges will be paid, how they will be metered and who will do what.  The whole matter is an unmitigated disaster.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very worried and concerned that these are the issues that people will vote on when they vote on 31 May.  I understand that the Minister is somewhere in Denmark today.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, has been on the radio and every show in the past 48 hours and I expect him to come to the House.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister of State with responsibility for NewERA at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, come here today to explain to us, as Members, and  the people the exact Government position on water metering and water charges, who will pay, how much they will have to pay and when the charges will be introduced and be effective from.  Time should be set aside today for the Minister of State, to come here to try to clear up all of the confusion that has emanated from the Custom House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien referred to a type of horror film.  Let us not forget that the real nightmare on Kildare Street began for us as a country when his party was in government and brought the country into receivership, lost our economic sovereignty and brought us into the IMF-EU programme in late 2010.  That was when the real nightmare on Kildare Street took place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the decision made at yesterday&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting on water metering and the establishment of Irish Water, an independent State-owned subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann group.  It is clear.  It is a big initiative and an important one.  It will be the biggest State company formed in a long time.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is likely that Irish Water will rival the ESB.  It will be important for us as a nation to ensure that we protect a scarce resource, protect and conserve our water supply and do so in a sustainable way.   That has patently not been done until now.  It is a disgrace how much water we have lost and the poor standard of water infrastructure.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate in the House on how best to pass legislation to protect scarce resources and ensure conservation.  There is a general acceptance among the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A question for the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On a rainy day in Dublin perhaps it may seem odd but water is a very scarce resource internationally, as the Senator is well aware.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it scarce?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, Irish citizens are well aware of the need to ensure conservation and that a fair charging system will play a large part in ensuring the conservation of a scarce supply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme for the coming session that was published yesterday.  It is an ambitious programme.  Quite a number of Bills are due to be published in the coming session and I hope that we will see a large number of them introduced here in the Seanad.  I know that the Leader will support my call.  I also welcome him giving us advance notice of the busy schedule for next week and future debates.  It is important to all of us when we order our time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the courtesy and the advance notice the Leader gives us when planning debates.  It means we can plan our debates better and be more informed.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to the important debate we are having this evening on criminalising the purchase of sex.  We expected the Minister to come back within the past six months on a commitment for the public consultation process.  He has done so and I ask the Leader for a commitment on the date for the end of the consultation process and for the Minister to come back to discuss the next steps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the establishment of Irish Water.  Senator Bacik is correct to raise the issue of the scarcity of water.  We are facing a difficult international future with the possibility of water wars and conflicts over it.  We should appreciate what we have in Ireland.  It is terrible to think that 40% of water here is lost through waste and I hope we are facing a more organised future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to an issue arising in the other House this evening, which prompts a call from me for a debate on a sensitive issue.  For the first time, legislation is being introduced in the other House to legalise abortion.  That is sad.  The legislation has many flaws, not least that it provides for abortion without time limits, disregards the consent of women in certain situations and imprisons conscientious objectors.  It is also based on a false premise, an outdated notion that there are psychiatric grounds for abortion, as was canvassed in the X case, in which no psychiatric evidence was heard.  The question is no longer whether abortion is ever necessary for mental health reasons; the question experts are considering is in what circumstances abortion poses a mental health risk for some women.  I hope the new information will be heard and this ideological Bill will be rejected.  From talking to friends and colleagues in the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, there is a diversity of opinion on these issues.  I hope we will not get a blanket ideological &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to this flawed and destructive proposed legislation.</P>
        <P>The way in which debates get manipulated is disturbing.  A sad situation involves women who would have preferred to abort children they were told could not survive long after birth but who gave birth to them.  Those women need to be heard and I am concerned about the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, in particular, bringing them in when that issue cannot be dealt with without a referendum.  There is also a very strong claim of a disabled child to be entitled to have the dignity of a natural end.  Women who chose to give life in those circumstances believe it is the best and most healing thing possible.  I do not know why the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland is seeking to push the debate at the same time as it attacked an organisation called Women Hurt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is the Senator seeking a debate on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;of women who wanted to tell their stories about how they had regretted their abortions.  Yes, I am seeking a debate.  How can the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland claim to represent all the women of Ireland if it is pursuing this ideological approach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>These are points that can be made during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>How can it claim State funding and be entitled to it when it pushes such an ideological line?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>These are women&rsquo;s stories, not an ideological line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important not to wait for the recommendations or options to be set by the expert group.  Members of Parliament should take their responsibilities seriously and consider these life and death issues and have a respectful debate where we communicate sincere concerns and ideas about this issue.  We should have the debate soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe there will be an inquiry into the night of horrors &mdash; the night of the bank guarantee.  A proper inquiry into the circumstances surrounding that night is welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Any time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Over 50% of water in this country is wasted.  Water is a scarce resource and children in this world would die to get water today.  They are dying because they are not getting water.  We need a mature debate on water services.  It is ridiculous that households do not pay for water services given that businesses and farmers have been paying for them for years.  I welcome that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Government are finally introducing a system whereby there will be a proper, efficient water service.  The establishment of a water authority is extremely welcome.</P>
        <P>Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader, has been invited and has agreed to visit England.  Her visit might be an opportunity for this House to invite the opposition leader in Burma&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter the Senator can take up with the leader of his party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am asking a question, a Chathaoirligh.  It would be highly appropriate that we invite her to address this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator Mullen, for reminding me that the National Women&rsquo;s Council is having a briefing session in the AV room.  I intend to attend that meeting because it is important that we are fully informed.  It is slightly silly to suggest that we should debate matters in anticipation of an expert review on anything.  If we are serious about having a dignified debate it is always worthwhile listening to what other people have to say, and I shall certainly do so.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader if it is possible to have a debate concerning the issue of rendition with which this House preoccupied itself when the United States authorities were illegally rendering people to countries where they were tortured.  I ask this in light of the fact that a committee was established under the rules of this House.  It was the first time that this type of committee had been established.  Unfortunately, it was then disestablished as a result of local pressure from business interests but it should be reopened in light of the fact that within the last week it has been disclosed in the House of Commons that very similar answers to those which the then Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs gave both to this House and the other House on the rendition issue have proved not to be correct and that it has been established beyond doubt that the then Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, and other Ministers deliberately misled the House of Commons in Westminster on the fact that particular persons had been illegally rendered to countries where they were tortured.  I put the name, number and transit route of this aircraft on the record of this House and I also made a complaint to the Garda Commissioner on the subject.  In the interests of morality, human rights and justice I would like us to explore this issue and find out if the same situation obtained in this country, as has now been made clear through the discovery of documents in Tripoli, as happened in England.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call for a debate with the Minister for Health in the House to explain the position that obtains for people living outside the catchment area of Dublin who have to travel to Dublin for medical procedures.  I dealt recently with a case of a young gentleman in Donegal who is in remission from cancer but who was told by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital that because he lived outside the catchment area he could not receive pain relief.  After much debate locally and thanks to a medical practitioner to whom I spoke and a Member of this House, who I do not want to name as he is not here today, who gave advice on the matter, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital said it would treat the patient.  The young gentleman from Convoy, Donegal, Thomas Keaveney, who does not mind me mentioning him today, went through two weeks of trauma not knowing if his treatment would be maintained in Dublin having been told he was outside the catchment area.  The Minister should clarify the definition of a catchment area.  In terms of the Dublin catchment area, Donegal is not in it nor are most western counties and counties outside Leinster.  Neither I nor other politicians should have to intervene on behalf of a patient who travels from Donegal to Dublin whose treatment has been terminated because of a cutback in the hospital budget.  It is not acceptable and the Minister should explain and find out from the HSE its long-term policy for the type of treatment the young man must have.  He has suffered trauma and had to publicly speak about his condition in the media.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the proposal by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien that the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, come to the House to explain the proposals for the imposition of water charges.  I notice the Minister, Deputy Hogan &mdash; the rottweiler &mdash; has been withdrawn and the poodle has been put on the radio stations.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I meant it in a most jocose manner and it should not be taken too seriously.  I call on the Minister to outline the situation regarding the fact there is no legislative backdrop to granting the national water authority to Bord G&aacute;is.  Bord G&aacute;is is up for privatisation.  Will all of the water schemes throughout Ireland and the assets built up by local authorities while providing an excellent water service form part of its assets?  The company will have all of the assets and if it is privatised they will go to private hands with no limitations on the charges. Farm families pay water rates.  The Minister does not seem to be aware there is an exemption of 48,000 cu. m, for a domestic house after which the charge is &euro;1.22 per cubic metre.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can make this point during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make the Minister aware this is the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not here yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am sure he will be informed of it.  We are having imposed on us the household charge, the non-principal private residence charge and the water charge.  Workers are very concerned.  Instead of decentralising services we are centralising the control of Ireland&rsquo;s water to Dublin.  Local authorities are in a better position to carry out Government policy in this regard.  It has been brought to my attention that whatever decision is made on this issue, all meters used should be manufactured in Ireland.  It is possible to manufacture these meters here, if necessary.  A total of &euro;450 million from the National Pensions Reserve Fund which Fianna F&aacute;il built up under Charlie McCreevy will be used for this purpose.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government needs to listen to the people.  Working people are paying more PAYE and PRSI and the universal social charge but are getting fewer services.  These are the same people who have to pay private health insurance at the same time as paying taxes for health care.  Local authority services are being cut to the bone and people are getting no extra service for all of these so-called charges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the course of our debate on the household charge we heard many Senators say it amounted to only &euro;2 per week.  They are now saying it will cost only &euro;50 per annum for the meter and that charges in respect of water usage will be only a couple of hundred euro a year.  However, it is the cumulative effect of all of these charges and their impact on working families that the Government does not get.  If it does not get it soon, it will be in serious trouble.  It is easy for well paid politicians to say we must pay for all of these services.  The reality is that people are paying an awful lot more taxes with less money in their pockets.  Unless the Government gets that, it will not get all of these charges over the line.</P>

Like Senator Leyden, I am concerned that the service provider in this regard will be a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is, which under the Gas Acts is a commercial entity.  One wonders if the people will be responsible for delivering profits for that company and if, as correctly pointed out by Senator Leyden, that new profit making entity, as paid for by the people, will be expected to increase the marketability of Bord G&aacute;is for sale, if it is to be privatised.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I note Senators opposite are shaking their heads.  Perhaps that is not the case but the questions are legitimate.  Senator Leyden has pointed out that there is no legislative basis for the Government announcing that a new semi-State entity is to be operated by a company that has a commercial mandate as determined under the Gas Acts, which is a real cause for concern.  Members opposite can shake heads all they want.  The people are entitled to information.  Quite frankly, the information they have received thus far has been abominable in the extreme.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, say this morning that there will be a free allocation every year that costs &euro;40, which in itself is confusing.  We need the facts to be determined and delivered for people.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to come to the House as a matter of urgency to discuss the health cutbacks throughout the country and their delivery regionally through the HSE.  I am particularly concerned about organisations and facilities that are delivering important services to those with severe to profound intellectual disabilities.  Wisdom Services, which are based at Cregg House in County Sligo, deliver services to people of that nature across the entire north west.  As a result of the cuts in the institution&rsquo;s funding that have been announced by the HSE in the west, the Daughters of Wisdom have announced that they are not capable of continuing to provide services as outlined in the service agreement.  It is worth noting that since 1955, each Government of the day has invited the Daughters of Wisdom to provide these important services on behalf of the State.  They have done that exceptionally well.  Given that no agreement is in place, the Minister needs to take a personal interest in this case and intervene in it as a matter of urgency.  Otherwise this problem will be replicated throughout the country.</P>

The national lottery supports arts and sports projects which are very much a part of Irish society.  Some of the young people in the Visitors Gallery will participate in many of those projects in the future.  I would not like to see the national lottery sold outside this country.  I would like an explanation of why it is being sold.  Why can we not keep it in this country?  There might be many ways of doing so.  I would like to find out why the Minister is selling it.  I would like him to come to the House to explain it.  Has the decision to sell the national lottery, which has served arts and sports causes so well over the years, been rubber-stamped in the Department?

All it could do is sow confusion, especially as the Cabinet clarified all the major matters on water charging yesterday.  We know there will be no charge before 2014 and how precious and scarce water is.  We know about the cost of water treatment, pumping water into reservoirs and piping to individual houses.  A good service has been provided by the local authorities down through the years in this regard but, as has been said, farmers and businesses are paying for water already.  Unless one meets the cost of sinking a well or develops a means of harvesting rainwater, which would also require treatment because of the acid in the atmosphere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, a chartered engineer, Mr. Kevin Murray, estimated that the average consumption per house is 150 cu. m.  At estimated current prices, this is worth &euro;345.  Mr. Murray questioned the point of having a &euro;400 meter when the annual bill is only &euro;345, particularly for small users.  Lone small consumers should not only be exempt from the water charge but also from metering.  Mr. Murray writes about a pointless exercise: if one cuts one&rsquo;s consumption by 10%, one saves less than what it would cost to install the meter.  There is a difficulty arising in that regard.  The purpose of the article is to suggest the Government should start with the big customers, bigger houses and those with bigger lawns and then work down towards those in small housing units, whose consumption is quite low.  The latter will not be able to achieve the savings that would make the meter worthwhile.</P>
        <P>I am concerned over the choice of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to run the company.  The evidence from the National Competitiveness Council and the Forf&aacute;s report is that Irish gas is substantially more expensive than that in the United Kingdom.  The figures in the Forf&aacute;s report of December last suggest that what will cost one between &euro;6 and &euro;8 in the United Kingdom will nearly always cost above &euro;10 in Ireland.  How did Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, which is uncompetitive by UK gas industry standards, manage to impress the Cabinet so much?</P>
        <P>My third concern relates to the energy regulator.  We have high gas and electricity prices.  The regulator is supposed to protect us from water prices and the charge for the meter.  The regulator believes the head of the ESB should be paid four times more than the Taoiseach.  I hope that does not set a precedent when he is looking for the cost base of Irish Water.  It would be unacceptable to all in the House if yet another massive pay bill were created by the setting up of Irish Water.  I want the Leader to discuss those points with his colleagues in the Cabinet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I  welcome the Government&rsquo;s clarity yesterday on Irish Water and how it is to be set up.  There is no confusion.  Those who were misinformed in this area are actually creating the confusion.  Tomorrow, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will be in the House and we can ask him about the proposed sale of part of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  I refer to the generation element, not the transmission element.  This will afford Senator Leyden an opportunity seek clarification from the Minister directly.</P>
        <P>Any of us who has been a member of a local authority knows well that what is proposed is badly needed.  We need to ensure we have water of the same quality from Mizen Head to Malin Head and in our major cities.  It was stated that 40% of water that is treated to a high standard of potability leaks from the system and this costs money.  Therefore, we should all welcome the fact that the regulator will be involved and will decide prices rather than politicians or civil servants.  The decisions will be made in an open and transparent fashion.</P>

Any member of a local authority knows that the water services investment programme arises as an issue year in, year out, yet no funding has been provided for it.  This is a way of providing a long-term sustainable solution to that problem.  It will ensure that we have good quality water.  If we are to attract industry and foreign direct investment, it is important that major infrastructure such as water supply be intact and that we can stand over a quality service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I am premature, but has the Leader received any indication of when the Government&rsquo;s promised legislation on water charges will be laid before the House?  Will it be a Seanad or D&aacute;il Bill?  Due to its controversial nature, chances are that it will be a Seanad Bill.  We would welcome that, as it would provide us with more time to reflect on the matter.</P>
        <P>As someone who believes in the continuation and strengthening of local democracy, I have not enthusiastically embraced the idea of praising the Government for setting up a water authority.  It seems that the Government is continuing down a path initiated by the previous Government, in that it is setting up yet another quango and reducing the role and authority of local councils and local councillors.  This seems to go against the Government&rsquo;s assertion that it will strengthen local government.  This afternoon, the Seanad will debate a Bill that will remove further power from local authorities in terms of driving licences.  I will welcome the debate on water charges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the idea that this initiative will ensure water quality, Ireland actually has excellent water quality.  While I appreciate that there were particular difficulties in County Galway, it has been proved time and again that the water coming out of taps is generally as good as, if not better than, the bottled water for which one pays &euro;2 or a minimum of &euro;1 in one&rsquo;s local store.  No question marks surround the quality of water.  The problem lies in wastage.  I do not know why it could not be addressed via existing local authority structures.  Any money collected could be reinvested at local level.  However, that is a debate for another day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I applaud and agree with Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s reference to General Michael Collins.  The loss of Michael Collins was a devastation for Ireland that resonates to this day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share the concerns expressed by Senator Mullen regarding the activities of the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland.  As a State-funded body and particularly in respect of a controversial matter like abortion, the Government has a responsibility to ensure that the council takes an even-handed view, puts forward both sides of the argument and does not pursue a specific agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have visited a number of countries in which water was in scarce supply.  At one hospital, water needed to be collected from its roof &mdash; it only rains there for two weeks per year &mdash; and stored in ten 50,000-litre tanks.  That supply must sustain the hospital for 11 and a half months.  In this light, one appreciates the value of water.</P>
        <P>In some Irish local authority areas, that more than 40% of water is wasted indicates significant inefficiencies.  We must address this issue.  Centralisation has been mentioned.  One of the good initiatives taken in the past 20 years was the establishment of the National Roads Authority, NRA.  It is not too long ago that the road network between Ireland&rsquo;s two major cities, Cork and Dublin, was appalling.  It was the NRA&rsquo;s careful planning and work with local authorities that brought about changes in road infrastructure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Likewise, setting up a national authority for the supply of water while involving local authorities is the way forward.  This is what the Government is doing.  When we debate the matter, it is important that the Minister make available to us details of wastage in the system in order that people can see that they are not getting value for money.  At the end of the day the taxpayers are paying for that wastage and they want value for money.  Senator Cullinane referred to services being wound down or restricted.  In the health care area, the number of medical cards has increased from 1,145,000 to 1,736,000.  At the current rate of progress more than 2 million people in this country will have either a medical card or a GP only card by the end of this year.  Somebody has to pay for these cards and the only people available to pay for them are the taxpayers.  What we are proposing will provide value for money.  Let us have a debate on the matter in order that the Minister can show us where inefficiencies are costing the taxpayer money.  This is a way to create efficiency and value for money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to seek clarification from the Minister for Health on an issue I alluded to previously but which is becoming more acute, namely, whether there has been a change in the process for deciding what anti-cancer drugs will be made available through the health service.  Good research shows that countries which underspend on cancer drugs have inferior cancer outcomes.  A famous study carried out by the Karolinska Institute several years ago caused a great deal of controversy in this regard and other research conducted by a young health economist working with me came to a similar conclusion.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The country on which we have most closely modelled our health system is the United Kingdom, which is the most advanced rationer of cancer drugs and among the large western health systems has the worst survival rates in many cancers for which records are kept.  It is upsetting to discover that the philosophy followed in that country appears to be entering our health service.  Our historically poorly developed cancer service, which had few specialists and a long waiting list, had the advantage of offering good access to drugs.  Our ability to access drugs like taxotere, which is a good chemotherapy drug, herceptin, which was a stunningly important drug for a small number of patients with breast cancer, and other drugs was substantially better than our colleagues in the United Kingdom.  A small amount of cancer tourism even took place under the radar with patients coming here for treatments that were unavailable in the UK.  However, it appears that the UK model is now being applied to our decision making process.  An entity called the national centre for pharmaco-economics, the head of which was reared in the culture of British health care rationing, is now making decisions that appear to routinely deny drugs to cancer patients in Ireland.  This has reached a crisis level with a particular drug called ipilimumab, which is used to treat patients with melanoma.  Ipilimumab is expensive and does not work very well for most patients but a small number win the big lottery in that they seem to be cured.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">As a society, we have to decide whether it is worthwhile to invest approximately &euro;4 million per annum in providing this drug for suitable patients who have this disease and for whom there is no other curable therapy.  It is an easy decision for me if the health system can afford to spend money to have the communications clinic write speeches for the Minister for Health or on establishing corporate affairs in every country.  If we can afford to pay &euro;10 million per year for HIQA, which has not saved a single life in this country, I cannot understand why we cannot make these drugs available to patients.  I have recently heard that another promising breast cancer drug is also being denied.  Many of the treatments we routinely use today would never have been passed if the same rules were followed 20 years ago.</P>
        <P>I am aware that we do not live in an economic vacuum.  I do not argue that there should be limitless amounts of money to spend exclusively on expensive cancer drugs but we are misspending much of the money in other areas of the health service instead of investing in these drugs.  For this reason I seek a clarification from the Minister on the status of the decision making process for cancer drugs and, in particular, ipilimumab.  I have a 21 year old girl and a 32 year old mother of a young family who are asking me every day whether I can procure this drug for them.  Not only is it being refused by the HSE but now the private insurers are following the lead.  One small office somewhere in the bureaucracy is making powerful decisions to make these drugs unavailable across the entire health service.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As we all know, the farming and business communities are already paying for water, as are people in rural areas who are in group water schemes.  There is an inequity that people living in towns and cities are not charged for water.  We now need to ensure that this valuable resource is available for business and for job creation into the future.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that the cost of it is shared equitably throughout the community.

	<P Just="Left">Is d&oacute;igh gur ceart dom, tar &eacute;is an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag mo chomhleaca&iacute; an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Maol&aacute;in, iarratas a dh&eacute;anamh go dtabharfa&iacute; cuireadh don Ch&eacute;ad Aire agus don Leas-Ch&eacute;ad Aire sa Tuaisceart teacht ar chuairt anseo, mar is l&eacute;ir f&oacute;s go bhfuil go leor m&iacute;thuisceana ann maidir leis an chaoi a bhfuil an st&aacute;t &aacute; riaradh thuas ansin.  As part of the programme of bringing guest speakers to the House, we should invite the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister from the Northern Executive to clarify the situation in the North as there is considerable misinformation as highlighted by what Senator Mullins has said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise the issue of a group in a very difficult and vulnerable position &mdash; lone parents.  They are being demonised in the media and there is considerable misinformation about their situation.  The SPARK organisation is campaigning on their behalf and is trying to bring to the attention of the media and politicians the difficult situation in which they find themselves.  This morning the Seven is too Young group, representing OPEN, the NWCI and Barnardos, made a very good presentation highlighting the problems they have with the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  I call for a debate on the situation of lone parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am afraid we are falling back into an almost 1950s mentality with single mothers being told they might as well stay at home with their children and raise them.  They are being made to feel they should not worry about trying to get educated or get a job.  They are made feel unimportant and they see others being prioritised.  That is a very dangerous road to go down.  Their plight crosses many Departments.  There are issues regarding social protection, finance, education, transport, housing, children and health.  There is considerable expertise in the Seanad which would be a very good place to have a debate on these issues.  We have people with experience of many of these issues in their own child care authorities and representative organisations in which they have worked.  Such a debate could be very beneficial and would be very timely.  The people concerned certainly feel marginalised and if some of the changes proposed are forced through, it will have a very detrimental effect on their situation and society in general for the next 20 or 30 years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s call for a debate on the proposed sale of the national lottery.  I am calling for a full debate on the national lottery, which Senator Conway has also called for on a number of occasions.  I would welcome such a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Government for clarifying the issue of water meter charges at yesterday&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting.  Ministers have now said they will establish a quango called Irish Water.  Together with the regulator, the new body will decide how much taxpayers will pay for this natural resource.  The Government will therefore be able to hide behind the regulator and Irish Water, while saying &ldquo;It has nothing to do with us&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I feel sorry for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who is an honourable and decent man, and doing his best.  This is his third nightmare in the Custom House.  First, we had the septic tank debacle, which was followed by the household charge fiasco and we now have confusion on the water meter issue.  I do not blame him.  He is the Minister responsible for the environment, community and local government portfolios, but he is only carrying out what the Cabinet decides.  He does not decide these measures &mdash; the Cabinet gives him the go-ahead to implement these decisions.  Time and time again, he has been wrong-footed and scapegoated by his Cabinet colleagues; therefore, I feel sorry for him.  I would welcome him to this House on any occasion if he wants to clarify the situation and agree with me.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There are many urgent items on the agenda that attract our attention, or which may distract us from other matters.  However, figures published yesterday showed that one third of all babies born in Ireland this year are likely to live to be 100, that is, until 2112.  It seems that those of us who are here now have a responsibility to ensure that the earth will still be around in 100 years time and is a viable place where our children and grandchildren can live.  It is said that we have the responsibility of minding the earth for the next generation and this is an opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am raising this matter because I have just come from a meeting to publicise Dublin as the city of science for six days from 11 July.  The objective is to help people to recognise that Ireland is serious about science.  Perhaps the Leader can find some time for a debate on science in the next few weeks.  This is a big event that will bring five Nobel laureates here, along with other important scientists.  I do not think we have ever had anything like this in Ireland before.  In fact, I do not think that anything like this has been held in Europe.  It is a worthwhile investigation because the responsibility is on us to care for the earth.  Let us ensure that this House is aware of the opportunities, possibilities and potential of being able to do something about it.</P>

	<P>The question of water has dominated the Order of Business, with quite a number of Senators contributing.  The Government made a series of decisions on the establishment of Irish Water at yesterday&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting.  It will be established as an independent State-owned subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann group.  This has followed a detailed analysis as to whether the public utility, Irish Water, should be established as a new State agency or under the stewardship of an existing State agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There will be no up-front costs to households for water meters or their installation.  The exact details on pricing and the operation of the free allowance will be a matter for the regulator, as has been pointed out.  This is the last country in the EU and the OECD to charge for domestic water supplies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to Bord G&aacute;is, the Government completed a detailed analysis as to whether the public utility, Irish Water, should be established as a new State agency or under the stewardship of an existing State agency.  On foot of that analysis, the Government yesterday agreed to establish Irish Water as an independent State-owned subsidiary within Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  Irish Water will be established as a public water facility and will remain in public ownership.  I remind Members on the opposite side of the House, the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, that their party&rsquo;s commitment prior to the last election included a commitment to introduce charging for treated water use that would be fair, would significantly reduce waste, would be easily applied and based on a system where households were allocated a free basic allowance, with charging only for water use in excess of this allowance and that in keeping with the allocation of greater responsibility to local authorities, they would set their own rates for water use.  This is the Fianna F&aacute;il stance and it would mean different water charges in every local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Bacik and other Senators raised the question of the plentiful supply of water.  I agree there is a plentiful supply of water in the country but there is not a plentiful supply of treated water and this is what has to be paid for.  A total of &euro;1.2 billion is spent on the provision of quality treated water and it will have to be paid for as outlined in the EU-IMF deal which was signed up to by the previous Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Mac Conghail referred to the Private Members&rsquo; motion.  The Government amendment to the motion is very conciliatory and I expect a very good debate and that the House will agree to the amendment as outlined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mullen and a number of other Senators referred to a Bill dealing with the question of abortion which is being taken in the other House.  We will have ample opportunity to debate that Bill if it reaches this House.  On that matter, the Government submitted an action plan on 16 June 2011 to the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe relating to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of ABC <i>v</i>. Ireland which was delivered on 16 December 2010.  As per the programme for Government commitment and the submitted action plan, the Government has established an expert group drawing on appropriate medical and legal expertise with a view to recommending a series of options on how to implement the judgment of the European Court.  It is proposed that the group, chaired by Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan, will report within six months.  The report is due in July 2012.  The Government is of the view that this is the appropriate forum in which to examine this complex and sensitive matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Conway requested that Aung San Suu Kyi be invited to address the House.  We will certainly raise the matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and inquire about the availability of Aung San Suu Kyi to visit Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris sought a debate on rendition.  We will see whether we can get time to debate that issue.  </P><P Just="Left"> I note Senator Harte's comments about catchment areas.  I am sure the HSE and the Minister will clarify the situation for the Senator when he requests that information. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Quite a number of points were made about water charges, which I have answered.  Senator D&rsquo;Arcy mentioned the donation to the National Museum of Ireland of locks of hair belonging to General Michael Collins.  The vendor is to be complimented on donating them to the National Museum of Ireland rather than putting them up for public auction.  I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s comments about the swab that was also supposed to go for auction; I hope it will be given to the appropriate authorities.  Something like that should not go for public auction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Donnell and Wilson spoke about the national lottery.  The lottery will not be sold; it is the sale of a 20-year franchise that is being discussed.  The majority of the up-front money from the sale will go towards the national children&rsquo;s hospital, but a percentage of lottery funding will still go to worthy causes.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Paul Coghlan poetically answered Senator Darragh O'Brien on the question of water.  I will certainly discuss with the Minister the points made by Senator Barrett about the Irish Water utility. </P>
        <P Just="Left">In answer to Senator Mooney&rsquo;s question, I am not aware when the legislation will be forthcoming, but I will update the House when I have that information.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Crown spoke about the important issue of anti-cancer drugs and their accessibility.  I suggest to him that he table a matter for discussion on the Adjournment in order that he can receive a comprehensive reply from the Minister which will clarify the position. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned lone parents.  I advise the House that the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill will be discussed here all day and practically all night on Thursday of next week, after being discussed in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday.  We can also discuss it on Friday, if necessary.  There is quite a lot about lone parents in the Bill, and the Senator will have ample opportunity to debate the issue at that point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn spoke about Dublin being the city of science and has mentioned what is coming here in July.  This would be a good opportunity for us to have a discussion on science and innovation, and I will try to arrange that debate as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The Bill I am introducing today has two main components, namely, the reform of commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing and the designation of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, as the driver licensing authority.  The provisions relating to the two areas will bring about significant and positive changes to the way in which each is operated and managed.  This will result in major service improvements for all users.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Bill, as suggested by its title, is to establish a legislative framework for commercial vehicle roadworthiness, CVR, testing in the State.  The Bill will see the functions of local authorities regarding CVR being assumed by the Road Safety Authority.  In addition, the Bill will provide for a new licensing or authorisation system in respect of test centres and authorised testers as well as greater powers of enforcement through targeted roadside inspections and inspections of commercial operators&rsquo; premises in respect of vehicle maintenance and roadworthiness.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Bill also provides for revised administrative arrangements for the processing and management of driving licences.  The administrative change will provide the necessary support for the introduction of a plastic card driving licence in Ireland at the beginning of 2013 and for the transfer of the driver licensing function from local authorities to the RSA.  These initiatives are important elements of my Department&rsquo;s action plan under the Croke Park agreement.  The reforms being delivered on foot of this Bill will result in a significant saving in the current organisation of public services in these areas and should result in a better public service.  I commend the leadership and commitment shown by the RSA, local authorities and those working in the area in responding to the challenge of public service reform and working to deliver the service changes underpinning this Bill.</P>
        <P>Before outlining in detail the provisions contained in the Bill, I would like to broadly explain the background against which these proposals were framed.  Regarding commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing, a number of years ago, following some high profile collisions involving commercial vehicles, my predecessor tasked the RSA with undertaking a comprehensive review of arrangements for the roadworthiness testing of commercial vehicles in Ireland.  At present, commercial vehicles are required to undergo an annual roadworthiness test at an authorised test centre.  Local authorities are responsible for authorising privately operated garages to provide testing services and for completing regular supervision of these authorised testers in their area.  Following the comprehensive review, which was carried out by independent consultants on behalf of the RSA, the recommendations contained in the report were approved by my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recommendations involved two courses of action that would seek to raise the standard of commercial vehicle testing across the country on a permanent basis.  The first element was a complete overhaul of the CVR testing system to provide for a three-strand approach by addressing the testing process to ensure that roadworthiness tests are conducted impartially and correctly at all times; developing a programme of roadside inspections to ensure continuous compliance with roadworthiness standards; and the introduction of operator premises checks and intelligence-led targeting of operators based on risk.  The second element was the transfer of responsibility for the management and operation of the commercial vehicle testing system from local authorities to the RSA.  The two elements are inextricably linked and necessary to meet the overall objective of the transformation programme, which will make a step change in the quality of commercial vehicles using Irish roads and thereby help to improve road safety, reduce congestion, ensure fair competition, develop a much greater awareness of road safety issues and promote a culture of safety in the transport industry in respect of the use and maintenance of commercial vehicles, including trailers.</P>
        <P>Many in the industry have claimed that commercial pressures have led some operators to cut corners in terms of vehicle maintenance and compliance with required vehicle standards, thus providing such operators with an unfair commercial advantage.  This is not hearsay and the claims are supported by RSA and Garda enforcement activity and reports from enforcement authorities in other EU member states on the defects found in Irish commercial vehicles.  A failure to act would perpetuate this problem to the detriment of operators who take a more responsible attitude.  In the current economic climate, it is even more important to take all necessary steps to ensure the roadworthiness and quality of the national vehicle fleet does not deteriorate further.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of safety, an estimated 17.5% of road fatalities on Irish roads over the period from 1996 to 2010 involved commercial vehicles, so an improvement in the roadworthiness of these vehicles could not only save lives but could also result in substantial savings to the State.  While it may seem callous to discuss the financial cost of fatalities, it is a reality.  The avoidance of four fatal collisions or 25 serious injury collisions per year involving commercial vehicles would more than cover the operational cost of this proposed reform.  However, it is the avoidance of loss and pain for the families involved that will provide the ultimate gain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another major contribution of this reform is to reduce congestion caused by breakdowns of commercial vehicles.  It is estimated that up to 10% of total congestion on primary roads is caused by such incidents.  Vehicles that are not compliant with the roadworthiness testing system are considered to be a significant contributory factor.  Based on UK estimates of the economic impact of such incidents, the cost to Ireland would be in the range of &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion.  It is clear that avoiding even a small number of these incidents on the M50 or in the port tunnel, for example, would have considerable economic benefit.</P>
        <P>Other indirect benefits from a reformed system include increased business for the vehicle maintenance and testing industry, increased revenue to the Exchequer from fines for non-compliance as well the restoration and improvement in the reputation of the transport industry.  The measures will support compliant operators in their business through more effective enforcement of non-compliance.  The measures will also support a system which reduces the administrative burden on operators, including, for example, the need to visit a motor tax office to obtain a certificate of roadworthiness and online motor tax for commercial vehicle owners.</P>
        <P>Following approval of the proposals, the RSA developed a transformation roadmap which outlined a phased approach to establishing a reform programme for the commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing system.  Preparations are well advanced for implementing the many elements of this roadmap.  The requisite number of staff has already been transferred from local authorities and the RSA is engaged in procuring IT and structural support for the measures.  With the legal support of the provisions in the Bill, the Department and the RSA will proceed immediately to drafting the necessary secondary legislation to enable the RSA to take the final steps to put in place the revised structure for CVR.  Subject to the appropriate legal provisions being in place, it is envisaged that the testing function will transfer to the RSA by the end of this year.  Furthermore, the new system of managing and supervising the performance of test centres to ensure a minimum consistent standard of testing throughout the country will be in place by the end of this year.  The other measures will be in place in the first half of next year.</P>
        <P>The other area to which the provisions of the Bill relate is the transfer of the driver licensing function from local authorities to the RSA.  The Irish driver licence system has operated on a decentralised basis since 1964 when the current system came into being.  The system as it currently stands has a number of strands.  Local authorities, operating out of motor tax offices, are responsible for processing applications and delivering licences.  Budgetary responsibility for the licence service rests with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  My Department has responsibility for policy oversight and the driver licence database, which is managed by the national vehicle driver file in Shannon.  Operational oversight at national level and certain elements of policy guidance rests with the Road Safety Authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The impetus for the change I am undertaking is the introduction of the plastic card driving licence in 2013.  Under EU Licensing Directive 2006/126, all member states are required to introduce a plastic card driver licence in January 2013.  The introduction of this new form of licence presented an opportunity to review the licence issuing system as a whole and an examination of whether greater efficiencies could be achieved by a change of approach.  The review conducted on behalf of the RSA concluded that, while the existing licensing delivery system has some advantages, the distributed nature of motor tax offices does give rise to variable practices, inefficiencies and an inability to benefit from economies of scale.</P>
        <P>The review suggests that for reasons of security, efficiencies and economy of scale the plastic card licence should be produced by an outsourced provider.  Apart from other considerations, it would not be economically feasible to site plastic card production facilities at multiple locations.  The main recommendation of the review was that a centralised model for dealing with all aspects of the plastic card driver licence should be proceeded with.  The advantages flowing from such an approach cover identity features, security, customer service, efficiency and value for money.  Having examined the review, I considered various State bodies and concluded that the RSA was best positioned to undertake responsibility for centralised processing and production of driver licences.  The authority already holds responsibility for the driver theory test and driver testing.  The extension of its functions to include licence processing and production brings a synchronicity to this area and provides the customer with a one-stop-shop approach to driver licensing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having set out the background, I want to outline for Senators the major provisions of the Bill.  First, I should clarify that while the Bill vests all of the powers and functions in me as Minister, it is my intention to confer these powers on the RSA and this is provided for under section 37.</P>
        <P>Part 2 provides the new legislative framework for CVR testing in the State.  This Part will cover all aspects of CVR from a regulatory perspective and provides significant powers to various statutory officers to support the reform of the system.</P>
        <P>Chapter 1 provides for the making of regulations in relation to the commercial vehicle testing and certificates of roadworthiness.  It includes relevant offences for using a vehicle without such a certificate and provides that the person using the vehicle and the owner can be guilty of an offence if not the same person.  Under section 7, a member of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na will have the power to demand a certificate of roadworthiness from the driver or the owner of a vehicle within one month of an occasion where the member has reasonable grounds for believing that the CVR vehicle was being used in a public place.  There will also be an offence in respect of non-compliance with this requirement.</P>
        <P>Chapter 2 contains the most significant provisions in terms of the reform programme.  It establishes a new regulatory regime for authorised testers who are responsible for operating the test centres, carrying out the tests and issuing pass statements for CVR vehicles.  The Bill provides for replacement of the term &ldquo;authorised tester&rdquo; with &ldquo;CVR test operator&rdquo;.  Upon commencement of these provisions, the new regime will apply to existing authorised testers and the necessary transitional provision for this is provided under section 10.  Existing authorised testers will be required to apply for a renewal of their authorisation within 18 months of the commencement of section 10.  Any application to become an authorised tester, which was being processed but not determined prior to the commencement of this legislation, will also be covered by this section.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill sets out the detailed requirements that will be imposed on persons applying to be CVR test operators.  The provisions in this chapter will raise and strengthen the required standards necessary for authorisation.  Not only will conditions attaching to the authorisation deal with a number of areas, including categories of vehicles to be tested, the type of tests to be carried out and the requirements in relation to testing centres and testers, it will also provide for other criteria against which an application may be considered.  These considerations will include the need for the competent delivery of CVR testing, the need for a well functioning, well maintained, accessible, competitive, integrated and safe network of CVR testing centres as well as the need for appropriate equipment, facilities and premises for testing.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above authorisations, section 17 provides for the authorisation of CVR testers.  CVR testers are the people who physically carry out the tests on the vehicles at the test centres.  This section provides a transitional provision for the testers who are already registered for this purpose and provides that a register of authorised CVR testers may be established and maintained.  Similarly, there is a provision under section 29 that the RSA shall establish and maintain a register of CVR test operators and this register will be made available to all, both online and at the headquarters of the authority.</P>
        <P>All aspects of authorisation in respect of both CVR test operators and CVR testers will be overhauled by this Bill and the new standards will be enforced by provisions to suspend and revoke authorisations when needed.  Sections 18 to 22, inclusive, provide for such suspensions and revocations.  Any non-compliance with the standards, conditions or directions prescribed in this legislation will now have serious implications for authorised CVR test operators as well as CVR testers.  Provision has also been made for the details of such suspensions or revocations under sections 18 and 19, respectively, to be made available as appropriate on the registers of CVR test operators and testers already mentioned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enforcement will be the key to raising the national standard of commercial vehicle roadworthiness.  This Bill will allow for greater powers of enforcement through targeted roadside inspections, inspections of commercial operators&rsquo; premises and CVR test centres.  These powers are being channelled through various statutory officers, namely, authorised officers, CVR inspectors and, of course, members of the Garda.  Sections 24 and 25 provide for the appointment of authorised officers and the powers of these officers in relation to CVR testing.  Authorised officers will have the power, subject to section 26, to enter a CVR testing centre or any other premises where he or she believes CVR tests are being carried out.  He or she may inspect the premises, the equipment and the facilities and enter and inspect CVR vehicles.  The authorised officer will be able to observe and supervise testing in progress and inspect or remove any documentation, as necessary, relating to the maintenance and testing of vehicles.  Authorised officers will have the power to issue directions to a CVR test operator where tests are not being carried out as required.  Failure to comply with the requirements or directions prescribed will result in an offence being committed by the CVR test operators.  The full extent of the authorised officer remit in relation to CVR testing is clearly set out in section 25.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Chapter 3, section 31 also provides authorised officers with additional powers in relation to CVR maintenance obligations.  The authorised officer will have similar powers to those mentioned already.  In this case, the powers will allow the officer to enter any premises where he or she believes CVR vehicles are being kept or information on CVR vehicles is being kept.  The section provides that an authorised officer can search premises to locate a vehicle and inspect such vehicles or any equipment being used to maintain the CVR vehicles.  He or she can also require an owner or a person in charge to provide any documentation or information related to the maintenance of the vehicle and the officer may inspect, take extracts or copies of such documentation.  These extensive powers should provide a truly effective means of ensuring compliance with the standard of testing and the vehicles themselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Similarly, significant powers have been provided for CVR inspectors in Chapter 4, which deals with roadside inspections.  A CVR inspector will be a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a person appointed as a CVR inspector under section 33.  Section 34 sets out the powers of a CVR inspector and provides that where a CVR inspector is a member of the Garda or is accompanied by a member of the force, powers are being provided to stop a vehicle and keep it stationary for a period that is reasonable for the purposes of carrying out an inspection.  Once a vehicle has been stopped by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the CVR inspector will also have the power to require the driver to produce a certificate of roadworthiness, seek information that assists in the inspection and drive a vehicle for a reasonable time and distance.  The CVR inspector will also have the power to carry out any tests or make any requirements that are deemed reasonable by the inspector for the purposes of inspecting the vehicle.  The provisions in relation to CVR inspectors go beyond my brief description.  I hope I have given a flavour of the type of powers that will be given to statutory officers for the purposes of enforcement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Chapter 6 will provide for the conferral of functions related to CVR on the Road Safety Authority.  The authority will assume responsibility for the oversight, management and direct control of the CVR function and will be central to implementing a robust testing regime.  The proposed overhaul of the CVR system involves the use of a risk register for systematic targeting of non-compliant operators and test centres.  Section 39 provides for this system.  Currently, most inspections are carried out on a random basis.  This largely random approach leads to compliant operators being inconvenienced as much as the non-compliant or higher risk operators.  The risk assessment system proposed is intended to be a fair and evidence-based system which will treat each operator consistently based on the information available.  Operators who adhere to good practices, hold appropriate records and consistently maintain their vehicles to the required standards will reap the benefits as compliance and enforcement activities are focused to a greater degree on higher risk operators.</P>
        <P>The CVR reform programme also includes an integrated information technology system, which will assist the Road Safety Authority in ensuring vehicle testing is carried out to a common standard.  This will support intelligence-based enforcement by building up a profile of CVR test operators.  The system, which is provided for in section 28, will enable targeting of non-compliant operators and minimise disruption to compliant operators.  The information and risk rating systems will be central to developing a modern and internationally recognised system of roadworthiness in Ireland.  This Bill will underpin everything that has been envisaged.  It is testament to the work that has been done and will continue to be done by all parties in a challenging environment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Chapter 8 Bill deals with miscellaneous amendments to the Road Traffic Acts, some of which arise from the main provisions in this Bill.   These are not substantive amendments and are primarily technical in nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 3 deals with the transfer of the licensing function from local authorities to the RSA.  As stated, we will move to a plastic card licence next year.  As part of a review to determine the best means of introducing this new type of licence, a centralised model in respect of driver licensing provision was recommended.  This will be vested in the RSA, which will become the licensing authority for the purposes of processing, managing and issuing driver licences.</P>
        <P>Section 49 amends section 4 of the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 to provide the RSA with the functions of a licensing authority within the meaning of section 21 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  Sections 50 to 55, inclusive, deal with all necessary amendments to the road traffic and finance Acts to reflect accurately this change in function.</P>
        <P>The objective of this Bill is to introduce a reform programme that will improve the roadworthiness and safety of commercial vehicles and to provide for the introduction of a plastic card driving licence with more efficient and effective management arrangements.  I hope Senators will support the Bill and that it will pass in the Seanad.  I look forward to hearing Senators&rsquo; views on its provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I broadly welcome the scope of this Bill.  This side of the House has been consistent in supporting the Government&rsquo;s road safety programme, much of which was initiated during Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s term under the then Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey.  We see this Bill as another cog in the wheel and, therefore, we welcome it.  We have certain quibbles about it, to which I will refer, and we may have one or two amendments, depending on how the Minister responds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Road safety is paramount for every citizen in the State.  There is a hardly a family and certainly not a community that has not been damaged in some way by a road accident or tragedy.  The efforts of the current and previous Governments are bearing fruit at this stage.  One is very sensitive about quoting statistics because, as we all say, one death is one too many.  Targets for reducing the number of deaths are being met consistently and that is most important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The introduction of penalty points and speed cameras has helped.  I noticed in a newspaper some days ago that an eminent judge stated he did not believe penalty points were having an effect because people believed they were something to be worried about in the future.  I disagree strongly.  From experience, I note that when one gets one&rsquo;s first couple of penalty points, and certainly when one gets a second couple, one definitely becomes more alert and ensures one does get any more.  Penalty points have been a very important development.</P>
        <P>Speed cameras have certainly reduced speeding on the roads and they work very efficiently.  This is because the system is being operated by a company from my own town, Listowel.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was quite shocked to read some of the statistics for accidents involving commercial vehicles.  Up to 20% of all roadside fatalities involve commercial vehicles.  At routine roadside checkpoints, 48% of commercial vehicles are found to be defective and 32% are found to be so defective that urgent action is required.  This is rather shocking.  There are those who do not have the high standards that are generally associated with the Irish Road Haulage Association, most of whose members are upright and responsible.  Every driver has anecdotal evidence of lorries that are dirty and whose registration numbers cannot be read.  Such lorries do not seem to have tail-lights.  Further inspections and accountability are required, and that is why we welcome the Bill.</P>
        <P>Drivers of older vehicles, in particular, are culpable.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> this week, it is stated the Kerry county coroner, Ms Helen Lucey, has had for the second time to flag a problem she has noticed whereby older lorries with the infamous four-foot blind spot to the front left knock down pedestrians without the driver seeing them.  This does not happen with newer vehicles because they must comply with a regulation.  The regulation, requiring the fitting of special C5 and C6 mirrors, called cyclops mirrors, is still being phased in for the older vehicles.  The Minister needs to address this lacuna, given the fact that people are still being killed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That there are 30 local authorities and 158 independent testing operations speaks for itself.  The system needs to be tidied up a little.  Speaking as someone whose background is in local government, I caution the Minister on the question of driving licences, which is the subject of the latter part of my contribution.  The power of local authorities is being gradually eroded.  Water is being taken from them, as was responsibility for the roads.  Licensing is now being removed as well.  The Minister stated that this initiative will create a number of jobs, but how many will it cost at local authority level?  Are the latter guaranteed under the Croke Park agreement or will people be redeployed?</P>
        <P>Standards are inconsistent.  This is natural, given the number of testing operations.  Communication between the Road Safety Authority, RSA, testing operators, the Garda and local authorities is poor.  This leads me to the crux of the matter, one on which I have submitted an amendment.  I refer to making data available to interested parties under the Bill.  Has this provision been cleared with the Data Protection Commissioner or does the Minister propose to consult him?  I will address this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister mentioned the Garda&rsquo;s limited manpower for carrying out roadside checks.  He might correct me if I am wrong, but if I have read the Bill accurately, it seems that commercial vehicle roadworthiness, CVR, inspectors who are not garda&iacute; will need garda&iacute; with them if they are to stop traffic for inspection.  This appears counterproductive.  Would it not have been better to give CVR inspectors the power to stop vehicles?  If there is a reasonable answer, I would like to hear it.</P>
        <P>The Bill refers to a transitional period of two years from the old dispensation to the new.  Will the Minister explain how this will work in practice?  The Bill has a major flaw, in that virtually all of it will require secondary legislation to become effective.  No timeframe for this is set out in the Bill.  One wonders why.  Secondary legislation will be at the Minister&rsquo;s discretion and we wonder what his programme for its introduction will be.</P>
        <P>The Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, with which I was in contact, has no serious quibble with the Bill.  However, it is concerned about who will be brought into the legislation&rsquo;s net.  In particular, it is concerned about cowboy operators who have no affiliation with it and who do not have the same level of accountability as its members.  The IRHA believes that its members are compliant and are either being inspected regularly or even too frequently while others are getting away.  The IRHA has a query about the commercial vehicles used by Musgrave, Spar, etc., which have fleets of lorries.  Like ordinary hauliers, will they be subject to one-on-one inspections?</P>
        <P>Regarding the new provisions on driving licences, the Bill does not mention much about the fact that it will be a Visa card-type operation.  While everyone would be in favour of that, a question must be asked.  If a system works, why fix it?  Where the local authorities&rsquo; operation of the driving licence system is concerned, customer satisfaction levels seem high.  One hears of few complaints about the way people are treated by their local council offices when the former try to renew their licences.</P>
        <P>The IMPACT union is concerned by the proposed job losses and cites the OECD report, which is in favour of more services being provided at local level.  Are we going against this idea?  We have found that centralisation is not the panacea it is often claimed to be.  The jury is still out on the centralisation of medical card applications.  Centralisation is not necessarily a good idea.  In this respect, perhaps the Minister might favour An Post for the implementation of the licensing regime, as it is in every town and village.  Although the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, missed the boat and did not include An Post in the implementation of the household charge, perhaps the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, might be able to use it.  The Bill proposes a charge of &euro;45 for the safety levy.  Will the charge be capped at that level for a number of years or will it jump to &euro;100 this time next year?  We welcome the Bill in general and commend the Minister&rsquo;s efforts on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this Bill and, on behalf of Fine Gael Senators, commend the Minister for his dedication in introducing a range of legislative measures to enhance road safety in Ireland.  I will deal with the parts of the Bill pertaining to roadworthiness of commercial vehicles and Senator Brennan will address the issue of driving licences.</P>
        <P>Introducing a new road safety measure is never a straightforward matter because it generally involves restricting rights that drivers previously held, imposing additional obligations or, at least, a change to the <i>status quo</i>.  However, given the ultimate goal of reducing road fatalities, it is essential that we have a Minister who is willing to grasp the nettle.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has shown that he attaches the highest priority to saving lives on our roads.  The fruits of a sustained legislative programme aimed at improving road safety are notable in the statistics.  To date in 2012, the number of road deaths are significantly below that for the same period in 2011.  A total of 46 people died on Irish roads between 1 January and 17 April 2012, which is 13 fewer than the same period in 2011.</P>
        <P>Data published recently by the European Commission indicate that Ireland improved its road safety performance in 2011, with road deaths dropping by 13% between 2010 and 2011.  As a result Ireland has moved up one place to fifth in the EU&rsquo;s road safety ranking.  According to the European Commission, Ireland and Denmark were the only countries in the top six to record reductions in road deaths.  However, we must continue to take measures to improve road safety and in this context it is notable that the regulatory impact assessment for the Bill indicates that commercial vehicles are involved in approximately 20% of all road fatalities.  This is a startling statistic.  Approximately 32% of the commercial vehicles tested at roadside checkpoints in 2011 required immediate action.</P>
        <P>I recognise it is callous to put a monetary value on fatalities or injuries because the financial impact can never be compared to the cost of life but we must bear in mind that the CEO of the Road Safety Authority estimates that every road fatality costs approximately &euro;2.5 million.  By this calculation the 186 road fatalities which occurred in 2011 cost &euro;465 million.</P>
        <P>This Bill contains two major initiatives, namely, reform of the test system for commercial vehicle roadworthiness and the introduction of a new centralised system for issuing driving licences.  Reform of the test system for commercial vehicles is necessary.  A recent documentary on RTE revealed worrying inconsistencies in vehicle assessment among different NCT centres, with dangerous consequences for road users.  Commercial vehicle testing is currently provided by 158 independent operators who are regulated by 30 public bodies.  Enforcement and the extent of supervision are not uniform.  In a small country like Ireland it is difficult to justify such a variety of test centres and the attendant variation in approaches and outcomes.</P>
        <P>With this in mind the Bill proposes to introduce a single authority to monitor and enforce standards.  A single authority is considered the best means of ensuring consistent practices, streamlined procedures, clear communications channels and accountability within the service.  The current system is cumbersome with functions and roles divided between a number of agencies, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority and the city and county councils.  Enforcement is a matter for the Garda.  Testing is required on both heavy and light goods vehicles but not all centres can carry out tests on both categories.</P>
        <P>An analysis of the system carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers identified additional problems, including inadequate communication between the RSA, local authorities and authorised test centres to ensure technical standards are applied equally in all locations; limited roadside enforcement by the Garda and infrequent multi-agency enforcement measures; possible conflicts of interest due to reliance on the integrity of the various stakeholders in a context where most test centres are garages that also provide other services such as repairs, sales, road haulage and bus services; poor statistical information on testing and pass rates; and no central database to deal with certificate of road worthiness, CRW, validity and expiry dates.  National vehicle and driver files are not updated with information from the CRW.    Compliance rates are impossible to estimate even though vehicles need a current CRW when applying for motor taxation certificates.  The Bill will address these problems by providing that the testing of commercial vehicles will be done through a network of commercial vehicle roadworthiness test operators authorised to operate test centres, carry out tests and issue pass certificates.  Vehicles which have received pass statements will be issued with certificates of roadworthiness.  CVR vehicles cannot be used in public places without certificates of roadworthiness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 7 of the Bill deals with vehicle certificates.  As with the car NCT, a vehicle roadworthiness disc should be provided.  There is a loophole in the current system.  For example, if a vehicle has to be taxed in January a roadworthiness certificate must be produced.  The test would need to be carried out in December.  An owner would have the vehicle tested in December and produce the documentation in January to have the vehicle taxed for the following year.  Technically that certificate could be submitted again the following December and get the vehicle taxed again.  In other words an owner can nearly get away with a year.  Commercial vehicles should be required to display a disc so that garda&iacute; or enforcement officers would be able to stop vehicles and verify its certificate is up to date immediately because the drivers of most vehicles do not carry it.  I ask the Minister to add this provision to the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister will regulate for the authorisation of CVR test operators.  To be authorised as testers individuals must be suitably qualified and fit and proper persons in the same way as CVR test operators.  The Minister may establish a register of CVR testers which could include details of suspensions and revocations from the register.  The authorisation to operate as a CVR test operator or CVR tester may be suspended or revoked by the Minister in certain circumstances.  This type of regulation is important bearing in mind the documentary programme to which I referred which indicated poor practice for testing cars in some NCT centres.  I very much welcome this modernisation of current practices.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill as part of an overall approach to improving road safety and as part of the process of modernising services and practices.  I wish the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport well in his ongoing work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and agree with much of what has been said by Senators O&rsquo;Sullivan and O&rsquo;Neill.  Road deaths have been reduced from a more than 600 annually and Senator O&rsquo;Neill brought us up to date.  However, 13 fatalities a month is still too many and we need to support the Minister as he attempts to reduce that number.  This is a good time to consider where we should go next.  In 2009 we were 39% more accident prone than the United Kingdom.  Great progress was made under the former Ministers, Martin Cullen and Noel Dempsey.  The report previously referred to as the Road Accident Facts was correctly renamed the Road Collision Facts because we realised they were not accidents but were caused by people.  They indicate the number of fatalities per 1 million vehicles has been reduced from 257 to 97 since 1990, which is a reduction of 62%.</P>
        <P>We are addressing here 17 to 18 fatalities &mdash; typically one per year in buses and the balance in commercial vehicles.  However, it leaves a large part in the safety picture needing to be addressed on which the House should reflect.  There are still 146 fatalities of car drivers and we will need to find a way to improve that statistic.  Some suggestions are made in the report.  There are 40 fatalities among pedestrians, 25 among motor cyclists and seven among pedal cyclists.  Those 42 pedestrians, motor cyclists and pedal cyclists are four times more important in number than the ones we are addressing here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Single vehicle accidents have increased from 30% to 40% of the total according to the Road Collision Facts.  Some 92% of these are caused by drivers.  I will later reflect on how we might address some of that, but it is a much bigger problem than the one we are considering today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Table 17 of Road Collision Facts shows that there was not one case where the vehicle was judged by the Garda to be the primary cause.  Some 92% of accidents were caused by drivers, 5% by pedestrians and 3% by road conditions.  Therefore, while supporting the Minister in what he is doing, I would not expect it to dramatically improve the numbers.  We have a lot of other things to do but I will be supporting him as I did when he introduced new drink driving limits.  In 2009, there were 238 road fatalities and the figure has come down but many matters remain to be addressed.</P>
        <P>References were made to cowboys.  In studying Irish transport, I have found that the incumbents always believe that their competitors are cowboys.  When they go to the Department they tell that to the Minister.  However, one must satisfy one&rsquo;s insurance company and in business customers have to be satisfied.  Aer Lingus did the job successfully for years, saying that any other airline would be a fly-by-night outfit.  In addition, CIE did it, saying that any other bus company would be useless.  Indeed, members of the Irish Road Hauliers Association did it, but the sector was deregulated by Peter Barry and expanded its share of the market to about 72%, with the other 28% being own account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As was pointed out the last time we discussed this issue, rail freight has declined from about one fifth to under 1% now.  This is a good, responsible and professional business and that is noted in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  It said that it depends on trust and professionalism both by vehicle operators and test centres.  They have an acceptable record there.  Some 80% of our road safety problem will still require to be addressed because of the other factors I have mentioned: motorists, motorcyclists and cyclists.  Goods vehicles accounted for 17% of fatalities while buses accounted for 1% out of 238 road deaths in 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am worried about the introduction of risk rating, which is a highly inexact science.  Are we moving towards a system where we will have three verdicts in Irish law: guilty, not guilty and risk rated?  We could be doing serious damage to somebody&rsquo;s bus or truck operation by giving them a high number on risk rating.  I do not have that much confidence in the actuarial professional or whoever will be doing this risk rating.  It seems to be an imposition on us by the EU but we should have discussed it at that level.  We could find ourselves open to large compensation claims by giving somebody the wrong risk rating.  In any field of activity &mdash; including the Minister&rsquo;s own one, the medical profession &mdash; can one, with that degree of precision, attach an anticipation of a result to procedures where there is risk involved?  Would one decline to perform an operation on the basis of risk rating?  People will say they have their records and have not infringed but under risk rating they will have a number attached to them for which there appears to be no right of appeal but which could be seriously damaging.  Perhaps we will discuss that issue tomorrow.  It should be evidence-based, rather than by risk rating.  I will support the Minister in all cases where it is evidence-based.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Trucks and modern buses can cost a few hundred thousand euro to buy; therefore, there is a lot at stake in this.  The Minister may have been told too much about cowboys but the evidence does not support that.  The bulk of road accidents are caused outside the sectors we are dealing with today.  The Minister may care to review what we have said about risk rating.</P>
        <P>I found some sections in the PricewaterhouseCoopers&rsquo; report strange.  On page 17, it awards zero to the present system of enforcement and to management information.  They then compile about five other factors with different weightings.  A bogus scientific methodology has been used.  The system that was rated zero for enforcement carried out 516,000 roadworthiness tests.  The management information system that got a zero rating, reported all of those according to a press statement dated 5 April 2012.  It seems there was enforcement and it was reported and that PricewaterhouseCoopers erred in giving two zeros.  It seems that 94% of operators are satisfied with the system and it is stated in paragraph 171 of the report that it works on the level of trust and professionalism of those involved.  We have built up an exceptionally good independent and State-owned bus business and this is also the case in the road freight business.  The accident rate has been falling dramatically.  It is a case of deciding how to proceed.  The high-risk categories are pedestrians, and solutions could include the use of high visibility jackets, educational programmes for pedestrians, and intelligent vehicles which will be able to stop when an obstruction is detected.  The Minister will meet other transport Ministers from OECD countries in Leipzig.  Ireland has a very high accident rate with more than 92% of accidents occurring on single carriageways.  Perhaps a technology could be designed to keep a vehicle on the correct side of the road.  High visibility jackets are essential for motorcyclists.  There should be speed limits for motorcycles as motorcyclists have a very high propensity for fatal accidents with 25% of motorcyclists more likely to be killed on the road than other road users.  I suggest similar speed limits for pedal cyclists.  A total of 40% of fatalities occur on Sundays and Mondays with the high concentration of fatalities being between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m.  Should the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be on the lookout at those times?  This is the time period when not much bus or freight traffic is on the roads and it is when weekend and drink drivers are on the roads.  I suggest more Garda patrols to deal with this behaviour would have more dramatic effects on the accident statistics.</P>
        <P>I referred on the previous occasion the Minister was in the House to the issue of Border areas and to the high rate of fatalities in Donegal and Cavan.  The 2009 figures confirm that it is more than twice as dangerous to drive in County Louth than in County Carlow.  Some discussion with the PSNI on how to stop the rate of dangerous driving in Border areas would be desirable.  Such driving seems to have moved from the western part of Donegal over to County Louth.  The plastic driving licence is a good idea although it is noted that the Oireachtas asked for the report on which this recommendation was based and it was not forthcoming.  This report should be supplied because the decision is correct and I have advocated the use of the plastic driving licence.  It was not available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and look forward to further discussion on Committee Stage.  This Bill will probably deal with about one fifth of the problem and the task ahead in dealing with the other four fifths of the road safety problem in Ireland will require a further initiative, some of which I have suggested.  I assure the Minister of my support in this regard.  Bringing the figure down to 13 deaths per month is still far too high.  The progress in making Irish roads much safer and bringing the figure down from 600 deaths to under 200 per year must be continued in the interests of everybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for bringing this important legislation before us.  Like previous speakers, I welcome this Bill.  It seems road safety is a theme which is discussed every time the Minister comes to the House and there is always commendable cross-party support which is a delight to behold for a change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is designed to reform the testing system for the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles and to transfer responsibility for the issuing of driving licences from local authorities to the Road Safety Authority.  This will bring a level of consistency and uniformity which may not have been in place heretofore.  The aim of this legislation is to reduce the number of road deaths in Ireland by reducing the number of unsafe commercial vehicles.  As outlined in his contribution and as alluded to by Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, currently commercial vehicles are involved in nearly one fifth, one in five, of all fatal road accidents in Ireland.  This is certainly too high, and any legislation that can reduce this must be welcomed.  I know this legislation is just part of the overall road safety strategy, which aims to reduce road deaths to 60 per million of population or 13 per month, as my colleague Senator Barrett said.  I do not know whether my maths are correct, but that would equate to about 252 road deaths per year.  I take the opportunity to commend the Minister, the Department and the RSA on the continuous reduction we have seen in road deaths.  Last year's figure of 168 was the lowest on record.  As said by others, however, even one person dead on the road is one person too many.  While we can pat ourselves on the back - to an extent - with regard to the figure of 168, I would spare a thought for the many who are seriously injured on the roads, sometimes living the rest of their lives in vegetative states, which is a fate nearly worse than death in some instances.</P>
        
        <P>The report that was commissioned by the RSA and carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers into commercial vehicle roadworthiness, which was published in 2007, highlights some specific areas that this legislation tackles.  The report found that commercial vehicle testing was being provided by 158 independent operators and regulated by 30 bodies.  That makes it virtually impossible for uniform testing of commercial vehicles to be carried out.  Roadside vehicle inspections in 2010 and 2011 found that near enough to half of the vehicles tested had defects.  More worryingly, it was found in these vehicle inspections that almost 40% of commercial vehicles in 2010 and 32% in 2011 had defects that were so serious that they warranted immediate action, including impoundment, repair on-site or a new test.  As the Minister outlined in his address, overall responsibility for commercial vehicle road-testing remains with himself as Minister.  He also said he intended to confer responsibility for monitoring and enforcement of standards on the RSA, which I welcome.  The conferring of those responsibilities on one single authority rather than the local authorities should go some way towards reducing the inconsistencies that may have existed in commercial vehicle testing and increasing the roadworthiness of these vehicles, which will ultimately reduce the number of road accidents involving buses, lorries and so on.  The fact that the Bill introduces powers of enforcement that allow for roadside inspection of commercial vehicles is a welcome step that should further improve standards among commercial vehicles by ensuring continuous compliance.  Improved enforcement of inspections of test centres that carry out the commercial vehicle roadworthiness, CVR, test should also help to improve the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles.</P>
        <P>I note that the reform programme will be financed by the road safety levy, as mentioned by previous speakers, which the Minister said would be collected as part of the test fee.  Apparently he said this morning that the fee would be &euro;45.  I ask the Minister to take into account the rising costs of petrol and diesel when considering whether the fee will be capped at this amount.  Haulage companies are facing massive fuel costs, which are affecting their fleets.  They are having a tough time.  The owner of a haulage company that was featured on a local radio station in Limerick last Wednesday said he had been unable to update his vehicles in recent months because of the prohibitive cost of fuel.  He did not seem to have the money to get his fleet up to scratch.</P>
        <P>The Bill also refers to driving licences.  Under the EU driver licensing directive 2006/126/EC, all member states are required to introduce plastic card driver licences.  This is something that was welcomed the last time the Minister was in the House.  Based on the external review that was carried out into the issuing of licences, it makes sense that one organisation be given responsibility for issuing licences.</P>
        <P>Given that the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for theory tests and driver testing it is a natural progression that it would issue driver licences.  As stated by other speakers, when it comes to one body taking control of a function exercised by local authorities there can be a mess as happened with the issuing of medical cards.  I ask those concerned to bear that in mind and ensure the authority is sufficiently staffed.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and bringing his unification skills with him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like a number of his colleagues, the Minister is a regular and welcome visitor to the House.  When important legislation is introduced in the House I hope that will be a continuing feature of his mandate.  When legislation comes before the House initially it is an opportunity for reasoned debate in a less adversarial atmosphere than the other House and allows the Government to tease out possible flaws that could be improved.  I am stating the obvious but, as my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan has indicated, we welcome the overall thrust of the Bill.  There are some who would say, we would, considering that the base and the bones of the legislation were initiated under the previous Government following the review, the recommendations of which were accepted by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, the former Minister Noel Dempsey.  In that context there are a number of issues, some of which have been raised, which will continue to be raised in the debate.</P>
        <P>An issue I wish to focus on is the centralisation of the driver licence system.  One of the main recommendations of the review committee was that the system should be centralised primarily because it would introduce greater efficiency into the service.  I would argue that the recommendations came at a different time.  Perhaps the amount of largesse floating around the economy at the time may not necessarily have focused local authorities on introducing the type of efficiencies that have been introduced as a result of the recession; in other words, I suggest local authorities are lean bodies because they have had no choice as the central block funding has been reduced and its revenue raising powers are limited.  Depending on the local authority with which one is involved, there have been significant reductions in staff numbers, reallocation of duties and greater efficiencies have had to be introduced.  Since the drawing up of the report and acceptance of the recommendations go back to 2007, I argue that five years on we are in a different world.  For that reason I do not agree that greater efficiencies will be introduced to the system by centralising the driver licence system.  The Minister will be aware that IMPACT which represents many of those involved has referred to staff issues and the loss of functions in local authorities.  I am grateful to the Library and Research Service for proving the information.  It makes the point that this proposal goes against a recent OECD report on the public service in Ireland which argued that local authorities should be used more frequently in the delivery of public services.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the Oireachtas Library and Research service for providing this information:</P>
        <P LI="1">This proposal goes against a recent OECD report on the public service in Ireland which argued that local authorities should be used more frequently in the delivery of public services.  The current service also enjoys a very high rate of customer satisfaction.  This proposal runs a very serious risk of further eroding local services in the wake of ill-considered decisions about public bin collections and concerns about the future control of water services.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In responding to a parliamentary question on the possible role of An Post, the Minister in reply referred to the fact that the work involved, that is, centralisation, would involve three main aspects, namely, card production, front office engagement with the customer and back office processing of applications, and stated that all three functions would be operated under contract.  This begs the question, &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, why fix it?&rdquo;  Is the Minister sufficiently confident that the centralisation of this service will result in the type of efficiencies that might have been envisaged five or six years ago when the report provided the detail it did, in light of all that has happened since?  I leave that question hanging because essentially we have been presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> and the Minister will go ahead with it in any case.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">It also begs another question.  The Minister&rsquo;s Cabinet colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who, like the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is a very regular and welcome visitor to this House, has repeatedly assured the House that in the overall structure of local government reform he will ensure there will be an enhanced role for local authorities which will be given greater power, not less, and that many of the revenue raising initiatives that were part and parcel of the rates system which was essentially the bedrock of the local authority system&rsquo;s revenue collection environment and which Fianna F&aacute;il abolished.  There is no question about that although at the time &mdash; I do not want to go back on old history &mdash; the manifestos from Fine Gael and, I believe, the Labour Party, stated they would introduce a 50% demolition followed by full abolition.  There was a climate of abolition at the time, rather than one of looking for alternatives.  However, we are where we are, according to that awful phrase and now this Government is attempting to roll back that 40-year history, on which I compliment it.  That is the reason I focus so much on this question of local democracy.  I do not know how it will work out in practice but we must wait and see.</P>
        <P>There are two other issues I wish to raise.  The test centres will go to contract and it is stated that during a transition period of two years the existing test centres will continue to operate, after which there will be some new form of overview or monitoring of the new tendered centres.  One assumes the existing test centres will be allowed to tender under the new regime and the chances are that in large part those that operate under the present regime will probably remain.  There is a positive there in that if there were to be a significant change there might be potential job losses.  I am sure the Minister will reassure the House that he does not anticipate there will be many, or any, job losses in the test centres.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The final point I wish to raise with the Minister relates to the driving licence issue.  There is reference in the Bill to drivers aged over 70 years who require a fitness certificate from a doctor and who can apply for three-year licences.  The Minister may have read in recent media reports &mdash; one case in particular was mentioned in the letters to the editor page of either <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i> &mdash; that certain insurance companies are refusing to provide car insurance for drivers over 70 in spite of the fact that they have a fitness to drive certificate from their doctor.  I do not know whether this issue has come across the Minister&rsquo;s desk.  If it is only anecdotal, that is fine, but might there be there some kind of trend because of consolidation of the entire insurance industry and the reduction of risk?  The question raised by the letter writer was to the effect that surely there was a far greater risk in the case of a younger person and that is the reason insurance is heavily weighted against younger people.  This individual stated he had more than 40 years&rsquo; driving experience free of any injury or accident, is operating on a full loading of his no claims bonus and yet has been turned down for insurance.  I am sure there are many like him.  I raise this in the wider context that it may be something the Minister&rsquo;s Department would look at to see if this practice is widespread within the insurance industry.  Are companies effectively refusing to cover drivers over 70 years of age who can provide a fitness to drive certificate from their local GP, as required by law?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overall, I reiterate that we welcome the broad thrust of the Bill and wish the Minister continued success in his areas of responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte ar ais a chur roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Seanad.  The second major provision in the Bill concerns the introduction of a new centralised system for the issuing of driving licences.  The current system is cumbersome and multi-layered and involves local authorities in the processing of applications and delivering licences, although the budget is under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s Department has responsibility for policy oversight and the driver licence database, while operational oversight at national level and certain elements of policy guidance rests with the Road Safety Authority.  The EU licensing directive of 2006 requires all member states to introduce a plastic card driver licence in January 2013.  This is an opportunity for modernisation of our current system for reasons of efficiency and security.  A cohesive approach to these matters across the European Union is necessary to give the fullest effect to the free movement of goods and people.  Under the Bill there will be a new centralised model for dealing with all aspects of the plastic driver licence.  The Road Safety Authority already holds responsibility for the driver theory test and for driver testing.  It will now deal also with the licence processing and production and will provide the customer with a one-stop shop approach to driver licensing.  I welcome this move to modernise and streamline our licensing system.  As well as benefiting the drivers of commercial vehicles, the new licensing measures will help ordinary members of the public, in particular those who require their Irish licences in renting cars abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has been estimated that 208 full-time equivalent staff in motor taxation departments are involved in dealing with driver licences across the country.  I understand processing with the centralised model will have implications for staff numbers and the new arrangement will require considerably fewer staff to operate it.  On the face of it, therefore, a significant number of staff in local authorities will be available for redeployment within the system when the necessary numbers transfer to the centralised model.  I should state I have been approached by the IMPACT trade union which is concerned about the reduction of staff at local authority levels.  Staff members of my local authority in County Louth have approached me to ask if there will be any staff reduction.</P>
        <P>A person will receive a unique identifier when applying for a theory test which will follow him or her through all aspects of the licensing process.  This idea is to be applauded and is welcome.  An application for a learner driver permit will be made through a front office network of agents who will carry out some basic checks on the application and supporting documents before forwarding them to the central processing unit.  This unit will be set up to process applications and deal with day-to-day customer service queries.</P>
        <P>I am a believer.  Each one of us has a part to play in reducing the number of fatal and serious accidents on roads throughout the country.  We must all examine our consciences and mend our ways.  I recall a recent visit to the United States where I noted that stop and yield signs are adhered to strictly.  Over seven or eight days I stopped at the same signs even though it was clearly visible there was nobody coming from any side, north, south, east or west.  Nevertheless, all vehicles came to a stop.  As citizens and drivers, we must mend our ways, drive within the limits and read signs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand the licence fee will meet the operating cost of the service.  Perhaps the Minister will say a few words on this point.  I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister on his achievements to date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I start on a positive note because while road safety is a political and policy issue, it is not a party political one.  The penalty points structure started under the previous Administration and a genuine effort was made under previous Governments to ensure road safety received the priority it needed to reach the relatively good position we are in.  My colleague, Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill, outlined in detail what has been achieved.  I commend the Minister for following on strongly and diligently bringing forward a series of measures, including this necessary Bill.  As a result of a report, consultants were hired by the Road Safety Authority and made certain recommendations.  Too often, we have seen consultants hired at great expense and recommendations made in our political system.  Often, the recommendations are not implemented but, in this case, it is being done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge that much of this is as a result of guidelines from the European Union.  We need a greater pan-European approach to road safety.  We must ensure that what is good in Ireland also applies abroad.  When people come from abroad, the set of standards implemented here and respected by road users must also be respected by those who visit.  Visitors to a country must abide by the country&rsquo;s rules and when we go abroad, as good citizens we abide by the rules, as described by Senator Brennan with regard to stop signs in the USA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When it comes to road safety, one can never over-regulate.  The commercial roadworthiness system proposed in this Bill is appropriate.  The streamlining of services under the auspices of the Road Safety Authority is appropriate and will save money.  It abides by the terms of the Croke Park agreement, where redeployment is required.  It is proper and appropriate that the licensing systems come under one body, as opposed to a myriad of councils and local authorities.  We must introduce the necessary regulations to ensure our roads are the safest in the world, not just in Europe.  This legislation is a step in the right direction but many more must be taken as the Minister identifies other high-risk areas.  In the lifetime of this and subsequent Governments, the Minister will come to the House with proposals to make our roads safer.  If legislation saves one life, it has done a good job.</P>
        <P>It is noticeable in recent months that automated speed cameras, located where there are no Garda personnel, have an effect.  I can see it in County Clare, where speeding has evaporated in certain areas.  People are consciously slowing down because they know cameras are more likely to be there.  Prevention is better than cure and the more speed cameras rolled out in dangerous areas, the better.  This move must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Streamlining licences is correct and should be done under the auspices of the Road Safety Authority because that means everything is being done to ensure our citizens are safe on the road.  I agree with previous speakers who pointed out that every citizen has responsibility for road safety, including pedestrians.  When it comes to road safety, everyone with a brain has responsibility.  We should have compulsory road safety education in secondary schools and compulsory driving lessons as part of the transition year curriculum.  This may be happening already but, if not, it should happen.  The necessary structures should be put in place to ensure it happens.  Interdepartmental groups should be set up between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Each driving lesson will have an effect on every teenager.  We need to change the culture among young people and the best way is through the schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are many worthwhile suggestions and the Minister has access to the expertise in his Department and in the Road Safety Authority to decide which suggestions are realistic and will achieve results.  That is why he is the Minister and makes recommendations to us.  I commend the Bill to the House as part of a myriad of effects.  Each element is as important as the next to ensure cultural and behavioural changes and, ultimately, to save lives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their constructive remarks.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan alluded to the progress made in making Ireland a much safer place in which to be a driver, pedestrian or cyclist.  The year 2011 was the safest year on Irish roads and, so far, 2012 is safer again.  This makes us the fifth safest country in Europe but there remains quite a gap between where we are and the best two or three countries.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to the former Minister, Noel Dempsey, and I am happy to be building on the work he did.  The previous Government received opprobrium for making many mistakes but it also did many good things and transport, and particularly road safety, was one of the areas in which progress was made.  I was pleased that Noel Dempsey attended the road safety conference on Monday morning and is still taking in interest in the area.  There has also been an all-party approach and we would not have made the progress without the co-operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the RSA, local authorities, the NRA, the campaign groups that helped to build public support for these measures and the officials of the Department, in particular, who are dedicated to this cause.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Brennan and Mooney, among others, referred to the power of local authorities.  When it comes to licences, local authorities have no power and fulfil an administrative function.  Under the new system, we will be able to reduce the number of people producing licences from 200 to 60 and move a loss-making arrangement, which costs local authorities money, to one that will be slightly profitable for the RSA.  It would not be practical to do this at a local level because we are moving to a plastic card licence.  It is one thing to have 30 laminating machines around the country but another to produce credit card type licences in 30 locations.  Even if we wanted to, it is not practical to keep it at local authority level.  That is not to say that what is happening here is the same as what happened with medical cards.  It is quite different because there must still be a front of office service.  I anticipate local authorities will continue to do this for quite a period of time until it goes to tender.  There are a number of options when it does go to tender: local authorities could continue to provide front of house service; An Post could do it if it wished to tender for it and I encourage it to do so; the Department of Social Protection may want to do it; or it could be done in the NCT test centres or driver test centres.  The old era of producing a small photograph obtained from a booth outside Tesco is ending and in the coming years we will all have a standard official photograph to be used on social welfare cards and driver licences.  This change will occur but it is something for the Minister for Social Protection to develop.</P>
        <P>With regard to CVR, the staff have already transferred to the RSA.  Senators mentioned approaches from IMPACT.  As this relates to local authority staff this engagement is not happening with me or the RSA, it is with county managers and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government because they are the employers.  Staff members are dealt with under the Croke Park agreement so there is no question of compulsory redundancies.  In some cases there will be redeployment to the RSA, in particular in the north west.  In other cases staff can be redeployed to other council activities which I consider to be a good development.  As Senator Mooney pointed out, the number of staff in local authorities has reduced dramatically, more so than in most parts of the public sector.  Local authorities are down almost one third in some cases and things are getting very tight.  The fact we can now redeploy up to 140 people from laminating and processing licences to other council activities can be seen as a positive step.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan asked whether CVR inspectors would be allowed to stop traffic. They will not.  Only garda&iacute; are allowed to stop traffic.  We considered it but we thought it would be quite a big move to allow people who are not garda&iacute; to stop traffic.  Concerns were raised about their safety as they are not trained garda&iacute; and with regard to public confidence.  The public will accept being flagged down and stopped by garda&iacute; but I am not sure whether members of the public would accept this power being given to other officials.  It is not in the Bill but it was considered.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not apply only to own account operators; it applies to all HGVs and trailers both own account and hire and reward.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Neill raised the idea of requiring people to display their certificate of roadworthiness testing on the windscreen.  It is a good idea and the Department will consider it and revert to the Senator when we have done so.  It is currently a big sheet and would have to be reduced in size to a square shape.  Perhaps it is possible to do so.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett stated the measures we are introducing will not dramatically decrease the number of deaths on the roads.  He is correct.  It accounts for less than one fifth of the problem.  However, it will make less likely major tragic incidents such as the Kentstown bus crash.  The Bill originated with that crash.  Even though they may not show up in annual statistics because thankfully such incidents do not occur every year, they do happen every couple of years.  It would be very good to have fewer such tragedies.  Other measures are also planned.  New penalty points offences will be activated later in the year and we are considering increasing the number of penalty points for those areas of behaviour which are most dangerous, such as speeding and driving while using a mobile phone, and decreasing them for behaviour which is not so dangerous.  One receives five points for not having an NCT and only two for driving at a ridiculous speed or overtaking dangerously.  This review is ongoing and the report will go to committee quite soon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Towards the end of the year I hope to publish legislation to introduce preliminary roadside testing for people who may be under the influence of drugs.  This legislation is advanced and we should be able to do so by the end of the year.  I also intend to introduce the graduated penalty points system for younger drivers.  Senators may have heard at the conference on Monday that we have begun to think about the next road safety strategy which will run from 2013 to 2020 and the type of new measures that could be introduced.  These will involve such issues as driver education for repeat offenders and fitting on certain cars alcolocks and devices which can monitor speed and how cars turn a corner.  This would be with regard to repeat offenders.  In some cases driver education may be offered as an alternative to penalty points.  All of these measures are under consideration.</P>
        <P>Senator Conway mentioned schools.  Road safety officers visit schools and do a very good job.  Together with the Department of Education and Skills we will probably be able to get across the line a special road safety module in the new junior certificate.  The new junior certificate syllabus will contain a number of core subjects and a number of optional 100-hour modules among which we propose to include road safety.  I believe it would be very popular and would be taken up by junior certificate students, particularly if they could do the theory test as part of it.  It is something the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and I are very much in favour.</P>
        <P>I share Senator Barrett&rsquo;s concerns with regard to risk rating or profiling.  It is like being profiled going through an airport.  One might be stopped a little more often because one looks a little darker than the next person.  It always occurs to people who may potentially be profiled in various circumstances.  However, there is good evidence that it makes sense to concentrate enforcement efforts on those most likely to be rogue operators rather than interrupting the business of those least likely to offend.  However, I share the Senator&rsquo;s concerns and I agree that whatever system is used it must be evidence-based.  There can be a degree of dodgy science in some of this.</P>
        <P>Senator Heffernan mentioned the phenomenal pressure of fuel costs on hauliers.  The industry is really struggling because of high fuel costs and other high costs.  The road safety levy will be &euro;45.  It is not capped in the legislation but I do not propose to increase it in the initial years.  I will see how the system works without increasing it.  The Senator summarised the Bill as bringing consistency and uniformity to commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing, and this is absolutely right and summarises it very well.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney mentioned the test centres.  The existing test centres will continue to operate for two years after which they can apply, but obviously they will have to be up to scratch.  They will have a two-year period in which to get up to scratch.</P>
        <P>I do not know about the issue of drivers aged over 70 not getting insurance.  It has not come across my desk.  Insurance falls as much in the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as mine but I believe there is a mechanism by which the industry collectively must offer insurance to people who are refused.  Perhaps I am wrong but I can check up on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take the opportunity to thank Senators for considering the issues contained in the Bill.  I am very encouraged by the responses I have heard today.  I am always appreciative of the contribution made to legislation by the Seanad.  I look forward to debating the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage tomorrow.</P>

	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
        <P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann recalls the Seanad debate on the Independent Group (Taoiseach&rsquo;s Nominees) Senators&rsquo; motion &lsquo;Criminalising the purchase of sex in Ireland to curb prostitution and trafficking&rsquo; on 12 October 2011 and:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> repeats its recognition that the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation is a modern form of slavery and a form of human rights abuse;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> recognises that prostitution and trafficking cause incalculable harm and acute distress to untold numbers of women and children; and that the trafficking of children for the purposes of prostitution is especially abhorrent;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> recalls that the motion, as adopted on 12 October 2011, agrees that &lsquo;prior to the Government making a definitive decision on whether legislation should be enacted reflecting legislation in Sweden and Norway there should be a considered public debate&rsquo;; and the six month timeframe given to the House by Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch TD within which the Government would establish this public consultation process;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> notes that the six month timeframe has elapsed and that the public consultation process has not commenced;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> reiterates the call of the Independent Group (Taoiseach&rsquo;s Nominees) for the Government to develop effective and appropriate responses to deal with prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation, and introduce legislation criminalising the purchase of sex in Ireland in order to curb prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.</P>
        <P LI="1">Considers that it is possible to draft appropriate legislation, with the advice of the Attorney General, criminalising the purchase of a sexual service by way of prostitution; and notes that some options in this regard have already been explored in independent legal opinions (Immigrant Council of Ireland).</P>
        <P LI="1">Calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to uphold the Government&rsquo;s commitment to commence a public consultation process with a view to assisting the Government in making a definitive decision on whether legislation should be enacted reflecting relevant legislation in Sweden and Norway, and in particular calls on the Minister to:</P>
        <P LI="2">1. publish before the end of May 2012 clearly defined Terms of Reference for the consultation process to consider criminalising the purchase of sex in Ireland;</P>
        <P LI="2">2. provide that the public consultation process should conclude before the end of October 2012;</P>
        <P LI="2">3. undertake to publish the Report arising from the public consultation process before the end of December 2012; and</P>
        <P LI="2" Just="Left">4. return to this House to debate the outcome of the public consultation process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister will be aware that the Independent Group of Senators previously submitted a Private Members&rsquo; motion calling for the criminalisation of the purchase of sex to curb prostitution and trafficking and that it was accepted at the time of that debate that a public consultation would take place and would commence within six months.  When as the end of 2011 approached there was still no announcement in regard to the consultation process, I respectfully wrote to the Minister asking when it might commence and he replied that the consultation document was near completion and would be published soon after.  In February this year, following the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary &ldquo;Profiting from Prostitution&rdquo;, Senator Power and I raised the issue as a matter on the Adjournment but still no announcement was forthcoming.  April 11 then passed, six months since the promise and still there was no word.</P>
        <P>It is, therefore, with a sense of disappointment that we propose the motion before the House.  I do so to restate our commitment and sense of urgency to the issue before us, namely, that our laws on prostitution and human trafficking need to be changed.  On each day of the six months that have passed more than 1,000 women and girls were made available for paid sex in Ireland.  Irish research, conducted by the Immigrant Council of Ireland, has explored the intersection of migration, prostitution and sex trafficking.  Some 97% of the women involved in prostitution in Ireland are migrant women.  The facts are that traffickers and recruiters use sophisticated methods of persuasion, enticement and deception, often exploiting women&rsquo;s situations of vulnerability, including their need to migrate here from situations of extreme poverty, to seek sustainable livelihood&rsquo;s elsewhere.  Many of these women endure forced travel, rape, physical and psychological coercion, captivity and the withholding of passports and money.  They are then made available for purchase through the Internet.  Repeated audits of the Internet have shown that their number has not declined.</P>
        <P>I am somewhat heartened to note that the Government&rsquo;s amendment acknowledges the estimates given regarding the extent of trafficking and organised prostitution in Ireland although I submit that much of it reads as though the <i>status quo</i> of protection is working, when clearly it is not.  Public debate has taken place over the past six months in the absence of a consultation document.  Part of this debate was in the form of two harrowing documentaries which confirm the findings of the Immigrant Council of Ireland&rsquo;s research and enhanced our understanding of the organised nature of prostitution and its link with organised crime.  The RTE documentary, &ldquo;Profiting from Prostitution&rdquo;, was based on six months of surveillance and exposed the control exerted over women by pimps and the structure of an organised brothel network in Ireland.  Both reports exposed the chilling reality for hundreds of women who are moved from town to town on a regular basis in order to meet the demands of purchasers.  The documentaries &mdash; we heard about this again afternoon &mdash; dispelled the myth that these women work independently when in fact they are threatened, coerced and enslaved by pimps.  The documentaries also show that criminalising the women involved is ineffective and does nothing to dismantle the sophisticated infrastructure of the pimps who remain untouched.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister will be aware that Ireland has a number of international obligations in the context of human trafficking, each of which recognises that measures to deter demand for prostitution represent an efficient approach to reducing sex trafficking.  Countries are obliged to introduce legislation to discourage demand.  It was pointed out during the previous debate that the Criminal Justice (Human Trafficking) Act fulfils our international obligations, as noted in the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  However, I respectfully suggest that while obligations have been met technically they have not been met effectively.  The Criminal Justice (Human Trafficking) Act criminalised trafficking in adults or children for the purpose of sexual exploitation and made it an offence to knowingly buy sex from someone who had been trafficked.  The Minister will be aware that only a negligible number of convictions have been secured against traffickers under this Act.  There have in fact been only two convictions, both of which were in respect of the trafficking of a minor.  There is significant difficulty in defining a person as a victim of trafficking under the Act.  It appears that such definition depends on the crime having been proven.  As such, we have a chicken and egg type scenario while other jurisdictions have more sophisticated methods of victim identification.  In essence, the two minors are considered the only victims of trafficking in Ireland, yet statistics from the Minister&rsquo;s Department indicate that more than 200 people have been identified as potential victims of human trafficking.</P>
        <P>It must be noted that no one has been convicted of purchasing sex from a trafficked person.  The Act provides that the purchaser of sex can use the defence that he did not know that the person from whom he was purchasing sex had been trafficked.  Clearly then the legislation does not deal adequately with the crime of trafficking, protect trafficked people or tackle the demand for prostitution.  The demand to purchase human beings is what we must address.  Prostitution is a market-led industry.  If the demand side is suppressed, then the supply side will dwindle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge also the Government&rsquo;s noting of the report of the advisory group on HIV in sex work.  We look forward to commenting on this in detail during the consultation process.  For now, I will simply say that this report is most relevant to developing countries with extremely high levels of HIV transmission, of which Ireland is not one.  The health and welfare of people involved in prostitution are of paramount concern.  There is no reason health strategies, in the form of a harm reduction model as well as a harm elimination model, cannot be pursued in tandem, as in the case of Sweden.  The Minister knows that while the Government will ultimately have to make a decision, which must be informed by solid evidence, it will still need to make an ethical and legal choice based on the diverse views presented.  That decision will also have to be in reference to an Irish context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motion also refers to the progressive legislation introduced in Norway and Sweden on this issue.  The Nordic Gender Institute has identified a halving of the number of sex buyers since the purchase of sex was criminalised in Sweden ten years ago.  It has also indicated a reduction in organised crime in general.  Why and how have these laws proven so effective in Sweden?  The Swedish law works as a deterrent to the purchasing of sex.  It seeks to change the behaviour of the offender and other potential offenders by way of penalties and, therefore, the increased chance of prosecution.  A fine rather than a criminal conviction faces a first time offender under Swedish law.  Purchasers of sex rarely have a criminal profile and are often married or in relationships.  Given the profile of the purchaser, the stigma attached to receiving a fine or a notice to their residence acts as an effective deterrent.  The introduction of such a law here in Ireland would reflect the belief that it is unacceptable to purchase another human being and that as a society we will not acquiesce when there is sexual exploitation in our towns and cities.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of members of the Turn off the Red Light Coalition.  The Minister may be aware that that coalition has obtained legal opinions on the creation of an offence to obtain a sexual service by way of prostitution.  These opinions contain strong legal arguments that there is no legal impediment to the creation of such an offence.  Again, we look forward to sharing the detail of these arguments with the Minister during the course of the consultation process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Independent Senators who tabled this motion do not consider prostitution and human trafficking to be a peripheral issue nor a matter that warrants delay and postponement.  This is a grave issue which some countries have demonstrated can be addressed by law in a way that is effective and can reduce human rights abuses.  We have evidence that societies that have enacted a law that criminalises the purchase of sex are healthier and less violent places for all people and, most especially, for women and children.  In an Irish context, it is alarmingly clear from recent television documentaries and Irish scholarly research that this land is a place wherein Irish and migrant women and children, some men and boys, are caught in an horrific web of abuse of human rights and restrictions on human freedom.  There was a common understanding, given our interpretation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment in October, that Government consultation would have commenced in the past six months.  Instead, during that spell of silence from the Government, it has been revealed by stark imagery the kind of abuse in this area that is happening throughout our land.</P>
        <P>It is good to hear now that the Minister is again committing himself to publishing the consultation document shortly.  Time has been lost, however.  We are on our feet today because, as Members of the Oireachtas, we feel a depth of responsibility for ensuring this matter is advanced and no further delay happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am seconding this motion.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  His presence is an acknowledgment of the seriousness and commitment he brings to the substantive issue covered in the motion before the House.  Just over six months have passed since we debated the possibility of criminalising the purchase of sex.  We suggested that such a measure could and would halt the pernicious and degrading crime of human trafficking.  Ireland has been the poster boy of Europe in many areas in the past.  There is a strong likelihood that the level of acceptance of prostitution in Ireland will make us the poster boy for a degrading and sordid side of society.  It would be easy for me to repeat what I said during last October&rsquo;s debate on this issue.  However, that would be insulting to the many women who are illegally held captive in our republic.  We owe it to them to bear witness.  We need to build on our deeper and ever-increasing understanding of prostitution in Ireland.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">During last October&rsquo;s debate, we were promised by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that a planned consultation process would be in place &ldquo;within six months&rdquo;.  Nothing has happened since, other than the broadcasting of two worthy and important documentaries on television.  An RTE documentary, &ldquo;Profiting from Prostitution&rdquo;, showed what one man &mdash; Paul Maguire &mdash; and a small team of filmmakers could achieve with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  They highlighted and prevented heinous crimes from being committed against women in Ireland.  The documentary exposed that prostitution is not just a matter of escort agencies and individual call girls working on their own &mdash; it is a massive, sophisticated, military-style operation that is organised by an organised crime syndicate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We know that resources are one element of the solution.  I understand that just 1.5 staff members in the Garda National Immigration Bureau are dealing with this issue.  That is meagre when compared to the scale of the problem.  As Senator Zappone said, an average of 1,000 people are offered for sex each day through the Internet.  Up to 97% of them are migrant women and, worryingly, some of them are children.  Paul Maguire outlined some shocking statistics and facts.  He mentioned that 76 of these women are under the age of 26.  The level and scale of the movement of these victims is also alarming.  An average of 330 of them are moved from city to city or town to town each week.  We are moving towards a gradual acceptance and tolerance of prostitution in Ireland.  If the Seanad does nothing else in this term other than to assist the Minister in arguing for and supporting his goal of eradicating the growth in human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation in Ireland, Senators will be able to stand proud.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One in 15 men in Ireland purchases sex.  The men in question tend to be high earning professionals.  It has been reported that over 60% of them are married or in committed relationships.  I said during last October&rsquo;s debate that I am a classic example of such a person, in so far as I am married with children.  I said I was the classic punter, so to speak.  Having said that, we were told by Paul Maguire this afternoon that there was no particular demographic.  Men as young as 19 are involved in this activity.  Mr. Maguire mentioned the case of an older man who walked in with his Zimmer frame to purchase sex from a woman.  Such cases can be found everywhere in Ireland.  In 2011, the Criminal Assets Bureau indicated that the sex industry is worth approximately &euro;250 million per annum.  It reported that the average price for sex in Ireland is approximately &euro;150 for half an hour.  Paul Maguire of RTE has worked out that a pimp is earning at least &euro;100,000 a week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some people argue that prostitution is a harmless commercial transaction between consenting adults and that we should respect the choices of those who willingly choose to become involved in prostitution.  This is just not true.  It is fair to point out that in the context of an expanded prostitution business, the old concept of consenting adults, which is embedded in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, has disappeared and dissolved as a result of the commercialisation of indoor prostitution activity, the normalisation of the act and the commodification of the prostituted person.  Women who are involved in prostitution suffer severe physical and emotional harm as a result of having to provide sex for multiple buyers on a daily basis.  The Minister is well aware that they are vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, violent attacks and the threat of violence.  They often live under the control of those who run prostitution agencies.  They do not know to whom they are expected to provide sex or what might be demanded from them at any moment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was suggested at this afternoon&rsquo;s briefing with Paul Maguire and Monica O&rsquo;Connor that prostitution had become like a takeaway.  There are many pages on the Internet setting out what one might order, or what one might want.  It can be delivered to one within ten or 15 minutes.  Women who are involved in prostitution live lives that are full of fear of violence and anxiety about health and safety.  They move from apartment to apartment and from town to town &mdash; from Christchurch to Ennis to Cavan to Galway to Dundalk.  These are facts.  The Government amendment rather patronisingly recognises &ldquo;the difficulties inherent in reliably estimating the extent of trafficking and organised prostitution&rdquo; and notes &ldquo;the various estimates that have been made in that regard&rdquo;.  We know the facts.  At this stage we need to move beyond them.</P>
        <P>I contend that we know the extent and the scale of this problem.  Now is the time for action.  There is a sufficient body of knowledge, backed up by some indepth research from Ireland, on the issues pertaining to prostitution and sex trafficking.  My colleague, Senator Zappone, outlined some of that evidence.  The Government must recognise the need for a modern approach to prostitution that reflects best international practice.  A central part of this approach must involve tackling the demand for paid sex.  I believe the Minister is serious about this.  It can be achieved by penalising the purchase of sex, along the lines of the Swedish legislation that has been demonstrated to work.  The Government should follow this approach and close the loophole in the existing laws.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last October, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, reminded us of the two main aims of the Irish approach to prostitution, as set out in legislation in 1993.  She said that the first aim was to protect the public &ldquo;from the more intrusive aspects&rdquo; of prostitution.  On-street solicitation was criminalised for that reason.  The second aim is to protect people who sell sex.  It is clear that when the 1993 law was coined, the lawmakers did not have thousands of foreign nationals, most of whom lack proper authorisation to be in the country, in mind.  Therefore, this aspect of what was intended when this legal measure was introduced in the 1990s is no longer relevant under the present circumstances.</P>
        <P>We ask the Minister to clarify his plans with regard to his commitment to develop effective and appropriate responses to deal with prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation in Ireland.  We would like him to offer a time commitment to us in the Seanad this evening.  He should also set out how he might approach this matter, as the Government amendment is confusing in this regard.  The bullet points in the amendment mention &ldquo;a planned public consultation exercise&rdquo;, &ldquo;a detailed discussion document&rdquo;, &ldquo;the consultation process&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Minister&rsquo;s intention to publish a discussion document&rdquo; and &ldquo;the current review&rdquo;.  We would like clarity on those matters.  The most simple thing we are requesting is a committed timeframe for the public consultation process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &lsquo;&lsquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;&rsquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P FLI="0">&ldquo;&mdash;deplores the trafficking of persons, and in particular the trafficking of children, for sexual exploitation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> acknowledges that the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government are determined to ensure that everything that can possibly be done to combat prostitution and human trafficking will be done;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes the extensive package of legislative, administrative and other measures undertaken in recent years to prevent trafficking in human beings, protect victims and prosecute offenders;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> further notes that Ireland&rsquo;s legislation on human trafficking for sexual exploitation complies with the EU Council Framework Decision on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, Council of Europe and other international instruments and that the penalties in this jurisdiction for human trafficking are severe;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes the conclusions of the December 2011 Report of the United Nations AIDS Advisory Group on HIV and Sex Work, which recommends that States remove criminal penalties for the purchase and sale of sex to establish legal and policy environments conducive to universal access to HIV services for sex workers;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 it is an offence to knowingly solicit a trafficked person in any place, public or private, for the purpose of prostitution;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to organise prostitution, knowingly live off the earnings of prostitution, or keep or manage a brothel;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that under the 1993 Act, as amended, any person who solicits or importunes a child, whether or not for the purposes of prostitution, to commit an act which would constitute carnal knowledge or sexual assault, is guilty of an offence, and that a person who engages in a sexual act with the child could be charged with serious sexual offences;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> while recognising the difficulties inherent in reliably estimating the extent of trafficking and organised prostitution, notes the various estimates that have been made in that regard;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> acknowledges the concerted efforts, including targeted operations, which have been made, and which will continue to be made, by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to vigorously investigate and prosecute alleged human traffickers;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that because of the possible involvement of criminal gangs in human trafficking, such Garda operations can be supported by specialist assistance provided by units such as the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> in supporting all reasonable and effective measures to curb prostitution, recognises that any proposal to criminalise the purchase of sexual services within our legal and constitutional framework raises complex issues and requires very careful examination;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> acknowledges that there are differing and genuinely held views on the appropriate legislative response to prostitution;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that on 17 October last, in order to inform public debate on this matter, the Minister for Justice and Equality published his Department&rsquo;s report on Sweden&rsquo;s legislation to combat prostitution and human trafficking;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> acknowledges the Minister&rsquo;s announcement, on the same date, of a planned public consultation exercise to help inform the future direction of legislation on prostitution, thus ensuring that public debate on this sensitive issue is open to the widest possible audience;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that a detailed discussion document to facilitate the planned consultation process is expected to be published shortly and that the Minister will make an announcement at that stage regarding the arrangements and time frame for making submissions;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> agrees that a report of the outcome of the consultation process should be published;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that legislative measures taken in other jurisdictions, including the &lsquo;Swedish model&rsquo;, should and will be examined in the context of the current review of prostitution legislation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s intention to publish a discussion document on the future direction of prostitution legislation before the end of May and looks forward to the outcome of the consultation process;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> further notes that when the current review, including the consultation process is concluded, the Minister will bring any legislative proposals to Government in the usual way.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House again.  As those who proposed the motion said, we previously contemplated this matter on 12 October last.  I recall that at the end of that debate, there was a general level of satisfaction when it appeared to be the political position that certain political progress would be made in the months to come.  It was suggested that the Minister would report back to us and it was hoped that he would be in a position to announce some changes.  I recall that one of the Independent Senators &mdash; perhaps it was Senator van Turnhout &mdash; warned us that unless we kept strictly to that six-month deadline, a further motion would be brought before this House.  This motion has been proposed now that the six-month timeframe has elapsed by a week or so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a woman of my word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Senator has certainly kept her political promise.  Here we are again this evening.  The amendment I have moved on behalf of the Government is expansive and thorough.  If it is acted upon, it will bring a satisfactory solution to this issue.  I wish to focus on a part of it that was referred to briefly by Senator Zappone.  It is probably the most substantial change to the background to last October&rsquo;s debate, in the context of where we are this afternoon.  I refer to the report of the UNAIDS Advisory Group on HIV and Sex Work, which was published in December 2011, subsequent to the debate I have mentioned.  When documents are presented before us, we sometimes wish they had not been.  We might prefer to ignore them because they raise uncomfortable and inconvenient truths.  In the context of the subject we are now discussing &mdash; the issue of prostitution &mdash; it appears that the UN is advising that states should consider the removal of criminal penalties relating to the purchase and sale of sex and instead establish legal and policy environments that are conducive to universal access to HIV services for sex workers.  Senator Zappone has correctly pointed out that this would certainly apply to some of the Third World and developing countries.  Can we say with certainty it does not apply to us in western Europe?  I would be interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response to that.  Trying to solve one problem while creating another difficulty is not what we should be about.  It is not what the Minister is about.  We must hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on this because the report adds a slightly different perspective to the current one and has an impact on how we proceed.  I am sure, however, of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to dealing with this issue.</P>
        <P>One side of the debate was informed by the UN report and another side concerned the desire to amplify the pressure for action.  There have been more television documentaries and investigations into the sex industry.  Perhaps we did not need the latter and perhaps they just presented to us what we already know.  The documentaries painted a very frightening picture of how the industry is affecting so many lives in this country.  Those who did not fully recognise the scale of the challenge and scandal, and the scale of the Minister&rsquo;s difficulty in dealing with these, would have been very much informed by those programmes.</P>
        <P>We cannot rest on our laurels or say we will wait another six months.  I cannot say to my Independent colleagues that I will see them again in six months, at which time we will certainly have all the problems solved.  We are giving a very strong commitment in our amendment that the Government is taking the matter absolutely seriously and intends to act.  It must act methodically and take into account all the evidence, including that gleaned from a full debate on the new suggestions, concerns and fears of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>The bottom line is that the shocking problem requires action, not just talk, from the Government.  It requires legislative change, not just kind words from the Government.  We expect action from the Minister in the very near future.  The consultation period and the consultative programme must result in progress, and dialogue must be open and action must follow.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P>I advocate the acceptance of amendment No. 1.  I hope that, once again, the House can unite in the sure knowledge that the Government intends to go beyond words and engage in action at the earliest possible opportunity.  This is what all our motions are about.  It would be a strong, positive and good signal from this House if we did not just lead the debate on the matter but also inspired the Government to act.  We look forward to early action from it in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion tabled by my Independent colleagues on the other side of the House.  Our position has not really changed since the original motion.  I congratulate the sponsors of the motion on their unusual parliamentary punctuality, which is sometimes very lacking in this House.  It is unfair to blame the current Minister but I am sure that when we were on the other side of the House we would have said returning within six months was very quick and that one should be given time to react.</P>
        <P>When in government, Fianna F&aacute;il passed the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  We, as a party, will do everything possible to try to eliminate prostitution and control and curb human trafficking in any way we can.  When the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 was being passed, I remember a spokesperson on the other side of the other House talking to groups such as Ruhama and others, which felt we should have gone the extra mile to criminalise totally the purchase of sex.  We did not do so at that stage.  I had reservations and the then Minister felt the Bill was very important, a major milestone and step in the right direction, which I have no doubt was the case.  Circumstances have changed, however, and I believe it important to go the extra mile to eradicate prostitution from our society.</P>
        <P>While experts point to the Swedish model and others to the model in Holland, I do not believe that by eliminating prostitution one is putting women&rsquo;s lives at great risk and increasing the number of sexual attacks.  There is a view that prostitution somehow helps to control depression and reduce the incidence of suicide.  I do not subscribe to this.  I accept that there is a lot of common ground between the Government&rsquo;s amendment and what is purported by others.  It is easy on this side to be totally critical of the Government.  Playing that trump card will not do me or this side of the House any good.  I hope the common ground can be explored to the advantage of the genuine people who tabled the motion.</P>
        <P>I read the Government&rsquo;s amendment and have a couple of interesting queries for the Minister.  A paragraph states, &ldquo;in supporting all reasonable and effective measures to curb prostitution, recognises that any proposal to criminalise the purchase of sexual services within our legal and constitutional framework raises complex issues and requires very careful examination&rdquo;.  I honestly believe the criminalisation of the purchase of sex is neither legally nor constitutionally complex; one opts for it or one does not.  The Minister might enlighten me on the legal pitfalls.  The area is very black and white.  I have some knowledge of the Constitution and certainly envisage no constitutional restrictions or parameters that might in some way impede the Minister from moving in this direction.</P>
        <P>The punctuality of the re-entry of this motion must certainly have taken the Minister by surprise.  I empathise with him in that regard.  I have no doubt that if progress is made within the next six months we will revisit this issue.  I recognise a tone of determination on the part of Senator Zappone and others.  Like a hungry dog with a bone, they will not give up on this.</P>
        <P>The amendment &ldquo;acknowledges the Minister&rsquo;s announcement, on the same date, of a planned public consultation exercise to help inform the future direction of legislation on prostitution, thus ensuring that public debate on this sensitive issue is open to the widest possible audience&rdquo;.  I am a little perplexed by that.  I am not saying so in an unhelpful way.  Prostitution is one of the oldest trades, dating back many thousands of years.  We are discussing this matter because of the way Europe and society has changed in the past decade.  Twenty or 30 years ago, the idea of trafficking human beings to Ireland for sexual purposes was unheard of.  One could argue this was the case less than 20 years ago.  I am concerned that there is a need for further debate.  This issue has been debated for many years.  People&rsquo;s positions are clear in one way or another and the facts are that prostitution, whether it involves the trafficking of women or minors, is a blight on society and that it escalated as we became more European and because of demographic movement.</P>
        <P>In our madness during the Celtic tiger era, there was so much money flowing around that using prostitutes became more affordable for many, thus intensifying the abuse.  My position is quite clear.  While I understand the Minister&rsquo;s anxiety to move in this direction &mdash; I have no doubt that the Government intends to try to resolve the issue, as stated by Senator Bradford &mdash; and there is much common ground, unless the Minister makes a pragmatic statement that affords the Independents who moved this motion an opportunity not to push it to a vote, we will support the motion as tabled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  I commend Senator Zappone and the other Independent Senators who, six months after a similar motion was tabled in the House, have brought this matter to our attention again.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment is conciliatory and adequately addresses the actions called for by the Independent Senators.  Every right-minded person agrees that curbing prostitution and preventing the trafficking of women for the purpose of prostitution are necessary.  The Government is committed to developing effective and appropriate responses to deal with these issues.  It is an unfortunate reality that Ireland is part of a globalised industry that mostly exploits women and girls, but also some men and boys.  These victims are experiencing a serious form of human rights abuse.  The methods used to dupe many of them into such a situation are callous and underhanded.  Many are lured by promises of jobs or education, only to find that on arrival at their destinations, they are relieved of their passports and locked in captivity where they are under the continuous threat of physical violence and forced into prostitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While it is difficult to estimate the numbers involved in this industry in Ireland, it is a lucrative one and it is only right and proper that those profiting from it should be pursued and prevented from earning a living from such dreadful methods.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to targeting proactively groups and individuals involved in organised crime, including prostitution.  Within the Departments of Justice and Equality and Social Protection, the HSE and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, dedicated units are charged with tackling various aspects of the issue.  This co-ordinated approach confirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the matter in a proactive and decisive manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend RTE for its &ldquo;Profiting from Prostitution&rdquo; programme, which brought the issue home to everyone and painted a picture of what was occurring.  I urge all Senators to support the Government amendment so that the Chamber can send a strong collective message to the effect that we support the co-operation of the State agencies in protecting victims, apprehending perpetrators and bringing the latter to justice.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Shatter, for his stance and his intention to publish a discussion document on the future direction of prosecution legislation before the end of May.  Like him, I look forward to the outcome of the consultation process.  He has indicated that he will bring legislative proposals to the Government after that process.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  It is significant that he has attended the House for this important debate.  I empathise with a great deal, but not all, of the content of the motion in the name of the Independent Senators.  It is important that the Seanad be used as a place where there are intelligent voices of dissent, of which I hope to be one.</P>
        <P>The motion&rsquo;s first point reads: &ldquo;repeats its recognition that the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation is a modern form of slavery and a form of human rights abuse&rdquo;.  Of course it is; I could not agree more, but have the Senators ever heard of the male species?  Did any of them ever think of the men and boys involved?  Some of them did, but the only Senator who has had the decency to refer to them so far is Senator Cummins.  Perhaps I am wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I discussed them as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>When I twice raised the issue of the forcible castration of 16 year old boys in Holland, the only person in this House who referred to it was Senator Cummins.  I suggest that the motion be amended to include the whole of the human species and not just women.  I am sure that the proposers would agree with that.</P>
        <P>I will refer to criminalising the purchase of sex.  I do not approve of prostitution and have never used the services of a prostitute, but I have encountered prostitutes.  When I bought my house on North Great George&rsquo;s Street some 35 years ago, a young woman was working as a prostitute in the basement next door.  On the night of an All-Ireland final, a group of &ldquo;young gentlemen&rdquo; in elevated spirits attempted to break the door down and get a group rate.  I went over with my real 19th century shillelagh and got rid of them.  She invited me in and gave me a cup of tea.  I have visited a brothel a couple of times.  Each time, it was to protect the vulnerable.  I cannot say much about that woman, but she was certainly doing it voluntarily.</P>
        <P>The trivialisation and commodification of sex are real and appalling, but do we honestly believe that we will eliminate prostitution?  It is not possible.  If we lived in a perfect world and it was possible, it would be grand.  Senator Mac Conghail knows of the riots that occurred at the time of the &ldquo;Plough and the Stars&rdquo;.  A member of the audience shouted that it was a libel against the women of Ireland because there was not a prostitute the length and breadth of the country.  That audience was within a cuckoo&rsquo;s spit of what was then the largest red light district in the whole of Europe.  The district was subsequently attacked by the forces of Frank Duff, which had all the brothels closed down.  The result was a significant increase in disease.  This problem must be addressed.  For this reason, it is important that we recognise and study the UN report.</P>
        <P>I helped to write a report on human trafficking.  While these issues are related, they are not identical.  If we try to make them so, we will make a big mistake.  Our principal attack should be on trafficking, a most repugnant and disgraceful activity that is linked with many problems, not just prostitution.  For example, it is linked with the way Turkish workers were treated in this country.  No one gave a damn about them until Deputy Higgins spoke out on the issue.  It is also related to the way that Filipino workers are treated like slaves and minions.  Each of these is a form of economic exploitation and I am 100% against them.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the issue of criminalisation.  I do not sympathise, but I am concerned about the idea of naming and shaming.  The House is constantly discussing the issue of suicide.  A married man or another person who engaged a prostitute, which is a reprehensible and immoral practice, would be named and shamed, but what about the impact on that person&rsquo;s family?  This is a complex and difficult issue.  I watched with great sadness a film at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, film festival where I was a judge.  As far as I can remember, the film was about a Spanish man who was forced into this situation.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister and will support the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  It takes into account a significant report by the United Nations.  More than 15 years ago I spoke at the IPU meeting in Delhi in India.  The then ambassador, who was a very gracious woman, gave a dinner party before the meeting and asked if she could be of assistance to us.  I told her I was interested in the question of AIDS and asked her to provide a list of the organisations which dealt with AIDS.  Of 71 such organisations, only one dealt with gay men and none dealt with sex workers, as they were then known.  I raised that issue because I thought it was dynamite.  It was driving the whole thing underground.  That is still my concern, although I empathise with my colleagues&rsquo; motivation.  For the reasons stated I will be voting with the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who have tabled this motion.  I am conscious that others wish to speak but I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the current review of our legislation on prostitution.  I acknowledge the promptness of Senators in tabling this motion on the basis that we are about a week late in fulfilling our promise to publish a document that will form part of a consultative process.  Unfortunately, I have discovered as a Minister that no matter how committed one is to an issue, it is not always possible to meet timeframes when one is also dealing with other important legislation.  As Members of this House will discover next week, an important Bill dealing with a related area is about to be published which I hope, based on discussions I am having, will first come before this House.</P>
        <P>We all agree that, as the motion states, human trafficking for sexual exploitation is a modern form of slavery and an abuse of human rights.  We also agree that trafficking and prostitution cause very serious harm.  We all share the same objective of dealing as effectively as we can with prostitution and human trafficking and with the harm caused by both.</P>
        <P>The motion calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to uphold the Government&rsquo;s commitment to commence a consultation process with a view to making a decision on whether prostitution legislation based on the Swedish legislative model should be enacted in this jurisdiction.  I unequivocally assure the House that our commitment stands and that a detailed discussion document on the future direction of prostitution legislation designed to facilitate the planned consultation process will be published shortly.  Drafting of the discussion document is well advanced and the document will be published before the end of May.</P>
        <P>Last October, when announcing to this House my intention to conduct a public consultation process, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stated on my behalf that I wanted the public debate on this issue to be open to the widest possible audience.  I have also published my Department&rsquo;s report on Sweden&rsquo;s legislation to combat prostitution and human trafficking in order to inform public debate on this matter.  Prostitution affects individuals, communities and society as a whole.  Owing to increasing globalisation, it has become more complex.  For that reason, I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so.  The consultation process will form an integral part of the current review of our legislation on prostitution and help to chart the way forward.</P>
        <P>The motion reiterates the call by the Independent Group for the Government to develop effective and appropriate responses to deal with prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.  I have no doubt there is scope for improvement in our response to this challenge but I also stress that many of the measures taken in this jurisdiction to address human trafficking have received commendation nationally and internationally.  A wide range of measures have been taken and will continue to be taken to prevent human trafficking, prosecute traffickers and protect trafficking victims.  These measures include: robust legislation; a national action plan; targeted law enforcement; dedicated anti-trafficking units; consultative structures which reflect a whole of Government response and include NGO participation in a number of standing working groups; a holistic range of supports for victims; broad-based awareness raising; and international co-operation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not propose to dwell on any of these measures at length.  However, I would like to say a few words about the dedicated units that have been put in place.  First, there is a dedicated anti-trafficking unit in my Department which, working with statutory, non-governmental and international organisations, co-ordinates and implements Government policy and measures to give effect to Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations.  Second, there is a dedicated unit in the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  This unit takes the lead role in the policing response.  I assure the House that the prevention and detection of human trafficking remains a policing priority.  It was one of the priorities set out in the police plan for 2012.  Third, a team of experts in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions deals with prosecutions in trafficking cases.   Fourth, a dedicated unit in the Health Service Executive develops and implements an individual care plan for each potential victim of human trafficking and a unit in the Legal Aid Board provides legal advice to victims.  In addition, personnel in the new communities and asylum seekers unit in the Department of Social Protection help victims who are not in the asylum system but are granted temporary residence to access a wide range of State services such as accommodation and other State benefits.</P>
        <P>I assure Senators that we are not complacent.  Self-evidently, the nature of human trafficking is particularly insidious and constant vigilance is required to ensure that it is recognised and tackled.  It is imperative that State agencies and victim support organisations continue to work together to deal with this issue.  Effective collaboration will enable preventative measures to continue to be put in place, victims to be protected and perpetrators apprehended and brought to justice.  I am firmly committed to ensuring those goals continue to be met, even while understanding the difficulties that arise in effecting prosecutions where allegations of trafficking are made.</P>
        <P>Although there is a significant raft of legislation on prostitution, there is scope for reform.  The criminal law on prostitution has traditionally had two objectives, which were referred to earlier.  The first objective is to protect society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective.  For that reason, under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purposes of prostitution.  The offence can be committed by the client, the prostitute or a third party, such as a pimp.  The second objective of the law on prostitution is to protect prostitutes from exploitation.  The 1993 Act makes it an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live off the earnings of a prostitute or keep or manage a brothel.  Under public order legislation the advertising of prostitution is also an offence.  Prosecutions have been successfully taken under the 1993 Act, contrary to the impression given.</P>
        <P>I accept that our legislation on prostitution should be reviewed, primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland, which was so well described by Senator Zappone.  That review has commenced.  Prostitution in this country was once mainly a street based phenomenon but that is no longer the case.  Most prostitution these days has moved indoors, is highly mobile in character and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the Internet, particularly in regard to the use of websites.</P>
        <P>Garda operations to tackle illegal activities have adapted to address the changed nature of prostitution.  The prostitution industry is monitored by the Garda and is the subject of regular targeted initiatives.  I would like to mention Operation Quest, in particular.  Initially established in the Dublin metropolitan region in 2003 in response to the growth of lap dancing clubs, it was revived in 2005 to target brothel keeping, organised prostitution and the advertising of prostitution.  The operation has successfully targeted individuals involved in the organisation of prostitution and led to the seizure of significant amounts of cash and the referral of files to the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Operation Quest investigations frequently unearth complex prostitution rings operating throughout this jurisdiction and abroad and have provided the Garda with useful insights into the industry.  The operation has been expanded on a regional basis.  It focuses on monitoring, gathering intelligence and acting on that intelligence.</P>
        <P>I am sure Senators will be aware of another Garda operation in the Limerick area.  Operation Freewheel is an ongoing, multi-phase investigation in Limerick Garda division.  It was devised in response to identified crime trends and specific complaints of brothel and street-based prostitution from residents and the business community in an area adjacent to Limerick city centre.    The initiative focuses on the identification and prosecution of offenders, identifying any possible links to human trafficking and other criminal enterprises, and increasing awareness among those involved in prostitution, particularly women, of the availability of diversion services.  This operation has led to numerous arrests, prosecutions and convictions for a range of offences under the 1993 legislation.  A number of the recent court cases generated substantial publicity.</P>
        <P>The motion rightly states that the trafficking of children for the purposes of sexual exploitation is especially abhorrent.  The amendment agrees but also points to the very strong legislative provisions already in place to address such trafficking.  It is important that their existence is acknowledged.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 gave effect to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in various international instruments to criminalise human trafficking.  The trafficking of children &mdash; boys or girls &mdash; for sexual exploitation, including prostitution, is a criminal offence and those convicted of such trafficking are liable in this State to life imprisonment.  In addition, it is an offence under the legislation for any person to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person in any place, public or private, for the purpose of prostitution.  This provision was included in the legislation specifically to address demand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s legislation on human trafficking for sexual exploitation complies with the EU Council Framework Decision on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings, as well as Council of Europe and other international instruments.  Where prostitution is concerned, our current legislation applies equally to adults and children, men and women, boys and girls.  However, the amendment highlights an important provision which is specific to children.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was amended in 2007 to provide that a person who solicits a child - irrespective of whether for the purposes of prostitution - to commit an act which would constitute carnal knowledge or sexual assault is guilty of an offence.  Moreover, in addition to being charged with such solicitation, a person who engages in a sexual act with the child can be charged with serious offences under sexual offences legislation.  In these circumstances, consent to the sexual act is not a defence.  Such solicitation may occur and may effectively be regarded already as a piece of legislation which targets those who seek to purchase sex.</P>
        
        <P>The motion calls on the Government to introduce legislation criminalising the purchase of sex in order to curb prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.  Senators will appreciate that until the consultation exercise is completed, it would not be appropriate for the Government to commit to any particular new legislative approach.  The consultation process must be and be seen to be objective, transparent, open-minded and fair.  As the amendment recognises, reasonable people disagree in good faith on the appropriate legislative response to prostitution.  It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course.  To provide feedback, I intend to publish a report of the outcome of the consultation process.  It is my objective that such a report would be published fairly speedily after the process is complete.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current review of our legislation on prostitution needs to include a comparative legislative analysis.  As indicated in the amendment, that analysis will include further examination of the Swedish model but cannot be limited to exploring the experience in Sweden and the Nordic countries that have followed Sweden&rsquo;s lead.  Consideration of the international dimension must also take account of the views of international organisations.  In this context, Senators will be aware - it was mentioned in the debate - that since the Seanad debate in October, the Report of the UNAIDS Advisory Group on HIV and Sex Work was published in December 2011.  This report has recommended that states remove criminal penalties for the purchase and sale of sex - neither of which currently arises in this jurisdiction - to establish legal and policy environments conducive to universal access to HIV services for sex workers.  I do not propose to go into all of the findings in the report of the group.  In any event, they require further examination and some Senators speaking this evening indicated they wanted to give further examination to that report.  However, to provide just a brief flavour of the UN report, it expresses concerns about the conflation of sex work and trafficking - a matter to which Senator Norris referred - and the impact that failing to clearly distinguish between the two has on sex workers.</P>
        
        <P>Of course, these impacts will vary from country to country.  The report states that:</P>
        <P LI="2">. . . the approach of criminalising the client has been shown to backfire on sex workers . . . in general, demonising and marginalising clients are approaches that create major barriers to effective HIV programming with sex workers . . . these approaches are often adopted with the aim of reducing sex work and also trafficking, but they have not been shown to be effective in achieving these aim . . . [and] should be avoided, from both a public health and a human rights perspective.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the circumstances, it will be important that the current review looks carefully at the UN report &mdash; a report that should not be entirely ignored.  Of course, this is an issue which also will be of particular interest to the Department of Health.</P>
        <P>I have given an undertaking this evening that the discussion document to facilitate the consultation process on the future direction of prostitution legislation will be published before the end of May.  I will make an announcement at that stage regarding the arrangements and timeframe for making submissions.  I am aware from representations received in my Department that there is significant interest in this issue.  I have already indicated on a number of occasions that ample time will be given to allow members of the public prepare and make submissions.  However, the time will not be open.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I have agreed that following the commencement of the consultative process after the general public has had an opportunity to make submissions, we will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the report.  The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.</P>
        <P>I have also agreed that a report of the outcome of the proceedings will be published and I hope this report can be published before the end of December.  I must caution, however, that it is subject to resources having regard to the volume of submissions received and competing legislative demands.  If it turns out to be the case that we do not manage to publish it by the end of December and it stretches into the middle or end of January, I hope Senators will give us reasonable leeway.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In that context, I wish to say something that may not have occurred to Members but which is already creating substantial work in my Department, which is that on 1 January 2013 we will take over the Presidency of the European Union.  That puts extraordinary demands on the staff within the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of a myriad of issues we need to address at a European level, a number of which would be very substantial priorities for Members of this House.  They include addressing the proposed European directive dealing with victims of crime to put in place a uniform framework across Europe to ensure that victims of crime, including victims of crime in this area, are treated with uniformity, that their rights are respected and that they are provided with the services they require.  The objective is the end of December, but one never can be absolutely certain we will meet that objective within the specific timeframe.  I believe it is achievable and hope it will prove to be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again thank Senators for raising this important matter.  The consultation process will be a substantial element of the current review and I look forward to its outcome.  I undertake to return to the Senators when the report of the consultation process has been completed.  That report will reflect both the written documentation we receive and the discussion that takes place in the meeting we hope to hold as I mentioned.  For my part and that of the Government, I again assure the House that we are committed to take all reasonable and effective measures to address the evil of human trafficking and the issue of prostitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share a view expressed by one Senator which is that in addressing the issue it is important we provide protection for men and women, boys and girls, who find themselves the victims of trafficking.  It is important that we ensure evil people do not exploit other human beings.  It is also important to be aware of the fact that the issue of prostitution is one that, in reality, has been part of the human world going back thousands of years.  I am not sure we are going to invent a solution that other countries, going back through the millennia, have failed to find.  These are issues of human behaviour and conduct, and we must deal with matters in a manner that does not simply create a legal regime that drives this industry further underground to the detriment of those engaged in it and those who resort to it.</P>
        
        <P>There are issues in the context of human beings being fallible and the extent to which their fallibility results in the naming and shaming to which Senator Norris referred.  There is therefore a broad range of complex human issues.  As far as I am concerned, as Minister for Justice and Equality, human trafficking should have no place of any description in this State.  We need to do everything we can to bring to justice those engaged in it.  We need to provide the necessary services for victims of trafficking.  We must also deal with these matters in a sensible, comprehensive and effective manner.  All these considerations should form part of this debate.  I look forward to what I think might be an important and interesting discussion that will arise following the publication of the discussion paper that is in preparation.  I hoped it would have been published before now but I am assured by my officials that it will be published by the end of May at the latest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and warmly welcome him to the House.  I even more warmly welcome the words he has shared with us.  His commitment to the issue is clear but perhaps we can reflect on it somewhat.  I tabled this motion together with my colleagues Senators Katherine Zappone, Fiach Mac Conghail and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien.  Much has been made of the six-month period, but my understanding was that the consultation process would be completed within that period.  My role is to be a bit impatient and urge things to move forward constructively, not destructively.</P>
        <P>In drafting the motion, we were conscious of what happened in the debate six months ago.  Then we asked for legislation to be brought forward to criminalise the purchase of sex.  We have listened and that is why today we are asking for a clear timetable on the consultation and clear steps for the Government&rsquo;s approach.  The Minister has done that for us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had a debate last October but the more one immerses oneself in an issue, the more one can understand and appreciate it.  My colleague Senator Mac Conghail spoke about bearing witness and it is important to do so.  The most frequent argument I have heard against our call to the Government to criminalise the purchase of sex is that criminalisation would violate a woman&rsquo;s or man&rsquo;s right to self determination over his or her own body.  I have not come to the issue lightly; I have done my research but I cannot agree with this argument.  When we peel away the complex layers of how and why women and men sell their bodies for the sexual gratification of others, it is clear that their path into prostitution did not start with a simple exercise of self-determination.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Research shows that a significant number of women end up in prostitution as a result of poverty, debt, homelessness and addiction, having been groomed by a partner, family member or friend.  Many are there by force.  As my colleagues have outlined, the sex industry in Ireland is inherently exploitative.  It is characterised by coercion, whether through violence or economic hardship, which renders free and informed consent to prostitution all but impossible.  Those who argue in defence of prostitution on the basis of consent should be mindful that the age identified internationally for entry into prostitution is 14.  It is an age at which consent cannot be given, as I know the Minister will agree.</P>
        <P>During the debate last October, I spoke about the devastating effects of prostitution on the physical, psychological and emotional welfare of those involved in it, and how unimaginable the impact is on children and child victims of trafficking.  We can talk all day about reports, findings and statistics, but the most important evidence of the need to introduce legislation is to be found in the personal experiences of women and children in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s commendable approach in listening to all the different perspectives of the consultation process.  I think that is important.  When I was preparing for the last debate and today&rsquo;s, I tried to listen to all perspectives.  The difficulty is, however, that I have met with victims and have offered to meet with those who present themselves to me through e-mail correspondence as sex workers, but I cannot get a meeting.  I want to put that on the record.  I am willing to listen to different perspectives and talk to people.  One may often get an email, but when one tries to follow it up the people are not there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the personal stories from recent years were lodged with the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s anti-human trafficking unit in September 2011 by the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.  One case identified a 17 year old girl from a rural village in Sudan.  She was introduced to a Nigerian man by a family friend who promised her an education in Europe.  The man brought her to Dublin via Manchester and Belfast.  While travelling, she was told to assume a Nigerian identity.  She was given clothes, boots and a bag of condoms, and told to do anything the clients wanted.  She was forced to have sex with a minimum of four men a night.</P>
        <P>In another case, a 16-year-old Romanian was brought to Ireland illegally and within a few months found herself living in fear of the man who brought her here.  For two years she was held captive and forced to have sex with men in flats throughout Dublin city.  She was subjected to frequent beatings, became pregnant and had a miscarriage when her pimp punched and kicked her in the stomach.  She eventually escaped these horrific circumstances and went to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Another eastern European girl came to the attention of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were called to a house in Dublin by neighbours.  She was taken to hospital by ambulance following a beating by a man who had held her at the house and had forced her to have sex with 200 men.  It subsequently emerged that she was six months pregnant.  She informed garda&iacute; that she had been taken by bus to Spain before being given a false Italian passport and trafficked into Ireland.</P>
        <P>This is a real issue and I have no doubt that the organisations working with victims could cite so many more examples.  Cases like these show an intrinsic link between trafficking, organised crime and prostitution.  Findings from the two recently televised investigative documentaries on the organised nature of prostitution in Ireland support this link.  I am not saying they are always linked, but there is a clear evidential link.  While I recognise that legislative measures are currently in place to tackle human trafficking and organised prostitution, they do not sufficiently appreciate that link.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I believe they are clearly not working.   Sexual exploitation of women, girls and men by organised criminals is rife.  We must deter demand for prostitution.  That is an integral part of the fight against organised crime and will reduce human trafficking.  I see the merits of the Swedish model which criminalises the purchase of sex.  Rather than operating in a punitive fashion, its existence alone has acted as a significant deterrent to purchasers of sex.  It has also considerably reduced prostitution and associated crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I warmly welcome the commitments the Minister has given here today.  He has given us a clear timetable.  I understand that the Minister&rsquo;s portfolio is wide-ranging and deals with serious issues.  I also appreciate the upcoming EU Presidency and am aware of how broad the justice portfolio is in an EU context.  On 31 December, I will not be telling the Minister: &ldquo;Hold on, you said...&rdquo;.  We are trying to keep this issue in the spotlight because it is happening every day to those in the industry.  I will therefore continue to be impatient and will not apologise for that.  I do welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitments, together with the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  I hope we can all work together on this issue in future.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and I am glad of the opportunity to renew this debate.  We had a full debate on this issue six months ago.  I commend Senators Zappone, Mac Conghail and van Turnhout, as well as the other Independent Senators, for bringing the debate to the floor of the House again.  They have kept everyone on their toes as regards timing and have also kept this issue at the forefront of our minds.</P>
        <P>I was here in this House for the entirety of the previous debate when the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, gave a commitment that there would be a public consultation process.  Like all Members, I regret that there has been a lack of progress or apparent progress in the past six months although we have had a good deal of public debate on this issue, given the excellent documentaries to which other speakers have referred.</P>
        <P>The information available to us has probably increased in the interim.  Senator Zappone set out very clearly the facts and figures around prostitution and trafficking in Ireland and Senator van Turnhout very helpfully and eloquently provided us with some of the very human stories behind the facts and figures.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Given that we are where we are, to use that clich&eacute;, and that the document on public consultation has not been published, there is now very little between the Independent Senators&rsquo; motion and the Government counter-motion.  I thank the Minister for very helpfully setting out a clear timeline for public consultation and for assuring us that a discussion document on which the public consultation will be based will be published before the end of May.  It is very helpful that a conference will be held in the autumn at which interested parties, stakeholders and others can discuss and debate the arguments and the issues entailed in legislating around prostitution and trafficking.  I suggest there is a useful model in the conference which the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, held in January in Dublin Castle, on the issue of gender quotas prior to the debate in both Houses on the gender quota Bill, the Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill.  That conference crystallised the issues for everyone and a conference on this subject could do the same and I suggest it be held in Dublin Castle.  It is generally accepted that the end of December is a very reasonable time to have a report published.  If the time slips a little, I think we will all accept that.  As the Labour Party justice spokesperson I accept a significant amount of legislative work is ongoing in the Department of Justice and Equality even though the Department has had other work to deal with in the past six months.</P>
        <P>The Dignity report published by the Department the week after our debate on 17 October 2011 referred to certain practical difficulties associated with adapting a model from Swedish legislation for use in Ireland.  In our previous debates we discussed these issues to do with the constitutional framework for criminal justice in Ireland.  However, these difficulties can be overcome and this is an aspect which would need to be examined.</P>
        <P>We are all in agreement that the current model of legislation needs to be reviewed.  There are difficulties associated with it and in the past I been involved in defence cases under that legislation and I know how difficult it is to prosecute and to obtain prosecutions under it.  I have also looked at the evaluations of the Swedish legislation and they seem to be very clear that street prostitution has halved in Sweden, and that in eight out of ten prosecutions the purchaser admits the offence.  The Minister referred to this statistic.  However, it is also clear from the Swedish experience that the legislation alone has not been responsible for the apparent reduction in demand.  Reports on the Swedish law find that considerable work was also carried out separate from the legislative work.  For example, alongside the legislative model, social services were operating KAST groups involving purchasers of sexual services in order to motivate potential and active sex purchasers to change their behaviour.  This demand reduction strategy has to be undertaken in conjunction with any legislation.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge and commend the Turn off the Red Light campaign which has been able to mobilise a great deal of support for the Swedish legislative model and which has put the arguments into an Irish context.  This campaign has also undertaken a good deal of legal research.  The Labour Party was one of the groups which signed up to the Turn off the Red Light campaign.  I also acknowledge the work of many NGOs, notably Ruhama, which have done a great deal to support those women, men, boys and children engaged in prostitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the United Nations report on HIV which I have read with great interest and which was issued subsequent to our debate.  It is an interesting report which refers throughout to sex work so it takes a very different position to the position adopted in the Swedish legislation.  Some of the issues it raises are of particular interest with regard to health strategies and HIV prevention but it comes from a particular position on prostitution law.</P>
        <P>We are all agreed in this House on the need to ensure our legislation is robust and effective in tackling prostitution and trafficking.  We need to look again at how our legislation is framed.  The Swedish approach offers us a different framework and model which appears to have been highly effective in Sweden.  It has been adapted for use elsewhere and we should consider its use here.  I welcome what the Minister said about a timeline for public consultation and consideration of the legislation.  I hope we can move forward in a spirit of compromise and in a constructive manner as is the tradition in this House and since we are all in agreement on how to address this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and this motion tabled by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  This is a very important issue.  It is disturbing that tonight and every night, people who have been trafficked will be exploited.  The measures in the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 have not been sufficient.  The purchase of sex is not a criminal offence and this leads to trafficking.  Other Senators have spoken about the Swedish legislation.  Senator Bacik has explained that it is not just a case of introducing legislation and she noted that other initiatives are undertaken apart from legislative measures.  As a result in Sweden there is a compliance level of 80%.  The reduction was from one in eight men in Sweden purchasing sex to one in 40.  This illustrates that because it becomes a criminal offence, this causes a change in behaviour and this is what we should consider.</P>
        <P>There is an argument that prostitution involves free will, that it is a transaction between two consenting adults.  This is an argument made by those who, for reasons difficult to comprehend, try to legitimise or rationalise what happens.  It might be the oldest profession but that does not mean it is a noble profession.  The women involved are forced into this work, either through personal circumstances or trauma or because of addiction or for economic reasons.  Trafficked people are fooled into the work and their very freedom is taken away when their passports are confiscated and they are prisoners in this country, for all intents and purposes.</P>
        <P>On another issue, people are also being trafficked for the harvesting of organs.  This is an issue which the Minister for Health will deal with in the future.  The modern-day version of slavery is where people are being used for sex or for work in sweatshops as is the case in other jurisdictions.  The fact before us is that the exploiters are not criminalised and if the Swedish policy were adopted it would produce a change in behaviour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and more than that I welcome his contribution to the debate.  I commend the Government amendment.  The Leader said it was a conciliatory amendment but it is also action-driven which is important.  My party will support the Government amendment for those reasons.  The amendment commits the Government to a planned public consultation exercise, a detailed discussion paper and a report on the outcome of the consultation process will then be published.  Examination of the Swedish model will form part of any review, and the consultation process will be conducted as quickly as possible.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the consultation process must be, and be seen to be, objective, transparent, open-minded and fair.  The motion that was tabled by the Independent Senators contains a paragraph that commits us to introducing legislation criminalising the purchase of sex in Ireland in order to curb prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.  If we were to support that, it would prejudice the outcome of any consultation process.  I hope there will not be a vote and that we can support the very good Government amendment.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the fact that reasonable people can disagree.  My party does have concerns about the Swedish model, not because of any impact it might have on people who purchase sex but because of the potential impact on people who work in the industry &mdash; I do not like using that phrase, but it is one that is often used.  The Minister cited the UN report that spoke about the potential for criminalisation to backfire on sex workers and drive the whole industry further underground.  There are real concerns that have been expressed not only in the 2011 UN report, but in a number of other reports that considered the Swedish model and the criminalisation model.  We need to deal robustly with trafficking, which we can all agree is something that needs to be strongly challenged by the Government, with proper sanctions and enforcement.  That is the area that needs the most attention, in my view.  I support the Government amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for coming to the House and his obvious commitment and comforting words.  If I was one of the very dangerous organised criminals who are obviously at the top of the pile, profiteering from these vulnerable and frightened people, I would be pretty happy because I would have another 12 months at least to continue to profiteer.  A lot of what I was going to say has been said, so I will shorten my speech a little.  The Minister listed the measures he intends to take, including robust legislation and a national action plan.  Senator Bacik made reference to education.  It really worried me, listening to Paul Maguire today, to hear that the purchase of sex in this country seems to have become normal and accepted.  Nineteen year olds are purchasing sex.  We all know who we think purchases sex, but 19 year old boys?  We seriously have a problem.  We do not need legislation for this; we need to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House, because this is a social problem and we need to start thinking about how to educate our young people immediately.  Obviously, this will be a long process.  This is something that was done in Sweden as well as the introduction of legislation.  I urge the Minister to pass this on to the Minister for Education and Skills and ask him to join forces with his own Department, which I know is very busy.  We need to make sure we educate all our young people to show them this is not a way for us to live or to treat other human beings.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister, and everyone who is sitting here this evening or watching the monitors, to close their eyes and imagine their son, daughter, nephew, niece, brother, sister or good friend being in this situation.  It could have happened to any of us.  I feel so fortunate, so enclosed, so nurtured to be in this beautiful House so far away from these people, who are yet so close to us.  They are 20 minutes from us.  I really respected the Minister&rsquo;s speech and was so comforted by him.  I know the European Presidency is coming up, but we must find the time to give protection to these vulnerable and desperately frightened people who are all over this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will pick up on a point made by Senator Cummins.  I appreciate that we have targeted law enforcement out there trying to help these people.  Paul Maguire was here today at lunchtime.  Only recently he was up in Dundalk filming two women who are in this awful work.  Only 55 minutes after he had filmed them in an apartment, there was a raid by the police, who arrested the women.  They were dragged to the police station and down to court and were bailed out by their pimp, who produced himself as a friend.  He moved them from Dundalk to Christchurch and within a day they were back at work, seeing 15 clients the same night.  As they have to report their whereabouts to the Garda every week, every week they go back to Dundalk and are made to lie that they are living there.  Their English is not great.  They are moving to Christchurch, down the country and to the west.  These people have no sense of where they are.  The Garda has no hope when it is the women they are targeting and not the clever, brilliant, dangerous, desperate criminals that the Minister is up against.</P>
        <P>If we do adopt part of the Swedish model and impose small fines on the people who buy sex, this might be a way for the Minister&rsquo;s people and the Garda to find a way towards the dangerous drug-running criminals.  I listened to what Senator Norris said, and we do not want to hurt the families of those clients, but the clients represent another way to find and identify the men who are at the top of this sordid and horrible situation that we find ourselves in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Mooney.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and his words.  None of us can expect to dictate his precise point of view on the issues, but we appreciate his ongoing commitment to debating this issue personally with us in the House and to hearing what the House has to say.  The Minister is an ideas person and he is clearly taking a considered approach to this issue.  I welcome his commitment to maximum consultation and eventual publication of the report.  That is important and it is to the Minister&rsquo;s credit.</P>
        <P>We have moved on since the last time this debate took place.  I give credit to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, who introduced this motion.  In the previous Seanad I tabled certain amendments to the human trafficking Bill to deal with the problem of trafficking and the need to criminalise the purchasers of sex.  When I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; motion on the issue, I had to deal with a certain cynicism in the corridors of power.  I remember one senior Minister saying, when I asked for support for the proposition that we introduce legislation according to the Swedish model, that there were young students making a few quid by going into prostitution.  I remember thinking what a glib and laddish assertion that was, and how far removed it was from the reality of the lives of people in prostitution &mdash; people who have been trafficked, who are often subject to violence, who can be raped with impunity, who do not have any friends or contacts and who may not even have the language to reach out for the necessary help.  Some of this horror was brought out in the film &ldquo;Trafficked&rdquo;, which some of us saw a few years ago.</P>
        <P>The issue with regard to the criminalisation of the purchase of sex has to do, in part, with helping to make this country a cold house for traffickers, as I have said before.  However, it also has to do with an honest assessment of what prostitution itself does to individuals and what it does to a society.  The Minister himself mentioned, with great sensitivity, that this is an extremely old problem.  He is right to say that, but often that can be allowed as an excuse not to tackle a problem.  Incest is also an extremely old problem; sadly, the laws against incest do not prevent it from happening.  We are always limited in our ability to reach, through the criminal law, the evils in our midst but we should be in no doubt that where a person engages in the purchase of another human being, he or she is committing a violence against the dignity of that person and against society in general.  He or she is undermining the kind of healthy egalitarian attitudes we need to promote between men and women.</P>
        <P>What we heard today, thanks to Paul Maguire, was particularly chilling.  I give credit to the media for their role in this issue.  They have been subject to legitimate criticism in recent times but this is one of the areas in which it has done us a service.  It was particularly chilling to hear that among those using and abusing persons in prostitution are people as young as 19, 20 or 21 years of age.  That points to a radical individualism in our society, which is a problem, and perhaps even an allergy to any consideration of the moral issues around sexual morality, in particular.  Perhaps because of the excesses of, and the wrong way we went about discussing some of these issues in the past, there is almost a free for all now.  That is  very troubling when one thinks of the impact of it.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute again to all those involved.  Tribute has rightly been paid to Ruhama.  I regret the reference to sex workers which would tempt me to oppose the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  It should at least be in inverted commas.  It is a sanitisation of something that is highly unacceptable.  However, this is a great improvement on the previous Government amendment and I hope the next time we have a debate, there will be nothing at all offensive in the Government&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his presentation.  I agree with him that it is right that, irrespective of the wording of this laudable motion, he should await the outcome of the consultative process.</P>
        <P>I was particularly pleased he made reference, without an over-emphasis, to what has been generally referred to as the Swedish model as if it was somehow the panacea to all of this.  I have done some limited investigation on the Swedish model which suggests that while great strides have been made since the 1999 legislation and while there is a cultural change, in particular among men, in the sense that the rate of usage of prostitutes is significantly lower, prostitution has not gone away in Sweden.  In fact, it is still operating.  It is no wonder it is called the oldest profession in the world.</P>
        <P>One of the things in which I would be particularly interested from an Irish perspective is the support services provided while prostitution continues.  I know it is against the law but other jurisdictions have taken not so much a liberal approach to this but a humane one and have accepted the reality of it.  I am not sure what the support services are but I am referring to health services, drop-in centres and such like.</P>
        <P>I refer to the victims of trafficking.  As the Minister said, under the law prostitutes can be, and are, legally sanctioned.  Are there any provisions in the Minister&rsquo;s discussions to encourage those who are trafficked to come forward and to be of assistance to the Garda?  Perhaps this is already being done but I am not aware of it.  Perhaps it is being done under the radar.</P>
        <P>In the context of the experience of other countries, if the law was more humane towards those who were trafficked, they would be encouraged to name and shame those who trafficked them, took their passports and whatever else and to assist the legal agencies here to prosecute those people.  Those are the sorts of issues in which I am particularly interested.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  I listened to almost all of the debate and feel a little inadequate in addressing the issue given the poignancy and the power of the contributions made.  I will reiterate some of the points because they are so important.  I compliment the Independent Senators on bringing forward this motion so quickly.  I thought we had just debated this issue recently.  As I did not realise it was six months ago, that will tell one how quickly time passes.</P>
        <P>I was going to appeal for time from the Minister to do this right because there is no point doing it badly.  When one looks at the list of measures in place, including legislative measures, administrative measures and so on, it is clear that this is a very difficult issue to tackle, so we must do it right.  The Minister came back with a very fine response.  He has taken it on the chin and he has said clearly what he will do.  The consultation process will be completed by the end of May, there will be a conference in the autumn and a report by the end of December, or early in the new year at worst.  This is good.</P>
        <P>I was going to appeal for time for the Independent Senators but when I heard Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s contribution, I said it is not a day too soon.  People are eating up our young people and our young people are eating up others.  It is abhorrent that 19 year olds are buying sex.  There is something wrong with our society if that is acceptable.  These norms are wrong.  I hope new measures will come out of the consultation process because let us face it, we are looking for something new.  Despite all the measures &mdash; a national action plan, a high level interdepartmental group, a multi-disciplinary partnership group, awareness raising campaigns, training on the issue of human trafficking for law enforcement, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) 1993 Act and the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 &mdash; prostitution still happens.  We are not saying it will completely go away but currently it is rampant.</P>
        <P>Young women are being trafficked throughout the country and some are children.  There must be a multi-pronged approach between the Departments of Justice and Equality and Education and Skills.  There is a place for this in education.  We have the relationships and sexuality education curriculum.  The education of our young males is critical but so too is that of our young girls because grooming happens when someone is very young.  When grooming happens and when there is an incident very early in a young boy&rsquo;s or a young girl&rsquo;s life, some feel unworthy.  They are made feel special and they do not have the self-esteem to counteract it.  We must include this in the relationship and sexuality education curriculum, certainly at upper primary school level.  I know that perhaps this would be controversial and it would have to be done in an age appropriate way but as the Minister said, this is evil and we must decry and abhor it in the strongest terms.</P>
        <P>I refer to Garda resources.  The Minister pointed to extra resources, which I acknowledge, but is there enough flexibility to respond to the gangs quickly?  I spoke to a detective recently who said their hands are often tied.  For all crimes, the key time period after the incident is 48 hours but with prostitution and trafficking, it appears to be within an hour of a call to a Garda station.</P>
        <P>I could make points about the Swedish model but they have been made by others.  The Swedish model appeals to me at one level because the person selling the service is in trouble in any event.  I support what Senator van Turnhout said that it is not just an act of self-determination by the prostitute or the person providing the service who is already in trouble as a result of poverty, addiction or mental health issues, who has been the victim of trafficking and violence and who may have had to suffer an abortion as a result of the heinous act.  The two-pronged approach of the United Nations is that we deal not only with harm reduction but with harm elimination because we must take care of the public health issues.</P>
        <P>It is good that it appears the House has united on this issue.    We have many problems but it appears we are united in the decision to deal with this issue seriously and that 2012 is the year to change things for the better.  The Minister has the support of the House and I wish him well in the consultations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his robust response.  I pay tribute to those involved in Turn off the Red Light campaign for their perseverance.  They have spread the message in a way that people can understand and as Senator Healy Eames said, they remind us that every day the exploitation of women and children continues, that day should not come to pass without some action to deal with it.</P>
        <P>When the Swedish Detective Inspector Jonas Trolle was here last year he said that it is now widely seen as shameful and unacceptable to purchase a woman for sex in Sweden.  He was speaking in support of the Swedish model and I know there is much confusion and discussion around the success or otherwise of the Swedish model, but he was right about that aspect.  It is shameful and unacceptable to purchase a woman for sex.  I think no person in this room would disagree with that.  It is important for us to remember that is at the core of what we are trying to achieve.  Our support for the Minister&rsquo;s work is because we believe this is shameful and unacceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is shameful that the culture in Ireland is such that as Senator O&rsquo;Brien has said, we believe it is kind of acceptable that sex is bought and sold and that equality is not sufficiently embedded.  We need to arrive at a point where it is shameful and unacceptable for men to demean women through the purchase of sex.  Women are demeaned in more ways than just sexual exploitation because of the trafficking, bullying, the physical and mental violence, not to mention drugs and control and all the other things related to sexual exploitation.  We have a job of work to do on the culture and the campaigners in Turn Off the Red Light have started that work.  As Senator Bacik said, while there may be debate about whether the legislation in Sweden succeeded in all its intents, it was certainly helped.  It was also supported by the role of education.  We need to bring education on the issue into this debate and not leave the problem entirely to the Minister for Justice and Equality to try to address a problem that cannot be dealt with by legislation alone.  The legislation will always have a flaw, the backdoor.</P>
        <P>We need to start to encourage young people to understand that this behaviour is not correct and to encourage those who may be engaged in buying sex to think again.  Some classes were run in the UK at the end of the 1990s and the first man who turned up at one of them said he was present for the prostitution school.  It had to be pointed out that he was there for the &ldquo;kerb crawling school&rdquo;, so to speak, because he had forgotten that he was responsible as a kerb crawler, as a purchaser of sex, and that the day was set aside to discuss with him and other men what had happened and why they had ended up buying sex.  We need to start to look at the issue in that light and educate not just those who may end up buying sex but those who are already in the system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some years ago, when I worked at the BBC, I had the privilege of working with Ms Irene Iveson, a physiotherapist who worked in Nottingham, whose 14 year old daughter was murdered in a car park.  Irene did not know that her daughter was a prostitute.  She had been working for three weeks when she was killed.  Irene Iveson very bravely decided to turn what could only have been described as an appalling experience into something positive and she started to work on educating people and helping them to understand this behaviour and also to encourage the outlawing of kerb crawling.  Unfortunately, Irene Iveson is no longer with us, but when I worked with her, we went to Glasgow to visit a number of prostitutes.  It is fair to say that even though we spoke to a small number of women, only eight or nine, every one of them would have wished their lives to be different.  None was there voluntarily.  They felt demeaned and they all spoke about the fear of violence.  When Irene spoke of her daughter having been murdered, they too were able to come forward and tell their stories much more freely because they knew that Irene understood them.</P>
        <P>We also met Ms Fiona Broadfoot, who still works with an organisation called EXIT and advises the British Government.  Fiona was a prostitute who came out of prostitution and set up an organisation to encourage other women to find ways out of it.  Implementation of the legislation must be supported by work in other areas.  I do not think the Independent Senators believe we can rely solely on legislation.  The more times we raise the matter and discuss the wider and broader aspects of this, the more we realise that Irish society has not faced up to the cold realities of what prostitution means to women and children and to the men who purchase sex.  We have a collective responsibility to act in the interests of society.  We look to the legislation only in the first instance but we realise that much work remains to be done.  I commend the Independent Senators on tabling this motion and urging the matter on.  I thank the Minister for his continued and clear dedication to the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I was heartened by the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  He has raised a number of very important points.  We in this House must ask ourselves why we are here today.  We are here because the Minister made a commitment that was not adhered to.  Ministers who come to the Seanad will be much more cautious about giving commitments to Members than they were in the past.  The lesson is that if a Minister finds himself or herself where he or she is not able to adhere to a commitment then he or she might warn the House in advance of that failure and request more time to deal with it.</P>
        <P>I read the literature on trafficking and prostitution and the previous statements of various Senators.  I found myself in agreement with the intentions that Senators outlined in their statements.  I do not think that anybody would disagree.  We are all <i>ad idem</i> on the evils of trafficking and prostitution but there is lack of balance in the debate.  The focus is on the criminalisation of the purchase of sex but very little attention is given to the social and economic reasons that people engage in prostitution.  We should give this some attention during the consultation process.  I am sure Senators are aware of the radio interviews on this subject that have taken place in the past number of months.  One interview stood out, where a woman who had difficulties paying her mortgage on the family home engaged in prostitution to pay the bills.  Unfortunately, the situation came across over the airwaves as both very sad but to some extent as risk free, when she explained to the audience how she managed her business of prostitution.  I find it somewhat misleading to the public that most women, or boys and men who engage in prostitution do it because they are poor, by and large, poorly educated or perhaps have drug problems.  The way the problem is presented in recent times is not indicative of the social issues around prostitution.  The fate of the former managing director of the IMF, Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn has not helped in the exposure of the realities of prostitution for most people in Irish society.</P>
        <P>I suggest that we need to look at the economic and social issues around prostitution, but I disagree with some of the comment on the lack of need to look at the legal aspect of the issue.  An issue close to my heart is the Matrimonial Home Bill 1993, which was struck down on a referral to the President.    That legislation sought to equalise the property playing field for women.  After it was struck down similar legislation has failed to see the light of day.  I would warn those who say we should rush to deal with this issue that we should not.  We need to have robust, carefully thought out and very clearly examined legislation.  I would not like to see this very worthy piece of legislation face the same fate as the Matrimonial Home Bill.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This has been a thoughtful and reflective debate.  I begin by thanking all Senators for their contributions, including those who might be at odds with what we propose and those who are with us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the end of the Minister&rsquo;s speech I was reminded of a theory I studied when doing some graduate work a number of years ago, namely ethical education.  We studied the theory that there are two kinds of people, those who are open-minded and those who are of closed minds.  As ethical educators we try to encourage those young people we work with who might appear to be of closed minds to move towards open-mindedness.  With the Minister&rsquo;s speech and reflection he demonstrated himself to be a man who has a character of open-mindedness and is not afraid of a diversity of views.  I hope we can promise we are not either.  As Senator Hayden said, in putting forward the motion we have acknowledged it is important to have a wide-ranging, public, informed debate and hear a diversity of views.  As part of that, evidence, critical analysis, stories, ethical principles and legal analysis will surface.  The best judgment from the Government will come through a discernment on the basis of all of that.  One can only do that if one is open-minded.  It will lead towards, as the Minister stated, something that will be sensible, comprehensive and effective.  I am certain the Minister will agree with the remarks of many Senators that while this is not only about law it does concern law and reform is required.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">On the basis of the items in the Government amendment to our motion, as outlined by Senators Bradford and Cummins, the commitments of the Minister outlined to us on the publication of a report, an approximate timeframe &mdash; we appreciate the need to be flexible and heard the words of Senator O&rsquo;Brien &mdash; and his promise to come back to us to debate this issue we will not press for a vote.</P>
        <P>We will come together on this issue.  We appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s workload.  I wonder if there is anything we can do to help share in that.  I can promise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Go raibh maith agat agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  This day last week the Secretary General of the UN, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, honoured the victims of the Rwandan genocide and stressed that the only way to prevent such atrocities in the future was to learn from history.  He went on to say that the International Criminal Court had become an effective deterrent for would be perpetrators of grave crimes.  What we are talking about is genocide on a scale of barbarity that we do not often see in this world.  I visited Rwanda a couple of years ago and saw at first hand the effects of the genocide.  I met people whose families had been murdered and many young people who were orphaned as a consequence of the genocide, one of whom, Immacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza, was in the House and spoke to a group in the audiovisual room a year ago.  She is the author of a number of books.  I was in her home village when she embraced a man who had killed a number of her cousins.  There is a great sense of forgiveness.  Those who are familiar with her book, <i>Left to Tell,</i> will be aware she hid in the pastures for 90 days with six other females.  When she left late one night to try to find her way to the French forces for protection, she met a friend at the encampment who told her that her mother, father and her two brothers had been killed during the period in which she was locked away.  With American Senators I recall meeting a number of the victims, all of whom pleaded with us to ensure that those responsible be brought to justice and that western countries protecting and hiding these people be encouraged to do so.  I tabled a motion in the House on the issue.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that the President of Rwanda, Mr. Paul Kagame, has accused western countries of failing to stop genocide suspects in their territory and to bring them to account.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">As we remember those we lost, some of those who killed them are still moving freely in some capitals of the so-called free world.  There is little effort to apprehend them and when this happens it is a token meant to blind us and give us the impression that they are doing justice.  They are released shortly afterwards, yet when acts of terrorism are committed against their people the whole world is mobilised, in fact, sometimes forced to join in the search for those criminals so that they can be brought to justice.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The specific case I am putting to the Minister deals with a French-Rwandan man, Mr. Claude Muhayimana, who is 51 years of age.  For the first time ever, a French court has ruled on an international arrest warrant to have him extradited to Rwanda in order that the accused can face the charges of taking part in genocide and crimes against humanity.  The extradition can only go ahead if the French Government is in accord with that.  In the past the French Government has never extradited its citizens to Rwanda even though it had involvement there and, some would say, was a contributory party to what subsequently emerged in Rwanda.  I ask that Ireland, as a concerned country and particularly as one who is seeking to join the UN Council of Human Rights, support the call and encourage the French Government to allow this man face justice in Rwanda rather than sidestepping Rwandan justice and taking him elsewhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 800,000 people were killed between April and July 1994.  The President, Mr. Paul Kagame, said it appeared Rwandan lives, and similarly Africans lives, were less valued than the lives of citizens of western countries.  We cannot have one law for the developed western world and a different law for African countries.  There is no hierarchy of life and I urge the Minister to encourage the French Government to move in that direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for the absence of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who has asked me to take the matter on his behalf.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, Rwanda commemorated the lives lost in the genocide 18 years ago.  International partners, including Ireland, emphasised our admiration for the resilience displayed by the Rwandan people in the past two decades and the enormous strides they have made in recovering from the disastrous after-effects of the genocide.</P>
        <P>The horrific events of 1994 represent one of the darkest episodes in human history.  The genocide of the Tutsi and moderate Hutu and associated crimes against humanity resulted in the death of up to one million people and brought unimaginable suffering and trauma to millions more.  We should never forget these events.  We should learn from the lessons that they provide for us, and we should continue to be prepared to play our part in addressing the ongoing consequences of the genocide and to make sure that it never happens again.</P>
        <P>Rwanda has made important progress in ensuring that the country and its people can recover sustainability, by putting in place mechanisms to improve peace and security, achieve national reconciliation and to reform the democratic and political institutions of the state.  Rwanda is now one of the most stable countries in the African Great Lakes region.  Its stability is underpinned by strong levels of economic growth and good economic governance, and Rwanda has won praise from international donors for its innovative approach to development.</P>
        <P>The Government is very clear in its position that those responsible for the genocide and associated crimes against humanity in Rwanda should be held accountable for their actions.  More generally, we are convinced of the clear obligation on all states to investigate, prosecute and punish genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes falling within their jurisdiction.  We are also clear that the criminal justice system must at all stages &mdash; investigation, trial and punishment &mdash; respect the fundamental rights of all persons involved, including those suspected, accused and convicted of such crimes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator has raised the specific case of an individual who is the subject of court proceedings in France on foot of an international arrest warrant issued in December 2011 relating to a request for his extradition to Rwanda to face charges for taking part in genocide, and crimes against humanity.  I understand from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade that this matter is currently the subject of court proceedings in France and in the circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the case.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I emphasise that the Government remains committed to working with the government and people of Rwanda to assist them complete their recovery and move forward towards a future of peace, reconciliation, and social and economic development and better lives for all Rwandans.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his response.  I am encouraged by much of what he has said.  However, I ask him to convey to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade my concern at the comment that a French court is still considering the matter.  Two weeks ago the matter was disposed of by a French court which ruled that the extradition was lawful and should proceed.  I concede it may be open to appeal; that is a possibility.  My information is that it cannot proceed without the French Government giving its accord to the decision of the court; in other words, the court is not the final arbiter.  I ask that we encourage the French Government to do this.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">While in Rwanda I attended the Gacaca courts.  These are community courts which were set up because of the huge number of people involved in the terrible atrocities and the fact that they would never get through the international criminal court in Tanzania.  They dealt with people who were involved in the genocide but were not the instigators or leaders.  It was a three judge court.  I observed some of the cases taking place where I had an interpreter who translated what was being said.  Having spoken with community groups, the process was considered to be fair.  The thrust of it was to encourage the people to expunge their guilt but also to enable them re-enter society and their local communities.  I was impressed by the whole process of reconciliation in Rwanda.  I would like to see the Rwandan courts getting to grips with somebody who is accused.  I agree with the Minister that the person is only accused at this stage and obviously the courts will have to determine whether he is guilty.  Given the nature and magnitude of the atrocities, I would like to see Rwanda get the chance to do that.  There would be sufficient international and moral pressure on Rwanda to show the progress it has made in dealing with the case in a fair and judicial way and I would like to see it avail of the opportunity.  I am worried if the T&aacute;naiste feels that it is still in the courts and has not been discharged.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Government to review the Garda superannuation scheme in order to provide justice and fairness for a number of former members, 81 in total, who have been deprived of their preserved retirement benefits due to the fact that they were dismissed or left the service prior to 1 October 1976.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na superannuation scheme was introduced by way of statutory instrument, SI 63/1925.  Section 13 of the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act 1925 is the primary legislation on which it is based.  From 1 October 1976, if a garda with a minimum of five years service after that date but less than 30 years service resigned or was dismissed, the superannuation benefits are preserved to age 60.  These arrangements were introduced to the Garda superannuation scheme with effect from 1 October 1976 by way of Agreed Report No. 218 of the Garda Conciliation Council.  No provision was made to provide superannuation benefits for those former garda&iacute; who left for any reason before 1 October 1976, except in certain circumstances where they subsequently took up another appointment in the public service.  To date these agreed reports have not been incorporated into a statutory instrument and are only being operated on an administrative basis.  On the other hand, Civil Service arrangements for preserved benefits, including their cut-off point of 1 June 1973, have been incorporated into legislation by way of SI 188/1 980 of the Superannuation Act 1909.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na superannuation preservation of benefits scheme was introduced on 1 October 1976.  This scheme required a minimum of five years service for qualification to its benefits.  However, the preservation of benefits superannuation scheme for civil servants was introduced with effect from 1 June 1973 &mdash; three years and five months ahead of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was not until the pre-1 October 1976 group of former garda&iacute;, who were then approaching the age of 60, began to make inquiries about their entitlements that they became aware that they were excluded from the superannuation scheme by the arbitrary cut-off date of 1 October 1976.  Opinion was then sought from Mr. Gerard Hogan, senior counsel.  In his opinion, Mr. Hogan states: &ldquo;this wrong is now beyond the capacity of the legal system to redress&rdquo; and goes on to state that members of the Oireachtas &ldquo;ought, in justice, to rectify this wrong by means of the enactment of legislation to cater for the very discrete category of pre-1976 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;.  Mr. Hogan further states that &ldquo;there is also the point that legislation was passed retrospectively to enable former Ministers to apply to preserve their ministerial pension entitlement, even though they had not done so in time in the past&rdquo;.  This was referring to a remedy for the former Minister for Education and Science, Mr. Michael Woods, who had inadvertently missed applying for a pension entitlement by a due date under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act.</P>
        <P>In light of this, is it now possible for the Minister to initiate a process whereby this relatively small cohort of former garda&iacute; will be able to access a preserved pension?  They have right on their side and my opinion is shared by Members of the House on all sides.  The cost factor would be very small due to the small number of people and the small number of years of service involved.  It would bring closure to a long campaign for justice, spearheaded by Councillor Pat Hynes of Galway County Council and his colleagues.  I thank the Minister for his attendance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter and I am pleased to be able to set out the factual position.  It is important to say the terms and conditions of pension schemes have and continue to evolve over the years.  New terms and conditions are introduced with effect from a specific date and apply to members of the scheme from that date onwards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prior to 1 October 1976, where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resigned or was dismissed before reaching the age and service at which he could retire on pension, that member forfeited all superannuation benefits under the then Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na superannuation scheme.  This situation was changed following discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council, the industrial relations machinery for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was agreed at that time by both sides, the official side and the Garda representative associations and endorsed by the then Minister for Finance, that the new arrangements should apply to members of the force serving on or after 1 October 1976.  By extension these new terms did not and cannot apply to members who had left the force prior to that date.  These discussions concluded in what are known as agreed reports.  Generally speaking, these agreed reports provide that a garda who resigned or was dismissed on or after 1 October 1976 can have superannuation benefits, accrued to the date of resignation or dismissal, preserved until the member reached 60 years of age.  As I have said, there was no provision for the preservation of superannuation benefits in the case of members who resigned or who were dismissed prior to 1 October 1976.</P>
        
        <P>The then Department of Finance, and now Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which continues to have overall responsibility for public service pension matters, agreed with the proposals for a cut-off date for eligibility for preserved benefits.  This date varies depending on the particular organisation involved and the conclusion of negotiations between management and the relevant staff interests.  For example, the cut-off date for civil servants was agreed by all parties to be 1 June 1973.  Equally, the cut-off date for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was agreed by all parties to be 1 October 1976.  I must stress that this was an agreed date between all of the parties involved in the discussions and was not imposed.  It is an inevitable consequence of the introduction of improvements in pension schemes that members of that scheme who had left it prior to the effective date cannot avail of that benefit.</P>
        <P>There have been numerous representations made to my Department on this particular matter and we have been in touch with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the general question.  The Department of Finance has stated in the past that it is not possible to resolve a case individually on an administrative basis and it would not, therefore, be possible to provide an individual with preserved benefits without changing the terms of the scheme retrospectively.  Such amendment would, in equity, have to cover all public servants who resigned prior to the effective date.  The Department of Finance has further stated that changing the various schemes to change the cut-off date is not a practicable proposition and there were no proposals to backdate the existing dates for the introduction of the preservation of superannuation benefits. I am sorry that I do not have better news for the Senator.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response.  It does not surprise me because I have seen the file of various representations made in this regard.  At the heart of the matter lies, for a small group of people, a sense of injustice for which they do not seem to be able to get closure.  They are not pursuing it for monetary reasons but as a matter of principle.  They may have to revert to other channels to address the matter, legal or otherwise, but that is a matter for them.  I thank the Minister for his understanding and response.</P>

        <P>I hope this was covered in the translation.  I think it possibly was.  I asked a question on the number of garda&iacute; stationed in Gaeltacht areas at present, five years ago and ten years ago and their capability to deliver a service in Irish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  I am afraid I am not as proficient as he is as Gaeilge and hope he will forgive me if I respond in English.  The position on the provision of services in Irish by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an issue of some importance.  The House is aware that the allocation of resources is a matter for the Commissioner and his senior management team.  He has informed me that the personnel strength in areas referred to by the Senator are as follows: 585 in Galway; 304 in Mayo; 436 in Donegal; 296 in Meath; 307 in Kerry; 290 in Waterford; 678 in Cork city; 303 in north Cork; and 310 in west Cork.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been substantial increases in these numbers in the past ten years and I am circulating a table showing the strength at present, five years ago and ten years ago.  A substantial number of Garda members serving in the relevant Garda divisions have been and are in receipt of the specific Gaeltacht allowance.  The table shows that a substantial number of Garda personnel continue to be paid the allowance to cater for areas where members of the force are required to be proficient in Irish.  Details of further Garda members who can also carry out their duties in Irish are not readily available.</P>
        <P>The payment of the allowance is determined on the basis of Garda districts.  A Garda headquarters circular sets out the conditions for the deployment or payment of the Gaeltacht allowances to Garda personnel serving in the &ldquo;fior&rdquo; and &ldquo;breac&rdquo; Gaeltacht areas in the divisions of Galway west, Donegal and Kerry.  The Garda authorities advise that the term &ldquo;fior&rdquo; in the concept of Garda usage denotes a Gaeltacht area where Irish is the main vernacular of the local population, whereas the term &ldquo;breac&rdquo; signifies a Gaeltacht area where English is, in the main, the more dominant language of the local population.  Additionally, I understand from the Garda authorities that the arrangements for the payment of Gaeltacht allowances are being examined by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>Section 33 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 prescribes that the Garda Commissioner shall, in so far as is practicable, ensure that members of the organisation stationed in a district which includes a Gaeltacht area have sufficient Irish competency to perform their duties.  Additionally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed and introduced a scheme under section 11 of the Official Languages Act 2003 to enhance current Irish language services provided by the organisation.  As part of that scheme, each divisional officer has nominated an inspector to co-ordinate the divisional arrangements and to monitor achievements against the specific commitments set down in the scheme.</P>
        <P>I would also emphasise that conducting business through Irish is part of the language curriculum delivered to all Garda trainees in the Garda College.  In addition, arrangements have been made to ensure that if a member of the force cannot provide an immediate service through Irish when a member of the public requests it, an Irish-proficient member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be contacted and made available.  I assure the Senator that the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are, and will continue to be, strongly committed to the Irish language.</P>

It may be just a review of how it operates in practice in the context of the numbers availing of it and their proficiency in the language.  I am not aware of any major event about to happen in the context of this matter.  I was simply informed when we made contact with the Commissioner&rsquo;s office that he is reviewing the manner in which matters are working.  I am sure if there are developments in this regard I will be informed and with the greatest of pleasure I will pass on to the Senator any information that arises.</P>
