      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Statute Law Revision Bill 2012 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 3.30 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 3.20 p.m.; No. 2, statements on symphysiotomy, to be taken at 3.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 4.50 p.m.; and No. 3, Education (Amendment) Bill 2012 [Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il] &mdash; Report Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 and the time allocated shall not exceed one hour.  For the information of the House, following yesterday&rsquo;s requests on the Order of Business, there will be an addition to the schedule of business tomorrow to allow statements on the 44th plenary session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly to be taken for an hour between the items already listed on the schedule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask a question about the proposed change to tomorrow&rsquo;s business.  Can the Deputy Leader confirm whether the Taoiseach will come to the House for the one-hour debate on the recent meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly?  As I said yesterday, the Taoiseach rightly saw fit to come to the Seanad Chamber to address members of other parliaments from other jurisdictions, but he has not seen fit to step into this Chamber to speak to and interact with the elected Members of this House at any stage during his 14 months in office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps tomorrow&rsquo;s debate might give him an opportunity to do so.  Last evening&rsquo;s debate on the mortgage crisis and the mortgage arrears situation, during which we made statements and asked questions of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, was long overdue but very useful.  Some excellent contributions were made by Senators on all sides of the House.  It was clear to me that the Government is being led by the nose by the banks, in effect, on the mortgage issue.  The Government has been frightened into paralysis, rather than dealing with the mortgage arrears crisis.  Figures on distressed mortgages for the first quarter of 2012 will be published next week.  The figures for the last quarter of 2011 showed there had been an increase of five percentage points in a single year, from 7.4% to over 12%, in the number of mortgages in arrears of 90 days or more.</P>
        <P>I ask Senators of all parties and none to consider a motion I will circulate next week.  This House can play an important role, in a non-partisan fashion, by agreeing to call on the Government to set out a clear timeline for the introduction of a strategy, comprising plans and actions, to help the thousands of Irish citizens who are in terrible positions with regard to their mortgages.  Many people fear they will not have a house over their head next year.  Members of this House have played a role in trying to solve this problem by introducing legislation, which was defeated by three votes last summer, unfortunately.  Our role is to hold the Government to account.  We can do that by agreeing a cross-party motion calling on the Government to set out a timeframe that it will meet.  It is interesting that we were told yesterday that something will be produced in August and that the Central Bank will do something by the end of May.  We were also told that the Government is producing the personal insolvency Bill, which is a complex piece of legislation.  I was concerned yesterday when the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, said &ldquo;the personal insolvency legislation will be the ultimate game-changer&rdquo;.  I honestly cannot see how that will be the case.  I will circulate the motion I have mentioned among the party and group leaders next week.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by asking the Deputy Leader whether the Government can confirm its position on Greece&rsquo;s continuing membership of the euro.  Frankly, I was astounded to hear the comments that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, made about Greece on Bloomberg.  He is reported to have said that &ldquo;apart from holidaying in the Greek islands, I think most Irish people don&rsquo;t have a lot&rdquo; of connections with Greece.  He continued by asking &ldquo;if you go into the shops here, apart from feta cheese, how many Greek items do you put in your basket?&rdquo;.  Comments like that are extremely insensitive to fellow EU citizens who are struggling.  People in Athens are rummaging in bins to feed themselves.  This is a serious situation.  The Minister&rsquo;s comments show how out of step he is.  Having spoken to Irish people, I know they have grave concerns about the people of Greece and feel for the situation they are in through no fault of their own.  The Minister went on to say that &ldquo;for big, knock-on effects you need to have strong economic connections&rdquo; and &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have any economic connections, really&rdquo; with Greece.  Is Ireland moving away from Greece?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, people on the Government side rightly criticised Austria, in particular, for talking about a Greek exit from the euro.  We are either in the euro or we are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concluding now.  This is really important.  I would like the Deputy Leader to comment on the statement the Minister for Finance made on Bloomberg.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, seems to make statements to international news media that he is not prepared to make to the media here.  Is the Government committed to Greece staying in the euro?  Will the Minister withdraw the insensitive and flippant remarks he made about a country that has youth unemployment of over 50% and a male unemployment rate of over 25%?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It ill behoves the leader of the main Opposition group in this House to criticise the Taoiseach.  As I said yesterday, he is the most amiable and approachable Taoiseach who ever stood in shoe leather in these Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe he has informed the Leader of the House that he will come to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;unlike some of his colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I gather from the Leader, who is absent today, that he intends to come to this House before the summer recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Please God.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will hear more about that.  The Senators opposite will recall that a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach came to this House twice or three times over a ten-year period.</P>

	<P>I do not want to be critical of any former Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Deputy Leader?</P>

	<P>I want to deal with another matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has to accountable for what he has said about the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Senator is way off beam.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>He would not be Taoiseach today if he did not get the support of Senator Coghlan and his friends in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden has missed a more senior person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>He would never have survived without certain Members of this House, including the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>More seriously&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is inviting trouble.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not.  I do not intend to.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien has misquoted the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  The Minister for Finance said that the Government, on behalf of this country, intends to do everything within the Union to assist our colleagues in Greece.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Senator make of his comments about Greece?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said that Ireland will do all it can at EU level to hold Greece within the euro, if possible.  He made it clear that he is putting no obstacles in the way of Greece&rsquo;s future in the Union and in the euro.  That conference is something else.  With respect, the Senator is misquoting the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I am talking about what he said on Bloomberg.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am telling the Senator that he is misquoting the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Am I?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Coghlan have a question for the Deputy Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to hearing what the Deputy Leader has to say on these matters.  Perhaps she will be more categoric that I can be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Senator Quinn, raised the matter of the missing children&rsquo;s hotline, 116000, on the Order of Business yesterday.  The theme of this year&rsquo;s international missing children&rsquo;s day, which is 25 May, is child abduction safety.  Senators will be aware that 25 May will also mark the first anniversary of this Seanad.  It would be fitting if the hotline could be in place and operational by that date.  On 12 October last, the Seanad agreed an all-party, all-group motion calling for the missing children&rsquo;s hotline to be brought fully into operation.  Since then, ComReg has allocated the number in question to the service.  I welcome the changed message that now directs anybody who rings 116000 to the Garda or to the ISPCC Childline.  I note that the number cannot be telephoned from an Oireachtas handset.  Hopefully, we will not have to report it.  I will follow that issue up with the Oireachtas authorities.  The number has been allocated but the service is not yet in operation.  Similar hotlines in other EU member states take calls from and offer support to anyone concerned about a missing child, including parents and children.  They take calls regarding different types of child disappearance, including runaways, parental abductions, missing unaccompanied migrant minors, criminal abductions and children who are lost, injured or otherwise missing.</P>
        <P>The EU has been asking Ireland for five years to put this hotline in place.  It is not too much to ask for the Government to ensure it is fully operational by 25 May next.  Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to come before this House at the earliest opportunity to confirm that the hotline will be operational by 25 May?  If the hotline will not be up and running by that date, will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister the reason for such a delay?  I suggest that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, should outline the plans of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to publicise and promote the missing children&rsquo;s hotline so that Ireland is not a missing link in child abduction cases.  We need to ensure that every child in Ireland, including those who might be going away over the summer, knows this number.  They should be made aware that if they are in another EU member state, they can ring the number and talk to someone who can help them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>On this happy day, 24 hours after President Obama in the White House publicly announced to the world that he was honouring Robbie Keane for being the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s leading scorer, I would like to ask the Deputy Leader to bring to the attention of the relevant Minister during this, the year of science, that there are two other Irish people who, I believe, deserve recognition.</P>
        <P>One of them is Professor Ernest Walton, RIP, who still has the unique distinction of being the only Irish recipient of any Nobel prize in science, a man who made a wonderful contribution to science when he was a very young researcher working with Cockcroft in the 1920s in Cambridge.  The Cockcroft and Walton experiment led to the first splitting of the atom.  Walton then returned to Ireland where he had a very serious and giving career in Trinity College, Dublin, as an academic and, following his retirement, in other advisory capacities.  He also acted as an adviser to the Irish Government on science issues in an unofficial capacity and is felt to have been one of the original inspirers of the modernisation revolution which Lemass and others attempted to introduce into Ireland in the late 1950s and early 1960s.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested on some of the online sites today that the new bridge being built across the Liffey at Marlborough Street close to Trinity College should be named the Ernest Walton bridge.  This would be a very fine accolade.  He has a number of structures named after him in academic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The naming of a bridge is a matter for the local authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>The second item I would like the Deputy Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and to any of my Seanad colleagues who may be from Cavan, is that there is another wholly unsung heroine of Irish science, Dr. Mary Patricia Cole, born in Cavan and educated in Carrickfergus, Portrush, Coleraine High School, Methodist College and Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast.  Following her bachelor of science and after a period of teaching, she went back to do a medical degree and then moved to the Christie hospital in Manchester as one of the first clinical oncology cancer treating doctors in the United Kingdom or, indeed, anywhere in the world, and there did the first trial with a drug called tamoxifen, which has probably saved or extended the lives of many millions of women around the world.  Dr. Cole, following her retirement, became heavily involved in the hospice movement and, when she was at a great age, finally retired back to her beloved Northern Ireland &mdash; her beloved Ireland &mdash; dying in Newcastle some seven or eight years ago.</P>
        <P>It strikes me that this lady, born in Cavan, who went on to make such a major contribution internationally in medical research should in some sense be memorialised, perhaps in Cavan and perhaps in Cavan hospital.  We memorialise people for all kinds of reasons in Ireland but these are two very fine researchers who blazed a great trail and whose efforts in many ways have not been exceeded by anybody else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator van Turnhout in her call for a hotline to be set up.  On another issue, until March of this year dentists working with the HSE were able to carry out minor orthodontic procedures, including taking impressions and some orthodontic interventions, at a cost of approximately &euro;250 to &euro;300 per child.  Given orthodontic treatment is generally &euro;4,500, this was a huge saving to the HSE.  Since March, without any discussion or warning, dentists have been advised they can no longer carry out these procedures and that the funding has been withdrawn.  This has come as a huge shock to many, and I know of a number of dental clinics in Kerry that have closed down, necessitating parents to travel many miles to visit the school dentist.</P>
        <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to debate the issue.  This should not have been done without debate and discussion and he should explain the reasoning behind this.  I call for the reintroduction of this scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a discussion with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in regard to RTE in general but in particular the case settled on 8 May that awarded over &euro;100,000 in costs and expenses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter was dealt with yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was raised by Senator Leyden himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; boycotted any coverage last night, as I predicted.  In fact, there was a blackout of news&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter was dealt with.  This is the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We are the licence holders and we expect fair play.  Anything referring to this issue is now being blacked out.</P>
        <P>Two very brave journalists, Mr. Philip Ryan of the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday</i> and Mr. Jim Cusack of the <i>Sunday Independent </i>will not let go of this issue because there is a serious question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss this on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business, as you well know.  Have you a question for the Deputy Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the Minister to come to the House so I can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris, please.  Senator Leyden should continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;so I can put questions to the Minister in regard to the allegations he made about Mr. Bailey on radio on a Sunday in 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>You are looking for the Minister to come in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Government is getting a very easy ride from RTE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can put those points to the Minister when he comes in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>RTE is now very much under the control of Pat Rabbitte because he threatened&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, please.  You have to give the Minister his proper title.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Pat Rabbitte.  He threatened to remove the board and the chairman but when the case was settled, everything was happy in the garden again.  There is a cover-up here and I intend to expose it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the matter of young people who have dropped out of school.  On Monday I had the pleasure of launching a website for the Cork Life Centre whereby 30 young people are being provided with education and skills training, bringing them back into the education system.  In fairness, it is a religious order which has been providing the funding for this project in recent years.  There are approximately 20 people working on a voluntary basis, many of them qualified teachers who cannot get employment.  This year, six of the young people who dropped out of school will be sitting the leaving certificate as a result of the efforts of these volunteers.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The problem for the centre is that it is falling between a number of different Departments, including the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is a matter that needs to be dealt with as those providing the funding cannot provide it indefinitely.  I ask that the Deputy Leader would arrange for a debate to deal with these issues.  The problem arises at a number of other centres which are being set up throughout the country given young people are dropping out of the education system.  I ask that a Department would take hold of this issue and make sure the proper support mechanisms are provided.</P>

	<P>I beg the pardon of the House.  I see it is listed as statements rather than Private Members&rsquo; business.  Nonetheless, I congratulate the Labour Party on that.</P>
        <P>I do not congratulate anybody on the fact a strange lack of courtesy is creeping into this House.  For the first time, the Leader and Deputy Leader are refusing to answer questions if Members are not in the House.  This is a gross impertinence.  Members often have to leave to attend committees and to take urgent messages.  I have always tried to apologise if I had to leave to attend a committee and the answer should be on the record.  It is a sign of the growing arrogance of this Government.</P>
        <P>Where did this document I am holding come from, can anybody tell me?  It is clearly a Government publication, although it is anonymous.  It is in defence of the so-called stability treaty and some 60 copies were given to every Member of this House.  Who is paying for it?  How dare they do this?  As an ordinary Member, I am not allowed to circulate material in this manner.  This is the kind of arrogant Government we are getting now.  I prefer this kind of focused concentration rather than the kind of scatter-gun approach of Senator Leyden but, in essence, he is right &mdash; it is arrogant.</P>
        <P>I would like to know whether we can have access to the minutes of the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where it was decided, in defiance of tradition, that on Second Stage we could not share time.  Who proposed that?  Whose idea was it?</P>

I would like a copy of the minutes of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to know who proposed it and how it was discussed.  As a Member, I believe I am entitled to that.  Otherwise, I will make a freedom of information request for it.  That committee should be run by the Members and chaired by the Cathaoirleach.  With regard to outside influence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yes.  Can we have a debate on political standards and fairness?  Can we also have a debate on the way in which the treaty is being handled?  The Referendum Commission was not established within the proper timeframe and now its members seem to be acting as Supreme Court judges.  They are not just giving information on the treaty, but are telling us what the Supreme Court would say if certain issues were raised.  That is beyond its remit and commission members should know that.</P>
        <P>We are entitled to respect for this House.  I see a situation growing in which some Members and some groups in this House are, apparently, co-operating with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s desire to close this House down.  Every time we restrict speaking and every time we refuse to be democratic, we are denying our own heritage &mdash; the thing for which we were created and for which we have a distinguished record &mdash; namely, the proper scrutiny and analysis of legislation.  We are being deliberately frustrated in this.  This House, as a talking shop, is being effectively shut down.  I would like to see a little more respect for it.</P>

	<P>Thank you.  I have a question related to the environment.  Many people go out walking, jogging and cycling and in the summer time in particular they notice how many cans and bottles are on the sides of the roads, country roads in particular.  We are trying to attract tourists here.  In countries like Germany and other European countries the practice is &mdash; like we did years ago &mdash; to charge a refundable deposit on bottles and cans.  The Minister should consider reintroducing this.  In Germany, the deposit is 30 cent and this is returned when the can or bottle is returned, which cuts out throwing them away.  Years ago here, people collected cans and bottles and returned them to shops for a refund.  The Germans, Swiss and French are environmentally correct and charge people a deposit.  Will the Minister, if he is in this House in the near future, consider putting a refundable levy on cans and bottles so that they are not chucked over hedges or into parks because it is too much bother to recycle them?  This waste is a cost for local authorities.  The issue is dealt with efficiently in Europe and we should look at doing the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need here and in Europe for a proper jobs plan to get people back to work.  We need immediate, realistic and deliverable plans that will create jobs for all of those who are currently out of work.  It is interesting that there is a shift in the European debate away from austerity, cuts and the kind of approach that has been adopted up to now towards a focus on the need for investment and growth.  There is an opportunity for this House to play an important role in that debate.  I do not see why we cannot have a full day&rsquo;s debate in the House on the need for a growth strategy and agenda.  We should even invite in parliamentarians from outside this jurisdiction and from across Europe and trade unionists and business people.  We need to know what exactly Europe means when it speaks of a growth agenda and we need to see tangible plans from the Government with regard to what that will mean.</P>
        <P>There is a responsibility on every party and grouping to put forward proposals.  We launched our proposals yesterday and they are not that dissimilar to those called for by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU.  I am sure there are many other ideas from other political parties also.  Irrespective of the referendum campaign which will take its course over the next number of weeks, given what is happening and the need for growth across the eurozone, there is an opportunity for this House to play a reading role in developing proposals.  I urge the deputy Leader to take this on board.  It would be very useful for this House to invite in parliamentarians from across Europe who have ideas on how we can create jobs, investment, growth and real stability in Europe.  We should also invite in trade unionists and business leaders and anybody else who has ideas to contribute to what would be a worthwhile exercise and debate in this House.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the issue of youth mental health.  A survey carried out by Headstrong under the auspices of Dr. Barbara Dooley from UCD has found that one in three young people has experienced mental health problems.  This is serious.  This significant survey of over 14,000 teenagers and young adults found that many young people who had engaged in harmful drinking behaviour or been classed as alcohol dependent sustained a significantly higher element of mental stress.  Some 7% of young adults reported a suicide attempt.  This is alarming.  Dr. Dooley has said that we must see youth mental health as a national priority.  It is a priority.  I read a report from Pieta House some time ago and it has seen a 93% increase in referrals to it this year of young people for self harm.  This is and should be a priority.</P>
        <P>I am calling for the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss this.  Perhaps the debate could be linked with the issue raised by Senator Colm Burke.  The Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should come together and we could have some joined up thinking on this.  The report found that if everybody had one supportive adult, it would not cost the earth to put something in place that would ensure young people had someone to talk to.  I call on the Minister for Health to produce a policy for youth mental health.  It is a national issue and emergency and we need to do something about it.  I call for the Minister come to the House to make a statement on the issue.</P>

        <P>While addressing the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in this Chamber on Monday last, the Taoiseach, in response to a question posed, stated that the dissident republican and loyalist paramilitaries continued to pose a real threat not only to Northern Ireland, but to this State.  This is the same Taoiseach who presided over a Government decision to close D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Army barracks in Cavan town just over a month and a half ago.  I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, come into the House  today to outline the reason D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks, the most economical barracks under the jurisdiction of the forces here and the most economical barracks in Europe, costing a little over &euro;250,000 a year to run, was closed.  Why did the Government take the decision to close this barracks while it knows that a significant threat remains?  This threat has even been outlined by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland.  Why did the Government take a decision to close a modern Army barracks located just eight miles from the Cavan-Fermanagh Border?</P>

If there was a security alert along that part of the Border, security personnel would take six hours to arrive there from the nearest barracks in Athlone.  What chaos would arise in the meantime?

	<P>Several months ago my group in the Seanad raised the issue of assistance for small businesses.  One of the matters discussed was procurement and public tendering.  The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, was forthcoming in regard to the need to assist small businesses by keeping public tenders in this country to the greatest extent possible.  My colleague, Senator Kelly, pointed out that tenders for major roadwork projects were being awarded to companies from Spain, Greece, Turkey and other places.  The Minister of State advised us that public procurement meetings were being held across the country.  I ask that he intercede with the management of the national procurement service to arrange an information session for Deputies and Senators in the AV room so that we can advise the people from small businesses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Over the weekend the Irish Pharmacy Union issued a statement about fatalities from cardiovascular disease and the fact that we can do something about it.  The union called for a heart disease screening programme to be implemented.  A considerable number of people die from heart attacks and strokes but making defibrillators available would save a large proportion of these people from death.  It would not necessarily cost the State anything if every organisation employing 100 people or more made at least one defibrillator available.  This is an initiative that has been pursued in a number of countries in Europe and it is something we could introduce here in order to save lives.</P>

	<P>Yesterday NAMA came in for considerable criticism in this House.  I have seen some of the good work the agency is doing behind the scenes, for example, in making developments safe.  It is providing money through the financial institutions but it cannot say this publicly because of data protection laws covering its debtors.</P>
        <P>There is exciting news with the Volvo race returning to Galway this summer.  It will be in Galway between 30 June and 9 July.  I can promise sun, magic and amazing times.  We expect 750,000 people to visit Galway and it has been confirmed this morning that one third of the world media in attendance will come from China.  The Taoiseach recently paid an exciting and beneficial visit to China and the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, made announcements regarding exports.</P>
        <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come to the House to speak about the measures that are being implemented by his Department and how we can address the issue of youth unemployment.  Perhaps there is also a Chinese dimension in the solution to youth unemployment.  It is a cause for concern that 30% of our young people are unemployed.  Youth unemployment is running wild across Europe, with rates of 50% in Spain and Italy.  This House must be concerned about the issue given the effect that it had on world history in the last century.</P>

	<P>The Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture is at present meeting representatives from the BAI and RTE regarding the report on the Fr. Reynolds case.  I offer my apologies to the Deputy Leader because I will be going to that meeting as soon as I have finished speaking.  I call for a debate on the report.  On Monday the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly discussed RTE in this Chamber.  It would be appropriate for the Seanad to have a similar discussion.  RTE faces numerous challenges, not least of which is in the financial area.  Question also arise in regard to impartiality in politics&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>You can say that again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;social issues and religion.  The BAI report reminded us that section 39(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 requires broadcaster to ensure:</P>
        <P LI="1">the broadcast treatment of current affairs, including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate, is fair to all interests concerned and that the broadcast matter is presented in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of his or her own views</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Act also requires that the privacy of individuals is not unreasonably encroached on.  Clearly I did not study the legislation as thoroughly as I ought to have done while it was before this House.  It does not reflect the RTE that exists today.  The Act&rsquo;s requirements are honoured in the breach more than in the observance.  We have seen many pro-abortion people being promoted on RTE but last week a group of women who regretted their abortions had to take a full page advertisement in the newspapers because they cannot get the same visibility.  My own party raised the issue of RTE&rsquo;s bias against us.  Members will be familiar with the case involving a &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; presenter who had to be removed because of her lack of impartiality.  This occurred following revelations published in a newspaper.</P>

	<P>I am glad Senator Keane drew our attention to the Headstrong survey.  This is an issue which I have raised regularly and I will not stop doing so until we make an impact.  Headstrong surveyed 14,000 young people in this country and found that one in three had mental health problems.  One fifth had considered self-harm and six out of ten were stressed about their financial situation.  The economic situation of the country is affecting our young people.  The alcohol consumption of almost 60% of 17 to 25-year-olds fell outside the normal parameters set down by the World Health Organization.  There is a clear connection between alcohol consumption and mental health.  It is well known in adults and it cannot be denied in respect of our youths.  I join Senator C&aacute;it Keane in calling for a debate on youth mental health.  The clear link with alcohol is undeniable.  We must have an urgent, joined-up approach.  Monkey sees as monkey does and there is a clear problem with drink in this country and in our culture.  Unless we tackle it in a serious way in the short term, the health and mental health implications will be insurmountable.  I call for an urgent debate with various Ministers, as Senator Keane suggested.  We need it next week.  I have been talking about this since the day I was elected but something must be done.  The Seanad should be the House where we really tackle this issue.</P>

Lest we be dismayed about the power of the Seanad and its Senators, a number of Senators wield great power.

	<P>It raises issues and questions.  This morning I sought clarification from Galway City Council because we need a debate on peaceful protest.  I was at a joint policing committee meeting in Galway city a few months ago when the chief superintendent categorically said that the encampment was not breaking the law.  No one at the meeting, politicians or city council representative, was able to say which law was being broken.  The chief superintendent has since been promoted and I congratulate him on it.  We have a new chief superintendent and apparently the Occupy Galway group is now in violation of the law.  I have sought clarification on the law under which they were removed and I am led to believe the legislation is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act.  I would welcome the attendance of the Minister for Justice and Equality because it is important to have a debate on the right to protest and on what is peaceful protest.</P>

I compliment the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the manner in which it was handled.  It is a much used amenity site in the centre of Galway city and it was being illegally occupied.  It was in the interests of everyone that it is ended.</P>
        <P>I support my colleague, Senator Catherine Noone, on her call for an urgent debate on the impact of alcohol on young people and their mental health.  I support her call that it is held as a matter of urgency.  Many people are exercised about this issue and it would be timely to have a debate.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement by the Rehab Group to create 750 additional jobs over the next three years, of which 400 will be based in Ireland.  Some of the jobs displaced by Rehab in Galway in recent times, which was highlighted by Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, will be replaced as a result of the positive announcement.  I compliment the Rehab Group on providing health, social care, education and training services to 56,000 people in Ireland.  It is fantastic to see the group expanding its range of services and creating much-needed employment.  I hope some of the employment will be created in Galway, where there was great disappointment when jobs in the Rehab Group were lost recently.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business by Senator Diarmuid Wilson.  I ask the Deputy Leader if she can ascertain from the Minister for Justice and Equality what has happened to the much talked about appointment of a military judge.  In a debate last July, I was told I was delaying the process and that if it was not sorted out within a number of weeks, the entire military system of justice would come crashing down.  The former Minister for Defence, Tony Killeen, was condemned for not acting swiftly before he left office almost 18 months ago.  Senator Wilson talked about the closure of the Cavan and Clonmel barracks and during those heated debates I questioned whether there was a necessity for a military judge.  A military judge must be at least Circuit Court status and I see the cost per year at &euro;500,000.  We have an army that is diminishing year by year and perhaps an ordinary Circuit Court judge could be seconded for two or three weeks to do the necessary work.  My understanding is that a couple of weeks work covers it.  In a similar vein, the admiralty division of the High Court is dealt with by an ordinary High Court judge.  Admiralty issues are rare and military court-martial and complaints are as scarce as teeth in a duck.  The Government should reflect on the cost, leaving out the political appointment.  It will cost the State &euro;500,000 a year to do work that a Circuit Court judge could do if seconded for one week each quarter.  Has the appointment been proceeded with, what are the costs and is it really necessary, having regard to the fact that the &euro;500,000 could be spent on the retention of the Cavan barracks in these dire economic times?</P>

	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien raised the issue of the presence of the Taoiseach in the Chamber.  I am delighted to inform the House that the Leader has been in discussion with the Taoiseach, who has given us an undertaking that he will be in the House in June to take questions on Northern Ireland and other issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Very good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>He can listen to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Coghlan said, that was always the intention.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien also raised the question of mortgage arrears.  Yesterday, we had a good debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, who referred to the personal insolvency Bill.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality of which I am a member, has held hearings on the Bill and produced a report.  Critical issues will be addressed in that Bill which we all eagerly await as part of the solution to deal with the very serious issue of mortgage arrears.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien spoke about circulating a motion to group leaders and he is entitled to do so.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien also raised the Greek situation and he sought clarification on the Government&rsquo;s position on Greece.  I will respond on behalf of the Government which recognises the political situation in Greece is very serious and it is a stark reminder to us all of the importance of political stability.  Many of those who are now opposing the stability treaty argued at one point that this State should follow the example of Greece and we must now recognise that such a course of action would be disastrous for Ireland and disastrous for any recovery.  The Irish Government is supporting the strong statement overnight by Jean-Claude Juncker, the chair of the eurogroup, who spoke of the unshakeable desire to keep Greece within the eurozone.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, participated in the meeting yesterday of the eurogroup which spoke of looking forward to the swift formation of a new Greek Government to take ownership of the bailout programme and which would have a sufficient parliamentary majority to fully implement the policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation in Greece serves to remind us of the dangers of political instability and it is perhaps a reminder also of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and economic growth.  That is the Government position on Greece.  The Government is committed to maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s presence in a strong and stable eurozone.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan dealt with some of the points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Brien.  In response to issues raised by Senator Coghlan and others yesterday, we are having the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly debate tomorrow, as I announced on the Order of Business and this will be taken for one hour in between the items previously listed on the schedule.</P>
        <P>Senator van Turnhout raised the issue of the missing children hotline which was also raised by Senator Quinn yesterday.  I responded yesterday to say that we had a debate in the House previously and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, promised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand corrected.  She assured us in October that funding had been allocated.  We had all hoped very much that the hotline would be operational by now.  I am not sure of the reason for the delay.  The Senator will be aware that the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held recent hearings on the issue of missing persons and it issued a report on missing persons.  Part of that report sought a missing children day and also that we would recognise a missing persons day.  A number of initiatives are possible, as well as the hotline.  I agree that we should ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, to come to the House.  One of the issues she might address with us would be that issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown spoke about Professor Ernest Walton and Mary Patricia Cole and this can be followed up with the relevant councils.  Senator Moloney asked about the missing children&rsquo;s hotline and the re-introduction of the orthodontic treatment scheme.  This is an important issue which might be worth raising as a matter on the Adjournment in the first instance but we can also raise it with the Minister for Health within a more far-reaching debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden raised the issue of communications.  I think what he said may be misleading the House on the question of who controls RTE.  The RTE board members are today attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, along with the BAI.  Senator Leyden&rsquo;s colleague has pointed this fact out and I was aware that they have been quite a number of hours before the committee.  They will answer to that committee and it is nonsense to suggest that RTE is under the control of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, or any other Minister for that matter.  However, I have previously answered Senator Leyden and other colleagues that the House will be looking for a wide-ranging debate on the media with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, before the end of the summer term.  A number of Members have sought such a debate.  We held that debate on 22 February but I know the Minister would be happy to come here again but I suggest we leave until a little later towards the end of the summer recess.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>One hopes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Burke raised the issue of centres for young people and the support they provide for return to education.  He suggested the responsibility for this area falls between Departments.  We might seek to have the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs come to the House for a wide-ranging debate on issues pertaining to children and young people.  She is the best Minister to deal with that issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of Private Members&rsquo; time.  It may not have been clear from the schedule but statements on symphysiotomy are being taken in the Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; time at our initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for that clarification but I really must point out that it is not in the time that is usually allocated for Private Members&rsquo; time.  There is nothing on the official schedule to tell me that it is not Private Members&rsquo; time and it was therefore perfectly legitimate for me to reflect this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please resume your seat, Senator Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like some honest information from time to time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>For the information of the House the times today were somewhat different.  An Arbour Hill commemoration ceremony took place this morning, as the Senator will be aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not affect the afternoon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a number of different issues to do with the timing today.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also raised the issue of 60 copies of the treaty circulated to Members.  Like Senator Harte I will certainly be distributing those&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not the treaty; it was a pro-treaty propaganda leaflet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, Senator Norris, allow the Deputy Leader to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>An information guide on the treaty which has been circulated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>By whom?  I asked by whom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris, no interruptions.  Please allow the Deputy Leader to continue uninterrupted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which will be of great use and assistance to Members in distributing to constituents who are looking for neutral information on the treaty.</P>
        <P>Finally I will deal with the issue raised by Deputy Norris on some matters of procedure in the House.  He asked in particular about the Leader&rsquo;s practice of not responding on the Order of Business to colleagues who have left the Chamber without doing him the courtesy of informing him they would be absent.  I am just following that practice.  I raised this yesterday at the start of my response to the Order of Business and I seemed to get universal approval.  It is a matter of courtesy to individual Members of the House and it is a matter of courtesy in particular to those Members who have sat in here throughout the Order of Business and have remained to hear the Leader reply.  I am simply following the Leader&rsquo;s practice.  This can be raised at the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is wrong.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris, please allow the Deputy Leader to continue without interruption.  Please, silence in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>This is like a circus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a distinct lack of respect for individual Senators where other Senators insist on interrupting them and that includes Senator Norris.  I ask that we try to have a little respect and courtesy for each other in this House because this will enhance respect for the House generally.  I refer to the new policy adopted by the CPP of spokespersons not sharing time and I, for one, would be very happy to review that decision.  Senator Mullins is the representative of the Independent Senators&rsquo; group on the CPP and he or anyone else may raise the matter.  I can raise it myself at the next CPP meeting.</P>
        <P>Senator Harte asked about the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and a deposit on glass bottles and cans.  This is a good idea and perhaps a cross-party motion could be agreed.  Senator Cullinane asked for a debate on a jobs plan after the referendum.  We can debate some of those points tomorrow during the debate on the stability treaty.  The Government has a significant and substantive action plan on jobs which has been developed and I am sure we can have a Minister in the House to debate it with us at a later date.  The Senator&rsquo;s suggestion of inviting parliamentarians from other countries is an interesting one and which could be explored at the CPP.  We have a policy of inviting distinguished speakers so we might include the suggestion under that policy.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane asked about youth mental health and the Headstrong survey.  This could be included in a debate with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs when she comes to the House since it concerns young people.  I am pleased to hear Senator Wilson seconding the proposal to honour Mary Patricia Cole in Cavan.  He also proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to have the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter, come to the House today to speak about the closure of Cavan Barracks.  I cannot agree to that proposal.  It would be more appropriate as a matter on the Adjournment.  In addition, I happen to know that the Minister is attending today at the justice committee dealing with a number of issues relevant to his defence portfolio, in particular, a review of the Reserve Defence Force and the report by Frank Callinan into the deaths of three Irish soldiers in Lebanon.  The Minister will be attending the committee for a significant time today.</P>
        <P>Senator Landy dealt with the issue of public procurement and its relevance for small business.  He had previously raised the issue of the lending policies to small business of the banks.  I wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, as a consequence, in order to arrange a briefing for colleagues in the audiovisual room.  It is a good idea to organise a similar meeting about the issue of public procurement.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the importance of defibrillators being available in workplaces.  I think there is one in Leinster House although I stand to be corrected but we should raise awareness about this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Noone referred to the Headstrong survey and the drinking culture and she has raised this issue a number of times in the past.  There was a debate during Private Members&rsquo; time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we had a debate on low-cost selling of alcohol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, took that debate and dealt with her very specific recommendations for reform.  It could form part of the debate with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about the power of the Seanad.  It would be worthwhile having a debate on public order and policing, and we can try to arrange for that.  There is quite a lot of public order legislation currently so it might be worth having a good debate on this aspect. </P>
        <P>Senator Mullins also welcomed the news about Galway.</P>

        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised the issue of the military judge, which could also be raised at today&rsquo;s meeting of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Minister will be dealing with defence matters there today.  It might also be worth raising it as an Adjournment matter.</P>

    <Title>Statute Law Revision Bill 2012: Order for Second Stage</Title>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Bill entitled an Act to promote the revision of statute law by repealing all statutes that were enacted before 6 December, 1922 other than the statutes not repealed by this Act, or the statutes not repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007 or the Statute Law Revision Act 2009 and that were not subsequently repealed before the passing of this Act, and for that purpose to repeal certain statutes of a specified series that were enacted on or after 1 January, 1751 and before 6 December, 1922 and certain other statutes of another specified series that were enacted on or after 1 January 1851 and before 6 December, 1922 and which have ceased to have effect or have become unnecessary, to identify the statutes of those series that are not being repealed by this Act, to assign short titles to certain statutes in order to facilitate their citation and to amend certain statutes in so far as they relate to short titles, to amend the Adaptation of Enactments Act 1922 and to provide for related matters.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is a pleasure for me to bring the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012 before this House.  I contributed actively to the debate on a previous Statute Law Revision Bill in 2007 when I was privileged to be a Senator and I recall the substantial debate and cross-party welcome on that occasion for the important work of statute law revision.  The officials in a number of Departments have been working on revising the statute law in this area for some time.  The Bill is another phase of that work.  It is appropriate to acknowledge the extraordinary work they have done to ensure we modernise, codify and bring up to date the legislative code before the foundation of the State.</P>
        <P>Statute law revision concerns the removal of obsolete legislation from the Statute Book which is no longer relevant or whose purpose is exhausted, or which has ceased to be in force otherwise than by reason of express repeal.  This Bill is being brought forward on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform further to the commitment made in the programme for Government to progress the statute law revision project in order to enhance public accessibility to the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>The Bill identifies 796 Acts which are not suitable for repeal at this time and will be retained on the Statute Book.  It will repeal all other legislation within its scope.  It proposes expressly to repeal 2,983 Acts in total, including 1,358 obsolete local and personal Acts and 1,625 private Acts, while implicitly repealing 18,953 local and personal and private Acts.  If the implied repeals are included, the Bill is the largest and most extensive repealing measure not only in the history of the State but also the most extensive single statute law revision measure ever brought forward in any jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>This Bill which deals with local and personal Acts from 1851 to 1922 and private Acts from 1751 to 1922, is the final element of the review of primary legislation enacted prior to Independence and as such clears the way for my Department to proceed to review the large body of secondary legislation that pre-dates Independence.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Private Acts&rdquo; are those concerned with the affairs of a single individual or body.  They are enacted under a different procedure from that used for public and general Acts.  The private Acts listed in the Bill include many naturalisations, divorces and provisions in relation to certain landed estates.  &ldquo;Local and Personal Acts&rdquo; are concerned with matters affecting a very limited section of the community such as a single local authority, local area or company.  Local and Personal Acts were published in a separate series between 1797 and 1922.  In addition, it should be noted that prior to the enactment of company registration law in 1844 and the introduction of limited liability for companies in 1855, most commercial companies were incorporated by an Act of Parliament.</P>
        <P>The statute law revision project has now assessed all 60,000 pieces of primary legislation enacted prior to Independence, of which 22,885 come within the ambit of this Bill, of which 153 were found to be already repealed.  Of the 60,000 statutes, approximately 40,000 were identified as not having applied to Ireland.  These Acts, though not listed in Schedule 2, have been implicitly repealed by virtue of their exclusion from Schedule 1.  Of the 20,000 Acts identified as applicable to Ireland, approximately 10,000 were found to have been repealed already, leaving 10,000 Acts of potential ongoing relevance to be assessed.  Of the 10,000 Acts with potential ongoing relevance, the Bill when enacted and its predecessors will have repealed approximately 7,800. The remaining 2,200 Acts have been assessed as not suitable for repeal and each have been listed for retention in Schedule 1 to the Bill or in the relevant Statute Law Revision Acts 2007 and 2009.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline to the House the major provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides definitions of &ldquo;statute&rdquo;, &ldquo;local and personal Act&rdquo; and &ldquo;private Act&rdquo;.  The definitions of the series of statutes are necessary to distinguish them from statutes of a public general nature which are not affected by the Bill.  It should be noted that the definitions relate only to statutes and therefore do not include charters of a local and personal or private nature.  Such charters are not revoked by the Bill.  Charters in the nature of public general Acts are, however, included.</P>
        <P>Section 2 is the central feature of this Bill.  It provides for fundamental clarification and simplification of the Statute Book by drawing a line at Independence on 6 December 1922 and repealing all Acts passed prior to that point, with three exceptions.  The first exception comprises those Acts listed in Schedule 1, which sets out a list of local and personal Acts from 1851 onwards and private Acts from 1751 onwards that were passed before Independence in 1922 and which are still relevant.  The second exception comprises pre-1851 local and personal Acts and pre-1751 private Acts retained by the Statute Law Revision Act 2009 by virtue of their inclusion in Schedule 1 to that Act and which were not subsequently repealed.  The third exception comprises pre-1922 public general Acts that have already been saved by Schedule 1 to the Statute Law Revision Act 2007 and which were not subsequently repealed.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides, for information purposes, a list of all statutes repealed by section 2.  It is based on section 3 of the 2007 and 2009 Acts.  This section proposes to list the specific Acts identified in the course of the review as being unnecessary or as being spent or obsolete.  These obsolete Acts will be listed in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  This section is not a repealing section, as the repeal is effected in section 2.</P>
        <P>Section 4 will assign a Short Title to any Act saved by section 2 which does not already have a Short Title.  This section is based on section 4 of 2007 and 2009 Acts.</P>
        <P>Section 5 makes provision for the amendment of certain unconventional or inappropriate Short Titles in respect of Acts saved by section 2, in order to facilitate the citation of those Acts.  This section is based on section 7 of the 2007 Act and section 5 of the 2009 Act.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides for the standard saving clauses.  Sections 6(1) and 6(3) are similar to the corresponding subsections in section 9 of the 2007 Act and section 6 of the 2009 Act.  They are standard forms in Bills of this nature.  For clarity, as with the previous Acts, reference has also been inserted to the &ldquo;application&rdquo; of statutes to the State to ensure the saver clause is wide enough to preserve statutes which have been applied to Ireland by statutes repealed by this Bill.  Section 6(2) is designed to preserve the status of bodies which may have been established by a charter made consequent on a statute which is being repealed by this Act.  It corresponds to section 9(2) of the 2007 Act and section 6(2) of the 2009 Act.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides for the remedying of an omission in the Adaptation of Enactments Act 1922.  This provided for the automatic adaptation of pre-1922 statutes with a power to make further adaptations by order.  The definition of pre-1922 statute was couched in terms that applied only to Acts of the Parliament of the &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and did not apply to Acts of the Irish or English Parliaments or the Parliament of Great Britain &mdash; that is, the Parliament after the union with Scotland.  The amendment rectifies this omission.  I am sure that meets with the approval of all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for a Short Title and collective citations.  This is a standard provision and is equally based on the 2007 and 2009 Acts.</P>
        <P>Schedule 1 provides a list of pre-Independence statutes for each period concerned which are not being repealed.  Those periods are from 1 January 1751 to 6 December 1922 for private Acts and from 1 January 1851 to 6 December 1922 for local and personal Acts.</P>
        <P>Schedule 2 lists the Acts specifically repealed by the Bill covering the same period of time as those in Schedule 1.  The Acts listed in Schedule 2 are the Acts which, while applicable to Ireland, have been identified in the course of the review as appropriate for repeal because they are spent, have become obsolete or are otherwise unnecessary.  Other local and personal Acts and private Acts for the periods concerned that do not relate to Ireland, or have only an exceptionally minimal connection with Ireland, will not be included in Schedule 2 but will be implicitly repealed by virtue of the general repeal provision in section 2.  Accordingly, this approach, which was also adopted in the Statute Law Revision Acts 2007 and 2009, will improve clarity as to the repeals relevant to Ireland and provide greater transparency with respect to relevant repeals.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the volume of legislation involved and the careful analysis given to each Act, it is clear that this Bill is the culmination of significant work for those involved.  I thank the researchers and management of the statute law revision project, as well as the staff of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General for their dedicated work on this Bill.  As I said, this extraordinary piece of work has spanned the terms of a number of Governments over a ten-year period, culminating in the Bill before the House and the two previous Acts I have mentioned.  It has required meticulous research on the part of those who have worked to bring our statute revision up to a standard which is well beyond what other Parliaments have provided for.  I congratulate all concerned for that work.</P>
        <P>I would like to acknowledge the indispensable assistance provided to the State by the UK parliamentary archives at the House of Lords and the House of Commons in Westminster.  Over a number of years, the parliamentary archives have kindly lent the statute law revision project various texts of Acts which are not available in any form in Ireland.  When project members travelled to the archives last year to view specific texts on site, they were provided with every assistance by the staff there.  In extending my sincere appreciation to the staff of the UK parliamentary archives, I acknowledge that without their generous and public-spirited assistance and co-operation, it would not have been possible to produce this Bill.  The project staff also received texts of Acts and valuable assistance and co-operation from the Honourable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns, the Oireachtas Library, the National Library and the National Archives.  I wish to express my gratitude to those institutions for their support and assistance.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s unique legislative past has left us with a complex stock of legislation with enactments from the Parliaments of Ireland, England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  The importance of simplifying this complex stock was noted recently by the OECD in its 2010 review of better regulation in Ireland, which reported that initiatives such as the Statute Law Revision Acts were impressive efforts to address this challenge and to improve accessibility and understanding of the law.  This Bill, in tandem with the Statute Law Revision Acts 2007 and 2009, constitutes the most extensive set of repealing measures in the history of the State.  As far as the Office of the Attorney General is aware, it is the most extensive statute law revision programme ever undertaken anywhere in the world.  That is a large claim to make.  I am sure the authorities in some country will pop up and say they did a more extensive trawl.  We should make the claim anyway.</P>
        <P>These repeal proposals were developed following a rigorous research and consultation process.  All of those interested in the proposals, including members of the public, were given an opportunity to contribute their views.  The process of statute law revision will help to simplify and modernise our law and make it more intelligible.  It will save time and costs for lawyers and others who need to know what the law actually is.  It will make it easier for citizens to access justice.  The Bill, when enacted, will achieve the following &mdash; facilitate the process of regulatory reform; ensure that the Irish Statute Book is significantly more modern and enhance public accessibility to the Statute Book in line with the programme for Government commitments; facilitate future legislative measures to repeal, re-enact, where necessary with amendments, and consolidate the statute law of the State; assist the Law Reform Commission in its task of preparing the legislation directory; and enable, for the first time since the foundation of the State, the compilation of a complete list of all primary legislation up to Independence that has not been repealed.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied, from the significant work undertaken by the statute law revision project, that the Acts specified in Schedule 2 to this Bill are now either spent or obsolete.  It is time to remove this legislation from our Statute Book and take another step towards the ultimate aim of a clear and concise Statute Book which reduces the regulatory burden on business and enhances accessibility for the general public.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Seldom will a piece of legislation come before the House that will have so much support and lack of objection from the Fianna F&aacute;il benches, either technically, politically or otherwise.  There is no cause for such objection.  We wholeheartedly support this revision, consolidation and repeal of certain obsolete pieces of legislation.  I searched the Schedule for an example of some of the Acts we are repealing.  With regard to 1779-80, the time of King George III, the Bill refers to &ldquo;Enabling William Sherlock, Esquire, to make leases, and to charge portions for his younger children, and for other purposes&rdquo;.  Such an item is a clear example of matters that should not trouble us any longer in this State.</P>
        <P>It is amazing that, when this Bill is enacted, the total number of repeals will rise to almost 8,000, together with an additional 40,557 Acts which were deemed inapplicable or implicitly repealed by the legislation &mdash; an astonishing statistic.  While it is probably an academic exercise, as the Minister of State pointed out, great research and painstaking work was put in by the officials, and the Minister also thanked the House of Lords and the archives service at Westminster, which it is important to acknowledge.</P>
        <P>I come from the old school of law.  When I was studying law initially in UCC so many years ago that I would hate to put the year on record in case I would be seen to be older than I look&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not pre-Independence anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not that far back.  In first year law, we were obliged to take two non-law arts subjects.  I chose Latin, because I was relatively good at it, and modern history, because of the lecturer at the time, the great Professor John A. Murphy, who was subsequently a Member of this House and who is still alive and well.  We had our arguments due to our political differences but they were friendly fire.  In those years, I studied Roman law, which was interesting, although I do not believe it is now on any curriculum in the Irish universities, and also ancient legal history, which included cases, jurisprudence and so on.  My niece was recently studying for her FE1, the Law Society entrance exam, and if I told her stories like that, she would certainly believe I was much older than she ever thought I was.  That was the way things were at the time.</P>
        <P>It is important to reflect on this when enacting laws.  We think we are modern and far advanced but if we look at the Brehon laws or Roman laws, or go back to the Stoics and the Sophists, we must ask whether our system of justice has really advanced in great strides.  We think we have, but if the old Roman laws had been in place in recent times for the banking crisis and the political crisis, many of those involved would have been beheaded.  There are many people out on the streets who would nearly wish for that again, but we have moved on.</P>
        <P>I was not aware that until relatively recently there was an obligation on every citizen of Ireland to own a bow and arrow and to practise archery, although this has been withdrawn.  Equally, I never realised where the word &ldquo;pillory&rdquo; came from until I discovered the now obsolete Act dealing with pillory, the act of locking someone into stocks so they could be pelted with tomatoes &mdash; we learn something every day.  Other legislation dealt with the regulation of children who worked as chimney sweeps.  As coal is seldom burnt any longer, perhaps we should send some of that legislation to China, where there are many coal burning facilities.  The Adulteration of Coffee Act imposed a &pound;20 fine on &ldquo;evil disposed persons who have at the time or soon after the roasting of coffee made use of water, grease, butter or such like materials, whereby the same is rendered unwholesome and greatly increased in weight&rdquo;.  The Adulteration of Tea Act was passed in 1776, two years after the Boston Tea Party which triggered the American revolution.</P>
        <P>This is of only historical benefit.  As I said at the outset, I welcome the legislation.  In conclusion, I make a point which is perhaps most appropriate to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, namely, I have always sought as a Deputy and Senator that we should work towards the codification of criminal law, even if only up to the year 2000.  I accept much work has already been done in this area.  It is relevant for anyone going to court in regard to road traffic or other offences and, while it is not the most urgent priority, the Minister might explain the position with regard to codification of statutes, particularly in the area of criminal law.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has our full support in this regard.  There will no demand for a vote on Second Stage and it is unlikely on the other Stages also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and reiterate his point regarding the work that has gone into this Bill.  Over the weekend, I gave the Bill to a solicitor friend of mine and the comment he made was &ldquo;about time&rdquo;.  As alluded to by my esteemed colleague on the other side, much of the legislation being updated is obscure and irrelevant.  I appreciate the painstaking work done and the time that has been required to bring the Statute Book up to date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Do I take it this will be a continuous, ongoing process given I do not believe the Statute Book will be updated in one fell swoop?  Will the legal profession be involved?  I have been asked whether there will be consultation with it in the future.  Having its input would make for better legislation.   As Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has said, this revision is long overdue and it is good that both sides of the House welcome it.  We look forward to dealing with the legislation as briskly as we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House again.  He is obviously getting very fond of us.  Touching on something Senator Sheahan said, I remember a similar Bill to this just a few years ago, in 2009.  Review is ongoing and we need to do it every so often.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to hear Senator O&rsquo;Donovan talk about learning Latin.  I met an American lady the other day who asked about my children and mentioned that I had encouraged them all to learn Latin.  She responded that this would be very useful if they ever visited Latin America.</P>
        <P>I am delighted with this Bill and am delighted these steps are being taken.  As Senator Sheahan said, review should be ongoing.  In 1971, I had the pleasure of ending up in court and winning a case, based on an Act introduced in 1938, that related to shop closing hours.  I won my case, but the State appealed against me because the Act had been in existence from 1938 until 1968 or 1969.  The issue went to the Supreme Court and again I won the case there.  This was one of the few Acts with which I got involved.  I learned constitutional law in college as part of my commerce degree and little thought I would ever use it.  However, I used it in this particular case.  Article 44 found that any legislation passed that discriminated on the grounds of religion was unconstitutional.  The statutory instrument that provided that all butcher shops should close at 6 p.m. had excluded shops that sold kosher meat under the Jewish ritual method of killing and on that basis, I was able to find that the shop closing hours legislation was unconstitutional.</P>
        <P>This legislation is a welcome piece of housekeeping that gets rids of laws that may cause confusion and demonstrates that we should not wait hundreds of years for the next clean up.  It was interesting to hear Senator O&rsquo;Donovan talk about some of the laws that existed.  I would like to discuss the issue of reviewing laws in a more general way.  We could follow the example of Germany, which conducts what it calls &ldquo;spring clean ups&rdquo; on a much more regular basis.  Recently, it reduced approximately 2,000 laws to approximately 1,700.  The Federal Ministry of Justice, the Parliament and the Cabinet there collaborate to write new orders and codes and to revise the old ones.  Since 1976, they have created new codes of administrative law and have modernised the civil and criminal code.  German laws use an open textured language of flexibility that also guides solutions to future problems, rather than the language of micro regulation more common in American law and in our laws.  Section 242 of the German civil code is famous for how it tempers the code&rsquo;s rules with the general obligation of what they call &ldquo;good faith&rdquo;.   We all talk about making the Oireachtas more accessible to citizens and there have been calls to write laws in more simple and accessible language.  However, the lawyers have always argued that we need complicated language in order to guard against misinterpretation.  The German example however seems to work well.</P>
        <P>We must also remember that the OECD regulatory reform programme encourages EU member states to conduct housekeeping of old laws, based on economics.  It also encourages them to create new permanent high level government institutions to conduct economic policy reviews of both old and new laws to ensure that the economic burden of laws and regulations never outpaces their social utility.  We do not have this function in Ireland, but it is needed.  We need it to look at laws and see how they affect issues like business and the economy.  In Germany, the national regulatory control council, which provides such a function, reports on the fifth anniversary of its establishment that it has saved Germany nearly &euro;12 billion in unnecessary costs.  Therefore, one of the reasons for us to do this is to reduce our costs.</P>
        <P>The amount of red tape and bureaucracy involved with dealing with old laws makes things very difficult.  I mentioned before that I was in Panama a few years ago.  Panama wanted to become the country most attractive to new businesses and it aimed to establish the shortest timeframe for the setting up of a new business.  I thought the target would be a few days, but it was seven hours.  I do not think Panama has achieved that and I believe Singapore and Hong Kong have remained quicker, with a set up time of a few days.  However, this example is a reminder that we can do something about the amount of bureaucracy and red tape that attaches to our legislation.  One of the easiest ways to do that is through what is being done today, reviewing and abolishing old laws and ensuring we become a more attractive place in which to start a business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber and thank him for his detailed and informative submission in which he went through the provisions of the Acts.  It was good to hear their relevance to today&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to lead this debate on behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad and to contribute on such an important piece of legislation.  As legislators, we have a tendency to add laws to the Statue Book, but rarely do we remove any.  On that basis, I commend the Minister of State and his Department on this legislation.  As he claimed in his speech, this is the most extensive statute law revision ever attempted anywhere.  We can be proud to undertake this course of action as it marks us out as reformers in the true sense of the word.  It is clear that a great job has been done in combing through the Statute Book for material which should no longer be there.  I understand that throughout this process a number of Bills have come through the House in previous years in this regard and that in total, approximately 8,000 Acts have been identified for repeal.  Together with these, some 40,557 Acts have been automatically repealed by the legislation.</P>
        <P>Along with the Office of the Attorney General, the Minister and his Department have outlined a purposeful project to review all legislation on our Statute Book and to repeal any legislation that is spent, obsolete and no longer of practical use.  As a barrister &mdash; I think I speak for most members of my profession on this &mdash; I welcome this development.  At least, now I do not have to worry about some ancient, archaic law tripping me up in the courtroom when fighting a case.  This is welcome.  More seriously, the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012 is designed to repeal all such obsolete Acts, such as the Local and Personal Acts enacted between 1851 and 1922 and private Acts enacted between 1751 and 1922.  This constitutes almost 3,000 obsolete laws which were passed before Ireland gained independence.  It is part of an earlier programme undertaken by the last Administration in 2003, whereby 5,000 obsolete Acts were eliminated.</P>
        <P>As with earlier phases, this Bill has been widely canvassed and accompanied by a consultation process with the various Departments, local authorities and other relevant companies, bodies and organisations.  Some of these laws date back to 1542.  While these are completely obsolete, they have enjoyed the full force of law, notwithstanding their age and the fact they were designed for a different era.  One might question why these laws survived our independence from the British Crown.  However, by virtue of an Act passed in 1922, many ancient laws were transposed into Irish law.  While we might be thankful that time has moved on, in legal terms it has not, until now.  The Schedule to this Bill contains a comprehensive list of both the Acts to be repealed and those to be retained.  In particular, Schedule 1 contains those Acts which continue to have some relevance and are provisionally proposed for retention, because they have been identified as neither wholly spent nor wholly obsolete.  Schedule 2 contains a list of Acts which when enacted, or subsequently, have had some relevance to Ireland but are provisionally being identified as wholly spent or wholly obsolete and, therefore, suitable for repeal.</P>
        <P>For instance, some of the laws which are to be scrapped relate to the removal of the 700-year old obligation for every citizen of Ireland to own a bow and arrow and to practise archery, as mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  The Act concerned with locking people into stocks so that they could be pelted with tomatoes is another Act to be repealed, as are the private divorce Acts, which are obsolete in light of our judicial divorce Acts of 1996, and the statutes relating to conferring of citizenship on non-nationals, where Ministers had no power to confer naturalisation.  This had to be done by Parliament.  While I have outlined only some of the Acts to be consigned to history, this Bill will also specify approximately 780 old Acts which are to remain in effect.  These include the Saint Stephen&rsquo;s Green (Dublin) Act 1877, which formally opened the green to regulated public use, and the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act 1877, which formally established the entities now known as the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland.</P>
        <P>As well as shedding light on Ireland&rsquo;s economic, social and political life this constant renewal of legislation saves time and money.  Our Parliament passes laws to deal with current circumstances and when these circumstances no longer apply the legislation should cease to apply immediately.  It is important that we remove legal deadwood from our Statute Book to facilitate a process of regulatory reform.  A modern democracy requires us to replace outdated legislation with laws that are passed by the democratically elected representatives of the people.  Obsolete laws have survived for too long because of the belief that they were not causing any harm.  That is where people are wrong, however.  Many of these archaic laws have frustrated the legal and judicial system and hampered its efficient operation because of the time legal practitioners were required to spend in the Law Library to determine the legal standing of a particular point.  This Bill reflects the Government&rsquo;s agenda for better regulation.  I thank everybody who has worked on this Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>While I commend the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House, I do so with reservations.  It may be quaint to ponder life in the 1800s and the legislative cures required at the time but I question the Bill&rsquo;s value in improving the accessibility of legislation for those who need to consult the law today.  I acknowledge the work that has gone into this Bill and other statute law revision Acts in recent years but the fact remains that it is a rather grand academic exercise.  The bulk of the laws governing Irish society today were introduced in the past 50 years.  Repealing or retaining a specific list of pre-1922 statutes may constitute good housekeeping but it will do nothing to make the law more accessible.  Statute law revision is a luxury we cannot afford.  If the Statute Book can be compared to an old and dilapidated house, instead of spending money on careful restoration we are spending it on the equivalent of a lavish swimming pool.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problems individuals experience in understanding legislation can be revealed from a random examination of virtually any area of the law.  For example, the legislation directory entry for the Roads Act 1993 reveals that it has been amended more than 170 times by 12 or 13 different Acts.  Anyone who wants to understand the law in that area must grapple with these latter Acts.  The Freedom of Information Act 1997 has been amended more than 100 times by a multitude of Acts.  These are not isolated examples.</P>
        <P>Some of the big law firms around town charge &euro;300 or &euro;400 per hour.  When a client approaches them with a legal query, one of the first things they must do is identify the law applicable to the problem.  This is no easy task because, as my colleagues will be aware, legislation on any given matter can be found in a principle Act and layer upon layer of amending Acts.  To understand the current law the reader has to piece together the principle Act along with all the amendments.  This can take a lot of time and when one is paying a solicitor by the hour it adds up to a considerable sum simply to understand the legislation.  I hazard the guess that hundreds of thousands of euro, at a minimum, are paid to lawyers every year by individuals and businesses trying to figure out the law.  That hardly makes us a competitive economy.  This cost does not even take account of the amount of time Departments and State bodies spend on trying to understand the legislation which governs us.  The Minister of State need not take my word that Irish legislation can be impervious to the most diligent lawyer, never mind the layperson.  This is recognised by the review of better regulation in Ireland published by the OECD in 2010, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Simple, effective and transparent access to regulations does not exist in Ireland.  There is a consensus (both within and outside the administration) over the fact that it is difficult to understand what regulations apply, and what is in the law (lawyers systematically need to be consulted, and even they have trouble).</P>
        <P FLI="0">Our legal system relies heavily on the principle that ignorance of the law is no defence.  In practice this means that a person who is charged with an offence cannot claim in court that he or she was unaware that the law prohibited his or her action.  In theory this presumes that citizens know every section of every Act or statutory instrument but if we are to sustain this principle we must do more to make the law accessible to citizens.  As matters stand, Acts are published only in their as enacted form.  When we pass a Bill amending pre-existing law it simply adds another layer onto the original law.  No effort is made to incorporate the new law into the old law and republish it as amended.  Several countries have moved to a system of making laws as amended available online.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission has for several years been driving the statute law restatement project, which it produces versions of selected laws in their amended form.  I commend the commission for its work in this regard but a severe lack of funds mean that it is only able to tackle a tiny portion of the legislation in force.</P>
        <P>The unavoidable conclusion of an examination of the current situation is that one side of the Office of the Attorney General, the statute law revision team, is spending years tidying the Statute Book, while the legislative drafting side is applying its industry to foster incoherence and inaccessibility by persisting with the old approach of amendment heaped on amendment, combined with inadequate publication.  Approximately 3,300 post-1922 Acts are on the Statute Book.  In these days of limited resources we should focus our efforts on making those Acts more accessible.  The State needs to work towards the development of a database of revised statutes which would contain legislation in its in force condition, incorporating the effect of all amendments while omitting spent Acts or repealed provisions.  By removing the deadwood and reflecting the effect of amendments, the publication of revised statutes would vastly improve the accessibility of legislation.  This has already been achieved in other countries, as was pointed out by the Law Reform Commission in its report on the legislation directory.  Out of the 33 European legal systems it examined, 27 had at least one official collection of consolidated texts of legislation and 25 made their collections available on-line.</P>
        <P>For these reasons I commend the Bill but question the value of an exercise focused on repealing or retaining pre-1922 statutes when the post-1922 Statute Book is in such a poor and inaccessible state.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>With the exception of Senator Mullen, every speaker in this debate welcomed the Bill.  As a layperson who is somewhat familiar with legal terminology I agree with anything that makes the system more accessible.  The Senators who have practised as lawyers pointed out that their work is made easier if they know they will not be tripped up by legislation that has been on the Statute Book since 1800 and is no longer relevant.  In repealing these Acts, any rights, privileges and obligations that were inherent in them will be carried over in amendments to new Acts.  The Bill does a service to the public, although it may do a disservice to barristers and solicitors who want to charge a mountain of money for going through 2,000 documents.  That is going to change.  I presume solicitors and barristers have a problem with that but, as a lay person, I have no problem with anything that makes it easier.  Is an attempt being made to get the repealed Acts online for research purposes?  We know how easy it is to scan material and put it online, even if it is time consuming.  That would facilitate the research suggested by Senator Mullen and I recommend it.  He said that 27 of the 33 countries surveyed by the Law Society have such a facility.  If it is not in place, we should examine doing it.</P>
        <P>This step was taken in 2007 but it strikes me that this is the most extensive statute law revision programme attempted anywhere in the world.  For the first time, it enables the compilation of a complete list of all pre-Independence primary legislation relevant to Ireland that is still in force.  That is a historic day for Ireland and I commend the Minister of State and particularly the staff in the Office of the Attorney General and elsewhere.  They pored over and analysed 22,855 statutes.  I am indebted to the Oireachtas library and research service for the research; I did not do it.  There are no Exchequer cost, staffing or other implications following the enactment of the Bill, which will produce savings in legal and business costs.  We sometimes hear criticism of civil servants for not doing work but there is no extra cost in this case.  It will produce savings in legal and business costs.  Savings in legal costs are always welcome.  I note the South Dublin Railway (Abandonment) Act of 1879.  I am sorry that we lost the infrastructure, rather than the legislation, because the old tramway passed by my house.  We had 60 miles of it from the beginning of 1879.  We have repealed the legislation but perhaps we could put tramways there again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House again.  The arrival of this Bill in the Seanad marks the completion of an important job of work by the Office of the Attorney General.  It took almost a decade to complete and I pay tribute to the office and its staff.  What has been achieved is no mean feat and the Office of the Attorney General must be commended.  I hope the Minister of State passes along the gratitude of all parties in the House.  It is a remarkable and unique item of legislation and I do not envy those whose task it was to conclude that the Clanricardes Estates Act 1770 ought to be preserved but the Limerick and Ennis Railway Act 1870 ought not.  These are the choices they had to make.</P>
        <P>Legal certainty is essential; it is a cornerstone of the law.  Perhaps one of the most well-known passages from a legal text is Lon Fuller&rsquo;s allegory of King Rex, contained in <i>The Morality of the Law</i>, in which the hapless fictional monarch attempts takes it upon himself to improve the law of the land.  The Minister of State might like the story.  One of the ways in which he fails is because his subjects cannot keep the law as they are not aware of what they are required to do under it, as the law has not been published or promulgated.  Another problem is that the law is unreadable, excessively complex and obscure.  He illustrates what he considers certain routes of failure for any legal system.  A lack of certainty and clarity on the law is one such route and the purpose of this Bill is to bring clarity and make it easier for us all.  Clarifying of the Statute Book is helpful and adds to the clarity of property law and land law in particular.</P>
        <P>However, I wish to raise some concern about the manner in which the project was carried out and the apparent dearth of resources in the Office of the Attorney General.  It is alarming that the statute law revision project would not have been completed were it not for the retention of interns from the work placement programme and JobBridge national internship scheme.  The Attorney General is perfectly entitled, and ought be encouraged, to give young graduates a valuable opportunity to gain experience in such a key project, notwithstanding my very clear concerns about the manner in which the JobBridge programme operates.  However, as legislators it would be reckless of us not to question the decision of the Executive to pare back resources in the Office of the Attorney General.  Responsibility for this dates to the previous Government.  A project such as this should not rely almost entirely on graduates.</P>
        <P>The regulatory impact analysis of the Statute Law Revision Bill of 2009 correctly acknowledged the impact of not proceeding with the project.  The lack of a coherent list of all statutes in force in the State would have financial implications for the public purse.  Time is money and, in the absence of a complete revision of old obsolete legislation, time continues to be wasted researching and sifting through the potential impact of such Acts.  This would also be an unnecessary cost for the legal fraternity and associated service providers.  The regulatory impact analysis warned that the lack of a coherent Statute Book could affect foreign inward investment if the regulatory impact is difficult to comprehend or ascertain.  In addition, the benefit of the Exchequer funds already invested in the initial phases of the statute law revision project would not be achieved if the project was not completed.  This would not reflect well on the State&rsquo;s commitment to regulatory reform.  We are all conscious of this because of the failure of regulation over the past number of years.  Once begun, it would have been extremely foolish and wasteful not to complete the programme.  Completion of the project will have positive implications for quality regulation, employment, industry and small business in that the proposals will assist in reducing the regulatory burden for users of the Statute Book, including business users, and will provide legal certainty.  It will be an improvement for ordinary citizens who come in to contact with the law.</P>
        <P>This was quite clearly the view of the regulatory impact analysis also.  Completion of the statute law revision programme would simplify the Statute Book and reduce legal and business transaction costs.  In 2010 the project stalled due to Government cuts to the budget of the Office of the Attorney General.  By the end of 2010 the Attorney General, in an effort to complete the project in the face of increasing cuts to resources and staff, decided to recommence the project on a greatly reduced cost achieved using the JobBridge national internship scheme.</P>
        <P>This is an important project and I commend those involved.  I commend the Minister of State on introducing the Bill.  It is possibly one of the most comprehensive Bills even though some people question whether it is important.  The need for proper regulation and a clear understanding of the law means it is worthwhile work.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>If I checked the Official Report, I am sure I would find my contribution to this process in 2007 and 2009.  I will probably make the same meandering contribution now.  It is an interesting item of legislation and, as the previous speaker said, a major amount of physical work goes into the compilation of the constituent elements of the Bill.  There is a lesson here for parliamentary democracy, the law of the land, law and order and the proper running of the State.  We now claim to live in a very modern Republic.</P>
        <P>The legislative process through the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the President is lengthy.  In so-called far less advanced times, parliamentary intervention was a frequent occurrence and hopefully on many occasions it righted wrongs and brought clarification in answer to doubt.  These thousands of Acts and orders which have been examined cover the length and breadth of the country and deal with all possible subjects.  I note, for example, lists of hundreds of people who had applied and were accepted for naturalisation.  The current naturalisation process may be regarded as lengthy yet the process has been on the Statute Book for hundreds of years.</P>
        <P>I commend all those involved in the detailed work which is tedious, slow and laborious.  This work has updated as much as possible the appropriate laws and will make it easier for all legal practitioners to give the appropriate advice.</P>
        <P>As Senator Cullinane noted, there are many problems facing the country and people may ask why so much time and effort has been expended on this project but it is a necessary part of the tidying up process which is now complete.  A total of 22,885 statutes were analysed, 3,000 are under consideration here and presumably the other statutes are not relevant or cannot be acted upon.  This progress in bringing the Statute Book up to date is welcome and there will be no political division.  The history and politics buffs such as the Minister of State will find a great amount of fascinating material contained within the Bill and of interest to every townland and parish in the country.  It could serve as bed-time reading for people who are so minded.  I commend the Minister of State and his officials and all those involved in the project for a job well done which will provide the clarification and certainty in areas where there might have been doubt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the indulgence of the Chair, I wish to make a point which I omitted in my contribution.  This Bill is a cleaning up exercise for the Statute Book.  I ask if the language used in legislation could be simplified for use by the public.  Several people have said to me that the language used in Bills is such that one would need a law degree to understand it.  I ask if this simplification could be incorporated into how Bills are drafted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for a very interesting and stimulating debate on this important piece of legislation.  This country has a unique parliamentary tradition.  Given the history of the pre-Independence period and the period from Independence to the present and despite the turmoil, the violence and difficulties, this is the fourth oldest parliamentary democracy in Europe.  We did not go the way of fascist Europe in the 1930s and 1940s and throughout that period, even with the difficulty of the Civil War, our Parliament has remained in place since Independence.  Even though we are a young State, we are an old parliamentary democracy.  Even in the period before Independence, the parliamentary tradition was very strong and with such a tradition it is inevitable that laws are passed which rightly focus on the rights of individuals and of companies and associations.  This unique parliamentary experience has produced all these rights in such a way that is comprehensible to the public and available to them.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Before I reply to the individual points made by Senators in their contributions, this Government is very aware of the need, when introducing new laws, to ensure those laws are put through a robust test which we describe as the regulatory impact assessment process.  It is an ambition in the programme for Government that any new legislation must be filtered out, as it were, by way of a regulatory impact assessment before it is published.  This process gives us the confidence to know that proper consultation has occurred at drafting and pre-drafting stages so that there is an engagement with stakeholders and that some of the issues are teased out before Committee Stage.  I cannot say if this is what happens in all cases but I refer to a Bill which was introduced in this House by Senator Quinn before the last general election, the construction contracts Bill, and which is now before the other House.  That Bill underwent a fully published regulatory impact assessment and the Bill will be the better for it, in my view.</P>
        <P>This revision should not be regarded merely as a theoretical exercise or some kind of academic reading of books which takes years and whereby obsolete legislation is removed.  There are real and practical benefits from this exercise which were clearly demonstrated in the OECD report in 2010 which highlighted the work of the statute law revision project and commended the then Government for continuing that work.  I echo the points made by Senator Quinn because once legislation is tidied up and obsolete statutes are removed, the cost of red tape to business is reduced and this is a service to the professions, to business, to ordinary citizens and there is clarification of entitlements under the law.  There is nothing theoretical about this project because its results are practical and real and it will make a significant difference to practitioners and the general public.</P>
        <P>The codification of law is in all our interests.  I refer to Senator O&rsquo; Donovan&rsquo;s point about codification of the criminal law and I raised this matter with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In order to effect codification, the obsolete legislation must first be removed because the total burden of legislation needs to be reduced.  I fully agree with his remarks that we need a simple codified body of legislation not only in criminal law but also for financial dealings.  Every year I make the same criticism of the Finance Act because it amends all the preceding principal Acts.  This is not a good way to do business because people find it difficult to understand where the law stands.</P>
        <P>To reply to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, the first objective of this revision exercise, which has been ongoing for the best part of a decade, is to remove the obsolete legislation and then to look at the post-Independence legislation which is obsolete and which is the next part of the work and which needs to be changed.</P>
        <P>I wish to reply to a number of points raised by Senator Sheahan about the continuation of the project.  As I indicated, I envisage that subject to appropriate consultation, resources and a Government decision, attention will need to be given in early course to statutory rules, orders and charters.  I am also keen to look at post-1922 legislation, if possible.  It will therefore not be just up to Independence but also post-Independence.  I am hoping to have the support of the House for any further amendments that my Department might bring forward in the course of the statute law revision project.</P>
        <P>He also correctly raised the question on detailed consultation, asking if we had consulted widely with stakeholders to ensure we are getting it right in removing obsolete law.  The contribution of relevant bodies and interested parties has always been welcomed.  Draft schedules have been available on the Attorney General&rsquo;s website and contact details have invited submissions.  I understand that submissions have been made.  I would envisage that any further phase will also welcome such contributions from interested parties.  I want to assure the Senator, therefore, that that has occurred.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn referred to what he described as a glorious spring clean of legislation, and he is right in that respect.  I agree with his remarks concerning the need to reduce bureaucracy and red tape, while ultimately introducing codified law.  I also agree with him and other colleagues that when we are introducing legislation it should be written as plainly and simply as possible.  It is more complicated when one is cross-referencing new law with existing law, which comprises a number of Acts.  Nonetheless there is a responsibility for plain speaking and clear laws, which help the public and practitioners to understand what is in the mind of the Oireachtas when it passes laws.</P>
        <P>I am aware of fascinating discussions that occur when the High Court or Supreme Court tries to get into the mind of the Oireachtas and discern what it meant when passing a given law.  Frequently, judges read the Official Report of debates to get a sense of what was in the mind of Members of the Oireachtas when a certain law was passed.  I agree with colleagues therefore that we have an obligation when introducing laws to write them as plainly and straightforwardly as we possibly can so that there is clarity, and that ultimately these matters are not open to judicial contest if a legislative action is not clear.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Lorraine Higgins who, from her professional perspective, made the point better than I did about the need to remove obsolete legislation.  She put on the record the practical benefits this legislation will give to legal practitioners.  When they are presenting submissions to the courts, they will not have to go back through pre-Independence legislation, much of which is obsolete and will be removed as a result of this Bill.  That point was well made.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins introduced some other arguments.  While I accept the point he is making about codification, I think he has got the wrong end of the stick when it comes to this Bill.  His basic premise was that we should just be concerned about what has happened since Independence, and that nothing that happened before Independence has any great practical impact or effect.  With respect to Senator Mullins, however, he is not right about that.  There are many pieces of pre-Independence legislation which we are keeping and which have a direct impact on organisations, groups and rights that currently exist.  I will refer to two of them.  The Dublin Fire Brigade and Dublin Corporation Act of 1862 is being retained in law largely because it is still of benefit.  In addition, the Coroners and Mortuary Act of 1907 is also being retained.  The Senator proposes that our task should be to examine everything post-Independence and that we should forget the historical, academic pre-Independence exercise.  It does not stack up that way, however.  This is not an academic process, it is a wholly practical one.  I have cited those two pieces of legislation which we will retain because they are still of significant benefit.</P>
        <P>I want to thank Senator Keane for her contribution which referred to the publication of pre-1922 legislation on the Internet, of which I would be supportive.  At present, the publication of legislation on the Internet is a function of the Law Reform Commission, which I understand is in the process of arranging to make available electronically certain pre-1922 Acts.  That is the point Senator Keane raised.</P>
        <P>I also wish to thank Senator Cullinane and others for their kind and generous remarks about the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  Senator Cullinane referred to the fact that interns were working on this project, but I think that is an entirely good thing.  They were working with experienced legal researchers and colleagues in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, and I hope they have got some good experience from doing so.  It is good that they were involved in this project and their enormous enthusiasm and assistance for the process is rightly appreciated.  I hope they have obtained something from that training.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, this has been a very useful Second Stage debate on an important Bill, which will have a practical impact on the business community, legal practitioners and citizens generally.  It will bring to the next stage of development a piece of work that has gone on for the best part of a decade and from which there are real benefits.  It reminds us all of our continuous responsibilities in this House and the other House, whether we are introducing new law or amending existing law, to do so in a way which is modern and brings maximum clarity to bear.  In that way people can know what exactly is in the mind of the Oireachtas and where the balance lies in any legislation initiated by any Member or any Government.</P>
        <P>I look forward to Committee Stage which I understand, with the agreement of the House, may be taken next week.  If there are specific issues I will deal with them on that occasion.  I have been reliably informed that witchcraft laws were repealed in 2007, so we do not have to re-examine them.</P>

    <Title>Symphysiotomy: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank those Senators who called for this debate which deals with a subject that is not only emotive but very pertinent and which needs to be dealt with.  I will start by explaining precisely what symphysiotomy is, to give some context about its use as a medical procedure and specifically its use in Ireland.  Symphysiotomy is a medical procedure that was primarily used before the advent of safe caesarean sections.  The procedure was carried out in Ireland from about 1920 until the early 1980s.  It was gradually replaced by caesarean section as the preferred method of delivery in childbirth where required.  It is clear the procedure continued to be used in Ireland for some time after it had been all but discontinued in other developed countries, most notably in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Reilly, and I are conscious of the distress symphysiotomy has caused to a number of women and recognise the pain this issue has caused to those affected by it.  The Government is committed to dealing with it sensitively, so that if at all possible this issue can be brought to an appropriate and fair conclusion for all the women affected by it.  Our first priority is to ensure the health needs of those who have had a symphysiotomy are met quickly and effectively.  With this in mind we are committed to ensuring the greatest possible supports and services are made available to women who continue to suffer the effects of having undergone this procedure.</P>
        <P>The women concerned continue to receive attention and care through a number of services which have been put in place.  These include the provision of medical cards to all who requested them; the nomination of a liaison officer for a patients&rsquo; group comprised of women who underwent a symphysiotomy procedure; the availability of independent clinical advice for former patients; the organisation of individual pathways of care; and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up for women, including medical assessment, gynaecology assessment, orthopaedic assessment, counselling, physiotherapy, reflexology, home help, acupuncture, osteopathy and fast-tracked hospital appointments.  Also included is the refund of medical expenses related to symphysiotomy in respect of medication and private treatments.  A triple assessment service was established for patients at Cappagh Hospital in Dublin in January 2005, and support groups, facilitated by a counsellor, were established in 2004 in Dundalk and Drogheda for women living in north-east region.  A national lead officer for symphysiotomy was nominated.  In addition, five designated regional liaison officers are in place across the regions of the HSE.  The provision of these necessary support services for women is monitored and overseen by the Health Service Executive which is committed to being proactive in seeking out and offering help to women who underwent a symphysiotomy and who may wish to avail of the services offered by the HSE.</P>
        <P>A figure of 1,500 symphysiotomies has been suggested for the period 1944 to 1992, giving a rate of approximately six symphysiotomies per 10,000 births.  While there was a large variation, even in the hospital with the highest rates the maximum rate appears to have been six per 1,000 births in one year.  Thus, it was a rare intervention in comparison with caesarean section, for example, which rose steadily in the same period from three per 100 births in the early 1940s to more than 20 per 100 births now.  This is not in any way to minimise any serious effects and suffering it had on the women concerned, but it indicates the procedure was quite rarely carried out in Ireland overall.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to act on the basis of the best evidence that is available on this issue as in all aspects of our health services.  To this end the chief medical officer of the Department of Health last year commissioned an independent research report into the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.  The aim of the report is to provide an accurate picture of the extent of use of symphysiotomy in Ireland, and an examination of the Irish practice relative to other countries.  It is to include an assessment of the circumstances in which the procedure was carried out, what protocols or guidance existed at the time to guide professional practice, and details of when the practice changed and why.</P>
        <P>The researcher was given the specific terms of reference to: document the rates of symphysiotomy and maternal mortality in Ireland from 1940 to date by reference to available data, including annual reports and other reports; assess symphysiotomy rates against maternal mortality rates over the period; critically appraise international reviews of symphysiotomy practice and associated rates in a number of comparable countries in the world and in Ireland; review any guidelines and protocols on symphysiotomy that applied in Ireland over the time period; and write a report based on the findings of the analysis providing an accurate picture of the extent of use of symphysiotomy in Ireland and an examination of the Irish experience relative to other countries.</P>
        <P>The academic researcher concerned was formally appointed on 1 June 2011.  The researcher experienced unforeseen difficulties in accessing information sources and, as a result, submitted the report behind schedule in late January 2012.  The researcher informed the Department that this was due primarily to the challenges with accessing historical data from a time when records on the procedure were not routinely kept.  In line with best practice, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has initiated a peer review process of the draft report and he proposes to make the report available for consultation with relevant individuals and bodies this month.  Following the consultation process and taking into account the outcome of the peer review, the report will be finalised and published.  The Minister will then consider the final report and decide on the next steps required to address this situation.</P>
        <P>Ireland is now one of the safest places to have a baby.  We have one of the lowest maternal mortality rates and perinatal mortality rates in the world.  Ireland is a now a very safe place to have a caesarean section and we should be proud that we are recognised internationally as leaders in the field of obstetrics.  Recent legislation requires doctors to maintain and update their competence.  These new requirements for doctors to maintain their professional competence are a significant step and concrete assurance that medical practitioners are appropriately qualified and competent to practise safely.</P>
        <P>The national clinical effectiveness guidelines published last year provide a framework for national endorsement of clinical guidelines and audit to optimise patient care.  These guidelines will contribute to improving health outcomes by reducing variation in practice, improving quality of clinical decisions, influencing health service policy, and informing service users and the public about the service they should be receiving.  These and many other developments are ensuring that the health system is striving to fulfil the vision of the commission on patient safety and quality assurance of what has been termed &ldquo;knowledgeable patients receiving safe and effective care from skilled professionals in appropriate environments with assessed outcomes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The new clinical programmes being developed and implemented in the HSE represent one of the most important developments in this regard.  These are currently led by the HSE directorate of clinical strategy and programmes which was established to improve and standardise patient care throughout the Health Service Executive by bringing together clinical disciplines and enabling them to share innovative solutions to deliver greater benefits to every user of HSE services.  The clinical programmes are a multidisciplinary initiative between the HSE and the various faculties, and generally include patient representatives.  Each programme is led by a clinician.  The clinical programmes are a sea-change in the way we provide health care in Ireland.  This new approach utilises key proven drivers of success in improving disease management and is aimed at improving patient care.</P>
        <P>The obstetrics and gynaecology clinical programme is led by Professor Michael Turner.  The aim of the obstetrics and gynaecology programme is to improve health-care choices for women.  Its initial work aims to implement key guidelines; establish local programme implementation groups to facilitate change; develop national models of maternity care; develop a standard approach to capturing and reporting audit and performance metrics; develop solutions and guidelines to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies requiring neonatal intensive care; develop workforce planning and training models and strategy; and investigate the numbers of women attending for antenatal care in early pregnancy.</P>
        <P>More generally there has been considerable progress in the options of maternity care available to expectant mothers in Ireland.  They now have a number of choices they can make in respect of the obstetric care they choose.  Women may opt for a combined care package with their GP and the hospital, under the maternity and infant care scheme which provides a number of free GP and maternity hospital visits to all eligible expectant mothers.  There are also a number of midwifery-led units nationally which offer the opportunity to expectant mothers to give birth in a uniquely designed birth room cared for by a team of experienced midwives.  These units are located close to hospitals should an emergency arise that requires specialist intervention.</P>
        <P>While these developments can bring further improvements to maternity services in the future the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and I are committed to addressing the issues that have arisen from the legacy of past practice regarding symphysiotomy.  The Government is also committed to dealing with this issue, with all the sensitivity which is undoubtedly required, do whatever can be done to help bring this issue to appropriate finality as far as is possible for those affected by it.  I have outlined the supports that have been provided to the women affected and the progress in finalising the research report.  We hope to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible &mdash; the women who have had this procedure deserve nothing less.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and our guests in the Visitors Gallery who are survivors of symphysiotomy.  I am entirely unqualified to in any way accurately verbalise how the victims of symphysiotomy must feel given the many challenges and difficulties they have had to endure throughout their lives as a result of this procedure.  As we sadly often say in these Houses on a variety of issues relating to health as well as other disciplines, there are many reasons for failure but there are no excuses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech is welcome in many respects.  The ladies present today, many of whom were here for the D&aacute;il debate, will note that her speech is almost identical to what the Minister, Deputy Reilly, said in the D&aacute;il some months ago.  While it is welcome that various steps were taken in terms of services being made available to the people in question, it does not provide the necessary redress and closure which the Minister mentioned in her speech.  I am not a qualified person in this field but I am aware of the pain and trauma, as it was explained to me by women such as those who have taken the time to attend this debate today.</P>
        <P>The report mentioned by the Minister has come in for some criticism in terms of the independence of the people preparing it and the suggestion that the terms of reference could potentially compromise its outcome.  That is a worry.  It is something the Minister must address as quickly as possible.  It is certainly a worry that it was commissioned some time ago and appears to have been with the Government since Christmas or shortly afterwards.  I appreciate that advice was sought from the Attorney General and so forth as to what the legal implications might be.  Governments must consider these things.  However, it was then due to be put out for consultation with all the relevant people and concerned stakeholders.  One of the briefing notes from one of the groups representing some of the survivors, Survivors of Symphysiotomy, SOS, alleges that it has heard nothing from the Minister at this time.  It appears ridiculous in the extreme that a process to consult with all stakeholders would appear to exclude the single most important stakeholders, the people who have been affected by this.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to closure as soon as is possible.  What is the hold-up?  When will some form of apology be put to the people who should not have undergone this procedure?  When will there be suggestions as to what form of redress and compensation can be given?  Nothing of monetary value can bring back one&rsquo;s health after so many years of pain and difficulty and the issues that have had to be endured as a result of these procedures, but the one thing we can do is speed up the process.  Indeed, I sat where the Government&rsquo;s spokesperson is currently sitting for 70 hours, with just toilet breaks, to ensure the National Asset Management Agency legislation was passed by the Houses.  Now we are dealing with an issue that is important to a relatively small number of people.  They have spent their lives enduring the pain and trying to get some answers, in the first instance, and trying to secure an apology to which they are entitled and some level of redress.</P>
        <P>That is not to take from some of the important services highlighted by the Minister which have finally been made available.  However, we appear to be going around in circles.  Can the Minister put a final time-frame on when this report will be published so all of us can see it?  What is in that we are so afraid to let people know?  It is over a year since the report was commissioned and several months since it was made available to the Government.  Some of the stakeholders, including the most important stakeholders, have not been consulted about it.  Nobody is getting any younger, and the demographic of the people concerned demands that progress be made much more quickly.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to delay the House but the single most important issue is closure.  Closure as soon as is possible sounds a little like the never-never.  When it is necessary these Houses are able to legislate within a matter of hours, not days.  Why can we not turn this around more quickly, in the interests of the people who have suffered?  Why cannot the Government apply a deadline for itself?  It is now mid-May.  Can it not pledge to publish this report by 1 June and publish the recommendations it intends to implement within a week or so of that?</P>
        <P>Even when I was sitting on the Government side of the House I often criticised these woolly reports and speeches.  That is no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, or the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, because I know they did not draft these speeches.  However, they say things such as &ldquo;there were unforeseen circumstances&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  If somebody is commissioned to produce a report, they must do it.  If there were unforeseen circumstances, does that mean people blocked certain information being made available to the person who is preparing a report on behalf of the State?  If so, that is a criminal matter.  What were the unforeseen circumstances?  When will the report be published?  When will the recommendations on foot of the report be published?  When will the people affected by this ultimately gain some level of redress, to which they are entitled?  Indeed, most of them have spent most of their lives waiting for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank her for her comprehensive overview of this issue.  I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this important debate.  It is necessary that the House recognises the pain and distress which have been suffered and continue to be suffered by women as a result of symphysiotomy procedures which were carried out in Irish hospitals.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to read a Supreme Court judgment which offers a one line definition that sums up the grotesque procedure.  It states that a symphysiotomy is the cutting of the cartilage that binds the two pubic bones, thus permanently enlarging the pelvis.  This was in the case of Olivia Kearney<i> v.</i> Ethna McQuillan and the North Eastern Health Board.  The pain of sufferers was described by the report of Mr. Clements in that case, when he stated: &ldquo;as a result of [the procedure] Mrs. Kearney has suffered 35 years of pain, discomfort, loss of sexual amenity and loss of opportunity for further children.  The operation was wholly improper and unjustifiable.  That it was done without consent or explanation, in clear contravention of the hospital&rsquo;s own ethical guidelines, adds to Mrs. Kearney&rsquo;s grief and anger&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is deeply regrettable that symphysiotomy procedures were carried out in Ireland for some time after the practice had been discontinued in other developed countries.  It is especially regrettable given that the preferred alternative delivery method of caesarean section had become the standard for difficult births from the 1930s in most other parts of the developed world.  The practice of symphysiotomy was allowed to continue in Ireland because of deep regulatory failure.  The women who underwent the procedure were in some cases used as clinical training material for staff bound for developing countries, because the practice was a low cost surgery.  This almost undoubtedly led to the procedure being used in cases where it was wholly inappropriate.</P>
        <P>However, as the Minister said, it is suggested that some 1,500 symphysiotomies took place in Ireland during the period 1944 to 1992, that is, six symphysiotomies per 10,000 births.  The maximum rate appears to be six per 1,000 births per year.  It was therefore a rare intervention in comparison with caesarean sections, which rose from three per 100 births in the early 1940s to over 20 per 100 births now.  These figures are not presented to minimise the suffering of the women concerned, but to indicate that the procedure was rare in Ireland overall.</P>
        <P>In recognising the pain and needless suffering caused to the women who underwent the symphysiotomy procedure it is important to ensure that a situation like this can never arise again.  I welcome the commissioning of an independent report by the chief medical officer of the Department of Health into the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>By compiling an accurate picture of the use of the procedure and protocols of the time relative to other countries, it will be possible to formulate guidelines for the future.  I also recognise the attention and care services that already have been put in place, including the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice, the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.  The Minister for Health has also stated his intention to have in place a named person to deal with all queries in respect of symphysiotomy, which will make it easier for women who have suffered the procedure to obtain the services to which they are entitled.  I note the Minister of State has already referred to this measure.  The provision of these services is monitored and overseen by the HSE, which is committed to offering help to women who underwent the procedure.</P>
        <P>I hope the recommendations of the report that is due to be published will be implemented and together with the support services already in place, a holistic care and support structure will exist for women who have suffered long-term side-effects to their health and quality of life as a consequence of a symphysiotomy procedure.  It is through the creation of co-ordinated initiatives that scenarios such as that which arose in Drogheda, where Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital continued with the practice of symphysiotomy after it had been discontinued in many other Irish hospitals, will not happen into the future.</P>
        <P>I refer to a decision of the High Court in the aforementioned case of Olivia Kearney<i> v.</i> Ethna McQuillan and the North Eastern Health Board.  Ms Kearney&rsquo;s case initially was dismissed by the High Court on the grounds of undue delay, thereby creating a further hurdle for her in receiving justice for a gratuitous and improper procedure carried out on her.  I believe it is unfortunate the courts have been the route to justice for those who have suffered as a consequence of the procedure.  The Supreme Court decision was delivered on 26 March 2010.  It is important that on publication of the report, the recommendations will be implemented at an early date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad to note the circumstances in which women give birth have changed significantly.  Ireland now is one of the safest places in which to have a baby.  We have one of the lowest perinatal mortality rates in Europe and have set up a number of procedures to which the Minister of State has referred.  As recently as 1998, only 14 years ago, maternity hospitals were not inspected on a regular basis but this practice is now in place.  There is a new national clinical director, Dr. Michael Turner, who, as a former master of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, has considerable experience.  Guidelines are issued and updated on a regular basis on all obstetrical and gynaecological procedures.  Moreover, each maternity unit carries out its own internal reviews when errors arise and I acknowledge errors will arise in any hospital, regardless of the area of medical care.  However, reviews are put in place immediately to ensure the mistake does not arise again.  There is in place a medical competency assurance scheme for all medical consultants that is overseen by the Medical Council and each maternity unit must produce an annual report setting out the figures for each procedure performed in that unit.  These six measures set out clearly the focus on ensuring the mistakes that occurred in this regard for many years will never arise again.  Moreover, it may be necessary that such procedures be reviewed and updated on a continuous basis.  Taken together, this new guidance and regulatory structure should be robust to prevent a situation similar to that which arose and to ensure similar mistakes are never made again.  I look forward to the report&rsquo;s publication and to the full implementation of its terms.  I again thank the Labour Party for facilitating this debate and the Minister of State for her attendance and for giving Members the time to deal with the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also thank my Labour Party colleagues for providing the opportunity to Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to make statements on the scandalous medical malpractice of symphysiotomy, which was performed in Ireland at least 1,500 times between 1944 and 1992.  I also extend the warmest of welcomes to the survivors of symphysiotomy who are present today in the Visitors Gallery and elsewhere in Leinster House.  I commend the dignity, bravery and honesty they have shown in sharing their personal traumas with Members during a number of Oireachtas briefing and information sessions.  I thank them for opening Members&rsquo; eyes to the at best utterly inappropriate and at worst barbaric treatment they suffered at the hands of trained medical professionals in Irish hospitals.</P>
        <P>I followed the statements on symphysiotomy in the D&aacute;il last March with great interest and I agree with the comment by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, which was echoed today by the Minister of State, that we should be proud that Ireland is recognised internationally as a leader in the field of obstetrics.  We also should be proud that with only one maternal death per 100,000 live births, Ireland has one of the lowest maternal mortality ratios in the world.  However, as is evident from the statements being made today, Ireland has a far from unblemished record in the area of maternal health care.  Between 1920 and as recently as 1992, many women suffered serious maternal morbidities under the care of trained medical practitioners in Irish hospitals.  Maternal morbidity is defined as an illness or disability in women caused directly or indirectly by factors relating to pregnancy, childbirth or the post delivery period.  The vast majority of maternal morbidities are preventable and as such, their prevalence constitutes a serious violation of women&rsquo;s fundamental rights to life, liberty and security, as well as to health, dignity and freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.</P>
        <P>In common with many others, I am extremely frustrated by the delay in the publication of the report into the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.  Extremely serious concerns must be addressed for the survivors to receive the acknowledgement, truth and justice they deserve.  Chief among them is the contention by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Ireland, upon which it appears the Department of Health is content to rely, that the practice of symphysiotomy was carried out due to medical necessity and only until consensus regarding caesarean section changed and it was deemed safe.  It is my hope that in carrying out a critical appraisal of international reviews of symphysiotomy practice and associated rates in comparable countries in the world, as well as an examination of the Irish experience relative to other countries, this report will refute this contention once and for all.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Reilly, himself acknowledged last March that symphysiotomy continued to be used in Ireland for some time after it had been all but discontinued in other developed countries and continued to be used for a longer period in particular hospitals, most notably in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  Rather than a procedure arising out of medical necessity, the evidence suggests symphysiotomy was the preference of some senior doctors in keeping with their conservative Catholic belief systems, whereby caesarean section had a safe birth limit of up to four children, while symphysiotomy would allow women have an unlimited number of children despite the horrendous cost to their health and well-being.</P>
        <P>While the last thing anyone wants is another institutional abuse scandal, if there is one, and I believe there is, it must be met head on.  The culture of secrecy, collusion and cover-up that surrounded institutional and clerical child sex abuse cannot be allowed to flourish again now as, otherwise, what has been learned?  I cannot help but discern a parallel between the recent calls for Cardinal Brady&rsquo;s resignation and this issue.  Something that was not illegal at a particular time or indeed which was accepted practice within an institution or discipline but which in hindsight is found to be utterly inappropriate and morally wrong, cannot and should not be immune to a contemporary and robust response.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed by the limited terms used by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, during the D&aacute;il statements in March in referring to the experience of the survivors.  He spoke of pain and distress but it is clear to me, having listened to the women&rsquo;s personal testimonies, that such descriptions are totally inadequate in the face of the devastating impact symphysiotomy had on their lives and those of their families.  In addition to the horrendous physical injuries they suffered as a direct result of the procedure, which sustained and worsened in the absence of appropriate aftercare, the serious emotional and psychological suffering they endure must be acknowledged.   The birth of a child &mdash; for many of the women affected this was the birth of their first child &mdash; should be the most joyful time in a woman&rsquo;s life.  Instead, for the survivors, of whom there are currently a little over 150, the birth of their child was the beginning of a nightmare.  This was a nightmare as a result of a medical procedure to which they did not consent, of which they were not informed of after they had it, in respect of which they did not receive medical treatment and aftercare, and the evidence of which suggests was not medically necessary.  Shockingly, there are women who, despite having presented to doctors for treatment for various medical ailments over the years, only realised following the RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; investigation into symphysiotomy in February 2010 that they were survivors.  These women still present as survivors in 2011.  Sadly, as time passes survivors are dying.  We know that at least four survivors have passed away since the Walsh report was commissioned.</P>
        <P>The women are the primary victims here.  We have heard testimonies from women who could not lift or attend to the needs of their newborn babies due to the pain they were in and of the helplessness, guilt and shame they felt as a result.  We heard from those who could no longer play beloved sports, to those who could no longer walk, of how their quality of life was irrevocably altered.  We also know that there are secondary victims.  They, too, must be acknowledged.  One in ten babies died during symphysiotomy births.  Children lost the love and nurture of mothers so traumatised by their experiences that they could not bond with their baby and subsequent babies.  Likewise, husbands suffered as a result of the effects on their wives.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments today and those of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, in March in relation to the provision of medical care to the survivors, which I welcome.  However, having also heard from the women, I am concerned that they are having difficulty accessing services.  I am particularly concerned about the difficulty some are facing accessing their medical records.  Some women have been told there records no longer exist and others have simply been denied access to them.  I presume this is the same &ldquo;unforeseen difficulty&rdquo; which the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, mentioned Dr. Walsh was experiencing in explaining the delay in the submission of her report?  I accept that records get lost over the passage of time, in isolated instances but when it seems to be systemic my antenna goes up.</P>
        <P>I heard from one woman that her doctor had requested a hospital in Dublin to carry out an X-ray to establish whether symphysiotomy had been performed on her.  To establish or indeed rule out symphysiotomy the doctor had referred the woman to the hospital for a stand-up X-ray, specifically.  The hospital refused to carry out the X-ray in this manner.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, spoke about addressing the legacy of the past.  What I have just outlined happened last week, not in the past, which makes me question whether the system is trying to protect itself.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State send out a clear message today that it is totally and utterly unacceptable for the medical profession to frustrate in any way the right of these women to redress and remedy?</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to the House.  I am grateful for the opportunity to lead Labour Party Senators in this Labour Party motion on symphysiotomy.  I welcome the many survivors in the Visitors Gallery today and those who contacted me in recent weeks and months, who could not be here today but are following the proceedings on the Internet.  The response I have received on this issue from many different people and the media has been fantastic, which shows how important everyone takes this issue.</P>
        <P>It is almost one year since I was elected to the Seanad.  During the past year I have taken a keen interest in the plight of victims of symphysiotomy and have attended many meetings where I have been over-awed by the courage, bravery, resilience and quest of those involved to attain natural justice for what happened to them.  As we have heard already, symphysiotomy was a dangerous childbirth operation performed in Ireland from approximately 1920 to the early 1980s.  It involved severing the symphysis joint or in the case of pubiotomy, cutting the pubic bone.  Up to 1,500 of these operations were performed in Ireland between 1944 and 1992, with approximately 150 known survivors.  As a result of symphysiotomy many of the women involved are living their lives in constant pain, suffer from incontinence and many have suffered serious psychological affects, as evidenced from the many briefings we have had throughout this year from the victims.</P>
        <P>I read yesterday of a case of symphysiotomy carried out in 1992.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has been regularly mentioned as a hospital which carried out this procedure.  Four of my five children were born at that hospital, two of them by 1992 and one in 1993.  My fourth child was born in Louth hospital which also carried out this procedure.  It is frightening to hear this procedure was being carried out only a short time ago.  Symphysiotomy procedures were, it appears, performed in some hospitals more than others.  It appears to have been favoured in some hospitals run by religious orders.  One woman told me yesterday of how she was told she was having a symphysiotomy because she was a Catholic and was then advised to have at least ten pregnancies after it, following which she would be okay.</P>
        <P>It has also been reported that symphysiotomy, despite the fact that it had been discontinued in all other European countries, was preferred to caesarean section as that would have meant giving family planning advice.  Symphysiotomy was regarded as preferable to that.  I welcome the support and services that are in place.  I know having spoken to women in the north-east region that there are many such services in place.  I acknowledge and commend these services, including the provision of medical cards for all those who have requested them, the appointment of a liaison officer and access to medical assessment, gynaecological assessment, counselling, reflexology, physiotherapy, osteopathy and acupuncture.  However, I call on the Minister of State to do everything possible to ensure all the victims of symphysiotomy are aware and availing of these services.</P>
        <P>What struck me most, having spoken to many of the women concerned, is that the majority of the women concerned are in the latter years of their lives.  They may not perhaps be aware that as survivors of symphysiotomy they can access medical cards.  I ask that everything be done to ensure they are looked after.  I also ask the Minister, who I know has taken a keen interest in the proceedings to date, to seek publication of the Walsh report.  I welcome the comment today that the report will be with the stakeholders at the end of the month, which is great news.  I look forward to publication of the report and hope that, following its publication, we can have a further comprehensive debate in the Houses on the matter.</P>
        <P>We owe it to the women concerned to do everything we can to ensure they receive adequate redress for what happened to them.  I hope the report will provide a full and comprehensive response on the reason this procedure was performed more frequently in Ireland that in any other country in western Europe.  I found it deeply upsetting to learn that the practise of symphysiotomy was often performed in Irish training hospitals.  These hospitals were training doctors to perform the procedure in Third World countries as an alternative and cheaper solution to caesarean section in a difficult childbirth.  I ask that the Minister consider how best we can ensure these victims achieve natural justice, be it by lifting the Statute of Limitations for a year or by setting up a redress board.  It is important that justice is attained for these women who have suffered all their lives.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to bring closure for these women.  I ask that we do not lose the opportunity to do so.  We must stand up and commit to that which has already been agreed.  The women concerned deserve an acknowledgement of what happened to them.  It is only right and proper that they receive an apology in that regard.  They must also be made aware of and have access to all the supports and services they need.  I welcome the formation in recent months of the cross-party Oireachtas group in support of symphysiotomy.  I welcome also the opportunity to be an active member of this group and acknowledge the support of all members of the Oireachtas on this issue.  It is hoped that in calling for this debate today we have again highlighted the pain and anguish and need for redress for these women.  I hope we can continue to further engage with the victims whom I stress must be at the heart of all our efforts.  I ask that the Minister of State do all in her power to ensure that it is the victims who remain the first priority, that they are listened to at every stage and are consulted as a priority in every development.  The practice of symphysiotomy has been tied up in secrecy for years.  It is now time responsible groups came forward and acknowledged the wrong done to these ladies.  Very often these victims were not told what had happened to them and many continued to live their lives in pain only to discover in recent years what has been done.  I pay tribute to the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, which opened this up for us.  There have been many disturbing stories of patients&rsquo; records going missing or getting lost and we need to address this.</P>
        <P>We must strive to attain closure for these brave and outstanding women who were so wronged by our country, many of whom I have met and who are from my own area of Louth-Meath, where symphysiotomy procedures were carried out in the Lourdes hospital.  I repeat that many of these ladies are elderly and time is not on their side.  We are talking about approximately 150 survivors.  I know the Minister of State will not let these women down.  The youngest survivor, who has come forward to date, is 47 years of age while the eldest is in her 90s.  Many of these ladies are now frail and vulnerable and it is imperative that the Government does everything it can to ensure these victims receive acknowledgement and redress.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the many victims we have met and who continue to support each other and who have provided invaluable help to each other over the past ten years.  People in my own area, Olivia Kearney and Kathleen Naughton &mdash; I think Senator Burke referred to Mrs. Kearney earlier &mdash; have campaigned tirelessly to bring closure to this issue.  To these and all the victims of symphysiotomy, I thank them for their bravery, courage and ongoing battle to ensure they attain the justice and closure they richly deserve.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is a good Minister; she is a decent woman and she was obviously extremely embarrassed by what she had to parrot out today.  It was the worst speech I have ever heard her deliver.  I will protect her reputation by saying that it was headlined &ldquo;Speech Material for Kathleen Lynch&rdquo;.  I do not believe she would have come out with this drivel.  She started by saying she would like to explain precisely what symphysiotomy is but she did not do so.  She never mentioned anything about the cruelty, the barbarity and the veterinary practices that were visited upon the unfortunate women, so why hold out the promise and not do so?</P>
        <P>A number of things have not really been touched on, although Senator Burke quoted a Supreme Court judgment which gave a very short definition of symphysiotomy.  Let us know what symphysiotomy is: it is a cruel and dangerous child birth operation that unhinges the pelvis severing the symphysis joint or, in the case of pubiotomy, which is an even greater aggression, sundering the pubic bones.  This was the only country in the civilised world for the last 60 years of the past century to do this.</P>
        <P>There was a vested interest in it.  The medical profession protected itself.  I remember I spoke on this issue on the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008, which was about whistleblowers.  People were terrified to speak out on this issue.  I remember in 2010 when I raised it again &mdash; I have raised it repeatedly &mdash; I was told there was going to be a report and that it was going to be referred to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the very people who were involved in it.  I put on the record two years ago that I was not impressed by the representative of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Some years ago, it was asked by the same Minister for a report.  It gave one page which was as contemptuous as the way in which this House was treated last night.  It dismissed everything and it was incorrect to do so.  It was the old boys network protecting itself.  This was an unnecessary and dangerous operation that had been impugned since 1777 and it was still practised here.</P>
        <P>Let us ask why it was practised.  I do not often speak well of journalists these days but Marie O&rsquo;Connor wrote a book about it after she wrote in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  I gather she is in the Visitors Galley and I would like to salute her because it is a wonderful book.  She had the courage to say in this book what lay behind it.  A sectarian, religious clique dominated and dictated.  The Roman Catholic Church, in particular, always demands the right to interfere in people&rsquo;s sexual and reproductive lives and in a democracy, it should not have that right.  I put on record some of what Marie O&rsquo;Connor stated.  Religious beliefs appeared to be central to the latter day practice of these operations in Ireland.  Prominent practitioners of symphysiotomy were at the centre of an informal network that included Archbishop John Charles McQuaid and several were members of  Catholic action groups such as the Knights of Columbanus, the Guild of Saint Luke, the Society of Saints Cosmas and Damian, a medical association dedicated to put Catholic teaching into clinical practice.  The writings of leading symphysiotomy revivalists at NMH, such as Dr. Alex Spain and Dr. Arthur Barry, are indicative of moral not medical difficulties with caesareans.  While they accepted its safety, they saw it as morally hazardous.  In other words, birth control, which was against the teaching of the church, might be practised and the church would be left without the control it had taken to itself in people&rsquo;s very personal lives.</P>
        <P>I was terribly moved by the television broadcast two or three years ago.  The impact of this decision by men without consultation with the patients &mdash; this often happened without them knowing it was being done to them &mdash; meant they were left unable to walk properly, they were not given proper nursing attention afterwards and some of them were permanently incontinent, and all for what?  It was for the pursuit of the imposition of the narrow sectarian moral views of one group upon a group of victims &mdash; women who, in many cases, did not even know what had happened to them.</P>
        <P>I have a description of what it is like, which is worth putting on the record.</P>
        <P LI="1">Some symphysiotomies, particularly those performed in the aftermath of a Caesarean section, [They did both; these people were unbelievable] were more hideous than others.  Those carried out during late pregnancy were almost equally unprecedented.  However, even the more usual symphysiotomies, those done during labour, were cruel in the extreme.  Women found the experience utterly traumatising: after being left in labour for many hours, they were generally operated upon without warning, in the labour ward or in theatre, under local anaesthetic.  And after the surgery, there was still a baby to be born: they were still in labour. [Can we imagine this?] The pain of pushing a baby out with an unhinged pelvis was followed by the agony of walking on it.  Instead of immobilising the pelvis, hospital staff further destabilised it by requiring women to walk.  Discharged home with a broken pelvis, women were left to sink or swim, without medical advice or painkillers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the most shocking indictment.  It was not only the pelvises of those women that were unhinged, the doctors who practised it were unhinged.  What did they think they were about?  What is the medical profession for?  There is <i>primum non nocere</i>.  Yes, I dare to speak the classical tongues in search of ancient wisdom.  The first rule is, do as little harm as possible.  That was not followed.  That goes back as far as the Greeks.  People 2,000 years ago knew that was the first duty of a doctor.</P>
        <P>Forget producing reports, setting up these commissions and investigations and all the rest of the blather.  Give the women what they want which is the temporary lifting of the statute bar, as was said by I think Senator van Turnhout.  Why not do so?   Some of these women only learned 20 years or 30 years later what had been done to them when someone was able to explain their difficulties to them.  Let us try to do that.  We will support the Minister of State, who I believe would like to do that.  It is a limited number of people.</P>
        <P>I will suspend my judgment of the setting up of an independent commission of inquiry.  I understand there were some difficulties.  It is a year old.  It has been submitted but let us have it out as soon as possible in order that we can discuss it here.  I will not judge this person whoever it was, I do not know whether it was a man or a woman, but whatever academic did it experienced difficulties in getting statistics and so on over a period of a year.  Now it is with the Government.  Let us publish it and have it out.</P>

When a 16 year old boy in Holland who reported the fact that he was sexually abused to the police he was taken back to the Catholic institution where he was castrated.  An investigation was carried out in that home.  That boy would be the same age as me.  That is why I feel it so much.  It was the same thing, the imposition of a religious doctrine.  Eleven teenage boys were accused of having homosexual thoughts and they were castrated medically without the knowledge of their parents.  It was the same thing and it should be stamped out.</P>

	<P>I welcome all the survivors of symphysiotomy and those promoting their cause who are in the Visitors Gallery.  I welcome the Minister of State who is a regular visitor to the House.</P>
        <P>Symphysiotomy was advocated in 1597 and the first procedure on a human being took place in 1797.  Given that society was primitive at that stage, one would have thought that medical procedures used in those ancient days would have been left behind in the 20th century.  However, it is estimated that 1,500 Irish women, unknowingly and without consent, underwent symphysiotomies during childbirth between 1944 and 1992.  Survivors were left with severe lifelong after effects including extreme pain, impaired mobility, incontinence and depression.  I cannot understand how such a barbaric procedure was still being carried out up to as late as 1992.  Obviously some in the medical profession will say it was a medical necessity, others firmly believe it was a religious ethic.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry said he was not a medical authority, neither am I, but I am a mother.  I gave birth to my first child in 1981.  Unknowingly, I could have been one of the victims as I had a very difficult childbirth but, thankfully, I did not have to endure such a procedure.  With no disrespect to the men in the House, one must have given birth to understand how vulnerable one is during childbirth, especially with one&rsquo;s first child.  It may come as a surprise to some that women were treated by some gynaecologists as if they were imbeciles.  I distinctly remember sitting up in bed, the morning after giving birth, when the gynaecologist was doing his rounds with a nurse.  He asked the nurse beside me, &ldquo;How is this woman feeling today?&rdquo;  He simply could not address the question to me in the bed.  That was unbelievable.</P>
        <P>Having sat and listened to the harrowing and heartbreaking stories of the surviving victims, some of whom are sitting in the Visitors Gallery, it is my duty to make a plea on their behalf.  Many of these women, who at a young age believed the procedure they underwent was the norm, carried this secret for many years.  They were afraid to speak up and take on the system.  They had been dismissed by their general practitioners and told that the procedure was a medical requirement and had to be carried out.  We know this was not the case.  The consequences for victims who had no choice in the matter are devastating.  The women who were victims of this barbaric act have suffered physical pain and mental and social torment for many years.  Some have outlined in detail to us personal and intimate details of the consequences of living with the aftermath of symphysiotomy.  Some are afraid to go out in public due to incontinence, some have indicated that their sexual lives suffered and, as a consequence, marriages have broken up.  Some are experiencing such pelvic pain that, many years later, they are on morphine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the introduction of the obstetrics and gynaecological clinical programme, led by Professor Michael Turner, the aim of which is to improve health care choices for women.  While I acknowledge that the HSE has put in place facilities and support services to help the victims of symphysiotomy, they are still awaiting the long-promised Walsh report which was due to be published on 1 September 2011.  I am pleased to note the Minister of State said the report will be published before the end of the month.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State will be aware many women have only recently become aware of the fact that what happened to them was symphysiotomy.  Many are barred by the Statute of Limitations and the issue of delay.  As there are only about 200 surviving victims an amendment to the Statute of Limitations would surely be less expensive on the State than a redress board.  All victims of such a barbaric act, women who put their trust in their consultant, the doctor who delivered their babies, have a right to access to justice.  The Minister of State is one of the most caring I have met.  I say that with my hand on my heart.  That is evident every day in her work on mental illness.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Cabinet and make a case on behalf of victims and request the Minister for Health to consider amending the Statute of Limitations for at least a year.  These women must be given a right to natural justice.</P>
        <P>I commend the women who have spoken out and have highlighted the injustice.  In particular, I pay tribute to Olivia Kearney who was the first woman to pursue a case through the courts and to the groups who are promoting the cause of survivors of symphysiotomy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As other Members have done, I welcome all the survivors of what can only be described as a barbaric practice who are in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery.  It is as simple as that.  Many of my colleagues have expressed in graphic detail the nature of these actions and their effects on women.   I commend the Labour Party for using its Private Members&rsquo; time to bring the matter to the fore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is fair to say that successive Governments and Ministers, particularly since 2003, have kicked the issue to touch.  While we must look forward to what can be done in real terms, Senator Moloney hit the nail on the head.  As a man and a father I cannot fathom the practices carried out on many of the ladies in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery and others and some, to whom I have spoken, who live in my constituency in north County Dublin who would have had access to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  I certainly know what a joy it was to have a child on 11 September 2008 when my daughter was born and what that meant to my wife and our family.  That such a joyous occasion was destroyed in the main with the consequent pain that lives on, the knock on effect on women&rsquo;s lives, their husband&rsquo;s lives, and their children&rsquo;s lives, is an issue with which the State needs to grapple immediately.</P>
        <P>While I have immense regard for the Minister of State with whom we have discussed many issues, particularly mental health, I am somewhat disappointed, not with the Minister of State, that there is no timeline for the publication of a report.  I was elected to the other House in 2007 and met survivors of symphysiotomy in late 2008 and 2009 and would have lobbied previous Ministers for Health on the issue.  Nothing further has happened since.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to natural justice, one of the striking issues mentioned by Marie O&rsquo;Connor in her notes is that justice delayed is justice denied.  As Oireachtas Members representing the people and citizens of this country, including citizens who have been wronged, the first thing that must be done is the temporary lifting of the statute bar.  If the Government will not do it, a redress board must be established immediately.  We know about the delays with the report.  Last February, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, made some comments that I disagreed with completely because it was not standard practice and nor should it have been.  I know the Minister of State well enough to know that she will drive the matter.  She has the full support of my party, my spokesperson this evening, Senator Marc MacSharry, who spoke on it, and me as leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party group.  I know previous governments have failed these women.  They and their families have been failed and it falls to us to address it.  At the very least, we need a timeline for the report and a commitment from the Government that it is willing to temporarily lift the statute bar to allow the people affected to move on.   I was shocked by what Senator van Turnhout said about the experience of a lady just last week when she tried to avail of an X-ray.  We are not talking about thousands of women here.  Unfortunately, the other 1,300 women whom we reckon underwent the procedure have passed on and there are about 150 left.  We should not be talking about the issue in a year&rsquo;s time.  I do not want to debate the matter again in the Seanad Chamber, not to avoid giving a voice to everyone that is here but because I would rather the Government delivered the report, implemented its recommendations, lifted the statute bar and gave a commitment that it will ensure that the needs of the remaining survivors of symphysiotomy are looked after quickly and within a stated timeline.</P>
        <P>I have a difficulty with the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech today, although I recognise that she is under some constraints.  I am certain that if she was not she would be much more forthcoming.  At this stage we need action and not another report or debate.  As someone rightly said, it was only after the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report in 2010 that people realised the difficulties suffered by these women emanated from what should have been the joyous occasion of the births of their children.  It was ruined.  All of us are in agreement on this matter and I want the Minister of State to set a timeline.  When will a report reach Cabinet?  When will it make recommendations that will be implemented swiftly?  The Cabinet can deal with this matter quickly.  Successive Governments have made swift decisions on urgent matters for this country.  I repeat Marie O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s words that justice delayed is justice denied.  Let us set a very strict timeline here and make recommendations.  We can discuss them, but I want to know when action will be taken because these women and their families deserve some closure and assistance with this issue.</P>

        <P>Like some of my previous menfolk colleagues, I am not qualified to speak on this matter.   However, I acknowledge the pain and distress that has been caused and that it will continue to be a great source of continuous pain for the women who suffered this barbaric procedure, not so long ago in some instances.</P>
        <P>I welcome the news that the Walsh report will be available within weeks.  The Minister and the Minister of State are committed to addressing the issues that have arisen out of the legacy of the past practice of symphysiotomy and that they both hope to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion.  I hope they do so as quickly as possible.  I firmly believe that the women who suffered this barbaric procedure deserve nothing less, as the Minister of State stated earlier, and the sooner the better.  I note that 1,400 similar procedures were carried out on women spanning the years from 1944 to 1992.  I was born during that period but I cannot tell the Members the year.  Thankfully, my mother did not undergo the barbaric procedure.  I am happy to say that my three children, and more recently my three grandchildren, were born in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  My children were born in the late 1960s and early 1970s and I am pleased that the barbaric procedure of symphysiotomy was not performed on my good wife during the births.</P>
        <P>I, too, congratulate my Labour Party colleagues and my colleague from Dundalk, in particular, on tabling the motion.  I wish and hope that the report will be published and that we can look after the survivors.  Sadly, many of the women who suffered this barbaric procedure have gone to their eternal reward having suffered pain for many, many years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sad that we are again discussing an issue where the citizens of the State have been badly let down by institutions and the State itself.  We are here again discussing an issue where people are seeking truth and justice, but it is important for us to hold this debate.  I commend all of the Deputies in the Lower House who conducted a similar debate a number of weeks ago.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators quite rightly characterised this practice as barbaric.  When one considers the pain and suffering that was inflicted on women because of this practice, no other word can best describe it.  Many of the women were left disabled by it.  Some of them are in the Chamber today, but, sadly, some of the women affected have passed away.  Many of the victims will never have their stories told because they never knew that a symphysiotomy was carried out on them, yet they all struggled through life.  These people deserve the truth and justice.  I know of one case that was carried out in my city of Waterford at the Airmount Hospital, and I am sure many more such procedures were carried out in hospitals across the country.  Many of those victims, as we have rightly described them, have passed away and will never receive the justice they deserved.  Last night, I attended the briefing session on the subject in the AV room here, and I attended the previous one held before the D&aacute;il debate, where there were copious amounts of genuine and sincere expressions of sympathy, empathy and kind words.  The only way we can move beyond sympathy and get to the truth and secure justice for the victims is to have an open and transparent inquiry into the matter.  In any situation where a state fails its citizens, and in this case the State failed women, a responsibility is placed on legislators to ensure that the truth outs.  That must happen, and the only way it will happen is if there is an independent, open and transparent inquiry.  I know there is great cross-party support, from the Independents and everybody inside the House and the public outside, to work together to ensure redress and justice for the victims.  We do not need a report to deliver justice because it is in our gift, as politicians, to deliver it.</P>
        <P>A number of people referred to the Statute of Limitations.  I want to read briefly from the conclusion to the briefing document that was given to us yesterday:</P>
        <P LI="1">If the Statute of Limitations is not amended, there is a real danger that many of the victims will be denied access to justice.  Furthermore, the inevitable legal dogfight will lead to substantial delays for the survivors&rsquo; attempt to pursue their claim.  All the victims, many of whom are in their 70s and 80s, are getting older.  If there is delay, many will not live to see justice done.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I do not believe anybody in this House, through a lack of action, would wish to prevent victims from living to see justice done.  I am aware that people from all parties have been working with the SOS group for many years.  They have seen people pass away, unfortunately.  Those people have not seen justice done.  It is in our gift.</P>
        <P>I am asking the Minister of State and the Government to do three things.  First, it is important for a proper, open and transparent inquiry to be established to get to the truth.  Second, the Government should introduce legislation to suspend the Statute of Limitations for 12 months and thereby give people an opportunity to have the day in court that they deserve.  It is incumbent on legislators and politicians to ensure these people get the opportunity they need.  Third, we need to consider people other than the immediate victims of this barbaric act, who were mentioned by a number of speakers.  Yesterday and previously, we heard many accounts from women whose relationships broke up, or whose husbands or children had huge distress inflicted on them.  It was truly harrowing to hear about babies who died while this practice was being carried out.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the time has come to move beyond sympathy and kind words, genuine and sincere as they may be.  It is time for action.  The only way we can give justice to these women is to do the three things I have asked the Minister of State and the Government to do.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank Senators for agreeing to this debate at short notice.  I welcome the many survivors of symphysiotomy and their representatives who are in the Gallery.  I know that more of them are following our proceedings from an overflow room because they cannot be accommodated in the Gallery.  I thank the Captain of the House and the ushers for facilitating the visit of such a large group.  We are delighted they are here.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party Senators are pleased to have used our Private Members&rsquo; time to facilitate this debate.  We did so at the initiative of Senator Moran, who has been calling for this discussion for some time.  It is important that this debate, along with the debate in the D&aacute;il on 15 March last, marks an historic recognition by both Houses of the Oireachtas of the suffering of the survivors of symphysiotomy.  This grotesque and barbaric procedure has been likened to female genital mutilation.  There is no doubt that it is a form of abuse of women.  It is appalling that it was carried out in Irish hospitals into the 1990s.</P>
        <P>We have heard the harrowing stories of some of the many women on whom this procedure was performed.  I would like to pay tribute to those who came into this House last night and on other occasions to brief us on their real and human stories and on the appalling health consequences they have suffered as a result of a procedure that was performed on them in most cases without any knowledge and in all cases without consent.  As we know, it was far from being a standard medical procedure.  It was carried out for Catholic doctrinal reasons.  It was carried out in hospitals instead of caesareans, which should have been the standard procedure in these cases.</P>
        <P>When I researched this issue eight years ago, I wrote that this barbaric procedure was carried out to avoid repeat caesareans, which were viewed by some Catholic doctors as being unwelcome as they might induce women to resort to contraception or sterilisation, given that a woman can deliver a small number of children only by means of caesarean section.  Appalling and twisted as it may seem today, symphysiotomy was viewed as preferable in these circumstances.  All of us agree that there is a need for action.  This debate and the debate in the D&aacute;il two months ago have highlighted the appalling abuse suffered by women who were subjected to this procedure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to pay particular tribute to Marie O&rsquo;Connor, Olivia Kearney and the other women who have brought this issue to the fore.  All of us are agreed on the need for justice for the women who have suffered.  As Senator Cullinane said, there is a need for action.  Senator Colm Burke referred to some of the cases that have been taken.  We are all conscious that the Olivia Kearney case, which succeeded in the High Court in March, is being appealed to the Supreme Court by the defendants.  We know that proceedings have been commenced in a total of 141 cases.  There is a real fear that the Statute of Limitations will form a serious legal obstacle to a number of those cases, if not the majority of them.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the Walsh report must review the best way for the State to facilitate access to justice for the women who have suffered symphysiotomy.  Perhaps we can provide for some sort of temporary lifting of the Statute of Limitations, as was done for the victims of residential abuse.  That appears to be a possible and realistic option.  Alternatively, the establishment of some sort of redress scheme has also been sought or suggested.</P>
        <P>All of us welcome the critical health supports that have been put in place.  More needs to be done in terms of a response on the justice side, in recognition and acknowledgement of the abuse and injustice that was done to these women.  We know that records were disappeared and have been hard to obtain.  That has been one of the reasons for the delay in the publication of the Walsh report.  We were all delighted to hear the Minister of State say it will be made available to the stakeholders within the next two weeks.  We all want to see a clear timeframe thereafter for the consultation process and the publication of the report.  We look forward to action being taken immediately thereafter.  I know the Minister of State is committed to that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator Moran, on organising this debate.  As someone who practised as a solicitor in Drogheda and Dundalk for a number of years, I am personally aware of a number of cases that arose from activities at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  I refer to this matter and to a number of other matters.  It is ironic that we are celebrating and commemorating the 1916 Rising in Arbour Hill today.  The culture of silence that existed in this country for many years allowed this practice and a number of other problems to develop.  I refer to the laundries, forced adoptions and sexual abuse, etc.  This is a particularly sad issue because every woman who has ever had a child knows the fear one experiences in advance of one&rsquo;s first childbirth.  It is particularly abhorrent to every woman in this country that medical professionals unilaterally ignored their patients in this way, preferring instead to impose their own views on sexuality and contraception on them.</P>
        <P>I would like to make a brief suggestion before I conclude.  We are all aware that records have disappeared.  Certain medical professionals &mdash; they know who they are &mdash; should be asked to come forward.  Perhaps they could be given some level of immunity that would encourage them to step up to the plate by making the evidence they have available.</P>

More than anything else, the contributions we have heard show that we are all of one voice on this issue.  We want to ensure that the women who had this horrendous procedure imposed on them get justice.  The procedure was not requested.  Who would request it?  It must be about justice.  A great deal of suffering has been endured over the years by those who were subjected to this procedure.  In many cases, it has detracted from their enjoyment of their families, which is something we all expect to have.  We need to acknowledge the great hurt and damage that was inflicted on them.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane has called for a sworn public inquiry to be established.  I remind him that this country has not had great experience with such inquiries.  Given that speed is of the essence, that is not the way we should go.  During the 12 months since this Government came to office, we have had to deal with many legacy issues.  This is one of the most horrendous issues we have come across.  We are desperately trying to grapple and come to terms with other issues like the Magdalene laundries and the Bethany Home.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Walsh report will be with stakeholders, the most significant of whom are the women involved, by the end of the month.  We must then have a two-month period in which submissions or reaction to that report come back to us, which is right as issues may arise with which those involved will not agree and which we will have to tweak or reconsider.  When it comes back to us, we will need to take another look at it but there will be no delay from our side &mdash; the women have received that assurance not just from me but from the Minister.  While they have rightly pointed to the delay that occurred, that was in regard to gathering the information.</P>
        <P>If there are people out there who have files, they should please submit them.  It has been too long and too tough a road for these people to have further delays now.  Was it Joyce who said that too long a suffering makes a stone of the heart?  It does.  This has gone on for too long.  We need to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion in regard not just to the women but to everyone else involved.  If there are people out there who have information, my message is &ldquo;Do not let this die with you, please come forward.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Senators who brought forward the motion so we can debate the issue and I pay tribute to the courage of the women involved.  Having spoken to most of those women, I know it was difficult at that time to go home and talk about the details of what happened in childbirth or other private, intimate details.  To be able to speak about it openly and honestly takes a great deal of courage &mdash; I know that.  The fact we are all here today is some sort of reward and recognition but we need to bring this to finality and, hopefully, have a conclusion that will be of benefit to everyone.</P>
        <P>The House has my assurance that the Walsh report will not be delayed.  The input of the women involved will form part of the recommendations that will come from the report and, for our part, there will be no delay.  I hope we can all reach a satisfactory conclusion because the women deserve no less.  I do not go to all of the briefings because I have already heard the stories, which I find quite harrowing.  I can only imagine what it must be like to have to live with this.  Even in my imaginings, however, I do not think I would come anywhere close to it.  I assure the women involved that we will bring this to finality as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to the House.  He has informed me he wishes to make a statement to the House.  For the information of the House, Article 28.8 of the Constitution provides that every member of the Government shall have the right to attend and be heard in each House of the Oireachtas.  Before I call the Minister, I want to make it clear that I will not allow any debate on the matter.  Once the Minister has made his contribution, the matter is closed.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me this opportunity.  The defamation action to which Senator Leyden referred in this House yesterday was, I understand, settled by RTE on confidential terms but without any admission of liability.  While I was not party to that case, I had agreed to appear as a witness.  I was not even aware of this case until a matter of weeks before it was listed for hearing and I had no hand in determining the manner in which it was defended or settled.  I understand, however, that the settlement details as reported are inaccurate.</P>
        <P>The case relates to remarks I made in 2006 about the circumstances in which a constituent, Dean Lyons, confessed to garda&iacute; to a savage double murder at Grangegorman that he did not commit.  I pursued this potential miscarriage of justice over many months in the other House and called for an inquiry into how this could have happened.</P>
        <P>Mr. Lyons&rsquo;s confession set out details of the crime, some of which could only have been known to the murderer or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He was 24 years old, a heroin addict and, at the time of his arrest, was sleeping rough and in hostels in the north inner city.  He was also borderline intellectually handicapped.</P>
        <P>Mr. George Birmingham, SC, subsequently Mr. Justice Birmingham, when the inquiry was eventually conceded, found in the report on his statutory investigation that: Dean Lyons acquired the detailed information in regard to these crimes from the garda&iacute; who were interviewing him; the written record maintained of the non-video-recorded interviews was not comprehensive and matters were excluded that would have assisted in the assessment of the reliability of Dean Lyons; and the procedure for the taking of statements as set out in the judges&rsquo; rules was not followed.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress, and I accept, that the report also found that Dean Lyons was not abused or ill-treated during the detention.  However, and I quote: &ldquo;Dean Lyons was able to provide accurate details of murders it is now accepted that he did not commit, due to the manner in which he was interviewed by Garda&iacute;&rdquo;.  It is also important to stress that the Birmingham report found that some members of the investigation team had misgivings about the degree to which reliance could be placed on what was said by Dean Lyons.  One garda referred to him as a &ldquo;Walter Mitty&rdquo;.  Indeed, I fully accept that the incident room manager, Detective Garda Alan Bailey, who was the plaintiff in the action against RTE, not only experienced reservations but expressed them at the time.</P>
        <P>I called repeatedly for an inquiry into the Dean Lyons affair and, I believe, I did so with justification.  It was and remains a troubling case.  The Grangegorman murders were savage and brutal, and Dean Lyons was wrongfully charged with them.  It was only because, during the course of a second and unrelated awful case, another man confessed to these crimes, that Mr Lyons was released after eight months in custody.  The Garda Commissioner, after what he called a &ldquo;comprehensive probative inquiry&rdquo;, declared he was satisfied that Mr. Lyons had no part in those murders.  He published a notice in the newspapers apologising for any embarrassment caused.  The apology was, of course, to the Lyons family, who are constituents of mine, since Dean Lyons had died in Manchester.</P>
        <P>To date, no-one has been brought to trial in respect of these brutal murders.  This is a heavy burden for the families and friends of the deceased to bear.  I believe all the circumstances of the affair more than justify my involvement in ensuring that as much as possible of the details should be brought to public attention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 118, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of these amendments to them.  The Minister will deal with the subject matter of the amendments in the group.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping to Members.  A Senator may contribute once on the grouping.  I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>During the passage of the Education (Amendment) Bill 2012 through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a number of amendments, five in all, were made to the Bill.  These were made both on Committee Stage, which was taken on 29 March, and on Report Stage, which was taken on 2 May.  Three of the five amendments were introduced following advice received from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 1, the first of these, was introduced on Committee Stage.  It provides additional guidance for the Minister of the day when making procedures and determining matters under the Education Act.  This amendment will require the Minister, in carrying out his functions, to have regard to the following: best practice in teaching methods; value for money; and quality outcomes for students.  This puts in place more restrictions on how the Minister of the day carries out his or her functions, by ensuring that the principles and policies to which he or she must have regard are spelled out in primary legislation.  This stipulation will be in addition to the requirement to consult with stakeholders in education, where this is provided for under the Act.  The Office of the Attorney General advised that this amendment was necessary in order to ensure that the discretion of the Minister is limited by specifying the considerations to which he must have regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 are drafting amendments.  These amendments were highlighted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in the course of the legislative process.  Amendment No. 2 was a Committee Stage amendment introduced to improve the readability of the new section 23(1)(c) of the Education Act.  It removes a comma from after the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; in the third line and replaces it after the word &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; in the first line.  This is a straightforward drafting amendment and there is no substantive change to the provision.  The requirement in section 30 to be registered applies to people employed as teachers in recognised schools rather than in any other education or training settings.  In this context, there are references throughout the Bill to a &ldquo;registered teacher&rdquo; in a &ldquo;registered school&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 4, introduced on Report Stage, simply includes identical wording to ensure consistency through the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.</P>

	<P>We will move on to group three amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 must involve an ongoing dialogue between the Teaching Council, my Department and the VECs.  Amendment No. 3 is a technical amendment introduced on Report Stage.  It is designed to ensure that in providing a transfer of information both teachers who are currently registered, as well as those who were registered in the past, may be identified in order to reduce the risk of error.  This is necessary, as information is to be shared between the Teaching Council register on the one hand and the payroll records of the Department and the VECs on the other, in order to give effect to section 30.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 5, concerns were raised by Deputy Brendan Smith in the D&aacute;il as well as by the INTO about the wording of the new section, 24(10)(<i>b</i>).  This provision referred to a limit on the length of time for which a non-registered person could be employed in a teaching position.  The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to provide clarity and consistency within the regulations to be drafted under this legislation.  It changed the wording so that the Bill would not refer to an unregistered person being employed &ldquo;in a teaching position&rdquo;, but rather that his or her employment would be &ldquo;in place of a registered teacher&rdquo;.  This follows a similar approach taken in other provisions of the Bill.</P>

	<P>Last December, when the Minister for Education and Skills announced details of the education infrastructure plan for 2012, St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Virginia was omitted from his list.  In April the Minister published the five year infrastructure plan, which outlines when the major projects needed to cater for demographic growth will be completed.  Some 77 schools were given the green light to replace rented prefabs with permanent classrooms but, again, St. Mary&rsquo;s was omitted from the list.  The Department&rsquo;s press release on the plan states: &ldquo;alongside the 77 schools who have been approved, the Department of Education and Skills is considering a further 110 schools in this scheme to replace prefabs.&rdquo;  Is St. Mary&rsquo;s being considered for the replacement of prefabs or the extension it has been waiting on for the last eight years?</P>
        <P>The major growth experienced in Virginia and surrounding areas has resulted in an influx of families and increased demand for school accommodation.  The most recent census figures indicate that the population of Virginia changed by 31.6% between 2006 and 2011, in large part due to its location along the commuter belt and its close proximity of Dublin.  In March the school enrolled its 80th student since September and its total enrolment now stands at 380 students.  These statistics do not appear to be reflected in the schools building programme for 2012.</P>
        <P>What is the current status of St. Mary&rsquo;s, what is required for it to move to the next stage and when does the Minister envisage that the extension will be approved?  The school is not even mentioned in the six tables on the Department&rsquo;s website which set out details of the building programme for 2012.  When I sought further information from the website on the current stage of the plans for the extension I came across two documents.  The first, which was dated 5 April 2007, set out the schools which were starting architectural planning for building and modernisation works and the second, dated 10 June 2011, listed major projects at architectural planning stage.  Despite a gap of four years between these documents there has been no update or movement on the project since the most recent was published last year.</P>
        <P>Understandably, parents, staff and even students are frustrated about this delay.  I urge the Minister to expedite the project.  The school is using 11 portakabins to accommodate its students at a cost of &euro;80,000 per year.  If it is not included in the current five year infrastructure plan, it will be 2017 before it is on the next list and construction will not be completed until 2020.  Where is the economic efficiency in renting 11 prefabs until such time as we can build badly needed classrooms?  The school community is being kept in limbo even though eight years have passed since the project was commenced.  It suggests negligence on the part of the Department that nothing has been done on the issue.  Why has the project been shelved and when will the Department dust it off and construct the new extension to the school?</P>

	<P>I am taking this adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  I thank Senator Reilly for raising the question of St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Virginia, County Cavan, and welcome the opportunity it provides to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in major primary and post-primary education projects over the coming years and to clarify the current position on the building project for St Mary&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>I wish to begin by setting out the context in which decisions on meeting the accommodation needs of schools over the coming years must be considered.  Total enrolment is expected to grow by approximately 70,000 students between now and 2018.  This will involve an increase of over 45,000 pupils at primary level and 25,000 students at post-primary level.  On 12 March the Minister announced details of 219 major school building projects which will commence construction over the next five years as part of a &euro;2 billion capital investment programme.  These are in addition to the 56 major school building projects already announced for 2012.  The projects will account for most of the capital funding available from now until 2016.  To meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools, particularly in those areas where it has been identified that most demographic growth will be concentrated.</P>
        <P>There are five primary schools in the Virginia feeder area.  The enrolment at primary level show an increase over the past decade.  However, based on an analysis of child benefit data for the area, the Department has projected that future enrolments will remain relatively stable up to 2018.  The current enrolment at St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Virginia, is 380 pupils, up from 350 in 2007.  While enrolment levels have been growing at the school, they have increased by less than 10% in the past five years.</P>
        <P>The building project for St. Mary&rsquo;s is currently at an early stage of architectural planning.  The brief for the project is to construct an extension to the existing school of approximately 1,250 sq. m, some refurbishment of the existing accommodation and the replacement of a number of temporary classrooms.  This will result in the provision of a 16 classroom school.  The current teacher allocation stands at 14 mainstream teachers.</P>
        <P>The design team was appointed in June of last year.  Stage 1 of architectural planning was approved in February this year and the design team is currently working on the Stage 2(a) submission.  The next stage is the completion of the detailed design, planning permission and other necessary statutory approvals and the preparation of tender documents.  To ensure every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools over the coming years.</P>
        <P>All other school building projects, including the project for St. Mary&rsquo;s, will continue to be advanced over time within the context of the funding available.  However, in light of competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible at this time to progress the project for St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Virginia, to tender and construction stage.  I thank the Senator for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber to take this issue, which deals with his area.  Half an hour ago, I received a text message that the Minister was coming to the House to make an important statement.  I wondered if it was possible that I had struck gold and that there were might be an announcement with which I could run to Radio Kerry.</P>
        <P>The LNG project in Ballylongford is critical to the State because it will ensure energy security, critical for my region of North Kerry Limerick West because it will provide 500 jobs during the construction stage and secure jobs in the future in an area crying out for work.  The Minister is aware of this because he updated me during recent debates.  There is new concern in the constituency because of the announcement by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, about Shannon Airport.  We welcome the announcement because Shannon Airport is very important for the mid-west but the downside is the lack of clarity on the apportioning of functions between State agencies such as Shannon Development, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  The people of north Kerry have had a very bad experience with the IDA.  The Minister&rsquo;s Cabinet colleague, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, described the performance of the IDA as disgraceful.  The project will now move into the hands of the IDA.  The Minister cannot be answerable for this but it is a new worry.</P>
        <P>The project has full support across the spectrum of politics across the county.  The Minister&rsquo;s party colleague, Deputy Spring, Deputy Ferris and I are working as a team and this.  Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us further.  There was an issue with the interconnector and perhaps the Minister can tell us if it has been resolved.  He should be on top of this and remain proactive because this project is great for the country.  However, many of us feel it could be in danger of slipping away because of the lack of progress.  It was initiated in the year I was mayor of Kerry, 2004, and has gone on in fits and starts since.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The promoters of the project, Shannon LNG, are a subsidiary of an American multinational corporation called Hess and it has expended millions of euro to date on planning and other issues.  It has the total support of the community apart from a small group.  The business community, the villages and the development associations are in favour of this.  The way is clear and I hope the Minister can bring us news and show us the way forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan for raising the matter.  It is important for his part of the kingdom but also for the country as a whole.  I have consistently welcomed the proposal from the Shannon LNG to construct an LNG terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry.  Such a facility, together with the bringing onshore of Corrib gas, would provide important security of gas supply for Ireland.  I met the promoters of the project soon after taking office last year and my Department and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, are in regular contact with Shannon LNG.  Last December, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, Deputy Spring and I met Shannon LNG.  The meeting provided the opportunity to review the state of play on the project and to underline the Government&rsquo;s positive interest in the potential investment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The meeting also discussed the central concern of Shannon LNG, which is to obtain regulatory certainty at the earliest opportunity on future pricing and treatment of Ireland&rsquo;s two gas interconnectors.  Together with all players and potential players in Ireland&rsquo;s gas market, Shannon LNG has a key commercial interest in the outcome of the regulator&rsquo;s ultimate decision on this complex regulatory question.  Given the complexities, there are many differing perspectives on the decision.  At that meeting, the Taoiseach asked the company to withdraw the complaint lodged in Brussels in order to facilitate the regulator getting on with his decision.  I understood that the company assented to that request but I am certain it did not dissent.</P>
        <P>The decision on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors is statutorily a matter for CER under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no function in the matter.  As the independent energy regulator, CER has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness.  It also has a duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of months CER has been engaged in an extensive consultation process on the matter and has had considerable interaction with Shannon LNG and all key stakeholders.  The CER had originally signalled that it would come to a decision last autumn.  The process has been delayed, regrettably, by Shannon LNG&rsquo;s decision to lodge a number of complaints with the European Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This further delay in the process was discussed with Shannon LNG at the meeting on 21 December, as was Shannon LNG&rsquo;s perspective on the regulatory issues for decision by CER.  At the meeting, the request was made for Shannon LNG to suspend the legal complaint to Directorate General for Competition.  It emerged that the complaint has not been suspended and, to my surprise, a further submission has recently been made by Shannon LNG to the Directorate General for Competition outlining the company&rsquo;s serious concerns about the CER&rsquo;s recent proposed decision in terms of compliance with state aid.  This further submission, which I became aware of today, will require my Department and CER to once again devote scarce resources to addressing issues in the further submission that are likely to cause further delays to the process.</P>
        <P>Following the publication by the CER on 17 February of a proposed decision paper for consultation and a public forum on 1 March, all stakeholders including Shannon LNG, were provided with an opportunity to present their views on the CER&rsquo;s proposed decision paper.  The consultation period closed on 16 March.  The regulator is currently examining all submissions and comments received in response to the consultation. I understand that the regulator has met several individual stakeholders &mdash; including Shannon LNG &mdash; since then.</P>
        <P>I understand that the regulator had expected a final decision to be available by the end of May although as I have already outlined, the letter now received by my Department from DG Competition, is likely to result in further delays in the regulator&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>Prior to this latest action by the company, we could have hoped that a decision would bring the regulatory certainty which Shannon LNG has repeatedly sought.  Now the company&rsquo;s own persistence in this action &mdash; which it is perfectly entitled to do &mdash; will at a minimum cause further delays.  Like Senator Ned O&rsquo; Sullivan, I regret this because it would be the Government&rsquo;s wish that we could get on with this project which is so important for adding another dimension of energy security in this country and apart entirely from this, it would also result in some very badly needed jobs in north Kerry.</P>

I have noted there has been a significant increase in the number of these drug farms in a number of Border counties.  These farms are producing drugs for sale or supply and cannabis is the most common drug being produced.  The current legislation has a loophole which allows individuals to purchase equipment and the seeds for the manufacture of these drugs.  It is not a crime to purchase or to sell the equipment or the seeds.  It only becomes a crime after the seeds have been planted. There may well be a loophole in the law which should be addressed but this is a separate issue.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley shares my concerns on this issue.  It has been brought to my attention that the drugs problem is escalating in County Donegal and it may be the same in other counties.  This has put more pressure on the Garda resources to deal with the problem.  It seems the main reason for this problem in Donegal is that 97% of our land border is with the North of Ireland and there is also the challenge of policing the coastline because drugs are brought ashore.</P>
        <P>The drugs unit in County Donegal has been working very effectively up until recent years.  However, it is now under so much pressure that it is increasingly difficult to deal with the demands of the work.  The drugs unit in Letterkenny in the centre of County Donegal has had a reduction in staff numbers from ten to three.  There are two other drugs units in the county.  The unit in Buncrana is staffed by three members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the unit in Donegal town is staffed by three members.  There are only nine staff members to cover the whole county.</P>
        <P>There is a need for additional staff.  I appreciate this is a challenging time for the provision of resources.  I am reliably informed that a major benefit to the drugs units in the county would be the provision of a sniffer dog to assist the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Very often when drugs are suspected of being in a location or being transported in a vehicle, it takes a long time to complete inspections because of the lack of a sniffer dog.  I ask that a dedicated sniffer dog unit be made available to assist the drugs unit in County Donegal and that additional staff be appointed to the three units.  The use and abuse of drugs will cause an additional burden on the health services and this will cost the country more money.  Drugs need to be apprehended at the earliest available opportunity and the only way is to have resources such as a sniffer dog unit at the first point of contact.  I know the Minister of State will agree with me in this matter.  I suggest the dog unit could be established on a pilot basis, given the unique geographical position of County Donegal, in order to combat some of those challenges faced by both the garda&iacute; and the general public.  Young people are vulnerable and drugs are being pushed on them.  Criminal individuals and gangs are setting up drugs operations and are pushing drugs in order to make a living for themselves.  This is not proper and those people must be apprehended and the garda&iacute; need to be provided with the resources to do so.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as an gceist t&aacute;bhachtach seo, a bhaineann le mo dh&aacute;ilcheantar f&eacute;in agus le mo chontae f&eacute;in, a ard&uacute; agus deis a thabhairt dom freagra a thabhairt thar ceann an Aire Dl&iacute; agus Cirt agus Comhionannais os rud &eacute; nach f&eacute;idir leis bheith anseo.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that the Commissioner and his senior management team are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the country.  This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a district, divisional and regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>The personnel strength of Donegal Garda division on 31 March 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 435.  On the same date there was a total of 13 members attached to the Donegal divisional drugs unit.  There were also 25 Garda reserve members and 29 civilians attached to the Donegal Garda division.    All divisional resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units, such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and other specialised units.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the problem of drug misuse is through a co-ordinated and integrated approach under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-16, which is co-ordinated under the remit of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government affirms the Government&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to tackling the problem of drug misuse through this pillar as outlined in the strategy and in partnership with all relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing plan for this year also sets out key actions for tackling organised crime, including drug trafficking.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains fully committed to continuing to vigorously tackle the illegal supply of drugs at all levels.</P>
        <P>A key feature of this work is the ongoing close co-operation between the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Garda drugs units to ensure that a co-ordinated and effective approach to drug law enforcement is in place.  Both these units are supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s strategies in tackling drug trafficking are continuing to result in significant drug seizures.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seized drugs with an estimated value of &euro;65.5 million in 2011 and an estimated value of &euro;11.5 million to March this year.  The reduction in drug crime, as reflected in the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s recorded crime statistics for 2011, shows that there were 17,709 recorded controlled drug offences last year &mdash; a decrease of 11.5% on the equivalent figure for 2010.  This is a trend that is very welcome and reflects the excellent work of garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>It is apparent from the crime statistics that the Garda authorities are making good and effective use of their resources.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to maintain a robust response to the evil activities of those who peddle drugs and bring so much misery to our communities.  Equally, the Government is determined to do everything it can to support garda&iacute; in their efforts.  In this regard, the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that he is open to considering any changes in the law which garda&iacute; believe would be helpful in tackling the activities of organised criminals.</P>
        <P>Garda management will continue to monitor closely the allocation of resources, taking account of transfers and retirements, crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a district, divisional and regional level.  The Donegal division will be subject to this same level of monitoring to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The Garda Commissioner has reiterated the commitment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to providing a professional and effective service to the community and he will have the Minister&rsquo;s full support in this regard.</P>

      <sTitle>Payment of Awards</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I apologise for keeping him in the House for so long this evening.  My Adjournment matter concerns the issuance of lump sum awards and the payment of awards by instalment.  This matter arises in relation to the Quirke report which arose from an expert group that was set up in 2010 to give advice on this matter.  This question arose recently in the High Court when an award of &euro;11 million was made and the judge asked whether the payment of awards by instalment would be more appropriate.  However, there is no such procedure in place at this stage.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State knows, the way awards are made out is based on: pain and suffering to date &mdash; that is, from the date of the accident to the trial date; pain and suffering into the future; loss of earnings to date, namely, to the date of the trial; and loss of earnings into the future.</P>
        <P>The big issues concerning loss of earnings into the future, especially in a severe case, is that it is not always possible to determine what period of time will be involved.  The Quirke report stated that the present method of awarding damages for future pecuniary loss &mdash; in this jurisdiction, the single lump sum award &mdash; is inadequate and inappropriate in cases where a plaintiff has sustained major injuries, and there are major, long-term consequences that will require ongoing care.  The report said the expert group believed that a seriously injured plaintiff should not be deprived of a right to claim within the courts that damages which are intended to pay for the cost of his or her future care and future treatment, and medical and assistive aids and appliances, should be paid periodically and not by way of a single lump sum.</P>
        <P>The group also believes that defendants facing such substantial claims should be entitled to claim within the courts that damages which are intended to pay for the cost of future care, treatment and medical equipment, should in the interests of justice be paid periodically at the appropriate time when the care, treatment and equipment are required.  The reason this is raised in relation to defendants as well, concerns the payment from a lump sum.  If the recipient dies within a short period, the lump sum passes to the next of kin.  In that context there is an advantage, for both a plaintiff and a defendant, to have periodic payments as opposed to one lump sum.  Given the report&rsquo;s advice, is it proposed to bring forward the necessary legislation and, if so, what is the timescale involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am standing in for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, who unfortunately cannot attend the House.  On behalf of the Minister, I would like to thank Senator Colm Burke for raising this important matter.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, the programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce legislation to facilitate the courts in making provision for structured settlements in circumstances where, currently, large sums are awarded as a consequence of individuals suffering catastrophic injury because of the negligence of another.</P>
        <P>The High Court working group on medical negligence and periodic payments, to which the Senator has referred, was established by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, in February 2010.</P>
        <P>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference included considering and reporting on whether certain categories of damages for catastrophic personal injuries can or should be awarded by way of periodic payments orders, as opposed to once-off, lump-sum orders, and to make recommendations and provide draft legislation, regulations and rules as may be necessary.</P>
        <P>In the course of its deliberations the working group extended its examination to all personal injuries not just medical injuries.  The working group was chaired by a High Court judge, Mr. Justice Quirke, and membership included High Court judges, practising solicitors and barristers, officials from the State Claims Agency, the Courts Service, the HSE, the Department of Justice and Equality, and representatives from the insurance industry and Patient Focus, a patient advocacy group.</P>
        <P>In the report of its first module completed in October 2010, the working group recommended that legislation be enacted to empower the courts to make periodic payment orders as an alternative to lump sum awards to compensate injured persons in cases of catastrophic injury where long-term permanent care will be required.  The working group also recommended that periodic payment orders should only be made where the court is satisfied that continuity of payment under the periodic payments order is reasonably secure.</P>
        <P>As the law stands damages awarded to compensate for personal injuries are intended to put injured parties in the same position as they would have been if they had not sustained the wrong for which they are getting compensation.</P>
        <P>The application of this principle can present practical difficulties.  Damages are assessed at a certain point in time and a lump sum is awarded, which is intended to compensate for all past and future losses, including the cost of care, medication, medical and assistive aids, and treatment.  The lump sum is intended to represent the capital value of future loss.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There has been much debate in recent years as to the appropriateness and adequacy of the lump sum system in cases where the plaintiff has been catastrophically incapacitated in the long term or permanently incapacitated.  The effectiveness of the current method of assessing damages for future loss can be seriously undermined by uncertainties affecting assumptions made as to the plaintiff&rsquo;s future personal circumstances, future investment returns and inflation rates.  The system encourages a conflict of evidence with both parties seeking the best possible outcome.  The court is required to determine the level of future damages by seeking to resolve conflicting expert medical and other evidence.  This presents the court with the difficult task of providing fair and just compensation where life expectancy is uncertain or disputed.</P>
        <P>The lump sum approach results in there being no recourse for a plaintiff who may exhaust his or her fund by exceeding his or her projected life expectancy perhaps owing to advances in medical science.  Lump sum awards can also create a risk for the Exchequer because if the return on investment is insufficient to meet the needs of the plaintiff, the State may be required to fund provision for those needs.</P>
        <P>There are, however, a number of advantages to the lump sum system such as finality and certainty for the parties in the resolution of the claim.  Lump sums enable the insurer to close the book on a claim and facilitate the operation of standard reinsurance arrangements. They also give autonomy to the plaintiff, allowing him or her to decide how to manage the award.  However, in catastrophic injury cases these arguments in favour of lump sums do not hold so strong, hence the calls for providing the courts with the power to make periodic payments orders.</P>
        <P>The successful operation of any new statutory scheme for periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure.  In this regard, the working group recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate. Alternatively, it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed.  The security of payment is key to any legislative changes that may be required and, based on the experience for example in the UK, it would appear that a good deal of financial infrastructure will be necessary to make the legislation workable.</P>
        <P>With respect to security of payment, the NTMA is conducting an actuarial review to examine the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of periodic payment orders as an alternative to lump sum payments or other options.  The review will examine in particular the feasibility of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security of payments principle.  The outcome of the review will inform the development of proposals under way in the Department of Justice and Equality to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitment to legislate in this area.  The review is expected to be completed in June 2012.</P>
        <P>The working group, now chaired by Ms Justice Mary Irvine of the High Court, has recently completed its report on its second module concerning the introduction on pre-action protocols in clinical negligence cases.  In view of the particular difficulties and challenges presented by the conduct of clinical negligence litigation, the Minister looks forward to examining any recommendations made in the second report once it has been published.  The group is now engaged on the third and final module relating to the potential of case management to expedite and minimise the costs of clinical negligence.  On behalf of the Minister, I would like to thank the working group for its invaluable work in this area.</P>
