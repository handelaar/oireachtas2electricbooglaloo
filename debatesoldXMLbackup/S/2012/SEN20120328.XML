      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s announcement yesterday of 31 May as the date for the referendum on the fiscal compact.  We had a good debate in this House on the issue, which should be followed through with another discussion once the referendum legislation is published.  We might be somewhat constrained in terms of the time available.  I understand the legislation will come before the D&aacute;il in the next week or so and will have to come to us promptly thereafter.  I assure the Leader of my party&rsquo;s support in facilitating the scheduling of that legislation, but I ask that sufficient time be given for debate once the legislation is published.  We have no difficulty with sitting on a Monday or Friday if that is required.  We will play a positive role in the campaign to secure a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for the good of our citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the debate on the Finance Bill last week I took the opportunity to ask both the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, about the mortgage arrears implementation strategy but received no answer.  This issue, which I have raised week after week in the House, is getting worse by the day.  It amounts to a crisis and is the single most important problem to be tackled in this country.  I ask the Leader for a commitment that on Members&rsquo; return after the short Easter break, he will schedule a debate with the Minister specifically on mortgage arrears, as Members must ascertain what is happening in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is D-day minus three in respect of payment of the household charge.  Anyone who considers the handling of this charge with a cold eye will state it has been nothing short of a disaster.  I was less than assured when listening to the comments made in a radio broadcast this morning by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  I found it quite amusing when he informed the public that 29 black sacks had arrived yesterday at the household charge office.  Does the Minister intend to open these black sacks and are their contents known?  Is the number of applications contained therein known?  I ask once again for a formal extension of the deadline for the payment of this charge.  Fianna F&aacute;il has published a Bill that would allow for the extension of this date to September and would allow instalment payments.  Most reasonable people will agree that the inability of citizens to enter one of the 1,100 post offices located nationwide to simply pay for the charge over the counter is an absolute nonsense.  I believe the real reason for this is the Government will not pay An Post the handling fee for so doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 5%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>To me, 5% seems minimal for processing of this charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Charging a fiver is a complete joke.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Conway should calm down for a second.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that far fewer than 30% of citizens have paid and by the end of this week, the Government will be lucky to break 50% or 60%.  The Minister was able to row back substantially on the septic tank charge registration while under pressure.  He has proved that he can look outside Leinster House and then decide to row back on decisions he has made.   This is totally unfair.  The majority of households have not even received any information on this charge.  As for the Minister to state repeatedly in radio broadcasts that one can pay online, tens of thousands of people do not have Internet access or are not versed in paying bills over the web.  What will be the position?</P>
        <P>I will conclude by noting a most serious development of which I learned this morning.  The Garda has warned people in County Laois about bogus operators calling into estates to seek the &euro;100 charge.  This is because the Minister himself stated that if people do not pay, council staff will call around to households to look for the &euro;100 charge and scam artists have already jumped on the back of that threat.  Incidentally, the Minister announced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Probably from the neighbouring counties and not decent Laois people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have asked repeatedly for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come into this House to update Members truthfully and factually on the position in respect of this household charge.  It is causing grave concern and I warn the Government that unless it is dealt with in a reasonable fashion, the scenario of which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, warned will come to pass.  It will have a referendum on the European Union that is not about the European Union.  It will be about the mismanagement of this Minister in particular and the Government in general.  Consequently, I once again propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, come into this House and tell Members directly the reason he will not extend this deadline and the reason he will not allow ease of payment through the extensive post office network.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In common with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, I also welcome the setting of 31 May as the date for the referendum on the fiscal treaty.  It is important to have set a date towards which everyone can work.  I am also glad to hear that Fianna F&aacute;il will campaign actively for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, as will the Labour Party, which is gearing up for it already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what they did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, whichever side of the debate Members are on, it is important that they contribute, as public representatives, to making it an informed debate.  It has been useful to have already had a debate in this House on foot of a briefing by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which has contributed greatly to everyone&rsquo;s understanding of the referendum and of the treaty.  I hope it will feed into a wider public debate and all Members have a duty to ensure this is done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also call for a debate on human rights and on the death penalty in particular.  I am conscious of a report published recently by Amnesty International on different levels of executions in different countries around the world and of serious concern being expressed about some countries in which it was impossible to verify the numbers of those to whom the death penalty was applied.  Amnesty International noted a particular increase took place in Middle Eastern countries.  At least 360 people were executed last year in Iran, 82 in Saudi Arabia and an unverifiable number in China, which was well in excess of the numbers there.  While all Members welcome the reports of substantial Chinese investment in Ireland and while it is welcome to see the Taoiseach on a trade mission to China, one must ensure that human rights are also on the agenda there.  I acknowledge the Taoiseach has stated the issue is and will be on the agenda whenever he meets Chinese leaders.  However, a debate on the death penalty would be worthwhile in the context of the Amnesty International report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On human rights, where is the concern about the 16-year old boy who was castrated in Holland?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Bacik to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator Norris, I very much share his concern about the appalling report of what happened in the Netherlands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad it is on the record at last.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Senator for raising it in this House as it is important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank all those who attended a seminar last night on the future of the Seanad organised by the classics department in Trinity College.  It was a worthwhile event chaired by a former Leader of the Seanad, Maurice Manning, and was part of a process that Members must help to initiate in the Seanad.  Members must ensure that whenever the referendum on the future of the Seanad takes place, like that on the fiscal compact treaty, it will be preceded by an informed debate.  Last night&rsquo;s seminar, at which attendees heard various contributions about the history and context of the idea of an upper house, should feed into any debate on this issue.  I again thank the many colleagues who came along to attend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I am afraid I was not present at the discussion last night on the future of the Seanad, I remind Members that they had considered the idea of inviting leaders of civil society to this Chamber on a regular basis to inform and to share information with them.  One of the Seanad&rsquo;s difficulties is that it is not fully democratic.  I am a nominated Senator and consequently can speak for this.  I acknowledge it is democratic in the manner in which people are voted and elected into the House but it is not a universal franchise.  While Members await the debate on the Seanad&rsquo;s abolition or reform, they should continue to engage with civil society.  Consequently, I call on the Leader and in particular the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in this regard.  The Independent group of Senators submitted several names from various strata of civil society to be invited into the House to share some of their thoughts on particular issues.  If I recall correctly, as Members approach the first anniversary of the present Seanad&rsquo;s establishment, only three individuals have appeared in the House, namely, former Senator and President, Mary Robinson, former Senator Maurice Manning and President Buzek of the European Parliament.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call on the Leader to invite to the House the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to update Members on the critical review of the amalgamations and mergers of State agencies and quangos.  While I do not necessarily contest that some of this must happen, there is uncertainty in the area of culture and the arts in particular.  For example, Culture Ireland is under critical review and there is talk of amalgamating the National Archives and the National Library.  The Minister should be invited to the House to facilitate a discussion on the context of the critical review and on whether it is based on saving money, on simply cutting quangos or on creating effectiveness.  I call for the Minister to have a debate with Members on the status of the critical review of the amalgamations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As far as the household charge is concerned, I am on the side of the people who pay and of those who pay on time.  I understand that many people are suffering and believe that many of those who already have paid are people who find it difficult to pay.  It would be a tremendous disincentive to law-abiding people for there to be any backsliding about the household charge at this point.  I also consider it to be a disservice to the public that Ministers do not really appear to be focused on clarity primarily but to some degree appear to be working out the tensions between the parties in government.  It is quite clear that Labour Party Ministers on this occasion have not really been playing for the team in their utterances.  It is said that one reason for that is because they felt they were not adequately consulted about the climb-down on the septic tanks issue.  That is not the way the Government should be operating and how to fulfil the duty to the public at this time of crisis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very glad to hear Senator Bacik mention the issue of human rights and China in the same breath.  I was concerned when watching the RTE report yesterday evening that there was no reference &mdash; as far as I am aware &mdash; to human rights.  I wonder if to some degree our media is being captured by the issue.  I know there are economic imperatives but this is an area where the media owes a service to the country and the public by keeping the issue on the agenda in order that politicians are not allowed to let this issue slide into the background.  People must know that Wen Jiabao is the name of a senior person in a very powerful and undemocratic country; it is not a question of when one should lower one&rsquo;s head in deference to a major economic power.</P>
        <P>On the subject of clarity in the messages coming from the Government, the T&aacute;naiste yesterday urged support for the fiscal compact treaty, which is fair enough, but he also tried to claim that support for the treaty was an entirely separate matter to our efforts to secure an improvement in the terms of our banking debt.  That is unacceptable as they are not separate questions.  The T&aacute;naiste has said this is about stability for the euro but Ireland has done more than anybody to stabilise the euro by taking on the national chin the consequences of reckless behaviour by our banks.  What happened to this country had nothing to do with its deficit ratios but it was rather a question of what the banks did because of a lack of oversight by the Government.  There was no problem with the debt to GDP that led us to this path.  The issues are connected and the Government owes it to the public to be braver and say as much.  Ireland has acted in good faith and we now expect to be treated in good faith by the partners in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the news from Ulster Bank this morning of a move on tracker mortgages whereby if a person wants to move house, he or she can hold a section of the tracker mortgage and borrow anything extra.  This will have a positive effect and I call on the banks we, for the most part, own &mdash; Bank of Ireland and AIB &mdash; to follow suit.  This will give people an opportunity to upgrade.  There was good work done in the budget for first-time buyers and initiatives like this would allow people to get back to the market.  It is a good move and I call on the other banks to act similarly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, on the date of the referendum, which is 31 May 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seconding the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  The Government should have put more focus on the household charge, and the issue is becoming a crisis.  There is a revolt taking place among the country&rsquo;s citizens, and it is possibly being fuelled by some personnel in RTE, particularly with the &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme.  RTE is getting most of the &euro;160 per household from the television licence, with no objection on its part, and there was never a campaign about that fee.  The licence fee is collected very efficiently by An Post, and it is a good example of how collection of a levy or charge should come about.  The Government must reconsider the matter and be reasonable.  The collection will not be completed by Saturday and it is very unfair to charge somebody &euro;10 extra if they go in after Saturday.  The Government should be realistic.  If the current 30:70 split in payment of the charge remains until 31 May, we are in serious trouble. We must ensure the two issues remain absolutely separate, and in Fianna F&aacute;il we are committed to supporting in every possible way the passing of the referendum on 31 May. There should be no doubt and it is of paramount importance to the national interest that the issue is resolved on 31 May. We should be seen as leading this campaign. </P>
        
        <P>I compliment the Chairman of the committee dealing with European affairs, Deputy Hannigan, and my fellow committee members.  We are holding special meetings all next week and during the recess to have detailed discussions with all the interested parties on the fiscal compact.  It is a positive action by the committee which shows it is prepared to give the compact the priority it deserves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the absence of the Chairman of the public consultation committee, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, I take the opportunity to welcome a first for the Seanad, namely, the launch of the first report from the public consultation committee.  One may remember this related to the rights of older people, and we had written submissions and hearings before concluding the report and making recommendations.  The report will be launched today at 12.30 p.m. in the audiovisual room, and I urge Senators to attend that launch and read the report.  Where they can, they should make public the recommendations and urge that the Government take them up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a separate note, I also raise the matter of domestic violence.  We have been outraged in recent days about the Mahon report and there was much outrage, torment and distress in recent years because of child abuse.  The number of children involved in domestic violence scenarios runs to hundreds and there are all sorts of figures and statistics from the domestic violence group known as Safe Ireland showing that on very many occasions around the country, women and children are turned away from shelters.  There were 3,600 such occasions in 2010 when women and children could not get access to accommodation.  That is an appallingly high figure, and in that group there are children without fault and who have no say or rights; they can do nothing when caught in such a position.  The children rely on the HSE and the State to ensure protection is available for them but it is not sufficient.  I ask the Leader to write to the HSE, particularly with regard to Teach Tearmainn in Kildare, which was built at a cost of &euro;900,000 and which is lying idle because the HSE cannot fund staff or operational costs. Already this year, 17 women and their children have had nowhere to go in Kildare, although the building is complete. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">First, I should say, &ldquo;Oh what a beautiful morning.&rdquo;  It is simply heavenly and I have walked through St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  I send my compliments to the Office of Public Works, which has maintained that beautiful amenity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good reason to pay the household charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We do not give people in the public services half enough credit for what has been done.  The household charge is the main issue I want to raise and I have a louder voice than any of the other Members so I can certainly shout anybody down if there is an interruption.  The household charge will go into central funds just like car taxes, which should worry everybody.  It should also worry people that we are expected to pay the charges on exactly the same day and we have not been given a clear undertaking that we will not have to pay the &euro;3.1 billion that the people do not owe.</P>
        <P>I am not signing up to or advocating the fiscal compact treaty, as it is a downright lie.  I do not believe in swearing to lies.  It is completely mathematically impossible and the targets are unachievable.  Our debt levels will get to 120% of GDP and everybody knows it is a farce; we will default but it will be called something else.  We should have a little honesty about these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted that I get to speak immediately after Senator Norris.  The Government is looking for money and anybody speaking against that should identify a source of money to pay those who are unemployed, who are in need of hospital facilities or who maintain the parks that the Senator enjoys walking through so much.  If they can identify an alternative source, I would gladly listen to them. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Keane have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I compliment the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on accepting a Private Members&rsquo; Bill tabled by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the Lower House, which will become law before the end of this year.  The legislation addresses an issue I raised in this House earlier this year regarding the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Deputy Michael McGrath tabled a short Bill to allow the ombudsman name and shame financial institutions which breach the terms and conditions agreed with individual consumers.  This is a welcome development which rows back some of the changes to the freedom of information legislation introduced in 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Approximately one month ago, I asked the Leader to request that the Government review the Freedom of Information Act.  The programme of Government includes a commitment to legislate to restore the Act to the position that obtained before it was undermined by the outgoing Government in 2007.  Thankfully, the largest party in the previous Government has had a change of heart and has introduced amending legislation which the Government has accepted.  I ask for a debate on the Act to ascertain when the commitment in the programme for Government will be implemented.  It would be preferable to amend the entire Act rather than change it in a piecemeal manner.  I welcome the legislation proposed in the other House by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and commend Deputy Michael McGrath for preparing it.  It is almost unprecedented for a Minister to accept Opposition legislation.  His decision shows that the Government intends to make things work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is no doubt the household charge has been a shambles from its conception to the sorry state in which it has left the Government.  Senators should cast their minds back to the introduction in the House of the legislation giving effect to the charge when the Minister indicated, in a very arrogant and dismissive manner, that he was not minded to accept amendments tabled by my party, other parties and Independent Senators which proposed to make it easier for people to pay the charge and increase the number of exemptions.  This is part of the reason the Government finds itself in its current position.  The crucial reason, however, is that many of those being asked to pay do not have the &euro;100 required.  Others are opposed in principle to the concept of the charge.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated this morning that 29 sack loads of payments had been received.  He will need 29,000 black sacks full of payments if he is to reach his target of a 50% payment rate.  I do not believe his target will be met.  It is high time he stopped engaging in nonsense and bully boy tactics, came clean and stated the charge is a mistake.  The Minister for Education and Science put up his hands and admitted he made a mistake on the DEIS schools before rowing back partially on his proposed measures.  It is time the Minister, rather than continuing to show arrogance, put up his hands and admitted he has made a mistake.</P>
        <P>At the weekend, the Minister indicated he would send out council staff to try to collect the charge or to remind people it was due.  This morning, I was informed by the city manager in Waterford City Council that he has not received any instructions from the Department or anyone else to use council staff for any such purposes.  The Government has issued an idle threat.</P>
        <P>I support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business and call on the Government to stop issuing threats, admit its mistakes, produce its so-called progressive property tax bill and allow us to debate it.  Sinn F&eacute;in will introduce a Bill in the D&aacute;il later today seeking to have the household charge legislation repealed and requesting that the Government produce alternative proposals.  Other options on the table would enable us to raise money in ways other than the unfair and unjust household charge.</P>

	<P>I commend and congratulate the 400,000 people who have already paid the household charge.  Let us remember that they are citizens of this country.  I also commend the several hundred thousand other citizens who are in the process of paying and will have paid by Saturday.  The &euro;100 charge amounts to &euro;2 per week.  The Government could have easily increased the standard rate of tax and probably generated significantly more revenue but did not do so because we are trying to be as fair as possible.</P>
        <P>The Government has been accused of arrogance.  One organisation that has displayed unbridled arrogance on this issue is An Post which wanted &euro;5 to process the &euro;100 charge.  It has now indicated it will process payments for &euro;1.  Why did it not do so from the outset?  People could then have paid the household charge at their local post office.</P>

	<P>I agree with many colleagues that the deadline for paying the &euro;100 household charge should be extended to 1 September.  The issue has been badly handled from the outset and no amount of burying one&rsquo;s heads in the sand &mdash; I refer in particular to the Minister in this regard &mdash; will solve the difficulties that have been created.  Will the Leader confirm that the decision to impose the household charge was made by the Government on the basis of a recommendation from the Minister and not imposed on us by the troika, as the Minister has repeatedly argued, most recently this morning?  I ask for such confirmation by way of clarification for Members and the general public.</P>
        <P>Yesterday was a black day in Cavan because, as of midnight, the town no longer has an operational barracks for the first time since 1780.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Defence to the House to answer some simple questions.  On Monday, an Army march out of Clonmel Barracks was witnessed by tens of thousands of people.  Similarly, the Army will march out of Mullingar Barracks later today in front of thousands of people.  Why did it not march out of D&uacute;n U&iacute; Neill barracks in Cavan?  Why were the gates locked while the flag was lowered and the &ldquo;Last Post&rdquo; played?  Why were families of serving members of the Defence Forces and former soldiers, some of whom retired only a couple of weeks ago, refused entry to the barracks?  Why did a proud band of men and women not march out of the barracks yesterday?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the announcement yesterday of the date for the referendum on the fiscal treaty.  I hope the House will be able to have a substantial debate on the pros and cons of the treaty as well as a debate on the referendum Bill.  An unfortunate aspect of recent referendums on the European Union has been the lecturing and hectoring we have had on both sides of the argument as we sought to force the electorate to make its decision by frightening it into accepting or rejecting the relevant proposals.  On this occasion, the Government&rsquo;s aim must be to ensure every citizen is fully aware of the content of the treaty and sufficient information will be sent to each and every voter.  We need a proactive and generous debate on the pros and cons of the treaty.  At the end of that process, I believe Irish people will overwhelmingly decide that it is in the interests of the country to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The people will overwhelmingly decide that it is in the interests of the country that we should say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Anybody living in the real world knows that there are difficulties in respect of the household charge and that lessons can be learned.  We can learn a lesson as well from the way we do our work from a parliamentary perspective.  My recollection of the debate in this House is that it was much too rushed, and this has been symptomatic of debates in both Houses.  There are time limits put on Second Stage speeches and on Committee Stage, while debates on amendments are being guillotined.  If we want to take our job seriously and highlight problems before they become a crisis, we need to discuss them in these Houses.  It is not good enough that Ministers come in here and attempt to ensure that the debate is shut down quickly.  This should be a House of debate, and if it takes a day or a week to pass a Bill, that is what we are elected to do.</P>

	<P>I hate reminding my colleagues of the fad&oacute;, fad&oacute; stuff.  In the 1980s and the early 1990s, people were given sufficient time in this House to make their case.  If a Senator required 20 minutes to speak on Second Stage, it was given.  Now the whole thing is compressed into a two or three minute contribution.  Is it any wonder that we then try to deal with problems afterwards?  If we had sufficient debating space, we could have already resolved them.</P>

I congratulate Senator Bacik for managing to explain the position of the Seanad to those who were there.  I support Senator Mac Conghail&rsquo;s proposed changes to invite other speakers here in the future.  The Leader was there last night and he heard the words of praise for the changes he made in the past year.  There is a strong case to be made for a strong Seanad in the future.  That case is in our hands in this House.  It was very well made last night.  We were taken through an interesting historical debate from ancient Greece and Rome to the Americas in 1787 and right up to the 20th and 21st centuries.  There is a very strong case to be made for a second Chamber to scrutinise legislation, to make sure that we do not leave everything in the hands of one House.  That case was started yesterday, but we can make it in the future in here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like the Leader to find time to debate the issue of those who are dying because they have not received the available organs for transplant.  We may have read last week that organ transplants increased last year from 12 per million to 20 per million, which is very high, but 20 per million in Ireland is a tiny number.  Another country of our size, Croatia, has 30 transplants per million, while it is 34 per million in Spain.  There are changes taking place all around the world.  I am not saying it has to be presumed consent.  We debated this a few years ago and it was adjourned.  There are other things taking place.  In New Jersey, there are plans to let the health insurers refuse transplant cover to anybody who does not sign an organ donation card.  We should have a debate here. People are dying in Ireland because we have not got a high enough rate of organ donation. We can do something about it and this House can lead the way. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a dose of realism in respect of the household charge.  I said this before in respect of the payment of commercial rates.  People who are paying commercial rates should place on their front door or front window the amount of rates that they are paying to local authorities.  One might walk into a paint shop to buy paint and paintbrushes.  The shop might be only 1,000 sq. ft., but the shop owner will be paying &euro;9,000 per annum in commercial rates.  The bill for commercial rates in a shoe shop might be &euro;22,000.  We need a small dose of realism in respect of the &euro;100 charge.  By the end of the year, almost 2 million people will have medical cards, and this is a clear indication that despite the pressures on the State, the Government is making sure that there are adequate provisions on health care and social welfare.  There are difficulties in certain areas, but they are being dealt with.  However, I do think a dose of realism is required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke some time ago about the need for the introduction of a patient medication card, which is very similar to a Visa card.  Everybody would have it and their files would be stored on computers.  We could eliminate giving out prescriptions and would have immediate access to medical records.  An argument is being made that it will take us ten years to implement that, but I do not agree.  Over 40% of people will be on medical cards by the end of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an issue that should be raised on the Adjournment because with over 40% of people having medical cards by the end of the year, we have a huge amount of information already available on computer.  Therefore, the introduction of patient medication cards should not be delayed and we should set a clear target for implementation during the lifetime of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Burke on the pressures being borne by businesses that are paying commercial rates, and the need for a real debate on that issue in conjunction with the household charge issue.  That is why it is imperative for the Minister to come to the House today to discuss both issues.</P>
        <P>The household charge issue is a chaotic shambles.  It has been dreadfully handled by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Minister, who was so arrogant when he was here during the debates on the household charge and the septic tank issue, has now been shown that we were right in what we were saying, which is that the people would not accept the road he was going down.  An extension of the period for paying the household charge is required.  The Minister should listen, because people should not be criminalised after next Saturday when they are not in a position to pay.  The Minister should give an extension, explain to the people where the money is going to go and bring about the ability to pay clauses or criteria where those who genuinely cannot afford to pay, do not have to pay.</P>
        <P>There are people who are saying that they will not pay, such as some Deputies and perhaps even some Senators.  They say that they will not pay the household charge and they are telling others not to pay it.  They are telling other people to break the law.  That is not right.  How can somebody who is earning &euro;92,000 say he or she is not going to pay the household charge and tell another individual earning &euro;10,000 not to pay it as well?</P>

What enforcement is taking place?  I have had reports about three new areas in certain towns that have been included but there is no enforcement.  In other areas that are in smokeless zones, registered, hard-working, local fuel merchants are called to by the council to have their registers inspected while fly by night fuel merchants are going into estates to sell bituminous coal to people at a cheaper rate and putting the local merchants out of business.  It is time the EPA reported to this House on the enforcement of smokeless coal zones.</P>

Is there ongoing monitoring by officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the situation of Bahraini medics, who now face their second trial having gone through a military trial, despite the Bahraini prosecutorial authorities having stated some time ago that the charges would likely be dropped? To refresh the memories of my colleagues these are nurses, doctors and hospital administrators, some of whom have an educational link with this country, and who it appears were arrested for no crime other than looking after the victims of a civil insurrection that was taking place in Bahrain. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader ask the Minister if a formal representation has been made to the Iranian Embassy with respect to Pastor Nadarkhani, the Christian minister in Iran who has been sentenced to death for apostasy, denying what is perceived to be the one true faith in Iran?  Has there been any formal representation on this issue?  I bring to the attention of my colleagues in the Seanad that, while I am not sure this is cause and effect, some weeks after I mentioned this previously, the Iranian Government found occasion to criticise the human rights record of the Republic of Ireland in the United Nations, an extraordinary example of finger pointing.  Having said that, I would like to know if any representations have been made on behalf of this brave man.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was not here last week, I was at a conference on breast cancer, but I would like to associate myself with some of the remarks made about the anti-Semitic murders in Toulouse last week.  When we read the circumstances of how the Sandler family were almost exterminated and eight year old Myriam Monsenego was pursued into a schoolyard by a gunman who held her by the hair while he shot her in the head for no other crime than being Jewish, it is important to recognise that the spectre of specific anti-Jewish anti-Semitism is alive and well in Europe and our society.  While I totally understand people have legitimate concerns and advocate for rights of other ethnic groups such as Palestinian Muslims and Christians in the Middle East, I ask that people think long and hard before allowing themselves to be associated with organisations such as Hamas, which have a specifically anti-Semitic agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>On the household charge, it would be wise to push out the deadline by a couple of months.  There are vulnerable people who have been listening to irresponsible legislators advising them to break the law and I pointed out yesterday that there are people who pay their bills weekly by buying stamps in the post office.  As a former community welfare officer, I can say that at the moment the CWO service is inundated with people looking for help to pay the charge.</P>
        <P>We are fast approaching the holiday season and many elderly people have received letters from the HSE telling them the home help will soon be on holiday and they must make alternative arrangements because there is no cover for them.  I have raised this before.  There is cover for them if the Minister for Health and the Department are willing to take on board my simple proposal.  We have thousands of unemployed carers on social welfare.  They should be taken on through a community employment scheme, which would cost the taxpayer &euro;25 per week and get 20 hours of service for it.  That amounts to &euro;1.77 per hour to take on carers in this way.</P>

During the years I have had the opportunity to visit China and see the improvements and progress made and the openness that is developing in its society.  Many might not be aware that Ireland enjoys iconic status in the diplomatic folklore of China because it was Frank Aiken, as Minister for External Affairs, who proposed the entry of China into the United Nations.  At the same time, however, human rights must be sacrosanct.  I wrote to the Taoiseach before he travelled to China and outlined a number of human rights issues which I asked him to raise with his hosts.  I hope that was done.</P>

She is isolated in the medical unit of a Northern Ireland prison.  Although she is very sick, she is handcuffed to a wheelchair.  That is not the generosity of spirit we associate with, and support, in the Good Friday Agreement.  It is incumbent on us, in the same way as we raise issues relating to China and elsewhere, to raise such issues at home also.  If we use human rights in bartering for political expediency or progress, we make a huge mistake.  It is only when we do not do so that we make a contribution to world peace.  I again call for the release of Marion Price.  It could, however, be a matter of too little, too late, which will not help Ireland.  She needs urgent medical attention and her family to comfort her.  She endured enough trauma during her hunger strike when she was force-fed for 200 days in a British prison.  What do we mean by human rights?  Let her go home now.</P>

	<P>Despite the impassioned plea made by Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on behalf of Marion Price, Members of the House are probably not very familiar with the case.  I ask the Leader to take up the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Obviously, there is a real human rights issue involved which should be addressed.  I support the call made by Senator Ivana Bacik for a debate on the death penalty and human rights issues.  The human rights issue raised by Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; should be part of that debate, as should the issue raised yesterday and today by Senator David Norris with regard to what happened in Holland, as well as that raised by Senator John Crown regarding the Bahraini doctors and Pastor Nadarkhani.  I take the opportunity to compliment Kofi Annan on the progress he has made in the last few days in attempting to broker a peace solution in Syria.  Given that 9,000 people have lost their lives there in the past year or so, it is incumbent on all sides to resolve the dispute.  I call on President Assad to honour in good faith the verbal commitments and indications he has given that he is prepared to adhere to the agreement brokered by Kofi Annan whom I wish success in improving the situation in Syria.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, seek an extension to the deadline for payment of the household charge, as there is huge confusion.  As Members mentioned yesterday, persons paying commercial rates are receiving mixed signals from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and their local council, depending on to whom they are talking.  The Government is penalising the old and those who do not have access to computers.  It is making them pay extra charges for paying the charge over the counter, which is obviously inequitable.  A charge or tax must be equitable.  I do not know how anybody can say it is equitable to expect a person living on an old age pension to pay the same as a Minister who has a fine big house.  That is the reason people are rebelling against the charge.  It is said there is no link between the charge and the issue of debt write-down and paying back bondholders, but there is.  The charge is being imposed because we are being forced to pay back these debts by our European colleagues.  Members opposite say there is no link between the two and that the moneys raised will be used to fund services, but the money is going into the Central Fund and will be used to pay off debt.</P>
        <P>I commend the Deputy Leader for the organisation of the debate last night.  This House has a role to play in a number of issues.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is organising the Gathering to commemorate the visit of John F. Kennedy to this country.  The Seanad could play a role, whereby Members of the Westminster Parliament, the US Congress and the Parliament of Canada could be invited to come here to discuss issues of mutual concern, including to the Irish diaspora.  Perhaps the Leader might take this suggestion on board.</P>

	<P>When the household charge was announced, Fianna F&aacute;il fully agreed that it was necessary to raise taxation, but the Government has given appalling leadership on the issue.  It was unclear from the start how the charge was going to be collected and what would be done with the money raised.  This issue has been raised in the public domain, but my concern relates to what the Government is doing behind the scenes.  Is there incompetence?  On the DEIS schools issue, we had the debacle of the Minister being obliged to row back on the changes announced.  Did he ever visit a DEIS school?</P>
        <P>Senator John Kelly was very logical.  Fianna F&aacute;il agrees that the deadline for payment of the household charge should be extended.  Ministers are now saying the matter has been mishandled.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, has said mistakes were made in the way the charge was handled, including in the distribution of leaflets to all households.  She has said the only other option for the Government is to increase income taxes, an avenue it does not wish to pursue.</P>

	<P>I endorse everything that has been said on this side of the House, and by some Members on the other side, about extending the deadline.  I am doing this because there seems to be a view abroad that because it is only &euro;2 per week, it really should not be any difficulty.  I heard Senator Conway talking about people paying motor tax in the local post office.  I live in Drumshanbo which is eight miles from Carrick-on-Shannon.  I have met old age pensioners who are living alone who are already being put to the pin of their collar concerning heating costs and the reduction of various social welfare allowances over the past 12 months.  They also have issues concerning windows and doors because essential repair grants are no longer available since this Government got rid of them.  The elderly have nowhere to turn.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Under the Government&rsquo;s watch, it has been reduced to the point where it is not happening.  There is now a need to consider seriously having an extension, especially for the elderly who do not have the capacity to pay.  With tears in their eyes, they are telling me about this dilemma.  They pay their taxes and also use the post office more frequently that the rest of the population.  There is, therefore, a real need to re-examine this problem.  The Department of Social Protection has operated a scheme for years whereby even if there is a court case pending against a claimant, it will allow for a schedule of repayments, some as low as &euro;10 or &euro;20 per week, which goes through the post office.  Could some system not be operated to allow for an instalment plan that would be much more attractive than the current one?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, raised the question of time for debating the fiscal compact treaty and the relevant legislation.  I hope to meet the group leaders tomorrow to discuss the timing involved, but I can assure the House that we will have more than ample time to discuss that matter.  It looks like we will be sitting for five days in the last week in April, Monday to Friday.  I am putting Members on notice that it is likely at this stage because we will have so many matters to discuss, including the Social Welfare Bill and Pensions Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will endeavour to arrange a debate on mortgage arrears when we return after the Easter recess.  I understand that the Taoiseach is chairing a Cabinet sub-committee on that subject; therefore, we will have more details on it after Easter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As happened yesterday, today&rsquo;s debate has been dominated by the household charge.  I stated yesterday that paying the household charge would not mean an increase in services.  However, failing to collect the charge will certainly mean reduced services.  That is a matter of fact.  In the budget, the Government tried to recognise the pain that people had already taken in previous budgets.  We did not raise income tax and did not reduce primary social welfare rates.  We reversed cuts made to the minimum wage and increased the exemption threshold for the universal social charge, thus removing over 330,000 people from it.  In addition, we increased mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers squeezed by high mortgage repayments after buying at the height of the bubble.  That is what happened in the budget.  These choices had to be made but we had no choice concerning the household charge, despite what the Opposition may say.  It was solemnly agreed to in the EU-IMF deal which was signed up to by our predecessors as a measure to be introduced in 2012.  We had no choice therefore and know that it will not be done in the fairest way in its first year, but we can say that we are on a path towards a fairer way of doing it in the coming years.  When the country has a fair and progressive property tax, we must bear in mind that it will help to prevent a future property bubble.  It will also help the country to broaden its income base to protect against a devastating collapse in revenue, such as the one which was partly responsible for our current problems.  I addressed the household charge comprehensively yesterday and have dealt with it again today.  I hope the majority of the public will pay it on time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik and other Members have raised the question of human rights in China and elsewhere, as well as the application of the death penalty in so many countries.  I know the Taoiseach has agreed to raise those matters with the Chinese authorities on his visit there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Mac Conghail and Quinn referred to distinguished persons addressing the Seanad.  I will raise that matter at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Senator Mac Conghail also called for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to attend the House to address the critical review of the amalgamation of State agencies.  I will endeavour to arrange for the Minister to come here to address that matter in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Comiskey referred to the moves by Ulster Bank on tracker mortgages, which are to be welcomed.  He said that other banks should do likewise and we would all agree with him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Leyden mentioned separating the household charge from the fiscal compact, which is very important.  I am glad that the Joint Committee on European Affairs will be addressing the fiscal compact treaty.  This House gave the lead in that regard by having a four-hour debate on the subject, as well as a presentation in the audiovisual room.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe referred to the public consultation committee which will have its launch at 12.30 p.m.  I hope as many Members of the House as possible will attend the launch.  It is a way of bringing the citizen close to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is to be and has been welcomed by many.  We will be having further consultations in the coming months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe also raised the question of domestic violence and the need for greater access to accommodation for those affected, especially children.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, will be in the House shortly and some of these points can be raised with her.  I will certainly raise the problem in Kildare with the Minister for Health.</P>
        <P>Senator C&aacute;it Keane referred to the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill dealing with the Financial Services Ombudsman, which I am sure all Members will welcome.  The Government is willing to accept good legislation brought forward by other parties.  The Senator also called for a debate on the Freedom of Information Act which I will try to arrange.</P>
        <P>Senator Diarmuid Wilson raised the question of barracks closures and asked why there had not been a public march in Cavan.  I will try to ascertain the position from the Minister for Finance.  I take the opportunity to praise the contribution of the Defence Forces which have accepted more rationalisation than almost any other sector of the public service.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn raised the issue of organ donation, as he has on several occasions.  I will try to arrange a debate on it with the relevant Minister after Easter.</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke referred to the burden of commercial rates on small businesses.  I take his point.  As the Cathaoirleach said, the matter of medical cards is one that could be raised on the Adjournment.  I, therefore, invite the Senator to submit his motion for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>Senator John Crown drew attention to the plight of the Bahraini doctors and Pastor Nadarkhani.  My information is that ongoing representations are being made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I will certainly bring the matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention again.</P>
        <P>Senator John Kelly spoke about carers and community employment schemes.  The Minister for Social Protection will be in the House after Easter.  This will provide an opportunity for the Senator to raise these points with her.</P>
        <P>I am sure we all join Senator Terry Brennan in congratulating the Garda and Customs officers on their success in tackling diesel laundering in County Cavan.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael Mullins spoke about the situation in Syria and Mr. Kofi Annan&rsquo;s efforts to negotiate an agreement.  We all hope to see peace in that land in the not too distant future.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to the House.  I express my sympathy to him on the recent burglary that took place in his home and ask him to pass on my sympathy also to his wife.  Nothing could provide a more appropriate context for the introduction of a new tort of violation of privacy.  Burglary is a significant violation of anyone&rsquo;s privacy and I express my sympathy to the Minister in that regard.  I have a long history of raising these issues in the House, despite what some commentators have maintained, namely, that I only take them up in the interests of public figures such as myself.  I have a series of files as long as my arm on cases I have raised relating to situations involving people&rsquo;s privacy and their private grief being invaded unjustifiably by the press.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I disagree completely with the idea that politicians are some special race.  I use the phrase &ldquo;ordinary people&rdquo;.  I have been chastised for that by people within the press who use it regularly themselves.  Everyone in this country uses it.  I am an ordinary person.  Politicians are just ordinary people who accept an extra burden of responsibility on behalf of the rest of the community.  I do not think any lesser degree of truth should be required in dealing with them than for dealing with anybody else.  I have never accepted that principle, although I know most other people appear to do so.  I think they are foolish to do so.  My principle is quite clear; it is &ldquo;Tell the truth or pay the price.&rdquo;  I have always said that.</P>
        <P>We had a long battle in previous Seanad debates on the Defamation Bill.  I am pleased my colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, is present.  We do not agree on many things but this is one issue on which we agree.  We were the two voices who spoke out on the Defamation Bill.  I led the charge on the issue because I realised that it was being introduced at the instigation of newspaper editors in order to give them greater freedom to trample over the rights of ordinary people, and so it proved.  In return for this we were promised that there would be a <i>quid pro quo</i>, namely, the introduction of a privacy Bill, the introduction of a tort of privacy, in order to protect the rights of citizens.  I refer for example to the situation in 2006 when a statement was issued on behalf of the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform saying that it would introduce a privacy Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main purpose of the new Bill will be to introduce a modern statutory framework to protect all citizens from the invasion of their privacy.  Who could disagree with that?  The main elements of the Privacy Bill largely reflect the recommendations contained in the report of the working group on privacy which had been established by the Minister.  One could refer to a series of cases including that of Princess Caroline von Hannover on which the European Court ruled that all persons are entitled to a personal sphere of privacy and non-intrusion.  Why should they not be?  What is privacy?  It is essential for mental well-being and for citizens to have a sense of security in their own homes and their relationships.  If anyone violates that, they should pay for it as far as I am concerned.  I will do everything I can, despite the gutlessness of so many people in political life, to ensure that this will and does happen.  I am not afraid of the consequences.  Nothing worse could be said about me than has been said fairly generally already.  The Minister will be pleased to hear that I will not rerun that situation because there are other more appropriate fora in which I intend to run those issues.</P>
        <P>We are told that the public right to know is very important.  So it is, but it is not simply a question of prurience.  The public right to know is not just what the people want to know.  Of course they want to know every dirty little detail of the sex lives of football players, but because they want to know it, does that mean they have a right to know?  I do not think so.  Public interest is deliberately confused by editors with public prurience.  That is a grave mistake.</P>
        <P>I referred to one case, the case of Princess Caroline von Hannover but there is another one with which I know the Minister is familiar, namely, Kennedy and Arnold <i>v</i>. Ireland in IR 587 of 1987.  In that case, Hamilton P. decided:</P>
        <P LI="1">The right to privacy is not an issue; the issue is the extent of that right or the extent of the right &ldquo;to be let alone&rdquo;.  Though not specifically guaranteed by the Constitution, the right of privacy is one of the fundamental personal rights of the citizen which flow from the Christian and democratic nature of the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">He goes on to say: &ldquo;It is not an unqualified right&rdquo; and it is not in the Bill that I have presented.</P>
        <P>He also states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The nature of the right to privacy must be such as to ensure the dignity and freedom of an individual in the type of society envisaged by the Constitution, namely, a sovereign, independent and democratic society.  The dignity and freedom of an individual in a democratic society cannot be ensured if his communications of a private nature, by they written or telephonic, are deliberately, consciously and unjustifiably intruded upon and interfered with.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I received a media release from a decent man, the secretary of the National Union of Journalists.  He expressed strong reservations.  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; as Ms Mandy Rice-Davis stated, &ldquo;he would, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;  He states that there is no overwhelming demand for such legislation.  He should read a few publications such as <i>Hot Press</i>.  I would have thought <i>Hot Press</i> was a popular magazine and it certainly makes a fairly strong case for it.  If I have time I will read <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial.  It makes a compelling case and the Leveson inquiry in Britain is irrefutable in its requirement that there should be changes.  Unless anybody dreams that these matters do not happen in good Catholic Ireland, let me say that witness after witness went into the box in the Leveson inquiry, and there were persons who were editors or proprietors of newspapers which had Irish editions and they all stated the same practices went on here.  I can say for a fact that they certainly do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree that the establishment of the Press Council and the Office of the Press Ombudsman have given aggrieved citizens a fair and efficient means of lodging complaints and I recognise the honoured presence of Professor John Horgan in the Visitors Gallery.  They have done some good work in addressing these matters, but there is no real sanction.  It is fairly toothless.  As I stated at the time of the Defamation Bill 2006, the Press Council is a complete and utter farce.  The same group, newspaper editors, demanded independent regulation in architecture, medicine and the law.  Every profession must be independently regulated except the press, which has become a tyranny.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also received an interesting brief which had been prepared for the 2006 Bill.  It was a commissioned hatchet job, extremely useful because it points the discerning reader directly to the points of weakness in the argument.  It, rather delightfully, quotes a case in which I am involved, Henchy, J. in Norris <i>v</i>. the Attorney General in the Supreme Court, 1983.  Mr. Justice Henchy stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Amongst those basic personal rights is a complex of rights which vary in nature, purpose and range (each necessarily being a facet of the citizen&rsquo;s core of individuality within the constitutional order) and which may be compendiously referred to as the right of privacy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">However, Mr. Justice Henchy was overruled, in a bad judgment, if I may say so, by the then Attorney General.  Apparently, the NUJ wants the courts to do the legislating.  The courts continually reprimand the Oireachtas for not legislating.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Leveson inquiry, I cite a couple of quotes.  There it was stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The indictment could as easily read as follows: Illegally accessing people&rsquo;s private voicemails, bribing employees into divulging personal information, blagging sensitive details through deception and trickery, blackmailing vulnerable or opportunistic individuals into breaking confidences about well-known people, the blatant intrusion into the grief of victims of crime, the vilification of ordinary members of the public unwittingly caught up in such events, the hounding of various well-known people, their families and friends, purely because this sells newspapers, and finally, the bullying of those who, in seeking to question these practices, are therefore merely exercising the very same freedom of speech behind which much of this behaviour is sought to be shielded or excused by the press.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am in favour of freedom of speech.  I was and still am a member of the NUJ.  For three and a half years, I was a columnist in a tabloid newspaper where I wrote honourably and decently, and I am proud of every word I wrote.  However, I am not proud of persons such as Mr. MacKenzie who boasted to the Leveson inquiry that in his considerable experience he only checked his sources once and then, when discussing the invasion of privacy, Mr. Sherbourne, QC, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Right at the outset in true media lawyer style, I know I meant to say in the clearest of terms that freedom of speech is an essential part of any democratic society, and I do.  No one could ... say otherwise. ... it is only one part of the equation.  The other side, so frequently ignored or understated by the press, is the right to respect for private life, for home, for family life, for correspondence.</P>
        <P LI="1">Privacy, contrary to what the newspapers believe, is not a dirty word, and it does not necessarily mean the same as secret.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Further, there is the following quotation where it states that privacy is a dirty little place &ldquo;for paedos&rdquo;.  That is an interesting quote from the editor of a newspaper.  That is what privacy means to him.  The shame reflects back on him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish on this and come back later because I have a right to reply.  The question of Ms Charlotte Church was a complete fabrication, not least because she was not there on the night of the events of which she was accused.  Nobody checked with her.  Apparently, nobody thought about whether this was intrusive, let alone true.  To use the Mr. Kelvin MacKenzie line, that &ldquo;if it sounded right it was probably right and therefore we should lob it in,&rdquo; bugger sources or respect for people&rsquo;s private lives.  That is what Mr. MacKenzie stated to the inquiry.</P>
        <P>I will end by referring to <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial.  It stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">All the bounds of decency have been broken, not to mention criminality and mendacity on a breathtaking scale.  Rights, dignity, trampled on.  Privacy, be damned.  And not alone by the late unlamented <i>News of the World</i> .  A culture of anything-goes was pervasive, justified on the basis of a spurious &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;, an attitude reflected most crassly last week by former NoW hack Paul McMullen at the hearing: &ldquo;Privacy is the space bad people need to do bad things in.  Privacy is for paedos. . .&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The general secretary of the National Union of Journalists in Britain to which I am affiliated, wrote that we want to show how the culture in the workplace is led from the top, how bullying and pressure from editors, accompanied with staff shortages and dwindling resources, puts journalists under huge pressure to deliver &mdash; a context where shortcuts become inevitable.  I know of the way in which people are bullied in this country.  I know the editors who do it.  I know what they have done and the reason I cannot put it on the record is because I have been begged by these people not to expose them because they will not be protected, they will not be treated as whistleblowers and they will lose their jobs.  This is rampant right throughout the industry of which I still remain a member.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As Senator Norris pointed out, he and I were very much <i>ad idem</i> in the debate in this House previously on the Defamation Bill 2006 and the Privacy Bill 2006.  I think I referred to it, and he himself made an insinuation in that regard, as something of an unholy alliance because we have differing opinions on many other topics.  Nonetheless, this is something which, at the time of the passing of the Defamation Bill 2006, should have been attached and enacted at the same time for reasons on which I would have expounded then.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise that we are debating an issue of two rights which are fundamental, namely, the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.  People have a right to privacy and they have a right to their good reputation.  There is an onus on the State to protect both of those.  Those of us who would have argued in this House that they would see the State and, indeed, other states, move against, for example, freedom of religion in all sorts of different insidious ways would certainly have to articulate that we must stand up for all such freedoms &mdash; freedom of expression and freedom of assembly &mdash; which are all very much associated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A free press is very much an essential component of our democratic infrastructure.  In many regimes, we have seen that the work of good investigative journalism, often at considerable personal risk to the journalists themselves, has exposed not only corruption, but atrocities, in a way that has led to a resolution.  Indeed, in some states some of them have sacrificed their lives in the pursuit of that, and that is something which we should acknowledge in these debates.  In this country, we have also seen good investigative journalism into abuses by politicians and serious deficiencies within the public services and in the private sector.  All of that is something that, in the enactment of any legislation, we should seek to protect.  However, I suppose it is fair to acknowledge as well that we have seen abuses by the media. Only in recent times we have seen the abuses by RTE in the Fr. Reynolds case, which displayed, at a fairly senior level within the organisation, the national broadcaster, a complete disregard not only for the truth and good investigative practices, but also for the reputation of those whose lives can be destroyed as a consequence. </P>
        
        <P>I know people against whom false allegations were made and who, subsequently, as result of the pressures that were brought to bear on them personally, committed suicide.  It essential that these Houses and the representatives of the people ensure this fine balance is set at the right degree with regard to protecting the privacy of people, while at the same time ensuring freedom of expression, which can be difficult to define.  I contend that, within our media, we have moved on from a situation where we were happy to read the written media or listen to or watch programmes on radio and television and be assured that what we were getting were the unvarnished facts of a situation because it was direct reporting.  I rarely see any reporting in newspapers now as it is practically all commentary, often coloured with particular views and opinions and sometimes even the bias of those doing the writing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The media have argued strongly against this Privacy Bill.  I was highly critical of my own Government when it was in power for introducing a Press Council, although I do not in any way take from the integrity of the people who serve on it.  However, a Press Council that is a creature of the media itself does not meet the first essential criteria of being independent.  It should be established independently and should be seen to operate independently.  I do not believe one that is paid for by the media itself can put itself forward in that light.</P><P Just="Left">I have raised in this House my concerns with regard to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. We have allowed a situation to develop where former senior executives of the national broadcaster play significant roles on that body and where people who are doing business and in contracts with RTE are on the body. This raises a question or a perception as to the operation of the independence of the functions of those bodies. When we are establishing such a body, we should in the first instance try to ensure it is absolutely independent. </P><P Just="Left">There are no real unfettered freedoms. We recognise that human beings have strengths but also weaknesses, and we are fallible in many ways. The Mahon tribunal recently shone a light on that and showed weaknesses within politicians. It also, I have to add, shone a light on the avariciousness of the legal profession and the exorbitant fees that are being extracted, not just in those tribunals but generally from the public, the State and taxpayers. </P><P Just="Left">It is important we get to a situation where the public can have confidence and where people&rsquo;s rights and the vindication of their good name are paramount. Since the publication of those Bills and since previous debates in this House, the Leveson inquiry in Britain has shown appalling abuses within the industry. We were lobbied in this regard by the secretary of the NUJ. I recall a preliminary debate in the O&rsquo;Reilly Hall in UCD, when a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. McDowell, arranged a gathering of all interested parties to have an open conference on this issue. The secretary of the NUJ stood up at that event and acknowledged there had been a lowering of standards within our media. I do not believe anyone would disagree with that point because it has been happening, perhaps because of the pressures of competition or because of the influence of the media, particularly the tabloid media in Britain. </P><P Just="Left">We in this House owe it to citizens and have an obligation to ensure that does not happen in this State. As a consequence, I urge the Minister to consider the contents of this Bill, to vary it if he feels it necessary, but to come forward with a privacy Bill which has the fine balance required. Above all, it should ensure a right to the protection of the privacy of our citizens in situations where it should not be exposed by a media that is often driven by trying to get the most outlandish story from the point of view of the marketing of newspapers. I appeal to the Minister to ensure this does not happen. I second the motion. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Privacy Bill, proposed by Senator Norris and seconded by Senator Walsh, seeks to create a tort of violation of privacy, which is, of course, already actionable by way of constitutional action.  As the Senators know, damages have been awarded for violation of constitutional rights.  Although I will be opposing the Bill, principally on the ground that it is premature, I thank the Senators for providing an invaluable opportunity to debate this evolving area of law and policy.</P>
        <P>This is an interesting moment in our political history.  While we are today debating this Privacy Bill and the importance of privacy in this House, the other House is debating the Mahon report and the importance of transparency and accountability in public life.  Of course, it is imperative to find the right balance in these matters since there is no doubt the public interest in democratic transparency and accountability can collide with the individual&rsquo;s interest in privacy.  The challenge is to ensure democratic transparency and accountability on the part of public officials when engaged in public duties while also guaranteeing proper legal protection for those privacies of life to which individuals, including public officials, have reasonable expectation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recognise the Bill seeks to build constructively on the Privacy Bill 2006 published by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, which I had restored to the Seanad Order Paper in June last year.  In restoring the 2006 Bill to the Order Paper, my intention was to examine how its provisions stood up and to improve the text.  The previous Government had left the Bill on the Order Paper to give adequate time, first, to assess the effectiveness of the Press Council in dealing voluntarily with issues addressed in the Bill and, second, to assess the impact of the new Defamation Act.  I did not want to frustrate those processes in any way.  For this reason, I judged it sensible merely to restore the Bill in its original form.  I intend, however, to review in 2013 how the current architecture is working.  In light of this practical consideration, I believe it is premature to enact the Senators&rsquo; Bill at this stage.  I also have substantial concerns about the content of both the 2006 Bill and the Bill now before the House.  If the Government decides we need substantive legislation in this area, the 2006 Bill will need repair to ensure it achieves its twofold objective of preventing unwarranted intrusions into individuals&rsquo; personal privacy and striking a proper balance between the rights of individuals and the public interest. It must do so in a manner that protects the right to individual privacy and other individual rights while respecting democratic values and the constitutional right to freedom of expression. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Prurient revelations about individuals&rsquo; private personal lives for financial gain by the media where the matters reported have no relevance to public affairs or matters of genuine public controversy, or the unwarranted invasion or targeting by the media of individuals&rsquo; personal and private lives, have, of course, nothing to do with democratic values or freedom of expression.  Such revelations turn on prurient interest and financial gain rather than public interest and the frequently proclaimed &ldquo;right to know&rdquo;.  Where value is attached to the individual&rsquo;s right to privacy, there is no right to know about every aspect of every individual&rsquo;s personal life.  Such a right to know and alleged right to report is nothing other than a claim to a licence to undermine individual freedom and dignity.  The evidence before the Leveson inquiry in England reveals the excesses to which the media may go when news values are undermined by prurience, ethics are abandoned and sensationalism and the pursuit of profit are slavishly pursued.  We are not totally immune from that in this jurisdiction but to date there is no substantial evidence that the indefensible excesses of the British tabloid media have been applied to prey on individuals in this State.  Should there be such revelations, however, I will not hesitate to progress any legislation necessary to protect citizens and those who reside here.  Such legislation in the new communication age must carefully ensure it applies practically and effectively to both new and old media in the context of the multiple ways now available to disseminate information online, including the social websites.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While there is no hard evidence that the excesses revealed by the Leveson inquiry have visited our shores, it is clear that some of our media, parts of the print media and some in the broadcast media, have lost sight of credible values and the ethic of ensuring the accuracy of stories of alleged news published.  There is today a substantial grey area between the reporting of news, the expression of opinion and the pursuit by sections of the media of their own agenda.  On occasions, it seems the desire to promote a narrative that serves a particular agenda, that appeals to the biases of the author or that brings sensationalism to the mundane to justify a headline presents a real barrier to objective and accurate reporting of events.</P>
        <P>There was a time, when I first entered politics, when the majority of journalists took pride in ensuring the accuracy of their reporting and the trustworthiness of their sources.  Accurate reporting and vigorous investigative journalism were correctly put on a very high pedestal.  This is a vital part of our democracy.  There are, of course, today many good journalists and broadcasters who respect these values.  Unfortunately, there are some for whom these values appear to have no relevance.  Speed in reporting an issue is regarded by some as a greater value than accuracy, as is a contrived narrative that will either attract substantial public interest or scandalise readers.  Where inconvenient facts undermine the desired narrative, there are some journalists who willingly omit them from the story written and published.  For those who so conduct themselves, the hurt caused to individuals by their reporting is of no consequence, nor is the resulting damage to reputation.  In this context, our defamation laws are crucial.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary how newspapers and some journalists who proclaim a commitment in the public interest to hold others to account for their actions seek to avoid and evade accountability when, by inaccurate reporting, they do damage to the reputation of individuals innocent of allegations made.  In my experience, there is an extraordinary reluctance to apologise and acknowledge mistakes made.  There is also an over-reliance on the financial strength of newspaper groups to withstand the possible consequences of court action and the burden and pressure that the taking of such action imposes on individuals who seek proper redress.  This is an issue that requires further consideration on another day and it is about more than the constructive tension that has existed between the media, politicians and others in public life over the centuries.  It is centrally about how the individual who is seriously wronged by media reports can be ensured of appropriate speedy redress.  The jury is out on how well our current mechanisms, both statutory and voluntary are dealing with this issue.</P>
        <P>It is important we review the adequacy of the 2006 Bill&rsquo;s provisions in light of developments, including case law in this area since its publication.  There is a broad spectrum of issues that need to be examined carefully in this sensitive area, ranging from the role of emerging technologies, the role of the State, freedom of expression, the abilities of corporations to protect their legitimate interests and the rights of private citizens to go about their lawful private affairs without undue interference.  As I see it, privacy as dealt with by the Privacy Bill 2006 and by the Senators&rsquo; Bill occupies the space between, on the one hand, the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003 and, on the other, the necessary and appropriate provisions in regard to dealing with security and crime issues.  There may be some overlap in provisions and effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Privacy Bill being debated and the 2006 Bill both seek to introduce a modern statutory framework to protect all citizens from the invasion of their privacy.  The Bills draw from the recommendations contained in the 2006 report of the working group on privacy law and from the Law Reform Commission 1998 report on privacy.  The Bills give statutory expression to jurisprudence of our own courts as well as of the European Court of Human Rights.  The philosophy of both Bills is to support the publication of material that is in the public interest, clarify the law for publishers and reduce uncertainty.  They reflect the judgment that the arguments in favour of the introduction of a clear statutory cause of action for violation of privacy outweigh the arguments against it.  The essential arguments are, first, that the absence of legal certainty in relation to a legal remedy for violations of privacy interests is undesirable, second, the absence of a precise legal remedy is likely to render it more difficult for persons to predict whether their actions may generate legal liability for invasions of the privacy of others, and third, that legislation was necessary to better meet the State&rsquo;s obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights which are set out in an evolving jurisprudence. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The report of the working group was adopted by the then Government.  It contains a draft Bill that inspired the Privacy Bill of 2006.  While the Statute Book contains provisions in certain situations for the protection of privacy, there is no dedicated statutory provision for a remedy of a violation of privacy.  The Privacy Bill 2006 proposed a new statutory tort of violation of privacy, as does this Bill.  It puts on a statutory footing the constitutional rights of the individual.  In several cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that an individual may invoke an unspecified or unenumerated right of privacy under Article 40.3.1&deg; of the Constitution.  In McGee <i>v</i> the Attorney General in 1974, for instance, the Supreme Court recognised the right to marital privacy.  In that case, Mr. Justice Budd stated: &ldquo;It is scarcely to be doubted in our society that the right to privacy is universally recognised and accepted with possibly the rarest of exceptions.&rdquo;  In the case mentioned by Senator Norris, Kennedy and Arnold <i>v. </i>Ireland in 1987, the Supreme Court ruled that the illegal wire tapping of two journalists was a violation of the Constitution, stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">The nature of the right to privacy is such that it must ensure the dignity and freedom of the individual in a democratic society.  This cannot be insured if his private communications, whether written or telephonic, are deliberately and unjustifiably interfered with.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">These cases concerned State interference in some form with the privacy of the individual.  It is now clear, however, that the constitutional right to privacy also has horizontal effect and may be invoked against private persons or entities such as media organisations.  For example, in the Bermingham case in 1997, photographs were surreptitiously taken of a professional model in a state of undress with a long distance camera and the photographs were later published in a tabloid newspaper.  Ms Bermingham successfully sued for damages for breach of her constitutional right to privacy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Privacy is also a right guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, the ECHR.  Since 1 January 2004, the European Convention on Human Rights Act requires every Irish court to interpret every judgment made and statute law in a manner compatible with the provisions of the ECHR.  It means that long-established rules of common law will fall to be interpreted as necessary to make them fully compliant with the ECHR and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  Article 8 of the convention effectively guarantees the right to privacy, balanced by Article 10 which allows for freedom of expression.  It is the tension, which the two previous speakers correctly mentioned, between those very often competing rights that is at the core of the general debate around press freedom, defamation and the protection of privacy.  Quite often, the debate on the right to privacy centres on public personalities and celebrities.  We should keep in mind, however, that the likely beneficiaries of reform of privacy law are not just celebrities but ordinary people who can find themselves in the media spotlight for a variety of reasons.  It could be through some innocent action or they might be caught up in an event for whatever reason.  A person has the right simply to be left alone to get on with his or her life without intrusion into his or her privacy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Violations of privacy are not the exclusive preserve of the media.  They can also relate to invasions of privacy in very ordinary circumstances, say for example, in situations where a neighbour installs a closed circuit television, CCTV, camera on his or her property, ostensibly as a security measure, but where the camera is positioned in such a way that it encroaches on an adjoining property and records images of a neighbour in a way that might be inappropriate.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Bill 2006 was published by the then Government at the same time as the Defamation Bill, which has now become the Defamation Act 2009 and which came into effect on 1 January 2010.  That Act gave recognition and certain privileges to an independent press council and press ombudsman in regard to the setting of standards and the regulation of media behaviour through an independent complaints procedure.</P>
        <P>My predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality, the late Brian Lenihan, in launching the first annual report of the Press Council of Ireland in January 2009, announced that he would allow the council a period of operation of at least two years before deciding to progress the Privacy Bill.  This would permit the council to elaborate in its code of practice on a sufficiently robust privacy provision and ensure it was enforced and adhered to by its members.  The privacy provision in Principle 5 of the council&rsquo;s code of practice is useful, but its members must continue to be willing to subscribe to the standards set down in the code.</P>
        <P>The Press Council of Ireland and the Office of Press Ombudsman have been positive developments in the independent regulation of the print media in Ireland.  The relative success of the council in the upholding of standards and the prevention of much that might be called media outrages stands in stark contrast to the role of the Press Complaints Commission in the United Kingdom.  Of course, defamation legislation and, ultimately, a privacy Bill will apply to all media.  To be fair to the Irish media, figures for 2011 show very few complaints in regard to privacy &mdash; only two out of 217 complaints made to the statutory Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Press Ombudsman received a total of 343 inquiries in relation to possible complaints under the code of practice for newspapers and magazines, of which 40 were related to Principle 5 on privacy.  Some 16 of the inquiries resulted in formal complaints being lodged, resulting in the Press Ombudsman making 14 decisions.  The final two complaints were successfully resolved when the editor in question wrote a personal letter of apology to the complainant for the distress and upset caused to the family concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While violations of privacy by the media are not a daily occurrence, this does not excuse us from the need to remain vigilant or take legislative action.  With technological advancement, the lines between traditional and new media are becoming increasingly blurred.  It might be a useful reminder to point out that the provisions of the Defamation Act 2009 and the protections of privacy afforded by the Constitution and through case law, both domestic and from the ECHR, apply to all material deemed to be published.  There is no particular protection afforded to a person who commits a violation online as opposed to the traditional media.</P>
        <P>I turn to the provisions contained in the Senators&rsquo; Bill and the 2006 Bill.  I hold the view &mdash; this is partly my reason for opposing the Privacy Bill 2012 &mdash; that many of its provisions need further work to render them serviceable.  However, I value the Senators&rsquo; work and this debate because they are a significant milestone on the road to statutory reform should it be required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 1 does not attempt to define &ldquo;privacy&rdquo;.  This was the approach recommended by the working group on privacy.  I wish to consider further whether this approach remains valid.  It may be useful to fashion an inclusive but not an exhaustive definition to capture the facets of the right to privacy.</P>
        <P>Section 2 provides for the tort of violation of privacy actionable without proof of special damage.  I fully recognise that the intention is to make a violation of privacy actionable <i>per se</i>.  The harm is done by the violation.  Some jurisdictions in the United States use the phrase &ldquo;dignatory tort&rdquo; to describe such actions.  Should the Bill stipulate nominal damages for a violation of privacy <i>per se</i>?  Is there a need to provide for a procedure for actions taking up time in the courts for trivial violations?  These are issues on which we must take time to reflect.</P>
        <P>Section 3 deals with the entitlement to privacy.  It states the privacy to which an individual is entitled is that which is reasonable in all the circumstances having regard to other important lawful interests.  This principle is justifiable, but we have to consider the issue further.  Might it be better to provide that the nature and degree of privacy to which an individual is entitled are based on reasonable expectation?  Do we not need to specify other matters, for example, national security, against which the entitlement to privacy must be balanced?  Section 3(2) provides that, subject to subsection (1) and sections 5 and 6, certain acts involve a violation of privacy.  It does not appear to deal adequately with the acquisition or collection of private information; it mentions surveillance but does not state whether the violation occurs whether the surveillance is accomplished by trespass or other unlawful means.</P>
        <P>Section 3(2)(<i>c</i>) makes it a violation of privacy to use the name, likeness or voice of an identifiable individual without the consent of that individual for a commercial purpose or financial gain.  This provision might prevent newspapers from showing photographs of spectators at football or hurling matches.  Would a photograph be a &ldquo;likeness,&rdquo; even if the person&rsquo;s face was not disclosed?</P>
        <P>There is no mention of electronic recordings in section 3(2)(<i>d</i>).  The tort seems to overlap with the torts of trespass, nuisance, breach of confidence and harassment.  I also have concerns about the broad nature of the provision and whether its application would in practice, as framed, bring desired clarity or make a real difference.  For example, does the reference to &ldquo;public morality&rdquo; grant licence to report on the intimate details of the private lives of public figures in all circumstances?</P>
        <P>I appreciate the principle behind section 3 which is an innovative provision.  It would provide for the first time in Irish law for the protection of a person&rsquo;s rights to control the exploitation of their own image for commercial purposes.  This important proposition is already law in many other states and designed to prevent false advertising or misrepresentation for commercial purposes and gain.</P>
        <P>Section 4 deals with matters to which the courts must have regard in determining whether a violation has occurred.  An important question in regard to this provision is whether the courts should be required in an action for the violation of privacy to consider whether the intrusion is of a nature and degree that are highly offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities.  Another issue arises from the stipulation in the section that a claim would not be defeated just because the information was in the public domain.  I would like to consider this issue further so as not to risk creating undue legal difficulties for the freedom of the press.  It is difficult to fathom how an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy could be regarded as having been violated where something already in the public domain is legitimately reported and published.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides for a number of defences available to a defendant in an action for an alleged violation of privacy.  These are eminently sensible.  In particular, the section would provide protection for an act of news gathering by a newspaper or broadcaster provided that any disclosure of material obtained was made in good faith, was for the purpose of discussing a subject of public importance, was for the public benefit and was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides that certain disclosures are not a violation of privacy.  There is a need to consider whether further additions may be required.  For example, we could suggest the following should also not involve a violation of privacy: the person consented to disclosure; the act was incidental to the exercise of a lawful right of defence of a person or property; the act was authorised or required under statute, by a court or any process of a court; the act was done in the course of a criminal investigation or for crime prevention purposes.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides for court jurisdiction in privacy actions, with provision for claims in the Circuit Court up to &euro;50,000.  This mirrors the provision in the Defamation Act and is sensible.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for a number of remedies that the court may order.  The Bill proposes adding that the court could direct that an apology be made.  Presumably, this would be in cases in which the respondent had not offered such apology.  This is a reasonable change to the 2006 Bill that deserves serious consideration should we proceed to legislate in this area.</P>
        <P>Sections 11 and 12 deal with limitation of action and notice of intention to bring an action.  I do not agree with the Senators&rsquo; proposal to extend these periods to two and three years, respectively, in section 11 and six months in section 12.</P>
        <P>Section 13 provides for the hearing of an action other than in public.  This provision was designed for the rare cases in which the mere application for protection from violation of privacy could in itself compound the damage done to the person, beyond that which could be remedied by the award of monetary damages by the court.  The courts have a long tradition of the administration of justice in public and I expect this to continue.  Public administration of law is a crucial and important democratic value and a democratic safeguard against judicial misconduct or other aspects of judicial behaviour which are not appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I happily agree with these provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>However, there are certain very limited circumstances where some curtailment is necessary; for example, in family law cases the courts sit in private to protect the anonymity of individuals.  There may be a case for allowing private hearings in certain circumstances where people are seeking to obtain protection for their right to privacy.  I am not convinced by the noises of those who shout &ldquo;super injunction&rdquo; as if this should be the inevitable outcome of all privacy actions.</P>
        <P>Privacy legislation, it is sometimes suggested, will prevent investigative journalism.  My answer to that is if the material published is true and clearly involves the public interest then journalists have nothing to fear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is incumbent on the media &mdash; both traditional and new &mdash; to exercise due care and attention with regard to potential violations of privacy.  This is particularly so in cases where exposure of private behaviour is not the public interest that is concerned but rather the public&rsquo;s prurience.  Where the behaviour of a person is not illegal, does not place anyone at risk of injury or financial loss or does not impact on public duties that they may be required to perform, I do not believe that it is fair for the media or anyone to expose such personal behaviour.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Quite frankly, some expos&eacute;s are done for commercial gain, though it is often dressed up as some type of morality lecture.  Media moralising, like moralising of any kind, should be avoided.  Significant hurt can be done to innocent third parties, especially children.  It is very difficult to argue that kiss and tell exposure stories are really vital to the maintenance of press freedom and investigative journalism.  They may add some spice and prurience to life and it is not unknown for certain people to effectively consent to exposure for their own reasons.  Where individuals do not give such consent there is no reason why their private personal lives should feature in the headlines of the national media.</P><P Just="Left">The publication of pictures is a sensitive issue. However, the media needs to be careful of context. There were complaints the media were prevented from photographing witnesses attending court to give evidence in a certain high profile trial in the recent past. The interest at that time clearly went beyond the public interest to a somewhat prurient interest. Care is always required in the publication of photographs. Defamation may occur. Care is also needed in regard to children. Media rarely consider the impact on children of a family when stories are written which are intended to create scandal but are really essentially about the private lives of individuals and are not matters of major public interest. </P><P Just="Left">The eventual outcome of the Leveson inquiry in the UK may contain important lessons for the future regulation and conduct of the media in regard to the violation of privacy. We share many of the same media outlets and influences, but we hope none of the significant defects and behaviour involved, as revealed in the Leveson inquiry. </P><P Just="Left">We have seen some shocking revelations as to the methods used by media to obtain information on private citizens, very little involving the public interest, but solely for commercial gain. Similar outrages in this jurisdiction, and I am sure Senators would agree, would merit and receive a swift legislative response. Abuse of the necessary freedoms afforded to the media in a democracy is a serious matter. </P><P Just="Left">I share many of the views expressed by Senators today. In opposing the Bill proposed by Senator Norris - I think Senators Quinn and Barrett also have their names to the Bill - I do not oppose the substance of the proposal, rather its timing. I will continue to review the provisions contained in the Privacy Bill 2006, taking into account developments in the law of privacy in our courts and elsewhere, with a view to necessary amendments to improve the Bill should the Bill prove necessary. I recognise that citizens justifiably worry about intrusions upon their privacy and that the potential for unjustified intrusion into personal lives is now unparalleled. I recognise that, ultimately, it may be preferable to legislate for privacy rather than simply leave the matter to develop through case law. The final content of this legislation, should it be required, will be a matter for Government next year. In addressing this issue we should also never, in any respect, undervalue the central role played by the media, be it the press, print media or broadcast media, in our parliamentary democracy and their capacity, through good journalism, to properly hold those to account who should be held to account, and in particular those who hold public office, in circumstances in which there are allegations justifiably made of misconduct. We have a public interest in a free press but we also have a public interest in protecting an individual&rsquo;s privacy from unnecessary intrusion in circumstances in which such intrusion is entirely unwarranted. </P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister.  I call another proposer of the Bill, Senator Feargal Quinn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Norris for introducing the Bill, it is a topic that needs exposure.  I also thank the Minister for his words and the consideration that he has given the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Thirty years ago my family went through a period where we were quite concerned about privacy.  It was at a time when two supermarket people had been kidnapped, Don Tidey and Ben Dunne, and we learned of a threat to myself and my family.  We asked the media to keep the details of our family home private and we got an immediate positive response.  There seemed to be a different attitude 30 years ago because in the past year I have witnessed Senator Norris get so frustrated at some invasions of his privacy and I realised that things have changed considerably.  Therefore, I welcome the debate on privacy because it needs consideration.  The Minister suggested that this is not the right time for the Bill but it seems the correct time for a discussion.  The question of privacy and media standards is of particular importance and the Bill attempts to close the gaps in our current system.</P>
        <P>The fundamental question is whether we should allow news organisations to publish whatever they want.  If they are limited will they survive?  In a 2008 speech by Mr. Paul Dacre, editor of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, he admitted that commercial survival was at stake.  If mass market papers are not allowed to write about scandals as well as drive public policy, he said: &ldquo;I doubt whether they will retain their mass circulations, with the obvious worrying implications for the democratic process.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Here in Ireland, the public&rsquo;s right to privacy and the right to be informed are governed by guidelines from the National Union of Journalists, the Press Council and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  They are just guidelines on ethics and morality and the way they are interpreted in a fast-paced and constantly changing news environment differs.  Some extreme cases merit attention and one that I can think of is the sudden death of Gerry Ryan, the broadcaster, in May 2010.  It was, and could be argued, public information of national importance and RTE found itself in the role of an employer and a messenger.  That was quite a dilemma for the State broadcaster.  If one argues that the public had a right to know and RTE had possession of the relevant information, more likely before anybody else other than close friends and family, then we might expect the news to be relayed almost immediately.  However, confirmation of his death was not transmitted until nearly three hours after his body was found.  RTE&rsquo;s editorial decision was to balance the public&rsquo;s right to know with the feelings of Gerry Ryan&rsquo;s wife and family who had to be made aware of his death before the general public.  The decision was made somewhat irrelevant given that a high profile RTE celebrity, Miriam O&rsquo;Callaghan, tweeted about the death of Gerry Ryan before the official RTE confirmation.  She stated: &ldquo;Tragically it is true.  So terribly shocking and sad.  Life is just too cruel sometimes.  RIP.&rdquo;  The message was instantly re-tweeted by dozens of others on the site but Ms O&rsquo;Callaghan deleted her original message after receiving a call from RTE.  Then RTE introduced Twitter guidelines for its employees to avoid a similar occurrence.  RTE&rsquo;s programme makers&rsquo; guidelines on privacy rule that there is an onus, under law, to ensure an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy and it came into play regarding Gerry Ryan.</P>
        <P>Are guidelines enough for RTE?  If we consider a recent development where Sky News told its journalists not to report information from any Twitter accounts whose owners are not employees of the organisation.  The new guidelines also warn Sky News journalists not to tweet about non-work subjects from their professional accounts.  This is an interesting development because Sky News has used Twitter to break news on events, including the Arab spring uprising and other events.  Should we allow RTE employees to use their position to impart knowledge and information that may infringe on privacy and perhaps be false?  Should they be allowed to tweet at all?  Let us consider the case of the late Brian Lenihan.   It was not right that TV3 broadcast the news of his illness but we can look back on that later.  On the subject of Twitter, we have all read about the controversy about the tweet that supposedly issued from a Sinn F&eacute;in account when Sean Gallagher was leading the presidential race.</P>
        <P>In Sweden, privacy is policed by self-regulation and newspapers that publish false stories must publish press council rulings across most of the page, which is humiliating for them.  This results in stronger privacy laws and a stronger defence of journalism in the public interest.  However, a row broke out when one newspaper published details of the suspected killer of the foreign minister in 2003.  I wonder whether the case of Sweden where a strong definition of the phrase &ldquo;public figure&rdquo; is provided for is worth following.  That is a crucial question.  One must also consider whether our privacy laws are good enough.  A significant debate is under way in the UK following the telephone hacking scandal.  The UK is examining our model of regulation under which the Press Ombudsman is recognised by the Oireachtas.  Our ombudsman, Mr. John Horgan, who is in the Visitors Gallery, describes this as &ldquo;independent regulation rather than self-regulation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We must consider the fact that our system is looked upon as a model others should follow.  Some argue our standards are too strict.  Journalists have told me about scandals that affect the public interest, which are widely known in their circles, but they do not publish them as a favour or out of fear of our libel system.  Do journalism students or practising journalists without formal training have sufficient training in the ethics of journalism?</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree.  I welcome the debate and Senator Norris&rsquo;s proposal.  I doubt the entire Bill will become law and the Minister has suggested a number of provisions that we should reconsider.  However, this is a good debate and I welcome his contribution.  It is the commencement of a debate that will be beneficial to both the privacy of individuals and journalism in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  We have not seen him for at least a fortnight and I was wondering whether he had gone missing in action.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an important element of the ongoing debate on the question of privacy and media standards.  I hope, at the conclusion of the debate, we will reach a consensus to allow work to continue and to allow the Senator&rsquo;s work, previous work in this area and the Minister&rsquo;s current thinking to bring the matter to effective and useful fruition.</P>
        <P>The walls of the self-service restaurant are decorated with front pages of old newspapers.  One is from <i>The Irish Times</i> in 1932 and it gives the visual and factual account of the election of Mr. &Eacute;amon de Valera as Taoiseach and, I suppose to give balance, there is an <i>Irish Independent</i> front page from 1948 recounting the election of Mr. John A. Costello as Taoiseach.  The pages are full of fact, not opinion.  They give a factual description of what happened on the day, who voted for whom, the biographies of both men and from where they came politically and philosophically.  They are faithful records of what happened the previous day.</P>
        <P>While we expect the public to be cynical and doubtful about what they read in particular newspapers, as politicians, we believe nothing of what we read.  It has, sadly, reached that stage.  In the 1930s and 1940s, newspapers reported fact but nowadays, as far as most of us are concerned, they mostly report speculation and opinion rather than news.  That is the difficulty facing the Minister, his ministerial colleagues and his advisers as he tries to put in place appropriate legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have moved on from the Ireland of silence and squinting windows and we have all the capability now of modern media and the problems that come with them.  That is why the Minister&rsquo;s task is so difficult in balancing rights and responsibilities as far as the media are concerned.  He summed up the political difficulty when he stated, &ldquo;We are debating what some would see as legislation which might bring about certain restrictions&rdquo;.  The D&aacute;il is debating the Mahon report and we may have to revisit other tribunal reports.  However, many of the tribunals would have been unnecessary and, more important, many of the problems that were investigated may not have emerged and the actions that led to them may not have happened if certain politicians had feared their activities or lack of action could have been highlighted and reported on in the national media.  The Minister must strike a balance between freedom of speech and expression and the right to appropriate privacy.  I do not envy his task but a substantial body of work is available to assist him. He referred to the 2006 Bill and the Bill tabled by Senator Norris and his colleague adds to this. Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has formally declared his opposition to the Bill, he will give it fair and due consideration. There is public demand for higher standards not only in politics and public life but also in the media, particularly in the context of taking responsibility. </P>
        
        <P>As was stated by previous speakers, most newspaper articles are opinion pieces and do not report what happened the previous day.  They are often ideologically driven, with which I have no problem, but newspaper reporting is much different now from 30 or 40 years ago and that makes the Minister&rsquo;s task more difficult.  We must seek balance.  He mentioned that one of his predecessors, the late Brian Lenihan, proposed a two-year window before he would act further on privacy legislation.  This window has passed but we have a new Minister and a new Government and it is only fair they would have time to reflect.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to recent presidential election and &ldquo;tweetgate&rdquo;.   The possibility that the outcome of an election to one of the highest offices of the State may have been adversely affected by such an intervention is a matter of serious and grave concern.</P>

	<P>I do not disagree with the Senator&rsquo;s intervention.  We must avoid these incidents and provide against them.  I look forward to the Minister working with all of us to bring about legislation that will work and that will provide the standards we require.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Norris on introducing the Bill, which seeks to implement a commitment of both the previous and current Governments.  I thank the Minister, who is not shy about attending the House, for his excellent and detailed contribution on this issue.  Senator Norris&rsquo;s contribution was so good and the Minister&rsquo;s response so positive, yet cautious, that there must be a strong argument for the acceptance of the Bill and revisiting it on Committee Stage in due course.  That should not be done in a rush or a panic; it should be done in consultation with the various parties concerned.  While supporting the Bill and acknowledging the role and importance of the media, I also recognise this is a significant industry providing jobs and economic opportunities.  That has to be remembered in the debate as part of the balancing act.  </P>
        <P>The reference to the Mahon and Moriarty tribunal reports is important.  The media should have nothing to fear from a privacy Bill if the transparency envisaged in the legislation before us and in the Mahon tribunal report is provided for.  A privacy law would be very safe from their point of view because as long as we are transparent as politicians about what we need, what we do in the rest of our lives can be private.</P>
        <P>There have not been widespread breaches of privacy.  There are examples which are very difficult for the people concerned, but prurient intervention in people&rsquo;s lives is not a common feature of the Irish media.  I have heard journalists talk about stories they will not publish because there is no public interest in them.  Such stories might be of interest, but they do not affect decision-making or standards of probity, rather they involve the personal fallibility of people.  There is a sense that there are certain things the media will not publish.</P>
        <P>Celebrities seem to be fair game and privacy is important for them.  Nevertheless, this has to be balanced against the activities recorded in some of the various super injunction cases taken.  Football players were portraying themselves as eminent family men and making a living from promoting family-based products, while acting completely differently.  Such persons do not deserve a right to privacy.</P>
        <P>The right to privacy has an important history in constitutional law.  It was invoked in America in the Griswold case on contraception.  The Minister referred to the McGee case in Ireland.  Many of the old restrictions on how the State interacted with the public were lifted following the establishment of a right to privacy in the Constitution.  It is right we then move to protect people&rsquo;s privacy from unnecessary intrusion, particularly but not exclusively by the media.</P>
        <P>There is a very strong Defamation Act in place for the media.  It has been strangled somewhat because some of the legal advice received by many newspapers is extremely restrictive and based on old thinking rather than the changes introduced in the recent Act.  There was meant to be a <i>quid pro quo</i> in liberalising the law on defamation or expanding the defences available to the effect that a privacy Bill would be introduced.  That has not yet happened, which is regrettable.</P>
        <P>We stand for a free media, but people are entitled to live their lives within the law as they see fit.  I repeat my call to the Minister that, if Senator David Norris agrees, the Bill be accepted on Second Stage and that after a considerable period of reflection, the Government come back with proposals.  The general principles of the Bill should be passed.  The Minister has justly raised various points which do not go against the principles of the Bill but call for a substantial and detailed debate on Committee Stage.  The adoption of such an approach might be appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to debate the Bill.  I commend Senator David Norris for taking the initiative and reintroducing a privacy Bill to the House.  The 2006 Bill is on the Order Paper having been reintroduced by the Minister in June 2011.  I pay particular tribute to the Senator who in litigation has done a good deal to give force and meaning to the privacy provisions in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is important to note this point.</P>
        <P>There is a good deal of consensus on the Bill.  It appears there is agreement on the need for a statutory framework to balance the competing interests of the public&rsquo;s right to know and an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy.  Whether the Bill, in its current format, is appropriate is an open question, as the Senator would probably acknowledge.  His Bill has been closely modelled on the 2006 Bill, but he has introduced a number of changes, including one which is appropriate, namely, that a defendant be ordered to publish an apology.  A good deal more could be done to improve the 2006 Bill, as there have been a lot of changes since it was published which, as the Minister said, will have to be incorporated in any new legislation introduced.</P>
        <P>We have gained a more nuanced understanding of how conflicting rights can be balanced.  Through the Defamation Act 2010 and the establishment of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council of Ireland we have a panoply of new protections for the privacy of individuals, the public&rsquo;s right to know and the right of freedom of expression.  I acknowledge the presence of Professor John Horgan, the distinguished Press Ombudsman.  The changes made to the balance of interests as a result of the introduction of the new framework need to be considered and reviewed in the course of redrafting the privacy Bill.</P>
        <P>The position on a good number of political issues has changed.  The Minister has referred to the emergence of new technologies which will have to be taken into account in any redrafting.  As Senator David Norris said so eloquently, we have seen appalling revelations about tabloid newspapers and the invasion of the privacy of individuals in Britain, a matter which is under investigation in the Leveson inquiry.  We have not only had an investigation in the case of Fr. Kevin Reynolds which has been mentioned but also the recent revelations in the Mahon tribunal report.  There was concern that there was an excessive fear among journalists about the law at the time in curbing the freedom to investigate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They did nothing.  It was done by Michael Smith and Colm Mac Eochaidh.  There was no investigative journalism in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was just about to say that.  The Senator has highlighted the fact that my good friends and colleagues, Colm Mac Eoichaidh and Michael Smith, did the public interest a great service and in moving outside the jurisdiction of the State which they felt they had to do to prompt what ultimately transpired in the Mahon tribunal investigations.  Clearly, there was a problem with investigative journalism.  The Minister has said, rightly, that there is enormous public interest in ensuring freedom of the press and having healthy investigative journalism to hold public figures to account.  All of these considerations will have to be taken into account.  When one bears this in mind, as well as the provisions in the original and 2006 Bills, not to mention the Senator&rsquo;s Bill, one realises a good number of changes will have to be made in any new Bill introduced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have to be conscious of the need to balance more clearly the public interest.  I am conscious that we have all been provided with the commentary of the National Union of Journalists by Mr. Seamus Dooley who has clearly said the media were inhibited by the law on defamation in investigating corruption in the past, a clear position taken by the NUJ.  While I am not sure I agree with his conclusion that there is no need for a privacy Bill, the analysis by Ms Andrea Martin, a respected legal expert in this area, which he provided us with is a very helpful appraisal and critique of the 2006 Bill.  She is right in saying the uncertainty surrounding the parameters of the actionable tort of privacy would not be clarified by the provisions included in the Bill.  She also says the terminology used is unhelpful and terms such as &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; are not in the defined in the Bill but should be.  Instead, as Professor Horgan has pointed out, we have a definition of &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; in the preamble to the code of practice drawn up by the Press Council of Ireland.  There is no equivalent definition in the Bill, as drafted.  Phrases which are used which do not have provenance in Irish or ECHR law include &ldquo;news gathering&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Ms Martin has made a number of pertinent and reasonable points in highlighting flaws in the Bill.  She concludes that it has the potential to inhibit legitimate journalistic investigations and the exercise of freedom of expression and that there are concerns about issues such as the hearing of actions other than in public.  One can go through the Bill in a piecemeal fashion but the overarching principle is the need for a review of the mechanisms in place, to ascertain how the Defamation Act has worked in practice and, in particular, how the Press Council of Ireland and the ombudsman are operating to protect the privacy of individuals while safeguarding legitimate freedom of expression.  It is worth noting the Press Council upheld a complaint by a Minister against a newspaper which had called her a liar.  It is also worth noting that the former chair of the Press Council said the best balance might be through the combination of the civil court powers on defamation cases and the ombudsman and council framework.  There is a need to review the machinery to ascertain whether a statutory framework is required, which it probably is.  On balance I would be in favour of a Bill but not this one and not in this format.  However, I welcome Senator Norris&rsquo;s initiative as it is helpful to debate the issue.  I hope we can move forward, leaving the Bill on the Order Paper, and conduct the review described by the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank Senator Norris and those who proposed the Bill.  I apologise to the Minister for not being in the House for his contribution as I had meeting but I will commit to reading his contribution.  Given what previous speakers have said it was a significant and important contribution in the context of the Bill.  I understand Senator Norris will not push the Bill to a vote which gives us an opportunity to discuss the issue at a later stage.</P>
        <P>In any democracy it is difficult to strike a balance between competing rights.  For example, the right to private property can often conflict with the public good.  The building of an infrastructure where a person&rsquo;s property rights are set against the public good in terms of the need for the infrastructure to be built.  It is important to strike an appropriate balance and in most instances we do.  Likewise, the right of the public to be informed of matters of public concern can come into conflict with the rights of individual citizens to privacy.  It is important to look at best practice and jurisprudence across Europe and in countries outside Europe.  One has only to look at what happened in the UK.  We had a debate on standards in the media recently.  It is clear the <i>News of the World</i>  crossed a line in regard to the invasion of privacy into people&rsquo;s affairs whether celebrities, politicians or whoever.  There was no conflict in that case, it was a clear breach of the privacy of those individuals.</P>
        <P>I consider the Bill useful in shaping a debate.  It clarifies and bolsters the law in this area and potentially allows us to strike a greater balance between the two competing but essential rights &mdash; the right to public concern and the right of the public to have information and privacy.  If the Bill is pursued there may be a need for a number of amendments to ensure the place of investigative journalism is protected.  I am concerned at the use of pre-emptive injunctions.  I am aware of the exception provided for in the Bill for investigative journalism among a number of other defences, which is to protect this crucial function.  However, I am not convinced that the exception adequately safeguards that right but I am open to persuasion.  If the Minister has not referred to the issue perhaps he will do so in his reply.</P>
        <P>I wish to look briefly at the law governing the right to privacy.  I understand there is a common law, a tort of invasion of privacy.  The Bill would, effectively, put that on a statutory basis.  There is also a right to privacy under the Constitution and in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which provides individuals with the right to privacy which is balanced against the right to free expression.  While Kennedy and Ireland <i>v. </i>the Attorney General and Hanahoe <i>v.</i> Hussey are a good guide to the law on the right to privacy, as enforced against the State, I understand there are no decided Irish privacy cases involving non-State bodies such as the media.  Recent European jurisprudence was seen to be hostile to the intrusion of the media into the private lives of public figures in cases where there is no overriding pubic interest.  This is positive and arises from those breaches of privacy and where certain media outlets crossed the line we would all oppose that robustly.  It is important that is set in the context of the issue being debated.</P>
        <P>The most prominent European Court of Human Rights case is von Hannover <i>v. </i>Germany which involved Princess Caroline of Monaco while the British case Campbell <i>v. </i>MGN involved the supermodel Naomi Campbell.  Campbell is also of interest because the House of Lords held that the established right of breach of confidence extended to protecting &ldquo;right to respect for private life&rdquo; without there being a need for a confidential relationship between the newspaper and Ms Campbell.</P>
        <P>The most recent Irish case, the Gray case, seems to indicate that one can be guilty of invasion of privacy by way of negligence rather than previously where the intention had to be deliberate or involve bad fate.  The law on privacy, in terms of individuals&rsquo; ability to pursue the media, has been described as being in its infancy.  Therefore, useful and relatively comprehensive legislation, such as this, which can be built on if the Minister so desires, with the support of political parties, would be a valuable way of advancing the law in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mention briefly an example of the danger of inadequate right to privacy.   In November 2010 the annual report of the judge who oversees the data retention system of the Garda confirmed reports that a sergeant who then worked in the Garda intelligence division had abused her position by accessing the telephone records of her former boyfriend, tracking details of his communications.  That garda is still a serving member of the force.  It is important that those who are there to uphold the law do so.</P>
        <P>I apologise for not being in the House for the Minister&rsquo;s contribution.  It is important when we make contributions that we listen to what the Minister has to say.  I will read his contribution.  I hope we return to the issue at some future date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Catherine Noone is anxious to make a few comments I will facilitate her.</P>
        <P>Some of the issues I wished to raise have been discussed.  I commend Senator Norris for tabling the Bill which is necessary.  We do need privacy legislation but it must be the right legislation and that will take time.  Having listened to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution, which was one of the most comprehensive I have heard on Private Members&rsquo; business since becoming a Member, he is genuinely committed to getting it right, and as Senator Cullinane said, getting the balance right can be difficult.  One has to try to balance freedom of speech, empowering people to investigate and at the same time ensure peoples&rsquo; human rights are protected.  There is also the evolving media of the past five to ten years &mdash; Facebook, Twitter, the Internet, live news sites, text messages &mdash; which has added an uncontrollable dimension to the whole notion of media.  Media is a broad church which will include social media.  There has been some case law in the area of social media in the recent past.  There is a need to get the legislation right and Senator Norris would want us as a combined body to get it right.  That is the reason I take hope and encouragement from the Minister&rsquo;s contribution.  The matter is a priority for the Government and the House.  I am disappointed at the low level of attendance given that during the Order of Business when the Fr. Kevin Reynolds case, Twitter and so on were raised, Members were very anxious to have a debate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator and Senator Norris for tabling the Bill.  I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his work.  As there is much to be considered in the Bill I do not want to repeat what other speakers have said.  As Senator Conway has said, Twitter and Facebook make the area much more difficult to regulate.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reference to the potential for <i>in camera</i> hearings in privacy cases.  In many instances, when one has to go to court to vindicate one&rsquo;s reputation, the issue involved is highlighted more than it was in the first place.  It is also welcome that we will have an opportunity to digest the outcome of the Leveson inquiry, which could be of use to the Government in drafting legislation.  The Minister clearly needs more time to review the Bill.  I welcome the debate and look forward to reviewing privacy legislation in the not too distant future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his advisers for the careful, reasoned and balanced approach they have taken to the Bill, which I find heartening.  They noticed the tweaking I had done, but I accept more needs to be done.  Obviously, people who take street photographs as an art form should not be excluded.  The Minister stated, &ldquo;...there is no substantial evidence that the indefensible excesses of the British tabloid media have been applied to prey on individuals in this state.&rdquo;  However, there is such evidence which I undertake in the next few months to provide for the Minister directly, I hope with confidence, in order that he can consider it at his leisure.</P>
        <P>The preamble to the Press Ombudsman&rsquo;s code of practice refers to the right of a newspaper to publish what it considers to be news.  I find this laughable and offensive.  The highest figure for truth and accuracy was 116 in the most recently published figures and the second, at 90, was for the invasion of privacy.  The Minister may have more recent figures, but they have not yet been published.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Press Council in Britain, Lady Buscombe said she had found it impossible to control the newspapers, that she had struggled to be independent of the industry and that she had failed.  The central theme in the submissions to the Leveson inquiry is that there was a cavalier disregard for solid, old-fashioned journalistic virtues such as engaging in methodical analysis and research and producing solid evidence.  The same might well be said in Ireland but for different reasons.  A culture has developed here in which there is scant regard for privacy or principle, deep research or time consuming trawls for evidence.  The media have moved well beyond reportage and are engaged in news making.  I refer to the case of the Polish woman who asked, &ldquo;How is it possible for anyone to publish something that is just not true, completely not true?  It is just misinterpretation or mistranslation.  It is just a completely different story.&rdquo;  There was also the case of <i>The Star on Sunday</i> publishing a photograph related to a case being heard <i>in camera</i> .  In another the name, address and occupation of a witness were published.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 113, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration,&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to state how pleased I am the Bill will finish its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the Seanad, where it was initiated.  I pay tribute to Senator Ivana Bacik&rsquo;s work on this area.  The Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill was examined on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 9 February.  At that juncture, as Senators might be aware, I introduced two amendments to the Bill.  The first was a technical amendment to update section 14 of the Bill following the enactment of the Biological Weapons Act 2011 last July. Section 14 amends the Schedule to the Bail Act 1997. The Schedule lists the offences defined as serious offences. Section 2 of the Bail Act provides for the circumstances in which bail may be refused for such offences. As a result of this amendment, the offences in the Bill related to sections 2 to 4, inclusive, will be added to the bail Schedule. </P>
        
        <P>The second amendment was recommended by the Parliamentary Counsel to make specific provisions for the commencement of the Bill by way of ministerial order.  These provisions are desirable to clarify that the Bill is not retrospective and to ensure nobody is charged under the Act until it is published in both official languages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his kind comments on the Bill.  It is almost two years since I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in the House to prohibit female genital mutilation.  I was delighted when the then Government took it up as a Government Bill and the current Government committed to introducing it.  I thank the Minister for his personal interest and steering of the Bill through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  The fact it has taken two years may be due to the fact that a Government fell in the meantime and we entered an IMF programme.  There are many reasons for the delay.  I am glad the Bill will pass.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I pay tribute to AkiDwA, the organisation represented in the Visitors Gallery, which has done a great deal of work on this issue in Ireland.  In respect of the two amendments made in the D&aacute;il, other amendments were mooted and discussed.  We also fully discussed them in the Seanad.  Perhaps they will be made by way of other legislation in the future.</P>
        <P>I was concerned about dual criminality, namely, that the Bill would have allowed prosecution for an offence where a person here took a girl or woman abroad to have female genital mutilation performed in a country where it was not an offence.  We received the advice of the Attorney General and were told it would not be possible to remove the provision and that the act must also constitute an offence in the place where it is done.  It is a minor point which it would have been good to see addressed by way of amendment.  Work is ongoing on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amnesty International also raised issues about definitions in the Bill.  Those issues were fully debated in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  The amendments made in the D&aacute;il and which we are agreeing today are technical and I support them.</P>

	<P>I have one or two comments. I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for introducing the Bill.  I thank Senator Bacik for taking the initiative two years ago.  When the matter was last before the House I said I had raised the matter as far back as 1992 with Members of the Oireachtas because there was a huge influx of women from Somalia to England at the time.  A medical professor in England raised the issue. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of dual criminality was debated on Committee Stage in the Seanad and an explanation has been given on section 4.  It is not possible under Irish legislation, which is different from UK legislation, to bring a prosecution.  I welcome the fact we are coming to the final stage of the Bill.  It is long overdue.  Over 3,000 women living in the country have, unfortunately, gone through the procedure.  It is important there is legislation to deal with the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted the Bill will be successfully passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ireland will shortly join an ever expanding list of nations which have made a forceful and explicit statement of their unwillingness to tolerate this human rights violation.  </P>
        <P>We know from talking to NGOs and public health services that summer is the time when girls are most at risk of being victims of female genital mutilation with families travelling to practising countries during the school holidays.  Therefore, it is my intention that a commencement order be issued before the summer.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that Ireland is in the fortunate position of being able to take a proactive approach to the prevention of female genital mutilation.  We have the opportunity and duty to protect women and children from practising communities currently living in Ireland from undergoing this procedure.  While legislation alone is never sufficient to tackle the problem of this gravity, the enactment of a Bill specifically prohibiting female genital mutilation and including extraterritorial provisions will be a vital step in preventing female genital mutilation taking hold in this country.</P>
        <P>The Bill, when enacted, will act as a powerful deterrent and also potentially empower practising communities living in Ireland to resist pressure from their country of origin to preserve this custom.  It is hoped it will enlighten their home communities where the practice still takes place.</P>
        <P>I extend my gratitude to Senator Ivana Bacik for raising the issue in the Seanad, encouraging the Government of the day to commence preparation of the Bill and giving the current Bill her continued support during its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I acknowledge the support and encouragement given by AkiDwA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his kind words and all colleagues in the House for their support before and since the last election.  It is good to see the Bill receive cross-party support.  As Senator White said, it is a sign of what the Seanad can do in terms of initiating legislation on areas which have not been dealt with in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Most importantly, as the Minister said, this legislation should have a powerful deterrent effect and will form part of a public advocacy campaign for those women and girls living in Ireland who are at risk of undergoing female genital mutilation.  Senator Colm Burke referred to AkiDwA&rsquo;s estimate that more than 3,000 women and girls living in the State have been subjected to FGM.  That is an extraordinarily high figure.  For the 10,000 women and girls from FGM-practising communities living in this country, our objective in this legislation is to ensure this barbaric practice is not carried out on any of them in the future.  The Bill&rsquo;s commencement before the summer is particularly welcome in light of reports that girls are most at risk of being taken abroad during the summer.  It is vital that anybody resident in Ireland is aware that taking a girl abroad for the purposes of having FGM performed on her or subjecting her to the procedure in this country is a prosecutable offence.  That is the great strength of the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take the opportunity to pay tribute once again to all of the organisations, including AkiDwA, which have worked so hard on this issue for many years.  I pay particular tribute to the departmental officials sitting behind the Minister for their work in preparing the legislation.  I also thank the Minister for his kind words, hard work and personal commitment to this matter.</P>

I was happy to take up this job at a time of great flux within our society generally and in the housing sector in particular.  We live in a time of great uncertainty and one of our greatest challenges is to bring back stability to a battered and bruised economy.  There can be no doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind that the &ldquo;irrational exuberance&rdquo; in the property market, to borrow a phrase, was the main culprit in the now sorry tale of the Celtic tiger years.  Such exuberance was encouraged by the previous Administration, which became drunk on the heady income stream the boom generated.  The party is over and my colleagues and I must clean up the mess left from the party that has left us all with the mother of all hangovers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I need not remind Members of the turmoil in which the State was embroiled last spring, nor of the painful sacrifices the people have borne with fortitude in the interim.  The disaster zone the Government inherited in the housing area meant that new ideas and fresh thinking were absolutely essential and the delivery of a radical new policy framework sooner rather than later was needed urgently.  The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement was published just three months after taking office and it has been diligent in ensuring the initiatives outlined have been actioned with all possible speed.  This new housing policy statement responds to current and emerging conditions in the housing sector, taking account of the dramatic cycle of rapid growth and sudden collapse in the residential property market.  The centrepiece of the approach is to chart a way forward for housing policy in Ireland by placing greater emphasis on choice, equity across housing tenures and the delivery of quality outcomes for the resources invested.</P>
        <P>The recently burst property bubble was driven by low interest rates, easy access to money, loose regulation and a construction sector that failed to gauge the capacity for demand.  Irish people have long aspired to owning their own homes and I consider this ambition admirable but only where the circumstances of the borrower allow it.  The State is far from blameless in this regard.  Responding to this ethos of home ownership, successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have overly-incentivised acquisition.  Since I was elected to the D&aacute;il in 1998, I have sat through many Budget Statements in which various incentives were announced for the purchasing of houses and other property.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>To be fair in this regard, the most recent budget also contained such incentives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>This led to the point at which the super-heated market went into meltdown so spectacularly.  The differential between borrowing and rental costs was too narrow and led to the &ldquo;dead money&rdquo; syndrome that nurtured the desire to acquire.</P>
        <P>In order to recalibrate this ownership culture, it is essential to ensure that a fully functional, properly regulated and vibrant rental sector is introduced.  The establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, was the first step in ensuring that security of tenure was safeguarded and appropriate accommodation standards were maintained.  It is essential to strengthen further the remit of the PRTB by bringing the voluntary and co-operative sector under its influence and by protecting the rights of both tenant and landlord alike.  A cultural shift away from ownership to a greater reliance on the private rental sector will only take place if a market is created that is transparent, equitable and affordable.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government commits the Government to addressing the issue of deposit retention and the Bill will introduce a system of fines for unjustified retention by landlords.  While the introduction of automatic penalties will seriously reduce the incidence of deposit retention difficulties, a more substantial deposit retention scheme might also be necessary.  The programme for Government has made a commitment in this regard and I already have indicated to the Government that I intend to return to it with my recommendations on this topic in 2012, pending research by the PRTB.</P>
        <P>The economic crisis has resulted in increasing strains being applied to the social housing area.  The Government finds itself with escalating housing lists as more people find themselves in financial distress.  The challenges facing the Government are immense and when coupled with the need to curb State spending, have confronted it with a major task.  Local authorities traditionally have provided social housing by means of build or acquisition.  Such capital-intensive programmes will not be possible in the future, certainly to the extent they have been in the past, and the shift to more flexible and immediate solutions will play an increasingly important role.  In the past number of years the leasing and rental accommodation schemes have contributed considerably to servicing an ever demanding sector.  The widened deployment of these tools in the coming years will allow for housing provision in a more direct, cost-efficient and speedy manner, while simultaneously absorbing the current overhang in the housing sector.</P>
        <P>Transferring responsibility for long-term rent supplement recipients to local government will, together with the move towards greater tenure neutrality, be seen as the most significant and radical of the reforms contained in our policy statement.  The programme for Government commits the Administration to reviewing the operation of the rent supplement scheme and to better aligning rent supplement and social housing support via an interagency working group.  Originally intended as short-term income support for households, rent supplement became a long-term housing mechanism.  This resulted in employment traps, weak regulation of the supported private rented market and a fragmentation of social housing services.  The new policy direction will see the transfer of responsibility for rent supplement households with a long-term housing need to local authorities.  Rent supplement will continue to be paid as a short-term income support, as originally intended.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and I brought a joint memorandum on this issue to the Cabinet yesterday.  We intend to begin to introduce the scheme from the beginning of January 2013.  In the meantime, we have quite a lot of work to do regarding the mechanism of transferring rent supplement to the local authorities.  For those households in need, the proposed arrangements would provide a new form of social housing support while renting in the private market.  The details of the new scheme are being worked out at present and the objectives will be to encourage recipients to take up full-time work, to facilitate better regulation of the private rented sector and to provide a more integrated service for households seeking State support to meet housing costs.</P>
        <P>Future social housing provision will see a greater reliance on the voluntary and co-operative sector.  Already these bodies have built up considerable expertise and credibility and demonstrated an ability to manage housing in a cost-efficient and effective manner.  The move from a capital-funded model to revenue-based tools will enhance their ability to service this sector.  A robust regulatory framework will be necessary for the expanded role of these bodies, using a collaborative approach between the sector and my Department to deliver a clearly defined set of standards which will ensure the orderly evolution of this sector.  The interim voluntary code of conduct will provide transparency in assessing the credibility of individual bodies from many aspects, including funding.  I have met representatives of a number of the housing associations to discuss such issues.</P>
        <P>Allowing the voluntary and co-operative sector access to finance, both from commercial institutions and from the Housing Finance Agency, will allow them to become more pivotal providers in the social housing sphere.  This will allow them to capitalise on the current overhang in the construction sector, acquiring units at a premium while contributing to absorption of the surplus.  Last year we saw the initial acquisition of property by Cluid from NAMA, and I anticipate more, allowing it to mine the social dividend of the housing surplus while allowing NAMA to fulfil its commercial objectives.  These new ventures also induce the development of mixed tenure communities, with a blend of social allocations and private disposals.  The eventual sales to social tenants under various purchase schemes, in time, might allow for further pathways to ownership.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is acutely conscious of mortgage arrears problems.  Where any borrower is experiencing distress, he or she should engage with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.  The services of the money advice and budgeting service is available to such borrowers and support is available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Provisions regarding lending by local authorities for the purposes of house purchase are set out in section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  Where a loan stands in default, section 11(10) provides that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as it considers equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department issued comprehensive guidance in 2010 to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears, including loans for shared ownership transactions, closely based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s first statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which ensures local authority mortgage arrears are handled sympathetically while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised code of conduct, effective from 1 January 2011, my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association, and publication of this manual is imminent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The well documented and grave problems in the commercial sector prompted the setting up of the interdepartmental group on mortgage arrears.  One of the key recommendations was the establishment of two mortgage-to-rent schemes, wherein distressed borrowers undertook to surrender their homes to the lending institution and thereafter lease them back from either the bank or a voluntary housing body who would purchase the property.  Officials from my Department and the other stakeholders have devised and recently initiated pilot projects in this regard.  Once we have assessed the efficacy and scope of these schemes we hope they will be rolled out more extensively.  This relates to the specific measure our Department is delivering arising from the Keane report, but there is more cross-government action in this regard, particularly with action from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Finance on distressed mortgages in general.</P>
        <P>When this Administration came to power, we were acutely aware of the problems presented by the plethora of unfinished estates nationally.  We resolved to tackle the issues head on and to put the residents of these developments at the heart of all of our actions.  On the recommendation of the advisory group on unfinished housing developments, we immediately set up the national co-ordination committee on unfinished estates to drive the proposed resolution agenda.  By including representatives from the local authorities, Irish Banking Federation, construction industry, NAMA, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency and the residents, we harnessed the goodwill, expertise and commitment of these entities to the job in hand.</P>
        <P>The national co-ordination committee produced a code of practice for stakeholders, which defined the rights, responsibilities and interrelationships of the key parties involved.  It also devised a guide for residents living in unfinished housing developments which outlined the possible steps to empower themselves and take a central role in pushing the resolution agenda.  Perhaps the most pressing concern for us as an Administration was the public safety aspects of unfinished developments where the responsible party could not be held accountable in the short term.  We made &euro;5 million available to local authorities to assess and make safe those elements which posed a safety hazard to members of the public.  To date, we have identified 166 such estates and have expended &euro;1.48 million on this programme.  We expect to pay out an additional &euro;2 million for works which are currently being completed in this regard.</P>
        <P>As evidence of my ongoing commitment, I have also set up a legislative review group to explore existing legislation and identify areas where it may need to be amended or strengthened.  Additionally, we are developing and deploying a standardised site resolution plan to identify the necessary remedial works in problem estates.  I am sure Senators are well aware of the problems of unfinished estates in the country and we must ensure we continue to respond to those problems and have proper site resolution plans to address the problems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the midst of a period of extreme turbulence and working within the financial constraints placed upon us, my officials and I have applied our best efforts to ensure the maximum possible outcomes are achieved for the least possible expenditure.  That is what we must do across the board in these times.  We will continue to devise imaginative and effective policies as we face unparalleled challenges.  The indomitable spirit of our people historically responds well under these pressures and, in the same spirit of resilience, I have had to review housing policies and react to the changing landscape which our straitened circumstances have imposed upon us.  We are not the font of all wisdom and I welcome suggestions Senators have on how to address the problems we face as a nation, especially in the housing area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, to the House and wish her well in her role at the Cabinet table.  I take the opportunity to pay tribute to Deputy Willie Penrose, whom she succeeded in the Department, and commend him for the excellent work he carried out when he was part of the Department.  It is ironic that on the day the Army barracks closes in Mullingar, the issue that caused him to resign his office, we are again discussing housing difficulties under various headings in the Seanad.  I commend the former Minister of State as he listened to what was said in this House by those on all sides and acted within days on one matter, a debate we had regarding unfinished housing estates.  Various proposals were made to the Minister of State, with one being to contact NAMA to try to get money for the estates for which that body was responsible.  Within ten days of being in the House, that was done by him.  Deputy Penrose was very positive with every opportunity he had to come to the House.  He did not dwell on the past but dealt with the present and future, which is how we should move forward.</P>
        <P>I will briefly discuss unfinished housing estates, which is a human tragedy for many families.  There are families and children living in these unfinished or so-called ghost estates with no lighting, manhole covers or footpaths, or where the roads are potholed or unfinished.  They are a few of the difficulties.  In my own county there were 38 unfinished housing estates identified by Cavan County Council but what criteria was used to determine what is unfinished?  My understanding is that where there were two or three unfinished houses, even in rural Ireland, the estate would be regarded as unfinished.</P>
        <P>A detailed survey was carried out in late 2010, with 2,846 housing developments surveyed, and an advisory group was established to bring forward recommendations on unfinished estates.  That group reported to the then Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, in June 2011.  I understand the survey shows 1,655 estates where a substantial amount of work remains.  The Minister of State indicated that &euro;1.4 million of the &euro;5 million allocation has been drawn down and she expects a further &euro;2 million to be drawn down this year.  Given the number of housing estates involved &mdash; 1,655 &mdash; the &euro;5 million allocation amounts to only &euro;3,200 per estate, which is an inadequate sum.  Does the Minister of State envisage the allocation being increased?</P>
        <P>In County Cavan, 12 estates were identified which need urgent repair.  To date, Cavan County Council has received little money from the Department for this purpose.  I ask the Minister of State to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate her on her appointment.  I wish to be associated with the sentiments expressed by Senator Wilson about Deputy Penrose.  I thank the Minister of State for her contribution which was mainly constructive.  We will allow her away with the non-constructive parts as having a cut is part of politics.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister of State referred to mortgage arrears in respect of social and local authority housing, as it is a matter I have raised in the House.  While I am aware she has been in the Department for only a short period, since the revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears was published on 1 January 2011, the Department has not yet published guidelines for local authorities.  The evidence available to me from my county of Fingal is that local authorities are finding it extremely difficult to deal with affordable and shared ownership housing.  I would welcome a timeline setting out when the new code of conduct will be issued to the local authorities.  How will the code be monitored?  If a Senator or Deputy has information on cases where individuals believe local authorities are being reasonable, what can we do?  While I know local authorities have a job to do, I have found that some of them have been inflexible on this matter.  Why are we still waiting for a code of conduct to be issued to local authorities more than a year after the publication of a revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears?</P>
        <P>I have a particular interest in unfinished housing estates which are a scourge affecting every county.  The Department, through the local authorities, issued a list of housing estates exempted from the household tax, which is an issue on which I do not propose to dwell, that appears to feature several anomalies.  I have documentary evidence of an unfinished estate, namely, Waterside on the Swords Road in Malahide, that does not appear on the list whereas other estates in the county are included in the list.  Is it possible to submit to the Department details of such estates to have them exempted from the household tax?  When a local authority deems that an estate is not unfinished, how can Deputies, Senators, councillors or, most important, residents interact with the Department to have the matter addressed?  Given that the list produced by the Department is not comprehensive, public representatives could be of assistance in this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would welcome an extension of the remit of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, which was established by the previous Government to provide important protection for tenants and landlords alike.  The role of the board should be extended to include residences covered by the shared ownership scheme.  From my dealings with the PRTB, it appears to be seriously understaffed.  For example, the timeframe for dealing with a complaint runs into months, if not years.  Given that private tenants are generally on 12 month leases, time is of the essence when complaints are made.  Does the Minister of State have plans to address this issue?</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in her important portfolio.  As she stated, no one has the answers to all of our problems.  I would like to know how public representatives and members of the public can submit suggestions.  Public representatives have received many complaints about the code of conduct on unfinished estates.  Should complaints be submitted to local authorities or to the Department?  I will provide information on specific estates that were not included in the Department&rsquo;s list of unfinished estates at the end of the debate.</P>
        <P>While the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will support the Minister of State in her endeavours, as Senator Wilson noted, she will require more funding.  This may not be easy to secure but we must bear in mind the awful tragedy that took place in the midlands only a few weeks ago and a serious accident that occurred recently in my own area.  We are all on the same page on this issue because we all want to resolve the problem of unfinished estates.  I urge the Minister of State to push the Department to ensure local authorities are fair to those who are in mortgage arrears.  Will she indicate when the Department will issue updated guidelines to local authorities for people who are in mortgage difficulties?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend her for the proactive steps she has taken to deal with the difficult problems arising from the housing crisis.  I also commend her predecessor, Deputy Willie Penrose.  As the Minister of State outlined, a number of pragmatic measures have been undertaken in the past year to try to deal with the various housing issues we face.  In this regard, the Government has stepped up to the plate, which was bare, and taken some action on the mortgage crisis.  As I noted, this is a difficult problem because we have been left with a legacy from a period of &ldquo;irrational exuberance&rdquo;, as the Minister of State described it, and the boomtime excesses overseen by our predecessors.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government should be commended for publishing a housing policy statement within three months.  The Keane report, which was published by the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears established by the Government in October last year, is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s continuing effort to tackle the mortgage crisis.  The issue cannot be resolved in one day.  The report sets out important measures that address the problem of mortgage difficulty.  Work is under way to implement key elements of the report, including the reform of personal insolvency legislation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">There is no question that many people are still in great distress as they seek to meet mortgage repayments.  The Government is determined to help any person who finds himself or herself in such circumstances.  Its priority, as the Minister of State outlined, is to develop and implement schemes to assist those who cannot make their mortgage repayments.  The Keane report, which was commissioned by the Government, sets out ten measures to help people.  The new schemes facilitate the reduction of the debt burden to be reduced.  A large-scale blanket debt forgiveness programme is not the solution to the problem as the taxpayer would have to pick up a bill of &euro;15 billion.  I presume no one wants this outcome when higher taxes are already a reality and there is nothing to be gained from increasing taxes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately , there is no quick fix to the mortgage crisis.  The damage caused by years of reckless policies &mdash; I am not ashamed to say it &mdash; and the creation of a false property bubble by Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments will not be magically undone.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Keane should stick to her script.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>The solution must be a long-term one.  As I indicated, I am speaking to the future and working to correct the damage of the past.  The emphasis is on the alleviation of debt for struggling homeowners, rather than waving a magic wand to fix the problem.  Banks have responsibility to develop solutions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last month, the Cluid voluntary housing association completed its first transaction with the National Asset Management Agency.  This is a positive development and I commend the Minister of State for activating a scheme with the voluntary housing agencies.  As she has spoken about deposit retention, I will not dwell on that matter. The Government has a role to play in trying to deal with the mortgage arrears predicament, on which it is working. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">There was good news today in respect of homeowners with tracker mortgages.  They will now be able to move home and keep their valuable tracker rate.  It would be good if the same scheme brought in by Ulster Bank could be used for people who bought houses under the shared ownership scheme from a local authority.  They are caught in a catch-22, where they bear the brunt of falling house prices while the councils do not.  They cannot rent their house because there is a clause in the shared ownership preventing this.  I would like the Minister of State to look at this and try to do something for them.  They have their houses.  They own 50% but they are caught in a difficult situation with the local authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State announced the social housing capital budget last week, which is welcome.  I know she had a difficult job on her plate to get what she could to preserve it.  New buildings will not be the order of the day any more, but what she is doing in respect of social housing is welcome.  A figure of &euro;691 million is available under the social housing investment programme for 2012, and capital funding of &euro;390 million is being provided for house construction, regeneration and improvement works this year.  The Minister of State assured us last week that we are on course to deliver between 3,000 and 4,000 additional units of social housing.</P>
        <P>The rent supplement situation is to be welcomed, as is the greater tenure neutrality.  I will not dwell on the huge problem of unfinished housing estates, because most Senators have spoken about it.  However, there is a case outside Dublin where the developer has given a bond to the council, but the council refuses to go in on it on foot of what happened in Mullingar.  The council will not do the work.  The money is there to do the work.  I made a representation only recently to the Department, so perhaps the Minister of State might look at it.  Councils fear being sued for doing work on a private estate that has not been taken in charge.  Local authorities need to be informed that they will not be sued if they do the work, even if they take the bond and the money is there to do it.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State and her predecessor, Deputy Penrose.  I hope she keeps up the good work.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past and move on from here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I welcome the opportunity provided for the Seanad to have this important debate.  This morning <i>The Irish Times</i> quoted from the most recent CSO survey on income and living conditions in Ireland, which showed that the gap between the richest and poorest grew by more than 25% in 2010.  The rate of those at risk of poverty rose from 14.1% in 2009 to 15.8% in 2010.  I obviously expect that trend has continued in 2011.  With that backdrop, it is appropriate that I address my statement on housing concerns to two very vulnerable groups historically in Irish society, namely, the long-term homeless and people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>These housing concerns have been long known to successive Governments.  They were never solved during the boom and I am very concerned that their specific needs will be further sidelined now that the housing crisis is affecting the general population so seriously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Focus Ireland has estimated that as many as 5,000 people are homeless in Ireland at one time.  Of that number, 1,500 children are homeless each year and a quarter of these are under 12.  The previous Government had a target to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2010.  Unfortunately, that was not achieved.  I feel really strongly about the need to end long-term homelessness, not only because of the social justice imperative and in the best interests of homeless children but also because it saves money for the Exchequer.  When we start looking at the figures, it is estimated that it costs &euro;30,000 per annum for a bed in emergency accommodation, whereas it can cost as little as &euro;14,500 to provide a home, even in Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to the current policy, it is not deemed unacceptable for a person to be in emergency accommodation for up to six months.  I first came across the term &ldquo;emergency accommodation&rdquo; when I worked in the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and thought it meant 24 hours or even one week, but this can go on for much longer periods.  The majority of homeless people are in emergency accommodation for over two years.  Some have been there for ten years.  There are 2,500 individuals in emergency accommodation in Dublin city centre alone, including 225 family households.  For family households, emergency accommodation can mean bed and breakfast accommodation.  This means that if a person has a young baby, she may have to bath the baby in the shower.  I have heard of children doing their homework on the side of suitcases.  The whole family structure breaks down, so it has a severe and detrimental effect.  My simplistic calculation of the cost of those in emergency accommodation in Dublin comes to &euro;38 million.  I struggle to understand why we continue to use emergency accommodation on such a long-term basis.  I find it quite unacceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to ending long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough.  I understand that in order to achieve this goal, in addition to the delivery of supports and services for individuals and families vulnerable to homelessness, 3,000 homes are required nationally to end long-term homelessness by 2013.  Given that only a few hundred homes have been delivered in the past three years by all local authorities and housing associations nationally, how are we going to deliver the required 3,000 homes?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, announced last December that 2,000 units had been earmarked by NAMA to be available for social housing.  I understand that further progress has been made on this and the Department is currently looking at 500 as viable for purchase or lease.  Can the Minister of State provide us with any information in this respect?  How many of these units will go to provide homes for homeless people?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The launch of the new housing strategy for people with disabilities is a welcome step.  We need to see progress on several issues and I hope that this happens soon, including the establishment of a housing and disability steering group in each local authority.   The supply and range of measures being deployed do not always meet the needs of people with disabilities.  For example, the rental accommodation scheme and leased properties are usually not suitable for people with physical disabilities.  What progress has been made to date on the strategy?  It is of particular concern to me.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have no doubt that colleagues have spoken before on the housing supply.  I can see that Senator Hayden is due to speak and she will provide much more expert advice than I will on this issue.  It has radically changed in the past two years, with a focus now on flexible measures, including long-term leasing of accommodation.  In 2007, over 9,500 new social homes were provided in the State but in 2011, that figure dropped to between 3,500 and 4,000.  We can see that the demand is increasing, but the supply is clearly reducing.  I am concerned about that.  The voluntary and co-operative sector could provide a great resource.  I notice the Minister of State is agreeing with me.  Why is 62% of the resources allocated to social housing for the period 2012-16, under the infrastructure and capital investment framework, being directed to local authorities and the private sector, when the majority of the new supply is expected to come from the voluntary and co-operative sector?  I do not understand that figure.</P>
        <P>I have much more to ask the Minister of State, but I will finish with a point on unfinished housing estates.  I know of an estate where 25 of the 30 houses are finished, and I can provide the Minister of State with the details.  Each end of the estate is occupied, but the rest of the estate has been boarded up and is under security watch.  A young man has been employed to be the security guard for the estate.  He sits in his car 14 hours per day outside the estate.  I would lose patience sitting around for an hour in my car.  This young man has 20 weeks left to complete his bricklaying apprenticeship and he is looking in at those five unfinished houses.  He cannot emigrate because he has not got his apprenticeship, but he is very close to doing so.  It does not make sense to me.  I am sure he is not alone.  I am sure it is not an isolated case.  I will forward my other questions to the Minister of State.  I appreciate the opportunity presented by this debate.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and pay tribute to the former Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose.  While I am at it, I also pay tribute to previous Ministers of State, Bobby Molloy, Michael Finneran and Noel Ahern.  We all agree that housing policy is incremental and does not just fall from the sky.  Good things have been done in the last ten or 15 years which, although we are going through bad times, we must acknowledge.</P>
        <P>I broadly welcome the Government&rsquo;s approach of tenant neutrality.  For too long we rewarded home ownership and council housing provision.  Council tenants had the same rights as those who owned their own homes, through tenant purchase schemes, differential rent and security of tenure, while a swathe of others were left out of the circle, particularly single, unmarried and poor people.  The broad approach of tenant neutrality marks a positive departure from the previous policy under which there was over-emphasis on home ownership.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a lot to put to the Minister of State who many consider is living in interesting times.  The figure of 100,000 seems to pop up a lot.  There are now almost 100,000 in mortgage arrears, 100,000 on the housing waiting list and 100,000 in receipt of rent supplement.  One of the dangers mentioned by the Minister of State about the pro-cyclical nature of housing policy is that the contrary is also true, there must be an anti-cyclical approach, when appropriate.  I am concerned that housing values dropped by 18% in the last CSO figures and that the figure for the construction sector has dropped to under 5%, which is regarded as particularly unhealthy in a developed country.  We, therefore, run the risk of repeating the mistakes of the 1930s and 1960s and finding ourselves with a housing deficit in a short space of time.</P>
        <P>The regulation of the voluntary housing sector and placing more emphasis on it is to be welcomed, but we must move quickly to regulate it.  The Minister of State said this process was under way, but the lack of regulation is impacting on the sector&rsquo;s access to finance.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the transfer of the dispute resolution machinery to the PRTB.  It is progressing at a very slow rate.  It has been put to me that there is a bureaucratic unwillingness to bring the sector within the ambit of the PRTB, something the Minister of State might deal with.  The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in the Donegan case also suggests we must act quickly to put in place an independent dispute resolution process between local authorities and their tenants.</P>
        <P>Too much emphasis has been put on distressed mortgages as a financial rather than a housing issue.  A mortgage-to-rent scheme has been put in place, but there are few situations where it will be applicable.  I am concerned we have not seen more movement on the Keane report, particularly the suggestion in respect of shared equity based on incremental purchase, which is provided for in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  It is a variation on the idea of split mortgages, but it will be more relevant for more people.  We run the risk of finding people in a position where their homes will be repossessed once insolvency legislation is in place.  Are we ready to deal with the number at risk of homelessness when this happens?</P>
        <P>There have been unhelpful comments from the Governor of the Central Bank recently indicating there should be large-scale repossessions of these properties.  It has been indicated that 20% to 25% of AIB&rsquo;s buy-to-let mortgage book is in arrears.  That creates a significant problem, as these are not large-scale developers.  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s statistics show 58% of rent supplement landlords own only one property.  We are talking about the person who lives next door.  These are not people with deep pockets and we run the risk of completely destabilising that market.</P>
        <P>Could we have a separate debate on social housing?  The future of social housing schemes should be given more consideration, as we have a lot to discuss today.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State did not mention homelessness.  I thank Senator Jillian van Turnhout for bringing up the issue.  The housing first approach has been prioritised in the programme for Government.  In the review of homeless services in the Dublin region it is indicated that there are 900 people employed in the sector to deal with just over 2,677 homeless people, of whom only 90 moved into permanent independent living accommodation in the previous six months.  We must re-evaluate how we fund homeless services and particularly section 10.  We are incentivising the provision of emergency accommodation rather than dealing with the issue of prevention and moving on.  The Minister of State has highlighted this point on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>I am glad the programme for Government is unequivocal that a tenancy deposit protection scheme will be established to put an end to disputes over the return of deposits.  It is the most common issue in the private rented sector in which there are twice as many people living as in social housing.  Almost 40% of the market comprises rent supplement tenants, and an additional 10% to 20% comprises the working poor on very low incomes.  We are, therefore, talking about the loss of anything from &euro;600 to &euro;1,000 for individuals, which is important.</P>
        <P>The proposal in the Bill to double the fines for those who withhold deposits will not work for two reasons.  When a determination is given by the PRTB, it is not adhered to.  There is a culture of non-compliance and a doubling of the fines will not be any more successful.  Second, I have serious concerns that the PRTB is not enforcing its determination orders.  This sends a message that the law is meaningless.  I am concerned about the total lack of clarity on which decisions will be enforced.  It has come to my attention that decisions in deposit cases are not being enforced.</P>
        <P>Similarly, standards and regulations are not being upheld by local authorities, about which I am seriously concerned.  I do not believe the matter can be rectified other than through a certification system under which landlords would have to certify their properties were fit to rent.  A person cannot walk into a restaurant without there being a certificate on the wall indicating it is fit to eat in.  We should not be putting people in homes that are not fit to live in.</P>
        <P>I welcome the transfer of the rent supplement scheme to local authorities.  It is a critical departure from the way we have tackled the issue of housing to date.  As far back as 2006, 70% of those in receipt of rent supplement had been in receipt of it for over one year, while 55% had been in receipt of it for more than two years.  People are in the rental sector as a long-term housing solution.  From my own experience, when people have the opportunity to work and pay differential rent, they will work.  However, the current system is stacked against those who wish to return to the workplace.  The sooner the change is implemented, the quicker we will see a real improvement in people&rsquo;s lives and their capacity to return to work.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in her brief which is an interesting one at a critical time.  I thank her for coming before us.  I would appreciate it if a specific debate on the future of social housing schemes was held.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to participate in this important debate.  I also welcome the well rehearsed and delivered speech by Senator C&aacute;it Keane, in which again the narrative is that it is all Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s fault.  There is a clear departure in terms of policy on the part of the new Government which it is stated needs time because Rome was not built in one day but that it will eventually sort out the mess left by the previous Government.  The only problem is that there has been no significant shift in policy, especially on housing.  There has been a shift away from social housing in the traditional sense to a different form of delivery, of which we can debate the merits or otherwise.  That is partly due to economic reasons because we do not have the money to maintain the level of capital funding provided in the past.  It is also partly due to ideological reasons, as some people prefer social housing to be delivered through the private rented sector and there are, of course, also policy implications.  However, there has been no significant shift away from what was set in motion by the previous Government.</P>
        <P>Let us take social housing as the first example.  There has been a huge drop in investment in such housing.  This manifests itself in a number of ways.  First, local authorities are not building a significant number of new houses.  Part of the logic behind Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was that because there was a lack of social housing being built, it would be replaced by Part V housing through new build developments in the private sector.  The difficulty we have at is that there is no new building in the private sector either; therefore, Part V developments are not coming on stream in local authority stocks.  That, combined with the fact that there is no new building of local authority stock, means the housing waiting lists are increasing.  In addition, approximately &euro;500 million a year is being spent on supplementing private rented accommodation through either rent supplement, long-term leasing or the RAS, rental accommodation scheme, option.  There is also a lack of funding for the retrofit scheme.  When they were in the opposition the Government parties stated they would support proper investment in the scheme.  In Waterford city there has been a significant drop in funding for the scheme and housing maintenance.  There is also a lack of funding for what was previously described as the disabled person&rsquo;s grant which became the housing aid for the elderly and mobility grants.  The funding is simply not available where older people and people with disabilities need work to be carried out in their homes.</P>
        <P>I was a councillor in Waterford city from 2004 until my election to the Seanad.  Waterford City Council put in place a priority policy with grades 1, 2 and 3 and it was awful to see people being stuck in grades 2 and 3.  They had an established need, but the council was never going to get around to them.  It might be something as simple as replacing a bath with a shower, but it falls into grade 2 or 3 and the funding is not available to do the work.  That is a problem also.  A level of capital investment is required in housing to ensure these needs are met.</P>
        <P>There is also a problem in mobility.  There are two issues related to the rent supplement and RAS option with which I have a difficulty.  The first is that people are moving house more frequently owing to the fact that they are in private rented accommodation.  The landlord might wish to sell the property, for example, or end the contract for whatever reason and people are forced to move.  This can be difficult for families, especially where they have children and put down roots and built relationships with friends and neighbours.  It can create problems.</P>
        <P>There is also a difficulty as a result of increasing the thresholds in the budget.  These changes have meant that people in receipt of or seeking rent supplement are finding it more difficult to secure private rented accommodation.  All Members can talk about people who are paying over and above the level of rent supplement.  They are giving the landlord &euro;30 to &euro;60 a week in addition to rent supplement.  It is the only way they can avail of the RAS option.  I understand what the Government was trying to do.  Saving money was part of it, but it was also trying to force down rents payable in the private sector and the charges being imposed by landlords for rental accommodation.  However, it has not resolved the issue because people are paying cash in addition to rent supplement.  In Waterford city the threshold for a single parent with two children is &euro;510 a week.  I am aware of countless cases in which those individuals are giving an average of &euro;50 to &euro;60 of their income in addition to rent supplement.</P>
        <P>My last point relates to the private sector.  One of the problems we have not solved but must solve &mdash; it goes to the heart of what was contained in one of the reports published recently that caused consternation &mdash; is that when councillors rezone land from agricultural to residential use, it makes landowners very wealthy overnight.  It should be about the common good.  A number of reports, including the Bacon report, recommended that if land was being rezoned from agricultural to residential use, a reasonable amount of money should be paid to the landowner.  That would be a better solution.  It is about the public good rather than making people millionaires overnight, which is what happened previously.  This played its part in driving up the price of land and property.  We must be conscious of this issue in the future.  While we deal with the other problems that arose in terms of corruption, we must examine this aspect also, as it was one of the drivers that led to this happening in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members who have contributed to the debate and will try to reply to the questions raised.  I join them in paying tribute to my predecessor, Deputy Willie Penrose, who did tremendous work in the period he held office.  I hope I can continue the various initiatives he started.  One of them which was mentioned by Senator Diarmuid Wilson was to deal with NAMA.  In addition, Senator Jillian van Turnhout asked about the properties we were in the process of acquiring from NAMA.  Not all of the properties are suitable.  The local authorities concerned are engaging with NAMA and where properties are deemed unsuitable, we return to NAMA and ask for alternatives.  When one looks at all of the empty houses and considers the number of people on waiting lists, living in inappropriate housing or who are homeless, it has to be seen as an opportunity.  It is something we must advance.  I am anxious to drive this and ensure we get the best possible social dividend from NAMA.  Getting a social dividend is provided for in the Act.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of unfinished estates.  To answer the question about how we categorise them and whether they can be recategorised, in many ways it is a work in progress.  Unfortunately, the categories stand as they are with regard to the household charge this year.  However, there is ongoing engagement and a committee has been established, as I mentioned.  The exemption applies to categories 3 and 4.  They were categorised by local authorities in accordance with the criteria drawn up by the Department.  I am aware that there were some inconsistencies in the categorisation and we are engaging with local authorities to look at them again.  Obviously, there will also be changes, whereby estates will be improved as a result of the money made available for improving estates and the category of these estates might well be reduced.  Certainly, we hope that will be the case because a significant amount of public money has been made available for that purpose.</P>
        <P>A call was made for local authorities to identify what they required to make estates safe, to which the Department responded.  That is why the full &euro;5 million was not sought.  Whatever was sought and whatever fitted into the appropriate categories was given.  However, there is more money available.  There might have been other areas with unfinished estates, but I was asked about specific estates in Cavan.  I will have to refer back to the Senator concerned on individual estates, but the local authorities were asked to identify estates and look for money from the Department for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There were a number of questions about mortgage arrears with regard to local authority and other mortgages.  I share Senators&rsquo; views that we must implement the recommendations made in the Keane report as quickly as possible.  People are in distress because they cannot pay their mortgages.  We must take every action we can in that regard.  The Department is engaging with the local authorities and preparing updated guidelines which will include the shared ownership scheme in which many people are caught.  We are working on those matters and there are a couple of elements to those guidelines.  I cannot give the House an exact date but they are being worked on.  If I can get a more indicative date, I will come back to the Senator about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As my advisers are saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, it will be before the summer.  </P><P Just="Left">Some strong points have been made about the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, and I know that Senator Hayden has a particular interest in that area. I heard her on radio recently making some good points. The deposit retention issue is in the programme for Government and I am committed to ensuring we move on that. There are a large number of issues concerning people who are entitled to get their deposits back but do not get them. On the other hand, some landlords are entitled to keep the deposit because certain things have happened. We must be fair to both sides in this regard but we do need a scheme. </P>
        <P>I share Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s concern about homelessness.  It is one of the areas for which we have ring-fenced funding, although it has been difficult to do so because of the necessity for cuts.  We are developing a housing-led policy and want to ensure we spend the money as well as we can for the benefit of homeless people.  In that way, they will not be kept in the trap of hostels but will move on to homes.  In particular, we are supporting voluntary housing associations which support people in their own homes.  I was in one recently in Athlone where I was impressed by the supportive system that was being set up there through the Simon Community.</P>
        <P>As regards the disability strategy, I have already met the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and intend to work with her on housing and disability areas in terms of addressing people&rsquo;s needs.</P>
        <P>The Senator said there was no change in policy but there has been a huge change.  We have had developer-led planning and building but we will not have that any more.  We are focusing on the needs of individuals now.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to start a fight between Senators but despite the limited amount of money we have, we are trying to give people choice with this policy and focus on people&rsquo;s needs.  That does mean using leasing and encouraging voluntary housing associations to raise money in other ways.  That is why we have things like the CAS scheme whereby they get a certain amount of money from the public purse but are also facilitated in raising money in other ways.  We also want to regulate them because it will make it easier for them to borrow from financial institutions.</P>
        <P>I would contest any suggestion that there is not a change of policy.  It is not about developers any more, it is about people living in homes we are trying to provide for them one way or another.  The move on rent allowance is a policy decision.  We want to get rid of the poverty traps whereby people were afraid of losing their rent allowance.  We want to get them onto a scheme that is similar to the local authority differential rent scheme.  That is a policy decision to get people out of poverty traps and give them the opportunity to go to work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the mobility grant were mentioned and I agree that they are important.  In so far as we could, we protected that fund.  I recently announced money for local authorities in that area.  Local authorities get good value for money in responding to people&rsquo;s needs.  As to some extent, they must match the funding themselves, not all local authorities sought as much money as they needed because they had to find matching funds from their own budgets.  However, we have tried to protect that as well.  We also want to respond in terms of local authority housing stock, which is why we have a fund to upgrade vacant stock and provide those houses.  It addresses two issues, first, the fact that there are a considerable number of vacant houses throughout the country, and second, the need to raise the quality and standard of local authority housing.  We therefore have funding for that area as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Donegan case was referred to, which essentially concerns anti-social behaviour and the ability of local authorities to take action where such behaviour occurs.  The judgment did not allow the local authority to take action because of European human rights law.  We are examining that matter because the reality is that, as well as having rights, people have responsibilities.  Local authorities need to be able to deal with anti-social behaviour in their estates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While it is not within my remit, Senator van Turnhout referred to apprentices looking at unfinished houses.  Some local authorities use community employment schemes to finish apprenticeships.  I know of some such cases and it seems to be a practical way of responding to the needs of young people who want to finish their apprenticeships.  We need to find way of addressing such problems, which is what this debate is about.  I thank those Senators who have contributed so far.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>There is so much to raise because it is such a wide issue.  When the new Government came into power last March, within six weeks it had changed the criteria for people to qualify for local authority houses.  People must now prove that they have been living in an area for five years before they can even apply for a local authority house.  There are 100,000 people on the waiting list, but many others are not allowed to apply because they cannot prove they have been living in an area for five years.  It discriminates against our own people.  If a person is from Limerick and travels to Donegal, they cannot apply.  That is something that has changed.  In addition, funding for all the grant schemes has been drastically cut.  Last year, for example, &euro;6.7 million was made available to Donegal County Council, but this year&rsquo;s allocation is &euro;2.1 million.  I would like to deal with a lot more issues, including unfinished housing estates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to draw the following to the attention of the Minister of State.  Categories 1 to 4 have been set out.  The Minister of State has outlined that local authority staff drew up the lists, but that is not entirely the case.  According to the senior planner in Donegal County Council, departmental officials surveyed housing estates within Donegal &mdash; I am sure it is the same for other local authorities &mdash; and decided that there were no estates in County Donegal in category 3 or category 4.  Last Thursday night, I met the residents of one of those estates, which is unfinished.  The developer has abandoned the estate, which is in category 1 when it should be in category 4.  The lists have been drawn up in such as way as to camouflage the real issues.  It will ensure estates that deserve some funding are ineligible to apply for it or to draw it down.  That estate in Donegal, St. Jude&rsquo;s Court, should be available to apply for the &euro;5 million fund.  The Minister of State mentioned that local authorities did not apply for the &euro;5 million fund.  They did not do so because they were not eligible to apply for it. The system needs to be radically reviewed immediately. If that is not done, people in housing estates that should be in category 3 or category 4 will be ineligible to apply for the &euro;5 million fund. That fund is only a drop in the ocean to remedy the problems facing people. </P>

	<P>The Minister of State is welcome.  I have a specific question that has been a source of concern to people in Oranmore, County Galway, for quite a number of years.  I am putting the question in order that the Minister of State might come back to me with a written response.  She referred to unfinished housing estates.  I will describe what is a very dangerous situation.  The situation makes this estate, Oranhill, in Oranmore, an unfinished housing estate, but it is not classified as such for the household charge.  There is a hole in this estate big enough to bury Leinster House.  This hole was intended for a huge shopping centre development.  It is cordoned off from the 250 houses in the estate, but not adequately.  There is a safety issue and a serious visual issue which affect values and deter prospective buyers in what is a very nice area.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">A few years ago, I tried to follow this up with the developer in this case.  He was nice initially and then was not a bit nice.  What is his responsibility?  This estate cannot be taken over by Galway County Council.  What protection is there for the residents?  I note the report of the advisory group on unfinished housing development and also what the Minister of State has said about a national co-ordination committee.  Will the Minister of State ask her officials to come back to me on this issue?  Given the size of the hole, why is the estate classified as finished?  Can that classification be reviewed?</P>

        <P Just="Left">When a person who is in a shared ownership scheme and who has been a social welfare recipient for 25 years pays off his or her mortgage, he or she may owe as much as &euro;70,000 to the local authority, which will be completely out of the person&rsquo;s reach.  Could that debt be written off when the person has paid off the mortgage element of the debt?</P>
        <P>The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, should send out renewal notices.  People who have signed up with the PRTB may not know when the year is up and should receive reminders, as we do for car tax.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many vulnerable people bought houses in good faith in what are now classified as unfinished estates.  I know of an estate in my own area where there are only two owner occupiers in an estate where 40 houses are inhabited and 30 need to be demolished.  This estate is going to rack and ruin.  The developer has gone into liquidation and I can see no hope for these people.  They have beautiful houses but they are in an estate that is filthy and run down.  When estates that are well progressed and where there are many family units are acquired from NAMA, consideration should be given to people like the owner occupiers of whom I speak.  There are not many of them.  Could they be allowed to transfer to another estate and have their original property in the unfinished estate acquired by the local authority?  No matter how long it is there, the run-down estate where they are living will never improve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  My question relates to rent allowance.  In 2005, we spent &euro;369 million on rent allowance.  Last year, that figure had risen to &euro;500 million.  We are paying more than half a billion euro on rent allowance and 98,000 people are now in receipt of the allowance.  I accept that it is a necessary evil but in some cases it is being abused.  I welcome the changes to the rent supplement proposed by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask that an audit be done.  Some people go on local authority housing lists simply in order to qualify for rent allowance.  If they were offered a local authority house they would not take it.  The Minister of State has said there are approximately 100,000 people on housing lists.  In my own county of Kilkenny, there are 3,000 people on the local authority housing list.  Of those, 2,000 have applied for housing in the city.  We have no unfinished housing estates around Kilkenny city.  Therefore, we have no hope of housing these people because we do not have the capital funds to purchase houses and the council has very little income from rental properties.  I ask the Minister of State to carry out an audit of the rent supplement scheme in each local authority in order that a genuine list of people who want a local authority house can be produced. Some people are using the local authority housing list simply to get rent supplement. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of an applicant having to live in an area for five years.  Is that a local requirement in the Senator&rsquo;s own area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement was introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in the third week of last April.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check that, but I am not sure it is practised in most local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a national issue from Big Phil.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have improved the income criteria for qualification for local authority housing.</P>
        <P>The Department issued the guidelines for unfinished estates and it was up to local authorities to decide what categories estates were in.  There is an opportunity to look at the categorisation now, but not for this year in terms of exemption from the local authority charge.  I will examine the particular case raised by Senator Healy Eames.  She said the estate was finished, but I am not sure if it is categorised as finished or if it is still in the hands of the developer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Kelly raised a few issues, particularly shared ownership.  We need to respond compassionately to people who are stuck in that situation.  There is also the issue of asking local authorities to write off large amounts of debt.  We have to make sure what we do works for local authorities.  I know of similar cases and agree with the Senator that something needs to be done.  I will get back to the Private Residential Tenancies Board in relation to renewal notices.  The Senator also made a general point about ghost estates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>And transfers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I met representatives of a voluntary housing organisation yesterday.  It is hoping to go into a ghost estate, where a certain number of people have bought houses.  The organisation hopes to take over the vacant houses and provide social housing for people who need it.  There is scope to work with the voluntary, community and co-operative sectors in these situations.  However, Senator Kelly is talking about an estate that may never be finished.  We need a solution for individuals in those cases.  We must be careful not to put people on social housing lists who may not satisfy the criteria.  We would have to look at each case on an individual basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Neill spoke about rent allowance and the need for an audit of local authority housing lists.  Work is being undertaken in the Department because we are taking over the area of rent supplement.  I agree this is a huge amount of money.  For a long time people have been asking that something be done about it because this spending is not controlled.  There is not the degree of oversight one would have if the scheme were under a local authority. That is why we are bringing the scheme into the local authority system.  I think we will be able to address the issues raised by the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish her continued success in her brief.  I understand she spoke with councillors in Limerick about retrofitting and insulation of local authority houses.  This issue caused me a problem when I was a member of Limerick County Council.  The council&rsquo;s system was to insulate vacant stock first in preparation for tenants moving into the houses, while existing tenants, who were up to date with rent payments, were not entitled to have this work done.  They did not qualify for grants because they were not home owners.  This system stuck in the craw of many local authority tenants who saw houses being insulated and retrofitted for new tenants while they did not qualify.</P>
        <P>In light of the findings of the Mahon tribunal, a sort of NAMA for local authorities was set up a number of years ago.   I believe it is called the Housing and Sustainable Community Agency and it seems to be a very secretive organisation, as it is difficult to pin down what exactly it does.  I understand it has taken over the assets of local authorities which bought land on the advice of the Department in the 1990s.  They were told to grab land all over the country, but they ended up with a considerable bill that they could not afford to pay.  I wonder, in the light of the Mahon tribunal report, whether it would be feasible for the Minister of State to see whether she could investigate the lands bought, the use that was made of them, from whom they were bought and exactly how much was paid for them at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for her statement.</P>
        <P>We all welcome the move by Ulster Bank &mdash; the news broke this morning &mdash; on tracker mortgages, etc.  It is important that the other banks take up the issue and make more money available, particularly to young people who want to get into the housing market.</P>
        <P>My question is about the derelict estates about which we are all talking about.  Could a scheme be introduced to encourage the sale to young people who might have to be vetted of semi-finished houses at a very low price, perhaps the price of a site, while ensuring they have a genuine interest in coming together as a community to have an estate developed properly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment her on her work in the Department since she took over the portfolio.  In particular, I commend her for the recent announcement of &euro;3 million in grants for the adaptation of homes for the elderly and those with a disability in County Galway and a further &euro;4 million for the improvement of the existing housing supply in the county.  While these figures are extremely laudable and she has had to fight hard to secure this funding given current budgetary constraints, there is one issue that concerns me, that is, the time lag between people being allocated a local authority house and their move-in date.  In my experience, in some instances, it can be six months or more before tenants move into the dwellings they have been allocated because essential works may have to be done, the BER ratings must be carried out or other works may have to be put out to tender.  This practice is depriving the Exchequer of much needed funds.  I respectfully ask whether the Minister of State has any plans to look at this in order that she can achieve further efficiencies within her Department in order that ultimately the funding could be used for other worthwhile projects such as the ones I mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  While she has a challenging role, she has hit the ground running and I have no doubt she will do an outstanding job in the years to come.</P>
        <P>On voluntary housing projects, how much money will be available in 2012-13 and how will the funding be shared out among the local authorities?  I ask this because I am aware of a particularly worthy scheme to provide 17 residential units in Ballinasloe being organised by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
        <P>My second question relates to the tenant purchase scheme.  I point out to the Minister of State &mdash; I raised this issue with the former Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose &mdash; that there is discrimination against persons on social welfare in the tenant purchase schemes as in order to qualify one must be in secure employment.  I am aware of a number of cases in which there is significant income going into a house and those paying the maximum amount in rent could afford to pay an additional &euro;30 or &euro;40 a week towards the cost of buying the house which has been valued at a modest figure.  However, because their income is derived mainly income from social welfare payments, they are deemed to be ineligible.  Everybody aspires to own his or her own home.  This, therefore, is an issue that should be looked at.  I am aware of many local authority tenants who probably could afford to buy their home if this situation was rectified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions for the Minister of State.  On unfinished estates, I wonder what has happened to those who left them unfinished.  Obviously, some of those involved are bankrupt, but I suspect that is not the case across the board.  Certainly, in my area there is much local knowledge of what happened, for example, that money was put aside and then re-channelled into another account.  I wonder whether that is an issue the Government should be addressing, as well as the practicalities which I appreciate the Department has begun to address.</P>
        <P>On regeneration, recently I visited Limerick and took an extensive tour of the regeneration project with its chief executive, Mr. Brendan Kenny, with some Members from Sligo.  It is an interesting exercise, as no doubt the Minister of State is aware far better than I am, given that she is from Limerick, but it was clear how slow and difficult regeneration was and how, ultimately, it was not merely about rebuilding houses.  I understand the Minister of State has announced the establishment of an independent regeneration office.  I would be grateful if she would confirm this, what its function will be, specifically in relation to, say, the Cranmore regeneration project which has been in the offing for quite some time for various reasons.  I appreciate that there are lessons that we, in Cranmore, could learn from the project in Limerick to ensure some of the errors made there are not repeated.  I pay tribute to the work done by Mr. Kenny.  I note that there has been criticism of the slowness of the project, but when one sees the complexity of the work involved, some of the achievements in difficult circumstances are worthy of mention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator James Heffernan raised the issue of retrofitting and insulation.  There has been concentration on vacant houses.  This in some ways relates to Senator Lorraine Higgins&rsquo;s question as to why it takes so long for people to move in.  One of the reasons funding is directed towards vacant houses is to bring them up to standard to facilitate their letting.  In a way Senator Lorraine Higgins&rsquo;s issue about speeding up the letting of vacant dwellings reinforces one of the reason the Department is focusing on vacant dwellings.</P>
        <P>I sympathise with the point made by Senator James Heffernan which was also raised with me by Limerick county councillors.  I am sure it is an issue for councillors in other parts of the country also where there is a tenant who has been living in a place for years and is looking at the house next door being done up and he or she is not able to have repairs done.  Local authorities have their own resources, some of which they are supposed to use for repairs.  Next year when we are making decisions on the provision funding I will be sympathetic to looking at the position of existing tenants because there is a genuine case that needs to be addressed.  We might be able to set aside some money for this purpose.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Senator James Heffernan asked about the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.  This relates to the land aggregation scheme.  The reason loans are being transferred to this organisation is that, unfortunately, local authorities bought land for house-building and following the bust were left with debts that they must pay.  I understand the overall liability is approximately &euro;500 million.  What we have been doing is setting aside approximately &euro;50 million per year and there is a queue of local authorities which are trying to access this funding.  The objective is to take the cost of servicing loans off the books of the local authorities and, I suppose, park it.  It is causing a financial problem for some local authorities who bought land at a time when they needed it &mdash; it is probably the advice they were given &mdash; and were then stuck with the cost of servicing the loans.  We can give the Senator more information on the matter, if he wants it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Michael Comiskey also raised the matter of unfinished estates and asked whether they could be sold to young people.  That is a good idea.  It is probably one we need to put to NAMA because part of its briefs is to get a good return for the taxpayer from its property portfolio and also because it does not own the properties in question.  It is a complex issue but something we would nevertheless like to progress.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I have already commented on the issue raised by Senator Higgins.  Whatever we can do to assist local authorities to occupy vacant dwellings as quickly as possible will be done.  I am very much aware of the difficulties faced by those waiting to be housed.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins asked about the amount of money available for the voluntary housing sector.  The allocation for this year under the capital assistance scheme, CAS, is &euro;70 million.  However, there are other ways in which funding can be made available to voluntary housing associations.  We intend later in the year to issue a multi-annual call for proposals which will involve asking local authorities to set out their priorities for social housing funding.  Some of that funding will be administered through voluntary housing associations.  There will not be a huge sum involved but associations will be able to access funding later in the year.  I will follow up with the Senator on the particular case to which he referred.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins also referred to tenant purchase schemes and the difficulties experienced by people on low incomes in availing of such schemes.  Ideally we would like to facilitate people to purchase the property in which they are residing if they can possibly do so.  However, given the variations in interest rates and so on in the market, we must be careful that people do not take on something they cannot afford.  There must be a balance between individuals&rsquo; available income and their desire to purchase the property in which they are living.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be flexibility in the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  However, there is an ability to pay issue that must be taken into account.  We do not want people undertaking to buy out their home and then finding they cannot afford to feed themselves.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe asked what will happen to the developers of unfinished housing estates.  I certainly hope the relevant authorities will pursue any of those who are guilty of misconduct in their affairs.  Some of the developers in question lodged bonds which the local authority can use to carry out certain works.  Some developers are in receivership, some are bankrupt and others are still in operation.  In the case of the latter, our objective is that they would undertake to complete the estates in question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to regeneration projects, I am pleased the Senator was able to visit Limerick and wish her success with the regeneration project in Sligo.  I, too, commend Brendan Kenny and his team for the work they have done.  We have announced our intention to establish an office of regeneration which will be separate from the local authorities&rsquo; housing departments.  It will be a directorate of regeneration in the local authority system with its own staff and so on, operating out of the offices in the current regeneration areas.  In the case of Limerick we will have a joint authority between Limerick city and county.  We hope the manager of the interim joint authority &mdash; it is a work in progress until the local elections in 2014 &mdash; will be the person to whom the director of regeneration will report for the entire Limerick area.  We are trying to bring the best of the two systems together.  Our aim is to maintain the good work done by the regeneration agencies, which will come to an end in June, but also to ensure we have everybody on the same path in terms of the local authorities.  The regeneration office will be connected into the local authority but will be a separate entity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>An elderly couple came to see me recently with a query about downsizing.  Now that their children are grown, they would like to downsize their four bedroom home to a single-storey building.  They are getting nowhere, however, with Cork City Council.  Does the Minister of State intend to introduce a programme to assist persons in that situation?</P>
        <P>I have referred to the German letting model on previous occasions in this House.  Under this system, landlords provide only a shell of an apartment and it is for the tenants to install the furnishings and fittings, from carpets to tiling to bathroom fixtures.  There are many young people renting in this country who are unable to borrow money to purchase a home but have substantial savings.  We need to look at new ideas.  A scheme whereby tenants can avail of a ten or even 20 year rental agreement, as in the German model, should be considered.  There are advantages for both landlord and tenant in such a system.  First, tenants can specify their requirements precisely, thus engendering a greater sense of pride in the property in which they will be living.  More importantly, while they must provide the outlay for furnishings and so on, they will secure the property at a much lower rent.  The landlord, meanwhile, has a secure leasing arrangement and does not have to worry about wear and tear and the replacement of household items.  Will the Minister of State consider introducing such a scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The specific instance cottages scheme was a system whereby local authorities undertook to build social housing on a site provided by the tenant.  This allowed individuals living in rural areas to have a home built on their own land, with an option to purchase after one year.  However, I understand the scheme has been more or less discontinued &mdash; by the Department rather than by individual local authorities.  Will the Minister of State consider reopening and rolling out that scheme in a progressive manner?</P>
        <P>The banks in this country are a disgrace, none more so than the pillar institutions that were guaranteed by the taxpayer.  I am not making a political point in this regard; I accord blame to former Ministers from my own party for how the matter was handled.  The banks must be challenged on their failure to provide mortgage finance.  They are claiming to be open for such lending but it is simply not the case.  Any public representative, anywhere in the country, will confirm this.  At the same time they are placing dreadful pressure on mortgage holders who have fallen into arrears.  These institutions must be held to account.  What steps has the Minister of State taken or does she intend to take to urge the chief executive officers of the banks to take action on the provision of mortgage finance and reduce the burden they are placing on customers who have fallen into arrears with their mortgage repayments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, the issue of mortgage lending must be addressed.  If the pillar banks will not comply, we must look at other options.  We may have to go back to the local authority model under which considerable amounts of lending was made to low-income people.  Alternatively, the credit unions may be able to offer some solution.  Let us not forget either that we own the Irish Nationwide Building Society branch network.  In a situation where mortgage lending has fallen to 1971 levels, action must be taken urgently.</P>
        <P>In regard to vacant local authority housing stock, the Department has made additional sums available to turn around voids very quickly.  There is no doubt that at times when the housing waiting list is long, the sight of boarded-up housing in existing estates is a cause of great frustration in local communities.  Reference was made earlier to the difficulties experienced by people with disabilities in accessing housing.  I am aware from my own experience that similar difficulties often arise for single homeless people.  I ask the Minister of State to consider providing a specific incentive for local authorities when a unit becomes vacant.  For example, it may be a three-bedroom unit that traditionally has been let to a family.  The Department might consider making moneys available to subdivide and perhaps extend such a unit in order that it might accommodate two smaller family units or it might be renovated to accommodate a disabled person.  This would bring more balance to the local authority housing stock, rather than having it geared specifically towards providing certain types of unit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a supplementary question on regeneration.  I had misunderstood the position as I had thought the independent regeneration office to which I referred was a national office, but it obviously pertains to regeneration in Limerick.  Is there an understanding of what the model will be for the Cranmore regeneration project?  Will it be an independent regeneration office, in an alliance with the council or an entirely new model?  Is the Minister of State in a position to comment on this?  As the Limerick regeneration project has been ongoing for some time and as part of the project is coming to an end, I am aware of the need to establish how best practice might be brought to the Sligo project, given that it has started, albeit in a minimal way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator Colm Burke&rsquo;s suggestion regarding the German model, the Department will consider any model available.  In some ways, it connects with the point made by Senator Michael Comiskey about making available the houses in the possession of NAMA to young people.  I am not familiar with that German scheme, but I am certainly here to listen and take back Members&rsquo; suggestions to the Department.  While I may not be able to state definitively that it will implement any particular measure, it will examine them to ascertain whether their implementation is possible.  </P>
        <P>As for the suggestion on downsizing in respect of people living in four-bedroom houses, this also relates to Senator Aideen Hayden&rsquo;s idea of subdividing.  This pertains to the phenomenon, whereby in some cases, properties are too big for the families living in them.  Again, the Department will consider all of these suggestions.  However, it must also consider their cost because it must give priority to areas of greatest need.  For example, I do not know how much it would cost to subdivide.  I presume Senator Colm Burke was referring to tenants in the case he raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have referred to an elderly couple who now are tenants in a four-bedroom house.  They do not need that space and wish to downsize to a two-bedroom house specifically aimed at elderly people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they council tenants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  One would then have available a four-bedroom house for a young family.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Normally, local authorities try to facilitate such cases by way of transfers and, obviously, people can be placed on transfer lists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It needs to be given priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities move people around all the time, as individuals are placed on transfer lists and moved around.  I understand a successful scheme operated in parts of Dublin some time ago.  The Department can examine the scheme that was in place to ascertain whether there is potential in that regard.  The same point applies to the specific instance cottages scheme mentioned by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.  Again, the Department must consider the matter and establish what funding is available.  However, I will take it back in the same spirit as the other suggestions made.</P>
        <P>I agree with those Members, Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Aideen Hayden in particular, who have raised the issue of encouraging the banks to lend.  My colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, have regular discussions with the banks and are encouraging them in this regard.  The Government must do everything it possibly can.  If the banks are not doing this and there are other ways to fund mortgages, such ways must be considered.  However, the banks must be incentivised.  They have received a lot of public money and the Government must have some influence on the manner in which they spend it.</P>
        <P>As for Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s question on regeneration, that was a specific solution for Limerick.  The Ballymun regeneration project was a different model, being even more at a distance from the local authority.  However, that project is winding down and probably will come to a conclusion in 2014.  Other areas of Dublin are in urgent need of regeneration and the Department hopes to move some of the money available into those areas.  I do not know whether there is a model available for Sligo.  While funding has been allocated, it probably has been allocated directly to the local authority.  However, I can revert to the Senator in that respect.  Up to now, we have been trying to learn from both the Ballymun and Limerick models to establish whether we can put in place the best possible systems to deliver the regeneration these communities need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State who has been present in the Chamber for a lot longer than me this afternoon.  I wish to raise two issues with her, the first of which concerns the categorisation of housing estates for the household charge.  I have done some work on this issue and it appears as though housing estates were taken in their entirety for this purpose.  However, in some parts of the country housing estates were built in a number of tranches and sometimes by different builders.  In some cases, the original builder built very good schemes but then sold on one third or half the zoned land with planning permission.  Other builders subsequently came in but were not as successful.  In some cases, they have flown the country and left a mess behind them.  However, I have evidence of specific instances in which, because the majority of houses are perceived to be finished, the estate is included under the global name of the original development.  Consequently, the parts that remain unfinished are categorised as being finished and being penalised through the household charge.  There must be further scoping in respect of both the methodology used and the actual listings provided through the <i>www.householdcharge.ie</i> website for local authorities regarding the estates that are not liable.  Moreover, I note the existence of many other estates that are not liable either but which are not so listed.  I hope I have made my point clearly.</P>
        <P>I have encountered this phenomenon and it is very difficult.  Last Monday evening I entered a housing estate only to witness nothing but housing footings and fencing around part of the estate.  The people living in the houses that have been built have been told they must pay the household charge, even though there is no public lighting.  Moreover, the sewerage system has had to be taken up completely because the builder did not even understand gravity.  He fed it back into, instead of out of, the houses. Consequently, the local authority has been obliged to repair it.  Furthermore, among many other things, the roads laid for construction of the building site have not been completed.  I ask the Minister of State to comment generally on this issue.  If she seeks specific details, I will provide them for her later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for State for her earlier responses.  I wish to ask a question that is supplementary to those I asked previously and which follows on from Senator Denis Landy&rsquo;s contribution.  The Minister of State has said the categorisation has been completed for this year.  While I do not like this, I understand the Department&rsquo;s point of view.  However, I wonder about cases in which evidence such as that held by Senator Denis Landy or me is available.  To be fair to the local authorities, this was the first time they were obliged to do this job, but it has not been as comprehensive as one would wish.  To where can Members send such information to ensure it is not lost and is examined genuinely?  Most Members will only forward information on genuine cases such as those mentioned by Senator Denis Landy and me.  While I appreciate no changes will be made this year, is there an avenue, whereby residents&rsquo; groups or public representatives can make submissions on the list for next year?  They can be helpful in this situation.</P>
        <P>My final question which has been asked by other Members relates to housing bonds.  There are estates that have been built for which cash bonds are not held.  The bonds in question are insurance bonds held by reassurance groups not based in the State and terrible difficulties have arisen in getting moneys back from them.  Does the local government auditor look at this issue within the local authorities&rsquo; planning departments?  I thank the Minister of State for her contribution which has been appreciated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.  Senators Denis Landy and Darragh O&rsquo;Brien have raised common issues.  I understand the point they have raised because I am personally familiar with such estates in which parts may be classified as being in category one, while others are classified as being in categories three or four.  This has occurred in large estates in which, as Senator Denis Landy has observed, a developer has sold on a piece of the estate and the builders have changed as time has passed.  To clarify, these categorisations were made in conjunction with the local authorities.  There were guidelines from the Department but the local authorities essentially put them into the various categories.  I take the point from Senator O&rsquo;Brien that this was the first time it was done and they did not know it would relate to a local charge when it was done.  We have much to learn from this year but we will consider it again for next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities did not get it right in some cases and the people living in those houses should not be penalised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that fully and take on board that point.  That is why we are in the process of looking at the categories again.  The person to contact would be the local co-ordinator, of which there is one in every local authority for unfinished housing estates.  There are people in the Department who liaise directly with co-ordinators in the local authorities.  I understand the comments but unfortunately, for this year, decisions on the categories have been made.  They will be looked at again next year.  If the Senator has an individual case we can see where it is and how it can be properly categorised next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>To be honest, if these people take a legal case against either the local authority or the Department, they would win hands down.  They are incorrectly categorised and we cannot force them to pay money when they should not be paying it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I cannot comment on people taking legal cases.  The operation was done by the local authorities with the guidance of the Department.  There are real difficulties with bonds and local authorities can struggle with them, depending on when an estate was built.  I do not know if I have a real answer to the issue but if we can clarify the issue, we will revert to the Senator.  Any of us who has been a member of a local authority knows that in some of the older estates there may not be bonds at all.  Certain examples may not be cash bonds in any case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On my own behalf and that of my predecessor in the role, Deputy Willie Penrose, I thank everybody for a very productive debate and, in particular, the constructive suggestions and support given in the work we are trying to do.  We realise that we must be as imaginative and creative as possible and with housing, we are essentially trying to ensure that everybody who needs a home has a dwelling appropriate to his or her family needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes with grave concern the difficult economic position faced by many of those engaged in small business at this time;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes the need to make more supports available for those who are self-employed;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> proposes that the Government consider the adoption of a number of measures specifically to support small business and those who are self-employed, to include:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) addressing the difficulties with late payments for those contracted to provide goods and services to the public sector;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) opening up the rules on tender and procurement again to enable a wider range of firms and businesses to seek public contracts;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) the provision of greater levels of social protection, including protection in the event of illness, for those who are self-employed; and in particular for those whose business fails leading to a collapse of income;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) addressing high levels of local authority rates;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>e</i>) enabling company directors to invest money from their private pension funds into their businesses; and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>f</i>) ensuring increased levels of access to credit and finance facilities for small and medium enterprises.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to the House.  It is a privilege to move the motion.  I welcome, in the Visitors Gallery, a number of representatives of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Small Firms Association, Dublin Chamber of Commerce and local chambers of commerce, including the Letterkenny and County Laois chambers.  I will be parochial and give a special welcome to my colleague from the Carrick-on-Suir Business Association, Seamus Campbell, a good Letterkenny man who supports Finn Harps.</P>
        <P>When a retailer opens his or her shop door in the morning he or she is at once a worker, a business person and an employer.  I wish to debunk the myth that the Labour Party is anti-business.  The majority of my Labour Party colleagues in the Seanad are either directly involved in business, come from a business background or are from families who own a business.  My mother ran a greengrocer&rsquo;s shop for many years, while my father bought bread from my grandfather, a baker, and established a bread round in south County Tipperary.  He remained self-employed for many years.</P>
        <P>Social democrats across Europe, especially in the Scandinavian countries, have been to the forefront of business and business opportunity.  Europe has some of the greatest economies in the world, notwithstanding the global recession.   That is proof positive that social democrats can also be business people who are pro-business, particularly pro-small business, as that is what we are discussing here today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unlike the banks, the Labour Party is open for business and open to business.  We sincerely welcome the visitors to the Visitors Gallery in order that they can witness this debate which I hope will be of assistance to small businesses.  In the last Administration the Labour Party served in, under the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, the Labour Party and its Fine Gael colleagues in government created 1,000 jobs per week.  When we left government in 1997, this country was on a sound financial footing.  I will not go into the history that followed, we are all aware of what happened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government so far has introduced an action plan for jobs and the Minister of State is directly involved in it.  We aim to create 100,000 jobs in the next number of years.  We aim to put &euro;150 million into capital schemes for small businesses, to create a micro-loan funds scheme of &euro;100 million for small businesses and we are already providing assistance and mentoring to small businesses across the country.  The county and city enterprise systems have been turned upside down and Enterprise Ireland is now coming to the fore for the provision of services and employment opportunities in Ireland.  We are doing a good job and we have only been in government for one year.  There are, however, many other things that need to be done.  This motion is about the issues that we see as Labour Party Senators who have listened, discussed and seen through our own life experiences the pressure placed on small businesses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This motion is an attempt to focus the attention of Government on a number of specific areas.  My colleagues will deal with the specifics in detail as we go through the debate.  We want to see positive action on late payments and an open tender process where it does not cost small businesses to submit tenders, as is the case in Britain.  We want to ensure there is social protection for the self-employed who, if they are sick, must rely on their savings to survive or, if they lose their business, have no social protection at all.  The person who opens the door is a worker, but as he or she is also self-employed, he or she should be treated the same. </P><P Just="Left">We want to tackle high business rates. I served on a local authority for almost 25 years and those rates are crippling small businesses, particularly in rural Ireland. We want to see opportunities for savings and pension schemes to be reinvested into one&rsquo;s own business or certainly into the general business world. Most importantly, we want to see real access to credit, not what we hear from the banks. Last year, despite what the banks said, the Central Bank reports that only &euro;3.1 billion was made available to small businesses. This year the target is &euro;7 billion and we want every cent of that to be available to small businesses. The Government has put that in place and we want to ensure it can be drawn down. I spent an hour with an accountant on Monday and he told me of five cases where the bank offered the loan but the terms were so prohibitive that not one of his clients could take it. </P>
        <P>We welcome the efforts of business in this country.  Chartered Accountants Ireland has made free business mentoring available to struggling small businesses.  Is that not socialism at work?  I think it is.  It is the social democratic attitude to help a fellow person who is struggling.  We have also seen at local level strong businesses mentoring new and up and coming businesses.  We have seen 30,000 civil servants retiring in the last few months, some of them at 50 years of age, who have collateral and funding and who want to start small businesses.  They have good ideas and we need to encourage people to put the money into starting businesses and creating employment.</P>
        <P>We acknowledge the problems that have been outlined by ISME, the Small Firms Association and Dublin Chamber of Commerce that there are delays of up to 120 days in payments, which is unsustainable for any small business.  The lack of a social welfare safety net is a major problem for small businesses, as are the difficulties in the tendering process, the high costs for energy and transport and the resistance of banks to lending.  We recognise all of these problems.  Our target and that of business in this country should be that most of the &euro;14 billion per annum put up by Government and local authorities for tendering should be kept in this country.  That equates to 11.5% of GNP, a huge amount.</P>
        <P>During this debate, my colleagues will outline in detail how the Labour Party feels these issues can be tackled and how together with the business organisations and community, the worker can remain as an employer and we can work together in small, medium and large businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and acknowledge our guests in the Visitors Gallery.</P>
        <P>Before I commence my contribution I want to say that I had hoped that we could add to the goal of helping small and medium businesses in these constrained times.  I had hoped that we could discuss some of the measures that we Labour Party Senators think might go some way towards finding solutions.  It would be easier to discuss these ideas, however, if we had some Members from the Opposition here to listen to what we are saying.  I am very disappointed with the turnout.  I hope that this debate can be taken in the manner in which it is intended and not used as an exercise for Government bashing and I trust that my colleagues on the other side of the House, when they arrive, will indulge us in this.</P>
        <P>To underscore the importance of this sector, we note that SMEs account for 99% of enterprises and 68% of employment.  We have seen the economy shrink by nearly 20% in four years, we have seen unemployment rise by nearly 300,000 in the same period and we have seen businesses starved of finance.  If we are to recover, and we will recover, the SME sector has a vital role to play in that recovery.  We have seen welcome growth in export revenue but the domestic side of the economy remains flat.  Without growth on the domestic side, we will not achieve sustainable levels of employment or a meaningful level of progress.</P>
        <P>My colleagues will outline some of our ideas but I will concentrate on an issue which has received widespread comment recently, namely, allowing directors of companies have access to their pensions in order to support their businesses.  We have structured the motion in the manner outlined to tease out the implications of this suggestion.  There is a certain attraction in this proposal.  If a director of a company has built up a substantial pension fund and now finds that his business is facing challenges in accessing finance, why should that director not be allowed to use a portion of his pension fund to support that business?  It is a sensible and simple option but in life few things are simple and in politics few things are sensible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One difficulty that becomes apparent when we examine this issue is the idea, which is a core issue with regard to pensions and the theory underpinning the provision of pensions, of risk diversity.  Best practice in this regard says that one&rsquo;s entire pension fund should not be invested in one sector of the economy or in one geographical area.  The risk should be spread across a range of sectors and industries and even a range of countries.  We can imagine what would have happened if the pension industry had decided during the boom that property in Ireland would yield a good return or, worse, that shares in Anglo Irish Bank would.  What if we had invested a substantial portion of our pension funds in such areas?  Thankfully, we did not.  Diversity of risk is very welcome in this area.</P>
        <P>We must be informed by the expert view in this case.  That view clearly points in the direction that the proposal might not achieve the outcome we hope to achieve and that the entire assets of a business owner, that is, his business and pension, would be exposed to risk if we followed this course of action.  However, there is scope to develop and further examine the merits of this proposal.  We should examine the issue of pension fund investment in a more strategic way.  There are &euro;72 billion in Irish pension funds and approximately 19% of these funds are invested in Ireland.  The Irish Taxation Institute has proposed that we should find a way to incentivise the industry to invest more in small and medium enterprise.  It suggests that a 5% investment would result in a fund of &euro;3.5 billion being made available for investment in this sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main responsibility of pension fund trustees is to maximise the benefit and return to their members.  We must find a way to make it an attractive proposition for managers of pension funds to make this decision.  I do not believe we can legislate to coerce pension funds to act in this way, nor would it be desirable.  I believe this must be done through the taxation system.  I am aware that a great deal of work is being done in this area in the Department and in some private sector institutions.  We expect a working paper to emerge in the near future which might give expression in further detail to some of the ideas I have mentioned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another area where the pension funds could play a vital part in national recovery is through investment in high potential start-up enterprises.  These are enterprises that employ ten people or have a turnover of more than &euro;1 million and have export potential.  It is noticeable, and ironic, that the main seed fund and venture funds in Ireland appear to be risk averse.  Several business ideas have failed due to the scarcity of investment or risk money.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s annual report shows that it has &euro;15 million to invest in seed capital.  Again, if we can find a way to incentivise the pension funds to invest in this area, it would make all the difference for many entrepreneurs. Even a 0.1% investment would make &euro;72 million available. This is minuscule in the general scheme of things but imagine what the most imaginative and innovative entrepreneurs in this country could do if they had access to such a fund. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I could speak all day on this issue, but I doubt the Acting Chairman would allow that.  I will conclude by asking the Minister to give consideration to some of the ideas I have outlined.  I hope to speak personally to the Minister or his officials in the next couple of days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">After &ldquo;at this time&rdquo; in the third line to add:</P>
        <P FLI="0">&ldquo;&mdash;criticises the Government&rsquo;s ongoing failure to address the lack of credit available to SMEs.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that the Government has completely abandoned its pre-election and programme for Government promises on addressing upward only rent reviews; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> further notes that the Government parties, the Labour Party and Fine Gael, have a control of the majority of rate setting local authorities across the country.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry.  I am fascinated by the contributions of the two Senators.  Is it due to feeling guilty that they put down this motion?  They are in Government.  The issue I wish to address is access to credit, which Members have heard me discussing on numerous occasions in the past six months.  I do not know why the Senators cannot exert their influence on their partners in government on the issue of lack of credit for SMEs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the Order of Business this morning we spoke about the disarray in the Government regarding the DEIS schools and its lack of leadership in dealing with the household charge.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the charge, and has supported it from the start.  I paid the charge immediately.  However, the lack of leadership by the Government on this issue is pitiful and it has frightened people throughout Ireland.  It is chaotic.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is saying one thing, that the charge can be paid in a post office, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said two weeks ago that people liked to get a bill.  I find that confusing.  Then the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, said that the Government had handled it badly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In some ways the Taoiseach is making great progress.  I compliment him on his visit to China where there are outstanding opportunities for Irish companies.  The opportunities there are awesome.  However, at the same time, on the issue of the lack of credit for small and medium-sized companies, the Government produced the action plan on jobs.  As a business person, I find paperwork and a long report ridiculous.  I want the Government and its Labour Party members to walk the walk, not just write reports.  They should demand a trajectory for securing money from the banks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, is an outstanding proponent for small business.  He is putting in a huge effort to attend regional meetings throughout the country and to speak to companies.  His heart is in the right place and he knows from where I am coming on this issue.  However, businesses are finding it practically impossible to access loans or proper credit facilities to enable them to protect existing jobs and create new ones.  The absence of credit is causing businesses to reduce their workforces or even close down.</P>
        <P>The Government must take action to guarantee increased credit to struggling businesses.  I am anxious to hear what the Labour Party Senators, who are due to speak later, will say in response to my comments on the lack of access to credit and why the Government has not made it available.  As the Minister pointed out in his report on small business, there are almost 200,000 small businesses in Ireland supporting almost 700,000 people.  A significant number of these firms employ fewer than ten people.  Many trade on international markets but there is huge potential to improve their exports and to create employment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">At the beginning of March I heard the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, speak at a conference in the Central Bank on small and medium-sized business and I wondered why the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Finance did not listen to him.  He said that Ireland was the most difficult country in the eurozone for small businesses to access credit, and that credit was not flowing as freely in Ireland as it was in other European countries.  He stated, &ldquo;Credit conditions for SMEs are tougher in Ireland than anywhere elsewhere in the euro area both in terms of cost and availability.&rdquo;  He went on to point out that Irish small and medium-sized businesses were the second least successful, after those in Greece, in obtaining credit, according to an EU survey on access to finance in the euro area.  At that conference, the Central Bank found that credit conditions were substantially less favourable for Irish companies.  The conference examined factors such as likelihood to be rejected for a loan, the size of loans, the level of collateral required to secure them and the commission, fees and interest rate charged.  All of these were substantially less favourable in Ireland than in the average euro area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 12 March, ISME reported that 91% of companies had stated that banks were making it more difficult to access finance.  Some 92% of SMEs say the Government is making no difference or is having a negative effect on lending to small and medium enterprises. ISME&rsquo;s chief executive, Mr. Mark Fielding, said: &ldquo;We must put an end to the fiction that bailed out Irish banks are functioning properly ... access to credit is abysmal, the application process is getting longer and businesses are not being told their rights.&rdquo;  Senator Landy drew attention to the representative of ISME in the Visitors Gallery. I do not know why the Senator is not mortified and embarrassed. Mr. Fielding continued his comments by saying &ldquo;the banks are simply the living dead. They restrict credit lines, delay decisions, miss deadlines and generally hinder progress.&rdquo; </P>
        
        
        <P Just="Left">On many occasions in this House, I have told the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, that there is a crisis in the economy.  On the one hand, we know that demand is falling because consumers are not spending, while those who have money are saving it.  The retail sector is flat but we need to keep small and medium enterprises going.  I find it amazing that the Government side is so blas&eacute; about it.  I am constantly amazed that Government party Senators are not putting pressure on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Finance in this regard.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State will have to say about this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">How many times have we heard the micro-finance and loan guarantee schemes being announced?  They were in the Fine Gael manifesto.  I understand why Labour Party Members want to get their credentials right and say they are for business.  I never thought they were anything else.  They do not have to prove that to me.  In government, however, they are not putting pressure on the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to get credit made available.  They should stop listening to the banks and listen to businesses instead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I thank the Labour Party for instigating the debate, which is very useful.  I also thank Senator White because she knows more than most people about the challenges facing small businesses.  I wish to address a number of issues in this debate and I hope that, if they are not within the Minister of State&rsquo;s remit, he will refer them on.  The Labour Party motion mentions the provision of greater levels of social protection, including protection in the event of illness for those who are self-employed and whose business fails, leading to a collapse in income.  I, for one, do not wish to harp on about business failures but it is a reality that many people face because every week there are more of them.  While we do not want to emphasise failure and wish to celebrate success, we also want to recognise the reality.</P>
        <P>A number of years ago, when the boom turned to bust, many people were badly caught out.  This was because they had high incomes on paper in 2007 or 2008 as tradesmen, including block layers or plasterers, and then sought the dole when they had no other income.  Social welfare officials examined the previous year&rsquo;s accounts which showed that they were doing really well and thus failed a means test.</P>
        <P>At the time, the former Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v &mdash; for whom Senator White has great time, as do I &mdash; straightened out procedures in the Department of Social Protection concerning the self-employed.  He acknowledged that it was quite a complicated process to analyse the sort of accounts that would be presented to social welfare officers by self-employed people, particularly if they had bought an investment property that went wrong.  A system was put in place, however, whereby social welfare officials were to look at the accounts and the position that pertained at the time of the application.  Some progress was made in that regard.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, however, I have met self-employed people in my clinics who are now out of work.  They are effectively being torpedoed by community welfare officers and social welfare officers who say their income is too high to qualify for the dole.  They are seeking last year&rsquo;s accounts and other material that is not relevant to those people&rsquo;s current situation.  I understood the situation to have been addressed by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v when he was a Minister.  At the time, I noticed improvements in it.  The former Minister produced a complicated document on the complex process of examining these accounts.</P>
        <P>Has there been a policy change in the Department of Social Protection on this matter?  Has the Department changed the procedures to slow down applications or prevent people from getting money?  That is my strong suspicion.  I know it is happening with regard to the carer&rsquo;s allowance and the disability allowance.  There is a deliberate slow-down and, in fact, a departmental official told me that.  Is the same happening with respect to self-employed people?  Are they slowing down applications to stop money being paid out where it should be paid?</P>
        <P>I know of one case in my constituency of a self-employed person who is now unemployed and, due to his financial problems and the difficulties he is having with the Department of Social Protection, it is leading to mental stress and illness.  Senator White is an expert in that area and I am sure she has seen it in this context many times.  The problem is not just that the mental illness is devastating for him and his family but also that it is preventing him from resuming business activities because he is mentally unable to do so.  In addition, no financial support is being offered for the basic, daily human essentials that social welfare is supposed to provide.</P>
        <P>Is there any way in which the procedures applying to the self-employed can be simplified, while acknowledging that the situation may be complex?  I know social welfare officers are under severe pressure but they should be trained to deal with self-employed applicants.  It should be recognised that when a person closes down their shop, they are not likely to have much of an income.  They may have had an income one or two months ago, but if the shop is gone, the likelihood is that there is no income.  They are not hiding some secret source of income from selling cigarettes around the back of the house.  That is not happening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A change of attitude is required in the Department to treat such people more fairly.  It would give them some basic assistance which one would hope would keep them from the onset of mental illness.  They may then begin to think of resuming in business, creating employment and furthering the economy.  I wanted to raise that point while accepting we should also be looking at success and encouraging people in this regard.  Nonetheless the plight of self-employed people who no longer have work is a reality I have increasingly encountered in my clinics in recent months.  I am surprised because I thought such attitudes had been eliminated from departmental thinking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  I agree with Senator Byrne because I have many friends in that scenario.  He is right to say the situation has improved but it should not regress to where it was.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be wrong of me not to reply to Senator White, for whom I have the greatest respect.  The business model that was applied here from 1997 to 2010 certainly did not leave much money in the country or in the banks.  It is very difficult trying to sort that all out.</P>
        <P>I have been self-employed for 26 years, have been at the coalface and know exactly what it is like.  Nobody can lecture me on what it is like in the small business sector because many of my friends and colleagues have been in the same situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important matter, the role small businesses can play in our economic recovery.  The ability of small businesses to succeed and grow will underpin our potential for job creation and prosperity, particularly as they are embedded in local communities.  The Government&rsquo;s recent action plan for jobs and the comprehensive report entitled, The Rise of Small Business, published this year by the Minister, outline the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring the SME sector is supported and allowed to develop in order that it would realise its full potential.</P>
        <P>In excess of 200,000 small businesses employ an estimated 650,000 people.  Small businesses have always been the backbone of our communities and I welcome the spotlight that has been shone on them by the Government&rsquo;s programme, starting with the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Those involved in the small business sector are willing to take risks and commit themselves.  They are willing to put in their own funds, take on a lease and seek bank funding.  They also recognise that there will be local authority charges in the form of rates and water services.  They know there are certain costs associated with taking on one or more employees, but they take the risk.  It is because they want to make money but also because they want to play their part in providing services and employment in their own villages, towns and cities.</P>
        <P>We have all spoken to small business owners who talk of the job that runs for 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  That is because they take the job home with them.  In the current economic climate the focus is on encouraging people to become entrepreneurs by starting their own businesses or supporting existing small businesses.  This Government has given them a voice.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Mary White on the need for credit.  A number of elements are covered in the motion and I will address some of them, particularly the need to access credit and finance facilities for small businesses which continues to be a major obstacle for existing businesses and those who want to start their own business.  It is welcome that Mr. John Trethowan who is fronting the Credit Review Office is on the board responsible for the action plan for small business established by the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry.  It is important that he hear at first hand about the difficulties people involved in business are experiencing in negotiating funding from their bank.  The Credit Review Office was established to provide an effective review process with an independent opinion if and when credit applications are refused by banks.  The review process will review banks&rsquo; decisions to review, reduce or withdraw credit facilities.  The process is initiated by the borrower and it is important to note that there is no other authorised channel where anyone can intervene with a bank and in its relationship with its client.  I see from the latest review from Mr. Trethowan&rsquo;s office, published last month, that in 54% of cases in which the Credit Review Office adjudicated on a decision of a bank not to lend or to withdraw credit, the bank&rsquo;s decision was reversed; therefore, there is a positive outcome.  The services of the office are available to customers and it is certainly putting itself out there and making its services known.  It is important to note that the two pillar banks are also obliged to inform customers about the services of the office.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that not all small businesses are viable and that not all credit applications can be met.  All requests need to viewed against a backdrop of the economic feasibility of a particular business.  However, it is encouraging to read in Mr. Trethowan&rsquo;s report that he is determined to ensure a business with potential gains access to credit.  He has consistently pointed out that overly rigid lending policies continue to be a source of concern for him and this continues to be the case, according to the latest review.  We all agree with this.  I certainly agree with Senator Mary White in this regard.</P>
        <P>In its recent action plan for jobs the Government committed to developing a temporary targeted partial credit guarantee scheme and a micro-finance fund which would have a positive impact on small business.  The partial credit guarantee scheme will place Irish small and medium enterprises on a competitive footing, relative to their international competitors who often have the opportunity to avail of loan guarantees in their own countries.  I look forward to publication of the legislation surrounding the partial credit guarantee scheme which is being designed.</P>
        <P>I note in the action plan for jobs that the partial credit guarantee scheme will be reviewed at the end of the year.  This is important, because often such schemes are established and set out without ensuring a follow-up to see how they are operating.  In a recent submission to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education, Enterprise Ireland spoke about the support it was providing for SMEs.  It was heartening to hear its officials speak about the work they were doing with the banks.  Staff of Enterprise Ireland have been seconded to the banks to inform credit decisions in the modern sectors and markets because we hear, anecdotally and factually, that the banks do not have the necessary expertise, as they focused their energies in the past ten years on making profit from property, which is no longer sustainable.  These staff can inform those who are lending to businesses such as those involved in food technology, medi-services, green technology and many more about the value of these businesses and how they can operate in European and international markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motion also notes the need to address the high level of rates payable to local authorities.  Anyone who has ever been a member of a local authority knows the valuable role of commercial rates in balancing the budgets of local authorities.  However, it is important that local representatives and managers of authorities are aware of the difficulties small businesses face.  There is a point beyond which a small business cannot operate.  I was pleased to note that the action plan for jobs stressed the need for local authorities to exercise restraint in this regard.  A commitment was given to accelerate the programme for the re-evaluation of commercial premises.  I have come across a couple of such cases.  This would provide a basis to adjust the burden of commercial rates in many local authorities. Local authorities are always encouraged to exercise restraint in setting the level of commercial rates.  I look forward to the contribution that will be made to local authorities by the household charge and from the, soon to be introduced, property tax.  No one is happy about paying the charge, but income will be gathered and delivered to spend on local facilities and services, which must be welcomed.  The charge has been particularly welcomed by Chambers Ireland which represents small businesses, as it recognises the need to ensure the financial burden is shared in communities.</P>
        <P>The plan also mentions the need to ensure local authorities consider the impact of development contributions on small business and competitiveness in general.  This is something I brought to the attention of previous Ministers.  Development charges set at the height of the boom are no longer viable for many small developments.  In many cases, the high levels set have discouraged businesses from proceeding with extensions or similar works.</P>
        <P>Local businesses also welcome investment in the development of water services throughout the country and the proposed establishment of the national water authority.  This will lead to greater transparency.  For too long, businesses have suspected that they have been sharing the cost of domestic water services and moves to assist them, whereby one will pay for water on the basis of usage, will be more accountable.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has stated all houses will have a certain generous amount of water for which they will not be charged.</P>
        <P>The issue of procurement and the facility of SMEs competing for procurement has always been to the forefront of small business associations and the people they represent in their communities.  The Government has given a commitment to work to ensure small businesses are assisted.  Advisers and mentors with specific public sector knowledge will advise and help firms to win more sales and procure contracts.  Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities will highlight the opportunities for businesses and local SMEs and ensure more local businesses and SMEs register on the eTenders website to enable opportunities to be created for them.</P>
        <P>I travelled the hills in February 2011 with a Fine Gael colleague, as we canvassed in the general election.  He remarked, &ldquo;There is a lot of negativity in Fine Gael.&rdquo;  There is negativity everywhere, but we might just get it right as a Government.  I firmly believe we will.</P>

        <P>I welcome the holding of this debate.  It is indisputable that the potential of small businesses must be exploited to the full if Ireland is to develop a sustainable and robust economy.  We note that there are very good ideas in the Labour Party Senators&rsquo; motion which we fully support.  It would remiss of me, however, not to point out that while motions such as this are positive, if overall Government policy is focused on contracting the economy, we cannot expect small businesses to overcome it.  If we are serious about giving small businesses a boost, we must come forward with a genuine plan to provide an economic stimulus.  Austerity is not working for young people who are unemployed in record numbers and it is not working for small businesses.  Sadly, I see nothing in the motion as it stands that reflects that reality.</P>
        <P>The most glaring omission from the motion which is rectified by the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is a call for the Government to reverse the VAT hike.  I know the increase is being felt most acutely in Border areas, but small businesses everywhere are feeling the pain of this ill-thought out rise.  Only last week the new figures released showed a contraction of the domestic economy.  The Government must reverse the VAT hike to give small businesses and the domestic economy a chance.  Senator Tony Mulcahy cited statements from Chambers Ireland.  That body released another statement today stating, &ldquo;The effect of the rise in VAT is now clear for all to see, with retail sales declining for the last two months following on from a rise in December 2011&rdquo;.  Chambers Ireland urges the Government to think about the consequences the rise in VAT to 23% is having for consumer confidence and the struggling retail sector.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party Senators correctly raise the issue of rates, but I am disappointed by the language used.  &ldquo;Addressing high rates&rdquo; is easily said, but what does it mean?  Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing a move towards a progressive rates system.  Larger, typically non-indigenous, retailers can afford to carry a larger burden of the total amount collected in rates.  This would allow some breathing space for smaller, usually indigenous, businesses and reverse the trend of small businesses and local shops closing down, particularly in rural areas.</P>
        <P>In their pre-election manifestos the Government parties promised to address the issue of upward-only rent reviews, but this has not happened.  This practice must be tackled, as it is stifling business and development.  It is preventing people from developing small businesses, but it is not mentioned in the Labour Party motion.</P>
        <P>The issue of credit is mentioned, rightly so.  What is not mentioned, however, is that the banks are now, to a large degree, in State ownership.  The Government should be using that leverage to compel them to begin lending to small businesses again.  The Government also has in its power the expedition of the promised partial loan credit guarantee scheme and micro-enterprise credit scheme.  These are practical steps which would bring immediate practical benefits to small enterprises.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has also been brought to my attention that the Central Bank is putting in place a deleveraging scheme with the banks which is putting pressure on them and not allowing them to lend to smaller enterprises.  It is stifling the banks' ability to do that.  The Minister for Finance could examine the way the Central Bank deleveraging scheme is having a detrimental effect in the short term.  The other side of the coin is the fact that the banks do not have a problem overpaying their chief executive officers and other high ranking staff in the banks.  The &euro;300,000 paid to one executive in the Bank of Ireland would give a good kick-start if divided up between ten small businesses, not to mention the other perks such as health club membership and other benefits that are still being paid for with the support of taxpayers&rsquo; money being put into the banks.  The issue of dealing with late payments is also a crucial one.  Small businesses need certainty on when they can expect to get paid.  The public sector and, critically, NAMA, must shape up.  A strict regime of prompt payment should be brought into being.</P>
        <P>The Government should also seek to ensure that being self-employed does not mean being left without a safety net if things go wrong.  This should include allowing them to avail of social welfare benefits.  The current system doubly punishes the self-employed in difficult times.  The system must be changed to allow self-employed people to invest and work with the knowledge that the social welfare net is available to them if the worst comes to the worst.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have seen an increase in exports but it must be noted that it is mainly driven by the multinationals.  If we are to grow the economy we must focus on small and medium enterprises, SMEs, to ensure they are able to export.  One of the factors that is stymieing them that we have discussed on a number of occasions is the cost of fuel.  The Minister for Finance has not addressed the fact that the cost of a litre of petrol and diesel has increased so much in recent months. We had an opportunity to change that last week but when the Minister was in the House I did not see any Fine Gael or Labour Party Senators jumping up and down and saying that needed to be done. However, it does need to be done. </P><P Just="Left">We have also seen tens of millions of euro squandered by the Government. Money was available from the European Union to retrain workers let off by Dell, Waterford Crystal and people in the construction industry but it was handed back without being used. That is absolutely disgraceful. We must get people retrained in order that they can find gainful employment. </P><P Just="Left">In its pre-election manifesto the Labour Party promised a strategic investment bank. Where is it? The local and community development programme, LCDP, used to provide services to people, in particular individuals who wanted to set up their own business. We have seen severe cuts in these areas, for example, of up to 35% in the community and voluntary sector, and the LCDP is one of those programmes. It is stifling the supports that were available to people on the ground who would set up small and medium enterprises. We also heard of a plan to subsume county enterprise boards. I consider that a retrograde step. It will not help people who want to set up small and medium enterprises around the country. </P><P Just="Left">In the Gaeltacht areas we have seen cuts to the capital grants of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. That has meant that in Gaeltacht areas it has been impossible to keep the level of employment as it has been in previous years. The cut must be reversed in order that jobs can be created in the future. </P><P Just="Left">One of the main problems faced by small and medium enterprises is being hounded by Revenue. That must be said because in previous years Revenue might have been able to show a certain amount of leniency but it is lethal in the way it is now following up cases and making sure that people have paid up by the deadline which gives people big problems from a cash-flow perspective.</P><P Just="Left">Two groups were left out of the JobBridge programme, namely, single parents and people with a disability. There is a discrimination against them. I am aware of single parents in particular who want to set up their own business but were not able to avail of JobBridge in order to do that. </P><P Just="Left">As we have consistently done, we welcome the positive ideas and we have provided some of our own. My colleague, Senator Cullinane, will further outline the Sinn F&eacute;in position. Go ginear&aacute;lta, ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh na molta&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta. Is mian linn cur leo. Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil leas&uacute; curtha chun cinn againn. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and all our guests in the Visitors Gallery.  In line with what Senator Landy said about Labour Party Senators being involved in business, as I was born and bred in a small retail shop in a rural area &mdash; my parents are still running it &mdash; I know a little about small business.  I do not claim to know everything but I have opinions on certain issues relating to business.</P>
        <P>I will speak on three aspects of the motion.  The first relates to opening up the rules on tendering and procurement to enable a wide range of firms and businesses to seek public contracts.  This is an important issue.  Under EU law we are making it easy for foreign companies to come to this country and get big contracts.  We do not seem to be able to compete with them, in particular on major road projects.  One could ask what is the material gain for us in doing that.  There is no material gain.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Identifying Opportunities for Sustainable Public Procurement&rdquo;, is a document that was produced by ClientEarth.  It outlines the importance of ensuring sustainability criteria to achieve the most economically advantageous tender.  It suggests that in any tender process it should not be just about the cheapest price.  For road projects the Spaniards and Turks will offer the cheapest price and they will have their own money but in such a tendering process one must also build in whether there is a locally based company, if the company is a rate payer, and how many people are employed locally.  If and when a local person gets a contract he or she will employ people and take them off the dole.  They will be paying taxes in this country and there will be an economic advantage.  That must be built into any future tendering processes for major works.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second part of the motion refers to the provision of greater levels of social protection, including protection in the event of illness, for those who are self-employed and, in particular, for those whose businesses fail, leading to a collapse in income.  I am a long-time campaigner for the self-employed who have no rights in the event of their becoming sick or unemployed.  When I ran for the Seanad election it was the No. 1 item on my campaign card.  When I ran in the previous election the same was the case.  As I have worked in that field for 28 years, I can understand the problems such people have.  Following consultation between Labour Party Senators and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, we hope to find a resolution to the matter as soon as possible by means of a voluntary contribution that will entitle the self-employed to get disability benefit in the event of illness rather than the current means-tested payment for which they would probably not qualify.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the recommendations of the advisory group on small businesses on commercial rates.  The group said that although rates are generally a relatively small proportion of business costs for many businesses, they can be particularly burdensome for some enterprises.  That is the truth.  I have called on numerous occasions in this House for a national review of commercial rates.  Some time ago a pilot scheme was carried out in three local authority areas in Dublin.  The outcome was a 35% reduction in rates for those local authority areas.  The Valuation Office says because it only has 12 or 14 staff it does not have the resources to address the issue but there is talk of outsourcing valuations.  That should be considered in order that the matter will be dealt with soon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ridiculous situations arise across the country.  I am from County Roscommon.  Monksland is a large area in the county on the River Shannon adjacent to Athlone.  The rate per square foot in the thriving town of Athlone is &euro;52.27 and the rate in Monksland across the River Shannon is &euro;74.34.  There is a difference of &euro;22.  Why would anyone consider setting up a business in Monksland with such a rate?  This is not something local authorities can deal with as they can reduce their rates by 1% or 2% if they can find savings for the benefit of small businesses but they cannot find savings of 22% or up to 35%.  The solution must be found at Government level by putting a national review in place.  The advisory group on small business also said that potential savings of &euro;511 million could be found through local government efficiencies.  I ask the Minister of State from where those efficiencies are to come and whether they will be passed on to the ratepayers, because it is vital that they are.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and I have spoken about rates and are agreed on one matter, that we should possibly consider a two-tier rates system &mdash; one for the blue-chip companies and one for smaller businesses.  As I have stated repeatedly, I cannot see the logic in a small business, which employs one or two persons and has a rates bill of &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 that it simply cannot pay, closing and putting the two employees on the dole at a cost of &euro;42,000.  There is no logic at all in that.  There must be a better way.  If the local authority were to forgo the rates, there would still be a saving of &euro;38,000 to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I have always stated, as I did a year and a half ago in Roscommon when Mr. Mark Fielding was present, that we should also look at the social welfare budget to create jobs rather than keep claimants at home.  If, as I stated, it costs &euro;21,000 a year to keep a person on the dole and we wanted to create 100,000 jobs by offering &euro;10,000 of that &euro;21,000 to an employer to employ somebody, we would saving &euro;1.1 billion per year and create 100,000 jobs from which employees would pay tax, charges, etc.</P>
        <P>On tourism and the hotel sector, many hotels are struggling.  There was one in my home town of Ballaghadereen employing 40, but as I told the Minister of State previously, it had a rates bill of &euro;40,000 a year and a water rates bill of &euro;30,000.  It was not able to pay that, as a result of which it closed and 40 people went on the dole at a cost to the taxpayer of &euro;840,000.  Why is there not an agency to deal with this to save money?  If that rates bill could have been forgone, we would still save &euro;750,000 to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>NAMA is concentrating far too much on the UK market, and I have said as much in the House previously.  From speaking to auctioneers and estate agents, I am aware that they have been in contact with NAMA to buy properties at a modest price for those who are willing to set up in business and NAMA is dragging its heels on this.  Many months later, NAMA has not signed on the dotted line.  There are people waiting to set up business and we are not doing anything about it as a Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Byrne regarding the self-employed, but it was Fianna F&aacute;il that put the self-employed on the dole.  When that party had an opportunity in recent years, it never looked after them once.  Now the Senator is blaming us for the mess his party created.</P>

	<P Just="Left">From 1997 to 2008 the workforce increased from a little under 1 million to 2.2 million. I presume that happened by some act of God that had nothing whatsoever to do with Fianna F&aacute;il. There are still 1.8 million employed despite, or in spite of, all the difficulties facing those who are unemployed. Even the loss of one job creates its own distress, both for the individual and also for his or her family. Not only that, it also trickles down into the local community. </P><P Just="Left">My friend and colleague, Senator White has been consistent in her criticism of what she believes to be the lack of credit being made available to SMEs. A rather interesting exchange took place about two weeks ago in this House. As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, the economic affairs sub-committee met both ISME&rsquo;s Mr. Mark Fielding and the representative of the Small Firms Association which, I believe, is attached to IBEC. As I said to Senator White following the meeting, we came away more confused than informed. Mr. Fielding, for whom I have the highest regard, was able to cite specific examples of firms which were in extreme difficulty and were not only failing to get credit but also having their overdraft facilities converted into term loans, yet the Small Firms&rsquo; Association stated that all the Government targets on bank lending had been met. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, was in the House and he also made the same statement, which was challenged by Senator White because of anecdotal evidence. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, who I trust will forgive me my bad manners in that I should have welcomed him to the House at the outset of my contribution, might have a view on that. He has hit the ground running and is doing the best job he can in difficult circumstances. I wish him continued success in that regard. </P><P Just="Left">There seems to be some confusion. There is evidence being cited that small firms are not getting credit and, on the other hand, there is what is being said by everybody else, including the Small Firms Association, whose bona fides I will not question but which sits on a Government-sponsored task force and which maybe has gone a bit native in terms of parroting the Government line. I do not doubt for one minute that the figures being supplied by the banks to the Government are in any way to be impugned. It is the manner in which these figures are collated. </P>
        <P>It was pointed out that it was probably more cost-effective for a small firm to go onto a term loan than to continue with an overdraft, but surely the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, who himself comes from a small business background, would appreciate that all businesses need some form of cashflow to survive, particularly as the seasonal nature of a number of firms requires that they need it at certain times of the year, and that seems to have been closed off to them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motion refers to &ldquo;opening up the rules on tender and procurement again to enable a wider range of firms and businesses to seek public contracts&rdquo;, with which we would all agree.  There was a reaction when the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, first referred to the possibility of centralising public procurement contracts.  Referring, for example, to stationery and other basic elements of small and medium-sized business, but as it applied to local authorities, he said it might be more cost-effective to have a more centralised form of procurement.  The point was made at the time that if the Government were to go down that road, laudable and all as it may seem in theory, the reality is that small local businesses would not benefit.  For example, where a local authority gives preferment to small local businesses for a wide variety of services it provides, there would be a danger if it were to be centralised to the point referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, that local businesses would suffer and jobs would be lost.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, might address that question of procurement.  What is the sentiment in Government in this regard?  Is some form of central procurement being proceeded with, notwithstanding that we all agree it should be widened to include as many firms as possible?</P>
        <P Just="Left">It goes without saying that we would all support the view that those who are self-employed should be given some form of social protection.  While I accept political charges across the floor as being part and parcel of life in this House, the question relating to the protection of the self-employed did not arise during the Celtic tiger years as we were building an entrepreneurial class in this country because people were doing well.  It is quite obvious, however, that within the 450,000 unemployed are those who built up businesses in good time which have gone to the wall through no fault of their own because of the economic downturn.  By the way, the downturn does not apply only to this country, which we need to keep repeating.  It is a European and worldwide problem following the bank crisis of 2008, which was year zero in terms of the economic downturn.  If that had not happened, the history of the past four years might be a different narrative.  Having said that, given that it is germane and pertinent, there should be some acknowledgement of the financial distress in which the self-employed find themselves when their businesses have gone to the wall.  It is an issue now where it was not an issue previously.  Even in these straitened times, I would hope there would be some way the Government might look at this area in order that it would be able to provide some financial comfort for the formerly self-employed and their families.</P>
        <P>On the question of local authority rates, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and I discussed in recent years the possibility of setting up a bank similar to the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC, which primarily existed to help small businesses.  There were ideas circulating in the Department and from the Minister of State with regard to creating a risk capital financial institution or other financial outlet to underwrite venture capitalists with sound business ideas.  This idea would have been borrowed from a number of countries, not least Taiwan, in which the Minister of State did excellent work as chairman of the Ireland-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Society during his tenure.  He might have views on whether that idea is being progressed or whether there are others to provide some protection through a venture capital financial institution to underwrite those with good ideas.  I am not talking about difficult projects in this context.</P>
        <P>There is a further issue which I raised with the previous Government, although I accept it is probably a non-runner in these straitened times.  There are a number of family-owned hotels, particularly in the west, that are in need of some refurbishment.  Despite the excellent initiatives taken by the Government to try to improve tourist numbers, the west is suffering, as the Minister of State is aware.  While tourist numbers are rising, the increase is mainly in Dublin and the west is not gaining to the extent it should, despite its excellent infrastructure.  Is it possible to consider the introduction grant aid for the refurbishment of family-owned hotels to make them more competitive?</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, as well as the representatives of the business community in the Visitors Gallery, particularly those from Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce who have made their way here today from County Donegal.  Anyone who knows anything about business in the Border area will know there are extra difficulties being encountered as a result of the sterling-euro exchange rate and the differences in VAT rates, although the difference in the exchange rate is the bigger issue, as I know from talking to people in County Donegal.</P>
        <P>The issue of VAT has been raised in the debate.  A differential of 1% or 2% in the rate of VAT will not make or break a business, given the difficulties in getting businesses up and running.  Like Senator Tony Mulcahy, I have been in business for 27 years, since I was in my early 20s.  The 1980s were difficult, with interest rates running at 18% or 19%, whereas they are 2% or 3% today.  Nonetheless, running a business is more difficult today.</P>
        <P>SMEs are the ones which will get the country back on its feet again.  They are and have been the backbone of the economy.  A small, family-run business will be the last to give up; it will fight to the very end.  That is the tradition in Ireland.  People who set up their own business do not do it by chance but through determination and the business is generally passed on through the generations.  The small business community has kept the country going and is employing hundreds of thousands of people.</P>
        <P>I do not have to convince the people in the Visitors Gallery of how hard they work from Monday morning through to Sunday night.  Those who work a five-day week do not appreciate their jobs.  When a person is self-employed, it is a seven-day week.  Many spend their time complaining about the Government and the current situation, but those involved in business do not have time to do this.  They come to work in the morning and might have one minute in which to complain before having to get on with their business and getting through the day.</P>
        <P>In recent years people often budgeted on an annual basis, but because of the way the economy has gone, many businesses are now budgeting on a monthly basis, which shows how difficult is the economic environment.  Anyone involved in a small business knows he or she just has to get on with it as he or she cannot depend on somebody else to look after it.</P>
        <P>Help from the Government is needed.  I served as a member of Donegal County Council for 11 years and of Letterkenny Town Council for 17 years and every year the rates issue was topical.  I have always said that in County Donegal the rates base is too small and that the pressure is on the business community which is suffering more than it did in the past.  The rates base has to be extended.  While I am open to correction, I understand 39% of all local government funding comes from commercial rates.  This cannot be sustained.</P>
        <P>In recent months I have heard speakers with a political agenda say, &ldquo;Do not pay your household tax,&rdquo; &ldquo;Let somebody else pay it,&rdquo; &ldquo;Europe will pay it,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not want to pay it.&rdquo;  However, a small shop employing, say, two family members and a couple of others might be paying &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 just to keep the door open.  At the same time, a person living next door in a private house worth more than the business might be refusing to pay the &euro;100 household charge.  The public must realise that if the small business community continues to suffers, jobs will not be available for their children, friends and neighbours.</P>
        <P>Like most people, I have no difficulty in paying the &euro;100 household charge.  However, the funds must be spread throughout the country, as the business community is getting smaller.  I assume, when rates were formulated 150 years ago, it was necessary to have a business premises, as people did not have laptops and cars then.  Today there are many who are doing well in business but who do not contribute to the community through rates because they do not have a building.  We must re-evaluate the rates system.</P>
        <P>There are other anomalies which the Minister of State might address.  I have experienced the following.  When a town council or county council brings forward a motion to grant a reduction in rates for new businesses, the law does not allow this to happen.  The county enterprise boards, of one of which I was a member for several years, can give grants to small businesses provided they do not interfere with others conducting the same business on the same street.  The county councils should be able to do the same after examining how the normal market operates.  If a building is left empty, the council concerned should encourage people to take it over.  In many cases, in which rates are owed on a building, the next tenant is liable for them, which is unfair.  If the system was run in a businesslike way by people such as those in the Visitors Gallery, many of these businesses would be operating again.  If councils gave a 50% or even a 10% reduction, these properties would be opened again and there would be activity on the street.  There is nothing worse than driving through a town and seeing &ldquo;To Let&rdquo; signs, boarded-up windows and paintings on windows to hide the fact that a building has been closed.  We should examine anomalies such as these in order that a town council could, in certain designated areas of a town, give a rates reduction to new businesses, provided they are not interfering with a similar business in the town.  There are many who want to get involved in business and as has been said, there are some 400,000 unemployed.  Many people just need an incentive and an extra push from the Government to get involved.  When that happens, more jobs are created and the cash starts to flow.</P>
        <P>It will be the small business community that will bring the country out of recession, as it has done in the past.  I wish those involved good luck in the future and ask the Minister of State to act on my requests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few points on small business.  I also welcome my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry.  We are very proud in the north west to have a local representative as the Minister of State with responsibility for small business who, as Senator Paschal Mooney said, is doing the best job he can in difficult circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have read the motion and the amendment.  It is welcome that Labour Party Senators are bringing forward a number of issues that require attention and there is little with which one can disagree in what has been said so far.  I wish to raise a number of issues.  As one who is involved in small business and as a representative of small business for many years in the chambers of commerce movement, I welcome the Chambers Ireland and the Confederation of Irish Industry who are here to listen to the debate.  As often happens it is a shame that the important points made here will not be covered by the media as its gallery is empty while the Visitors Gallery is full.  We are used to that in the House.  The organisations behind us could do worse than highlight the fact that these important issues are being ignored by what is a selective media.</P>
        <P>On the issue of commercial rates, the method of local government funding by consecutive Governments is consistently flawed.  The template was simply to wait and see what comes from the local government fund, take it away from what is needed for the year, and divide it out across the business community.  That was fundamentally wrong and affects the livelihoods of many, particularly in the more difficult economic times.  There is a need for an ability to pay clause, where people can take a holiday from the payment of rates based on economic concerns for a period, to return in future, albeit those figures may add up.  In certain circumstances down the line we could look at rates forgiveness.  That is necessary given that doors are closing as a direct result of not being able to pay the rates bills which would have arrived in many counties during the past week.</P>
        <P>There is no incentive to go into business, engage one&rsquo;s mind or have the entrepreneurial spirit and take that risk as we have seen throughout the economic downturn.  People have mentioned the lack of social supports for those who have taken the risk, irrespective of how many they may have employed or the contribution they may have made.  That is wrong and the Government must take action in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the matter of rates and the Border counties, Senator Jimmy Harte would have mentioned a number of issues in that regard.  It is not a level playing field for the Border counties.  We have a different set of rules in Sligo, 35 miles away, a different minimum wage, a different VAT rate and a whole series of different regulatory parameters which is wrong.  As many of our agencies insist on being the best possible Europeans they tender across the Border which is frustrating for operators on this side of the Border.  There is a case to be made in this respect.  I wrote a report some years ago and circulated it to councillors in the Border counties calling for a 25% or 30% rebate on commercial rates for people retailing in those areas.  Obviously the sterling exchange rate was at a particular level that perhaps made the position worse than now.  We have had the VAT increases.  Other Senators mentioned that Chambers Ireland had pointed out that was a particular concern with the continuing softening of the retail area.</P>
        <P>The issue of upward-only rent reviews is one of particular concern.  There was much commentary on the matter by the Government parties in advance of the election but that appears to have gone off the radar given that the Attorney General is examining the issue or that it cannot be done.  Today in the other House, Deputy Dara Calleary tabled the Landlord and Tenant (Business Leases Review) Bill 2012 which has been submitted for selection to the Ceann Comhairle.  The Bill proposes to deal with this specific issue.  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, accepted the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2011 yesterday which provides for publishing the names of financial institutions who treat customers poorly, I hope the Government will embrace the Bill with both arms and make it its own.  If the Attorney General has any particular issue with it, amendments can be made on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>In certain parts of the country State authorities and agencies have properties leased to businesses at higher levels.  In areas such as Killybegs businesses are renting from port authorities.  The Minister could do worse than instruct the agencies to examine the market and albeit that a legal lease is in place at a higher rent, to voluntarily enter into a reduced rate in that regard.</P>
        <P>The issue of procurement is a major bone of contention.  I do not like us having to be the poster boys of Europe when it comes to procurement.  I often use the example of the ushers who serve the Houses of the Oireachtas so well.  For many years the ushers&rsquo; uniforms were manufactured in Sligo by a particular master tailor who was asked if he would continue the work at the same price for a couple of years until a tender process could be arranged, and he lost the tender.  So be it, the tender was based purely on price.  It is ironic that the uniforms are now manufactured in Belgium and supplied by an Irish agent.</P>
        <P>In the German Parliament one will not find a civil servant driving a vehicle other than a Volkswagon, Mercedes or a BMW.  I do not think that is in their employment contract or that there are not individuals who have preferences for other models, it is not the done thing.  I would like tenders broken down and a specific focus put on how we can ensure, while being good Europeans, we facilitate a process legally that supports industry in Ireland in the first instance.  I do not think that deducts from our pro-European stance.  We must be more clever in how we do that.  In Ireland, the capital city being the key administrative centre where much of the business is done, State agencies can also focus a little more on the support of small businesses.  I have said previously that I doubt if any of the legal advice supplied to any Government, State agency or local authority is from a company that is not located between the Royal and Grand canals.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am aware of an aspect of IBRC which in wishing to procure auctioneering services &mdash; I declare an interest as I am an auctioneer &mdash; issued a tender process where only those with national distribution could apply.  If one was to examine the tender and somebody in the industry was to advise on it, that tender was written for one successful applicant.  We need to be much more inclusive and prepare tender documentation and a procurement process that makes it possible for an auctioneer, solicitor or accountant in Buncrana to have equal opportunity for success as KPMG, Grant Thornton Ireland or whoever in Dublin.  That has not been done adequately by countless Governments or by this Government.  As the Minister of State&rsquo;s heart is in the right place I trust he will take some of the issues on board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Labour Party motion and thank the Senators who tabled it.  I am conscious of all the contributions made.  The small business sector is very important to the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is acutely aware of the importance of the small business sector and its potential for generating employment.  Our challenge has been, and continues to be, where to target our best efforts and financial supports and interventions to best effect.  As stated by numerous Senators, there are almost 200,000 small businesses in Ireland, employing more than 650,000 people. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The action plan for jobs and the small business sector published last November reflects many of the issues of concern to small business that I have highlighted to the Government as Minister of State with responsibility for this area.  The action plan takes on board a number of recommendations from the advisory group for small business, which I established when I was appointed.  Given the importance of the small business sector and the need for the &euro;90 billion domestic economy to grow in conjunction with the exporting economy, we must ensure the action plan includes a focus on these vitally important areas. Senator Landy and others referred to the importance of the sector and the issue of access to credit, which I will deal with shortly. Senator Gilroy referred to the pension fund and diversity and those issues will have to be addressed. Senator Mary White also referred to access to funding. The Government has ring-fenced funding by the two pillar banks. </P>
        <P>Given the importance of the small business sector and the need for the &euro;90 billion domestic economy to grow in conjunction with the exporting economy, we must ensure the action plan includes a focus on these vitally important areas.

Senator Gilroy referred to the pension fund and diversity and those issues will have to be addressed.  Senator Mary White also referred to access to funding.  The Government has ring-fenced funding by the two pillar banks.</P>
        <P>I refer to the difficulties with late payments for those contracted to provide goods and services to the public sector.  Since 2009, Departments have been improving their respective payment times to assist the cash flow of businesses and they are obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.  The 15-day prompt payment rule was introduced by the Government on an administrative basis.  Departments are required to report quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target.  To date, ten sets of quarterly returns have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The returns for the final quarter of 2011 were published on 29 February.  These show that between 97% and 98% of invoices were paid within 15 days for that quarter.  The ongoing publication of these composite returns by my Department provides clarity on the performance of individual Departments in meeting the terms of the Government decision.</P>
        <P>As part of the commitments in the EU-IMF programme for Ireland, the 15-day prompt payment rule was extended beyond central Departments and rolled out to the Health Service Executive, local authorities, State agencies and all other public sector bodies, excluding commercial semi-State bodies, in respect of valid invoices received on or after 1 July 2011.  These new reporting arrangements should ensure all Ministers will be able to monitor the performance of the bodies under their aegis and will enable them to address issues with bodies that are not meeting these obligations.  There has been criticism in the media in the past few days of payments by State agencies.  Small businesses experiencing difficulties in securing payments should, in the first instance, approach the Department or the State body concerned.  Failures to comply with the initiative can also be brought to the attention of the relevant Minister with responsibility for the ongoing concern.</P>
        <P>A number of Members referred to opening up the rules on tendering and procurement again to enable a wider range of firms and businesses to seek public contracts.  Public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises.  In general, SMEs&rsquo; flexibility and ability to respond speedily to requirements can be advantageous in competing for local contracts.  Within this context, the procurement guidelines from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts.  The guidelines set out positive measures contracting authorities must take to promote SME involvement in a manner consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime.  They also highlight practices to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.</P>
        <P>I attended an event in Kilkenny a number of weeks ago for public contract providers and suppliers.  It was an open forum and it was educational for those dealing with smaller contracts.  The key provisions of the guidelines are: supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more are required to be advertised on the website, <i>etenders.gov.ie</i>; less use of restrictive tendering procedures and greater use of open tendering; ensuring the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified; and subdividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical.</P>
        <P>The National Procurement Service, NPS, is supporting SMEs through its information and guidance strategies and works closely with the relevant stakeholders.  In the past two years, there has been an increasing level of activity between the NPS and potential suppliers.  The NPS collaborated with InterTradeIreland, Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland to run a number of events titled &ldquo;Upping Your Game&rdquo;.  These events were well received by suppliers with 94% saying they were well prepared.</P>
        <P>I refer to the provision of greater levels of social protection, including protection in the event of illness, for those who are self-employed and, in particular, for those whose business fails leading to a collapse in income.  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State contributory pension and the widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension.  Regular employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of them, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full rate PRSI class A.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of their earnings in the previous 12 months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed unemployed claimant of allowance, the means of husband or wife, civil partner or cohabitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Social Protection established the advisory group on tax and social welfare last year to meet the commitment in the programme for Government.  The group will, <i>inter alia</i>, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons to establish whether such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  In addition, the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, which is due to be completed in mid-2012, will examine this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Addressing high local authority rates is an important issue which was raised by numerous Senators, including Senator Kelly.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is carrying out a comprehensive review of the rates.  The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county-by-county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates.</P>
        <P>The commissioner, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been reviewing various options for streamlining the valuation process and speeding up the national revaluation programme.  In this regard, the Government recently approved the drafting of a valuation Bill to amend the Valuation Act 2001.  There will be an ongoing debate with the Minister on this issue.  Having compared the figures for 2011 with those for 2010, the annual rate on valuation, ARV, decreased on average between 2011 to 2012 by 0.27%.  Of the 88 local authorities, 49 have applied the same ARV as in 2010 and 36 have reduced it.  Two local authorities introduced an increase and the 2010-11 figures for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council are not comparable due to a revaluation of all commercial properties by the Valuation Office.  Local authorities have been requested to exercise restraint in setting their 2012 ARVs.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the existing revenue base of local authorities is narrow by international standards.  This was a consideration in the introduction of the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences in 2009.  While these are difficult economic times for many businesses, Senators will appreciate that local authorities play, and must continue to play, a central role in delivering local services at local level.  Local authority capital and current budgets, economic planning and development, and the provision of goods and services, as well as community infrastructure, feed into the communities that they serve.  Local authorities have an important role in providing support both for the retention of existing jobs and the creation of new employment in their areas.  Local authorities are being proactive in many ways in this regard.  For example, business support units in each county and city council are providing a focal point for business and enterprise to engage with the local government system and smooth their path in setting up and managing businesses.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to impress on local authorities the need to continue measures to enhance efficiency with a view to minimising rates and charges for business.  The Minister recognises many businesses are facing difficult economic times and will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in his Department.</P>
        <P>The motion calls for, among other things, measures to allow company directors to invest money from private pension funds in businesses.  The regulatory and tax regime governing the activities of supplementary pension provisions are designed to protect and encourage individuals&rsquo; savings and benefits in order that they will have an adequate income on retirement.  This point is fundamental to the understanding of the Government&rsquo;s position on the recommendation made.  It might be expected that the trust deed to establish a pension scheme would normally set out the details of the power of trustees in the investment of the scheme&rsquo;s funds.  General pension legislation does not specifically prohibit it.  For this reason, the Minister for Finance has indicated he does not foresee changes being made to tax legislation which would facilitate proprietary directors to invest their pension scheme assets in sponsoring employer companies.</P>
        <P>Ensuring increased access to credit and finance facilities for small businesses was mentioned by a number of Senators and is by far the most talked about issue in recent times.  Irish small businesses are faced with the unavailability of adequate credit facilities.  The initiatives taken by the Government to restructure and recapitalise the banking system are the principal response in seeking to make credit available.  The aim is to restore the lifeblood of the market economy, that is, funding for lending and borrowing to help fuel business investments, run factories, buy machinery and equipment and pay wages.  Generally, large firms in good financial conditions can obtain credit more easily and on favourable terms.  In contrast, bank-dependent smaller firms have faced significantly greater problems in obtaining credit.</P>
        <P>The Government has engaged in significant efforts to improve the credit environment for small businesses.  It has imposed lending targets on the two domestic banks for three calendar years.  They were required to sanction the lending of &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion this year and &euro;4 billion next year.  The Minister for Finance recently confirmed both banks had achieved their 2011 targets.  The information is being independently assessed by the Credit Review Office.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. John Moran, has embarked on a series of meetings.  I met businesspeople in Limerick on Monday at a public meeting.  There was a series of meetings and Mr. Moran will compile a full report.  The Mazars report was also debated at public meetings.</P>
        <P>It should be stressed, however, that the targets for the approval of credit have not been imposed for drawdowns and the Minister has no plans to introduce such targets.  We are meeting and engaging with the banks on the issue of drawdowns, the ultimate test of any business.  The fundamental point is that &euro;7 billion has been ring-fenced for small businesses.  A lot of companies which were viable are no longer so.  There has been a shift from the management of businesses based on property to cash flow management.  Many businesses have to meet different criteria in getting funding from banks.  Many factors affect whether funding is drawn down such as changes in market conditions or company restructuring.  In the recent Mazars survey of SME lending conducted on behalf of the Department of Finance the most frequently cited reason for not availing of approved credit was that it was not needed at the time.  A lot of micro companies are not going to banks, as we have found at the meetings I have attended.  Companies are not engaging with banks.  Every second loan refusal appealed to the office of Mr. John Trethowan has been overturned.  The code of conduct of banking has been examined and banks are obliged to give a lending report to the Credit Review Office within 15 days.  It is important, therefore, that people engage with the banks.</P>
        <P>My Department is taking action to address some specific market failures which will add value to the actions the Minister for Finance has taken.  We will shortly introduce a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme which will be closely targeted at commercially viable, well performing companies which have solid business plans and defined markets for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay loans.  The scheme will support new companies, safeguard jobs and create new ones.  As I have stated, Enterprise Ireland companies will have the highest level of exports ever this year.</P>
        <P>The two pillar banks have now dedicated bank officials reassessing loans.  The real crisis is in the micro-domestic economy.  Banks need SMEs to make money and SMEs need the banks.  It is in the interests of the two pillar banks to invest in profitable companies which will repay the money.  The Taoiseach is determined to ensure the banks fulfil their obligations.  They have been recapitalised and it is our job to make sure they meet their obligations.  If Senators are aware of cases in which viable applications have been refused and if they bring them to my attention, they can be investigated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Primary legislation to underpin the scheme is being progressed with the Office of the Attorney General with a view to its publishing in the coming weeks.  The scheme is intended to address two distinct barriers to lending, namely, inadequacy of collateral and inadequacy of understanding the novelty of a business model.  It will be targeted exclusively at companies which are unable to access credit.</P>
        <P>Another priority for my Department and one that has a significant entrepreneurial focus is the introduction of a microfinance fund.  If we are to maintain the strong Irish culture of entrepreneurship, we need to ensure Government supports are in place to empower people to strike out on their own and shape their own future.  We acknowledge the difficulties which can be experienced by micro-enterprises in gaining access to finance at an early stage of business development.</P>
        <P>There are many very good commercial ideas in third level colleges.  To remove the barrier, work is under way in my Department on the establishment of a microfinance fund to provide loans of up to &euro;25,000 for micro-enterprises employing up to ten persons.  It is envisaged that the microfinance fund will go live in the third quarter.</P>
        <P>Small businesses are not just a vital part of the economy, they play a critical role.  Senators Denis Landy, John Gilroy, Mary White, Thomas Byrne and Tony Mulcahy referred to credit facilities.  There is a common theme in all of the issues raised.  Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to rates reductions and rent reviews.  The Bill tabled by Deputy Dara Calleary will be studied.  Senator John Kelly referred to the issues of rates and procurement.  I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will consider the issues raised.</P>
        <P>Senator Paschal Mooney referred to a lack of credit facilities for SMEs.  Running a business is not just about credit, it is also about having the management tools required within companies.  While credit availability is one aspect, business survival is not based solely on a bank extending an overdraft facility.  Management expertise is required, as the marketplace has changed fundamentally.  However, bank lending is an issue we are determined to address.</P>
        <P>I encourage Senators to attend the meetings on public procurement held across the country.  I welcome those present in the Visitors Gallery.  The Small Firms Association, ISME and Chambers Ireland have all played a critical role on behalf of their members.  I take Senator Harte&rsquo;s point in regard to local authority policy in terms of encouraging vacant units to be occupied by business.  That should certainly be examined as part of each authority&rsquo;s management review.  Councils have a level of discretion which allows them to facilitate a certain degree of derogation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s suggestion regarding a rates holiday is a good one, as is the proposal regarding rent reviews.  Of course, the opinion offered by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office must be taken into account.  There is plenty of evidence that rents are coming down throughout the State.  The bottom line is that any landlord faced with a choice between half rent or no rent will opt for the latter.  These people are intelligent enough to recognise reality.  We have 13,000 sq. ft. of retail space per customer in the State compared with 1,000 sq. ft. per customer in the United Kingdom.  The buoyancy in the commercial rental sector in the boom years led to a situation where every town in the country is home to massive rental units whose capacity is way beyond what was ever needed.  However, common sense is generally prevailing, with landlords opting for reduced rent in lieu of no rent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the procurement issue, I strongly encourage Senators to meet the management of the National Procurement Service.  The impressive team has embarked on meetings throughout the State and has certainly changed the service&rsquo;s remit.</P>
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for small business I will continue to ensure we have a supportive business environment in this country.  I thank the Labour Party Senators for raising this important motion.  As the saying goes, &ldquo;No problem, no business&rdquo;.  There are problems in every business and these are challenging times.  I do not claim to have a panacea for all of the current difficulties.  It is about safeguarding the viability of small business.  Success is the new survival.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is about helping those who can, with the right support, survive and ultimately thrive.  The Government is absolutely focused in this regard.</P>
        <P>The key proposals outlined in the action plan for jobs underpin this supportive business environment.  As such, I hope all Members will accept and support them.  I am anxious to work with Senators and take on board their views.  The Government has been very open and frank with the business community.  Our concern is to empower business people, and we recognise that small businesses are the backbone of the economy.  Part of that empowerment is reducing the regulatory burden on companies.  The &ldquo;think small first&rdquo; principle is very important in this regard.  Access to credit is another priority for the Government.  In addition, we must ensure that people who have failed in business get a second chance.  Honest entrepreneurs are entitled to that and we will ensure every possible support is available to them.  Above all, the banks must fulfil their obligations.  Instead of restructuring existing loans, they must offer new lending to new companies with new ideas.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Several issues were raised which apparently attract a cross-party consensus.  The first is the need for safety nets for self-employed people in the form of an entitlement to social welfare benefits.  As Senator Mooney observed, we all accept that something must be done in this regard.  The point, of course, is that nothing has been done thus far.  Given the cross-party support expressed in this House, perhaps there is an opportunity for an all-party motion on the matter.  It is no longer acceptable that people whose businesses do not work out are left with no support from the State.</P>
        <P>The second issue is procurement, which we all accept must be opened up.  It is not enough merely to have this discussion, from which many good ideas have emerged.  The Government must take action now.</P>
        <P>Access to credit is the third issue in respect of which we have seen a cross-party consensus that something must be done.  The Minister of State is correct that access to credit is not the be all and end all for businesses, but it is certainly important.  If a business is to grow and develop, funding is required.  The deleveraging of the banks has had an impact in the form of, for example, curtailment of overdrafts for businesses and the inability of enterprises to borrow.  We have gone from one extreme in the Celtic tiger years, when there was reckless lending on a massive scale, to the opposite situation now where there is precious little lending just when we need it most.  The Government must address this issue without delay.</P>
        <P>On the question of rates, Senator Harte made an important point in regard to businesses which do not operate from a building and do not make any contribution.  These are the types of issues that must be examined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the members of the business community who are in the Chamber for this debate on the proposed introduction of supports for small businesses and the self-employed.  I thank the Minister of State for his responses to the issues raised by colleagues.  I intend to refer to some of the specific challenges facing the business community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prior to my nomination to the Seanad I was self-employed all of my life, as are all members of my family.  As such, I am very familiar with the particular challenges facing the many business people who are striving hard to keep their boats afloat.  I have experienced some of those difficulties at first hand.  In particular, I highlight the utterly disincentivising situation in Ireland.  Now, more than ever, we need people with an entrepreneurial spark and verve to feel secure in following their business dream.  To that end, the current situation whereby one is prejudiced in terms of acquiring social protection following the collapse of a business must come to an end.  How can we realistically encourage people to develop a business idea and seek out funding for that purpose if there is no safety net should things go wrong?  Not only is this policy misguided, it is unacceptable in that it is utterly prejudicial to those concerned.  I urge the Minister of State to liaise with the Minister for Social Protection in order to address this unfortunate anomaly in Irish law in order that entrepreneurs in the State can set about creating jobs without fear of confronting a uniquely Irish problem should their business plans go awry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I urge the Minister of State to prioritise the implementation of the European prompt payments directive which will inevitably be transposed into Irish law in the coming years.  This directive would give many businesses the legislative framework and protection required in order that Ireland can shift decisively to a culture of prompt payment.  It will seek to reverse the trend of late payment by penalising debtors who delay via the introduction of interest charges and fixed penalties for those who fail to comply without further notice.  The directive must not be limited in terms of application.  It must apply to all businesses, including State bodies and multinationals that are in receipt of State supports.  With 1,900 corporate entities being wound up in the State last year &mdash; this does not take into consideration partnerships and sole traders &mdash; this legislation is essential in encouraging greater confidence among business people and in affording protection to badly stung creditors who are operating in a very difficult marketplace.</P>
        <P>An issue that has come to the fore in Irish life in recent times is that of access to credit and finance facilities.  If businesses are to buck the unfortunate trend of years past, it is essential that this issue be addressed.  While I welcome the budget announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, of a target of &euro;3.5 billion in lending by Bank of Ireland and AIB to the SME sector, we must police that requirement more radically.  I understand these banks are engaging in a horrible practice of withdrawing overdrafts and transforming them into term loans.  This activity is masqueraded as new lending for the purposes of satisfying the requirements set down by the Minister for Finance.  We must focus more radically on this behaviour and ensure we take into consideration the draw-down figures as opposed to loan approvals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State and the representatives of the business community to the Chamber for the debate on this Labour Party motion.  We all recognise that small businesses are the backbone of the economy, employing more than 650,000 people in some 200,000 enterprises.  We all welcomed the new jobs announced by various multinationals in recent months, but small businesses deserve to be the centre of our focus.  These enterprise are located in Dublin and other cities and in rural communities throughout the State, each employing as few as one or as many as 20 or more staff.  While they are very important, they are facing many problems.  Consequently, I hope this motion will help to address some of those problems.  The Government has proved it is pro-business and the Minister of State has pointed this out in respect of the micro-financing initiative, whereby money will be made available to small businesses employing up to ten people in local areas in the form of loans of &euro;25,000 per year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe credit to be the major issue affecting small and medium businesses or any business.  When the banking crisis struck this country, it resulted in credit being unavailable.  At the time, Fine Gael proposed the establishment of a State bank that would take charge of providing credit to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as other enterprises.  Two domestic pillar banks are operating in the country and as part of the restructuring and recapitalisation of the banking system, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, recently imposed lending targets on them for the three calendar years up to 2013.  They must lend at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 and unless these targets are met, the State bank will be back on the agenda.</P>
        <P>I believe everyone has referred to the issue of rates and the Government is committed to a rates review.  When a member of a local authority it was evident to me that the cost of water, both as an input and an output, was a major charge to any small business.  I hope the establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of water metering whereby everyone must pay for water will help to lessen the burden on businesses in this regard.  In other words, I hope businesses will no longer be asked to pay for everything.  For years, local authorities have been relying on businesses, through business rates, to keep their services going.  Nevertheless, Members of this House and the Lower House still object to paying a household charge of &euro;100.  This is a disgrace and if the tax burden is shared equally, small businesses will be able to make progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and also the business people in attendance.  As someone who has been self-employed for many years, I am deeply aware of the difficulties small businesses are obliged to face.  My colleagues have touched on many of the issues already.  However, I wish to touch on two issues.  The first concerns an agency funded by the State that has removed a contractor from its list of approved contractors without any prior notice or without going through fair procedures.  This is outrageous and the case is on my desk.  A contractor was removed from the list overnight because of an allegation in respect of family members being involved.  However, no complaint was made against the contractor in question and there is no evidence this contractor has done anything wrong.  Despite this, he has been removed from an approved contractor list by a State-funded agency.  No fair procedures were followed through and this is a clear case for a judicial review, which is the advice I have given.  It is outrageous that fair procedure has not been followed through in this day and age.</P>
        <P>The second issue I wish to raise pertains to insurance companies.  I refer to cases whereby claims are lodged by businesses but huge delays arise in the processing of claims for damages experienced by businesses through flooding or fire.  The process is prolonged <i>ad infinitum</i> to try to force businesses to accept settlements at values that are far lower than the level of damage done.  This is an issue whereby insurance companies are abusing their position and Members certainly should ensure that insurance companies comply with the policies from which they have collected large premiums.  I ask that this issue also be examined.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to go back over points that have already been made.  I thank the Minister of State for what was a thorough, serious and genuine response to the contents of the motion.  I also thank the stakeholders who have taken time out of their own busy schedules to attend this debate.  While I acknowledge Members on this side are in government, they are not detached, removed or remote from the reality of life.  I believe that having a detached Government is what got us into the present circumstances in the first place.  The current Administration is grounded in reality and this debate is not simply about tea and sympathy.  It constitutes a genuine attempt to engage with the small business sector and to act on its concerns.  This motion is the first step in such a process.  All good legislation and policy has its genesis in good ideas that are well crafted, properly communicated and then executed and there have been some highly positive and constructive suggestions made by Members across the House.</P>
        <P>My suggestion is that the late payment legislation should be extended to multinationals.  They benefit from a good tax regime in Ireland and while they provide important employment, this should not give them the opportunity to long-finger payment to small Irish suppliers.  Consequently, they should be included within the aforementioned legislation.  While I understand the transparency the Minister of State seeks to achieve, the reality is that late payment remains a serious problem.  For most companies, the waiting period has gone past 70 days, whereas the average was only 52 days before the introduction of the legislation.  Consequently, it should be extended to include multinational companies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While there are many other points I would like to raise, I will conclude by noting one cannot have one&rsquo;s cake and eat it and one cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  The only people paying for local authority services are those in the small-business sector.  A property tax must be reintroduced to replace rates, which should never have been abolished.  Those who oppose this are trying to have it both ways but that is not possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the many representatives from the business organisations who were invited to the House for taking the time to attend and for putting forward constructive suggestions and ideas to Members.  All Members are highly conscious of the difficulties faced by small businesses and those who are self-employed in this difficult time.  I am grateful to the Minister of State for setting out part of what the Government is attempting to do in this regard.  It should be noted the Government&rsquo;s priority is to restore consumer and international confidence in the economy.  All the actions and all the ideas that have been discussed should be carried out within that climate.  I refer to two key ideas that are worth putting forward.  One is a measure suggested by Dublin Chamber of Commerce, namely, to raise the threshold for the cash basis of accounting for VAT from &euro;1 million to &euro;2.5 million.  I note Dublin Chamber of Commerce has put forward a detailed proposal in this regard.  In addition, I support the idea suggested by others that the range of firms that can tender through the e-tender process for public sector contracts should be increased.  For example, some of the tender requirements impose thresholds that are far beyond the reach of small and medium-sized enterprises in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many really useful suggestions have been put forward during the debate on this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  I thank all my colleagues who have contributed, as well as all the representatives who have attended the debate.  As everyone is establishing his or her business credentials, my grandfather came to Ireland from Czechoslovakia in the 1940s and set up a venture that began as a small enterprise, namely, Waterford Glass.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was only a lowly insurance clerk but what do I know about business? I thank the Minister of State for his most comprehensive contribution. I believe that Private Members&rsquo; time for Government Members is much better served by the production of legislation, rather than simply discussing motions in the Chamber. I acknowledge that many good ideas have been put forward. Successive Governments, including the present Administration, can always do more for the business sector. </P><P Just="Left">As time is short, I will limit myself to a couple of items. In his response, the Minister of State suggested that more than 98% of invoices were paid within 15 days by the public sector but there is absolutely no way this is happening. I do not believe anyone agrees with that point and the Minister of State should get his officials to provide him with the real figures in this regard. </P>
        <P>Second, I refer to lending.  While I acknowledge this also was the case under the previous Government, all Members are aware there is not a rat&rsquo;s chance in hell that AIB or Bank of Ireland will have hit their 2011 lending targets to the SME sector.  It simply is not happening.</P>
        <P>The other point not addressed by this motion and which is a glaringly obvious omission concerns business costs with the exception of rates.  As for the latter, I am glad to hear that some of my colleagues on the Government side have realised they now are in government but I remind them that most councils are controlled by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  During the lifetime of the previous Government I proposed the reintroduction of the central government cap on rates.  Such a cap should be reintroduced, there should be central government control on rates and models for rates should be considered, such as one based on turnover.  In such a model, when a company is doing better it pays more but when it is not doing well, it pays less.</P>
        <P>While simple measures can be taken, Members should not be fooled in any way by the banks about lending or by Departments claiming to pay 98% of invoices within 15 days, which is nonsensical.  I will conclude by stating that one can talk about procurement until the cows come home and note that I produced a report for the Committee of Public Accounts during the lifetime of the last D&aacute;il.  However, the bottom line is there now is procurement for less, because the capital programme has been slashed in half and the schools building programmes have been slashed by &euro;500 million over five years.  One can procure all one wishes for half the amount that was available in 2010.</P>
        <P>I genuinely wish the Minister of State well, as we all want businesses to thrive, but this cannot happen without addressing the matter of business costs.  I have said before and will say again that increasing the minimum wage which those on the Government side have trumpeted and welcomed is a nonsense.  It is a cost to business.</P>

Already we have been given, thanks to our colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, some hope that new legislation will be introduced to deal with the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  The Minister of State has confirmed there is a review group dealing with the issue of social welfare benefits for the self-employed and there are clear guidelines on the amount of money the banks have available and are required to loan to the small and medium enterprise sector in 2012.  Contrary to the comments made by the last speaker, there is still &euro;14 billion available for procurement projects in 2012, a sizable amount of money that could be used to create much employment.</P>
        <P>Senator Ivana Bacik&rsquo;s grandfather produced glass and I would like to think the glass is half full rather than half empty.  We will follow up with the Minister of State on the issues on which we are not satisfied.  The Labour Party group in the Seanad will pursue all these issues.  All but one of us are new Senators and we are almost one year into the life of the new Seanad.  This has been one of the key issues worked on by the Labour Party group and that work has come to fruition in this motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful to the Minister of State for taking the time to come to the House to take this Adjournment debate.  Unfortunately, fuel smuggling and fuel smugglers have not gone away you know.  Instead of it being a problem that is in abeyance, it is expanding all over the country, it is no longer just a Border problem.  It costs the Exchequer an estimated &euro;200 million in lost revenue every year but it also has a damaging effect on small businesses the length and breadth of the country.  I am reliably informed by the motor industry representative group SIMI that there are now pop-up filling stations in Clare, Galway, Cork, Kerry, Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath selling laundered fuel and adulterated diesel.  This puts legitimate traders out of business and has a profound effect on hauliers who are trying to run their business legally, while costing the Exchequer, not to speak of the terrible environmental damage being done.  I could not have timed this motion better if I had tried because last night another fuel smuggling depot was unearthed in Cavan.  It is high time the Government cracked down on these cowboys and put them out of business.  Enforcement is too lax and the range of measures brought to bear to date has simply not worked.  What proposals does the Government have to curb this problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for rightly raising this very important issue.  He has raised it in the past, as have others.  It is particularly poignant that he has raised it on a day when information has come through Revenue about the illegal operation in County Cavan.  We owe the enforcement agencies, North and South, a huge debt of gratitude for their own work in this area.  From information I have received, I am also aware of the intimidation of local authority officials, Revenue Commissioners staff and enforcement officers by these gangs of criminals, many of them connected to paramilitaries.</P>
        <P>We take this issue very seriously and I have today spoken to the Minister for Finance.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners who have responsibility for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in mineral oil products that they are acutely aware of the threat posed by illegal activity and tax evasion in this area.  The most serious risk is the large-scale laundering of markers from diesel, which is subject to a reduced rate of mineral oil tax on condition it is not used in road vehicles.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Currently the Revenue Commissioners collect &euro;1.1 billion annually in excise from road diesel; therefore, the scope for loss of tax revenue from this fraud is very significant.  It is also important to note other costs are associated with this criminality.  Apart from undermining the competitiveness of legitimate businesses, it damages the environment, can damage consumers&rsquo; vehicles and sustains organised criminal gangs.  For these reasons the Revenue Commissioners have made action against illegal fuel related activities one of their top priorities.  They are tackling the problem on a number of fronts, including robust and sustained enforcement action, implementing more effective controls in oil distribution and pursuing a more effective marker in conjunction with the Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs in the UK.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the enforcement front, action is taken at all stages of the fuel supply chain, tackling both those involved in laundering and the sellers of laundered fuel.  The Revenue Commissioners are supported in this work by well established structures to ensure very close co-operation between all relevant agencies north and south of the Border.  The cross-Border fuel fraud group brings together representatives from a number of agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, as well as the UK and Irish revenue authorities.  There has been excellent co-operation between all agencies in sharing intelligence and identifying and investigating criminals involved in this fraud.  Since 2010 the Revenue Commissioners have detected and closed 14 oil laundries and seized 574,300 litres of oil, together with nine oil tankers and 29 other vehicles.  This important work continues to be pursued vigorously.  Just last night, as I said earlier, another oil laundry plant was uncovered in County Cavan and two vans, bleaching earth, laundering equipment and a large quantity of laundered product were seized.</P>
        <P>While there has been considerable success, therefore, in detecting and closing oil laundries, it is recognised that this approach alone will not solve the problem.  Oil launderers must be denied access to marked oil for the purposes of laundering and they need to be denied access to the market for their laundered product.  Since last July, the licensing regime for road fuels has been tightened up to make it more difficult for launderers to get their product onto the market.  The Revenue Commissioners are engaged in a vigorous campaign targeting specific locations nationwide, with the intention of immediate closure of unlicensed outlets and challenging instances of non-compliance.  As a result, 38 filling stations have been shut by the Revenue Commissioners because they did not have a licence or were in breach of licensing conditions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key issue is licensing.  Under the new rules one must obtain a licence to import oil into the country and a licence to obtain that product from the significant ports in the country.  If one does not have the licence, one is turned down.  There is also a computerised system that was not in place in the past.  In recent months, there have been a number of detections of the &ldquo;stretching&rdquo; of petrol using methanol.  The Revenue Commissioners are monitoring this situation carefully and will take all necessary action to counteract this form of fuel crime.</P>
        <P>In addition to the ongoing enforcement action, legislative changes that will enable more effective controls in this sector have been put forward in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.  These will lead to the introduction of new licensing requirements for marked fuel traders.  The new arrangements will, for the first time, require any person dealing in marked fuel to hold a licence for the purpose.  The granting of a licence will be subject to tax clearance requirements, and the applicant will have to show to the Revenue Commissioners that any conditions subject to which the licence may be granted will be complied with.  The Revenue Commissioners will be empowered to revoke a licence if any of the licence conditions is breached.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the introduction of this new licensing system, the regulations that lay down the detailed rules and requirements on mineral oil matters are being reviewed.  It is intended that the requirements for record keeping will be strengthened and that a new requirement to make periodic returns to the Revenue Commissioners will be introduced.  All mineral oil traders, including traders in marked fuels, will have to make regular returns &mdash; electronically &mdash; detailing their fuel transactions.  The advantage is that if we see, for example, in a small area of the country an enormous amount of oil being purchased by one of the larger traders, the question will be posed as to why the trader needs this oil and what he or she is doing with it, given the sale of product in other parts of the garage.  This gives us the power to do that for the first time.</P>
        <P>Steps are also being taken, in close co-operation with the UK authorities, to acquire a more effective fuel marker.  The Revenue Commissioners are planning to go to the market shortly, with the UK authorities, to seek a new marker.  A good deal of preparatory research has been undertaken here and in the UK and we expect to proceed with this project shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Stringent penalties are prescribed for offences relating to mineral oil smuggling and laundering.  For example, a person convicted on indictment of an offence of evading or attempting to evade excise duty can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years or a fine, or both.  Following a substantial increase introduced by the Finance Act 2010, the fine is an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970 or, where the value of the goods is more than &euro;250,000, an amount not exceeding three times the value of those goods.  These penalty provisions permit the courts to impose sentences that would act as a deterrent to involvement in this form of crime.</P>
        <P>The problem of fuel laundering and smuggling is a serious one, and the extensive enforcement action that is being carried out on an ongoing basis highlights the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; commitment to combating it.  The new legislative steps that are being taken, together with the work on development of a more effective fuel marker, will serve to enhance the effectiveness of this action.  I assure the Senator that there will be no let-up in the work against those involved in this criminal activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his thorough and comprehensive response.  I am heartened by the range of measures being taken by various agencies of the State in terms of detection, enforcement and prosecution.  It is to be hoped we are finally sucking diesel, as it were, on this matter.  It is a problem that has been escalating out of all proportion.  People might think they are getting cheap fuel, but whether they are wittingly or unwittingly putting laundered diesel in their cars, they are causing themselves a world of bother as it can cost more than &euro;3,000 to repair damaged vehicles.  I welcome the efforts being made.  The local authorities are hit with the burden of cleaning up these laundering operations.  They cause serious damage to the environment and it is no longer just a Border problem.  However, I welcome the moves that have been made on licensing and the supply chain verification. They will help to solve this problem. I hope to see more prosecutions in the courts and that the courts will implement the full rigours of the law to deter people from this criminal activity which is putting legitimate businesses out of business. At no stage should we let up in our efforts in this regard. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for the great interest he has shown in highlighting this issue in the House.  Given his home location, he will be aware that this is a nationwide problem and not confined to the Border region.  The Senator also raised the impact on local authorities.  He is absolutely correct.  Since 2003 the Government has provided &euro;4.5 million for the purposes of supporting local authorities in Louth, Monaghan and Offaly for the clean-up operations generated by this activity.  The fuel launderers produce a huge amount of sludge as a result of their activities, and that is dumped in fields and on roadways.  The local authorities must then pick up the cost of dealing with it.  At present the cost is borne centrally. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government recognises that it is not fair that the local authority must pay the cost. However, in addition to the &euro;4.5 million, there is the environmental hazard and pollution created by this activity. I recently met colleagues in the Louth area who outlined to me, through their local authority, the very substantial cost involved in this area. </P>
        
        <P>This is an issue throughout the country.  It is an issue for the Revenue Commissioners due to the loss of tax revenue at a time when we need to take in as much money as possible, and it is an issue for the North and South due to the activities of paramilitaries on both sides of the Border.  It is also an issue for the local authorities.  I assure the Senator that this matter is taken very seriously by the Minister for Finance, me and the Revenue Commissioners.  Any and every effort will be made.  This year we will see the effect of the licensing regime and the supply chain requirements which have been put in place under the Finance Bill.  They will make it harder for this criminal activity to succeed.  We will monitor it closely this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My Adjournment matter concerns the need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to review Ireland&rsquo;s position on the issuance of visas so as to best serve its economic needs so far as potential investors, talented or knowledgeable workers, students and tourists are concerned.  The lion&rsquo;s share of our exports still goes to the United Kingdom, the eurozone and the USA.  As the Minister of State knows, these regions are experiencing economic difficulties and face years of austerity, economic stagnation and low growth.  Overall, however, the world economy is still growing.  The so-called BRIC countries &mdash; Brazil, Russia, India and China &mdash; continue to power ahead, while others are in decline.  We in Ireland, therefore, need to diversify our trade to ensure the economy grows in order that we can create new jobs and instil new confidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our success in the 1990s was based on American companies using Ireland as a platform to export to Europe.  We can now replicate this with the BRIC countries, but we need to prioritise the attraction of foreign direct investment, especially from countries such as China, although I know we are doing our best in that regard.  Such investment would lead to the creation of jobs.  One only has to look at how well Ireland has worked as a European base for international businesses to see how we could be of benefit to Chinese companies.  From my own experience of interacting with Chinese businessmen, I know they want Ireland to be their hand-holder in Europe.  We have a highly educated young population and are the only English-speaking people in the eurozone.  This should be our calling card, as well as defining how we identify Ireland for the Chinese business audience, especially now that China has large amounts of money to invest.  It has foreign reserves of in excess $2.85 trillion and wants to diversify into other currencies such as the euro, as it does not want to be totally dependent on the US dollar.</P>
        <P>A recent trade conference demonstrated that Ireland was in a unique position.  We could be the home of innovation clusters if we got our visa issuing system right.  American multinationals are still wealthy and looking at the Chinese market, but they do not trust the Chinese with their intellectual property.  Ireland has a very good relationship with the United States and is building an interesting relationship with China.  Therefore, this country could be the base on which innovation clusters are formed.  The United States will trust us with the right team and we could be its access point into the Chinese market, particularly the public procurement sector.  There is still a hierarchical government in China which, for example, controls the purchasing and usage of drugs.  Nonetheless, there is a great opportunity, but we need the right visa system in place to attract the right workers with knowledge.  One may say we have those workers already but only to a certain extent.  For example, US universities are turning out 20,000 PhD students a year, half of whom are Chinese who cannot work in the United States.  There is no reason we could not have alliances if we had the right visa system in place.</P>
        <P>All EU countries, with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom, are signatories to the Schengen agreement.  The Schengen visa makes it possible for someone to visit all of the countries in the Schengen area and cross internal borders without further formalities.  Ireland has a more conservative policy in issuing visas than the United Kingdom.  UK visas are more targeted, particularly in attracting investors and exceptionally talented workers.  UK visas will be accepted in Ireland as part of the Olympic Games measure, provided visitors travel through the United Kingdom first.  This is restrictive and we are learning that we must open up the system a little more.  I suggest the following changes.  First, the current visa position should be reviewed to see how Ireland&rsquo;s economic needs can best be served.  Alternative visa arrangements should be examined such as an online pre-flight visa scheme with adequate safeguards and strict enforcement on arrival.  Second, the issuance of a visa on arrival, subject to proof of adequate funds and other safeguards, should be considered.</P>
        <P>I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say in reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, would like to thank the Senator for giving him the opportunity of updating the House on the way in which the immigration system is working in the interests of the economy.  The Irish short-stay visa waiver programme commenced on 1 July 2011 and was scheduled to run on a pilot basis until the end of October 2012, taking in the period of the London Olympic Games.  Under the programme, tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa are able to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  Nationals of 16 countries are included in the programme, including India, China, Russia, various priority Middle East countries and others.  As part of the initiative, nationals of these countries who are long-term legal residents in the United Kingdom will have the cost of an Irish visa waived should they wish to visit Ireland.  It is estimated that there are up to 1 million people in this category in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>The Government agreed on 28 February to the extension of the programme for a further period of four years, that is, to the end of October 2016; to add Bosnia-Herzegovina to the programme, and, as a further measure to encourage tourism, to waive the fee for visas for long-term residents of countries covered by the programme who live in the Schengen area.  This will be reviewed after six months.</P>
        <P>As announced in a joint ministerial communiqu&eacute; before Christmas, Ireland and the United Kingdom are also working on developing a possible common travel area visa.  If this were to be realised, it would clearly be a boost to tourism.</P>
        <P>Important as these visa developments are, we need to realise that the overwhelming number of current and likely visitors to Ireland for tourism purposes do not need a visa.  The major fluctuations in our tourist numbers in recent years have little to do with visas.  Nevertheless, the Minister has indicated that whenever we can use the immigration system in a sensible way to boost tourism, we will do so.  For those who do need visas for tourism purposes or otherwise, it is probably worth recalling that the approval rates for Irish visas in our dedicated overseas visa offices in 2011 were actually very high and ran at 97% in Russia, 92% in China, 91% in India and 87% in Abu Dhabi, covering the Gulf and north Africa.</P>
        <P>On 13 March the Minister formally launched two new programmes aimed at facilitating non-EEA migrant entrepreneurs and investors.  These programmes will be open for applications from next month.  The Minister had the pleasure of taking part in a debate on them a number of weeks ago in this House.  Their purpose is to support direct or indirect job creation by harnessing the investment resources and entrepreneurial potential of migrants.  To qualify for the immigrant investor programme, the migrant must make an investment of a designated type, ranging from a &euro;2 million specially created low interest Government bond, a capital investment in an Irish business that creates or protects jobs, to a &euro;500,000 endowment in the cultural, sports, educational or health areas.  Investment in property may also qualify in certain cases.  The start-up entrepreneur programme provides that migrants with a good business idea in the innovation economy and funding of &euro;75,000 can be given residency in the State for the purposes of developing their business.</P>
        <P>A lot of work has been done in the last couple of years on the issue of student immigration, both by this and the previous Government.  We now have a coherent strategy covering promotion, quality assurance and immigration.  This includes enhanced opportunities for graduates to stay on after they qualify.</P>
        <P>It is not just a question of adopting a whole of government approach but also a case of the Government working alongside reputable industry stakeholders.  There is widespread agreement that the future for Ireland in this area lies in offering a high quality product.  The ultimate aim is to increase the number of international students and, consequently, earnings from this vital sector.  However, it is not a case of numbers at all costs.  Student immigration channels are recognised in every jurisdiction as being open to abuse by economic migrants; therefore, we must be clear that we are selling education, rather than jobs.  Colleges which do not recognise this reality have a very limited future.  We need to develop or, in some cases, redevelop key markets.  In this regard, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service is working in partnership with the colleges on a number of programmes, the most recent of which is a pilot scheme with the English language sector to relaunch the Chinese market for adults and juniors.</P>
        <P>These initiatives send certain important messages: first, that Ireland is open for business; second, that we are prepared to think creatively about how to use the immigration system in support of the national economic interest; and, third, that any changes must be properly thought through in advance and based on appropriate risk assessment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for that answer.  I know things have developed in this area in recent months, of which even the people who put questions to me may not be fully aware.  We are very reliant in the moves we make.  Why can we not stand on our own two feet as opposed to following what the United Kingdom is doing?  Why is Ireland restricting the issuing of visas to buy property here?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not know the answer to the Senator&rsquo;s second question.  I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to answer it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Senator's first question, we are dependent on what Britain does because there is, and always has been, a common travel area between both jurisdictions.  This has been a key part of our immigration strategy since the foundation of the State.  We cannot take a move the British have not taken, on the basis that there is a land border between both jurisdictions and we are, consequently, dependent on them.  We do not want to take a position relating to our nationals and their ability to travel on an east-west basis.  That is why there is such dependency.</P>

    <sTitle>Rare Diseases</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>My matter relates to the medical condition epidermolysis bullosa, commonly known as EB.  It refers to a group of genetic conditions, the central feature of which is extreme fragility of the skin.  It is characterised by blisters and wounds on the skin and internal linings following even very minor friction.  Children with the condition are often referred to as butterfly children, due to their skin being as fragile as a butterfly&rsquo;s wings.  Mild forms of EB result in chronic pain and immobility.  Severe forms affect many systems of the body, can be fatal in infancy or result in dramatically reduced life expectancy, and cause patients to live in constant pain.  EB is a rare condition affecting an estimated one in every 18,000 babies born.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to deal with this matter.  I raise the matter because DEBRA Ireland has been in contact with me.  Its members, for a variety of reasons, are concerned about the difficulties experienced by EB patients.  For example, EB is not included in the long-term illness scheme. Many families do not qualify for the medical card on financial grounds and must rely on the unpredictable and subjective methods of assessment for qualification on a discretionary basis.  When a medical card has been approved for an EB patient, it must be renewed regularly, despite the fact that EB is a lifelong incurable condition.  Dressings are not listed as reimbursable items in the general medical or drugs payment schemes.  I learned of one case where medication and dressings cost more than &euro;1,000 per month.  In many cases, dressings must be acquired through the hardship scheme, which is available only to those who have a medical card.  The assessment process for the hardship scheme is, once again, subjective and tenuous as it is dependent on having an understanding and supportive local public health nurse or pharmacist.  In addition to these challenges, many non-prescriptive drugs are required by EB patients but are not covered by the State schemes.</P>
        <P>I seek a recognition of this condition as a long-term illness for which a medical card should be automatically provided.  The difficulties in accessing medication must be streamlined and the obstacles I have outlined removed.  The condition affects a small number of people but clinical photographs of patients are frightening and families who must deal with the condition every day find obstacles in the way of accessing the services, medication and support they need.  I ask that the matter be considered.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The long-term illness scheme is a non-means tested scheme.  It provides free medicines and medical appliances for people with 15 specified conditions.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme.</P>
        <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme.  Under this scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, non-reimbursed medical expenses can be offset against tax.</P>
        <P>Rare diseases are those which affect fewer than one in 2,000 people.  Between 5,000 and 8,000 rare diseases have been described, affecting about 6% to 8% of the population in the course of their lives.  Many of these conditions are complex, severe and debilitating.  Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare disease.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has been supportive of the EU proposals on rare diseases.  Countries are recommended to develop plans or strategies, preferably by the end of 2013.  We are now well advanced in developing this work in Ireland.  In April 2011, the Minister for Health established a national steering group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases.  The national steering group identified a number of areas relating to rare diseases which it is considering, including centres of expertise, access to appropriate medication and technology, orphan drug development, research and information and patient empowerment and support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An integral part of an effective policy framework will be the development of a dedicated HSE clinical programme.  A proposal has been submitted to the HSE to establish a national clinical programme for rare diseases.  The HSE has agreed to establish such a programme, the details of which remain to be worked through.  In addition the steering group is planning to consult patients and key stakeholders in early summer on the broad proposals and recommendations that will emerge.  It is expected that the steering group will submit a plan to the Minister for Health during the latter half of this year.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>My information is that one in 18,000 babies born is affected by this disease.  At present, 88 patients are attending the two specialist EB clinics in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  The number of people affected is extremely small.  All I ask is that EB be classified as a long-term illness.  There is no cure for the disease; it is there for life.  Serious consideration should be given to including EB in the long-term illness programme.</P>
        <P>I was given the example of a family in Swords who have two girls, aged three and eight, and who have had to surmount all the obstacles I listed to get medical cards and to put support systems in place.  It is quite difficult for parents to deal with that.  First, they must deal with the knowledge that their children have a long-term illness that will not go away.  Second, they must deal with the condition day to day.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider what I ask.  It is not a huge demand.  The number of people affected is small.  The one in 18,000 figure translates as approximately five babies being born with the condition every year in Ireland.  We should give serious consideration to this matter and I ask that this be done.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate where the Senator is coming from and the challenges the diagnosis of a rare disease poses for an individual and his or her family.  I do not believe the long-term illness scheme is the appropriate way to address some of these issues.  The long-term illness scheme relates to 15 particular chronic illnesses that affect significant cohorts of the population.  The intention was to relieve the cost of the additional medication associated with those conditions.  The appropriate way to address rare diseases is through the clinical programme, as outlined in the reply, and also in terms of the steering group which is due to report to the Minister.  I do not say for one moment that we do not recognise the difficulties associated with rare diseases, but action is under way to address them in a way that is specific to the rare condition itself.</P>

    <sTitle>Redundancy Issues</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Today I took a short walk from these buildings to Dawson Street.  I called into the Game shop to offer support and solidarity to the workers in the shop who are engaged in a sit-in.  As the Minister of State is aware, that is the case in many centres throughout the State and in the UK.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise this Adjournment motion because of the gaps in legislation on the protection of workers who find themselves in such a situation.  We can look at examples such as Waterford Crystal, TalkTalk, Vita Cortex, La Senza and now Game.  While the issues are not all the same; the trend is the same in terms of a lack of employment rights in certain areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The best thing I can do is read a copy of the statement I was given by the workers, which eloquently outlines their plight and circumstances.  It reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">As of 26 March Game has told all employees in the Republic of Ireland that they are being made redundant.  The company has appointed administrators, PricewaterhouseCoopers in the UK to look after the stores that are being closed there but they have failed to appoint a receiver to the business in the Republic of Ireland.  We have only been told to make a claim to the State for our statutory redundancy entitlements, a process which we have not been offered any support with, and which we understand will take more than a year to complete while Game and PricewaterhouseCoopers walk away from any responsibility or liability in the Republic of Ireland, even while they have asked us to remove all company assets back to the UK, which we believe puts them out of reach of any Irish creditors.  We believe Game and PricewaterhouseCoopers are making us a burden on the Irish State and Irish taxpayer while avoiding their responsibilities.  Employees have not been given any of the paperwork or information required to claim redundancy from the State.  We were instead given information about UK redundancy procedures.  We were informed that we would not be paid redundancy or any statutory or contractual notice periods or any outstanding annual leave.  Game and PricewaterhouseCoopers are still trading as a going concern in the UK and we feel that they should pay us the wages and entitlements we are due, including statutory notice and redundancy payments rather than forcing us to spend a year our families do not have claiming our entitlements from the Irish State and taxpayers.  Game and PricewaterhouseCoopers can expedite these payments and allow staff to pay their mortgages and feed their families without having to wait as much as 16 months for their just entitlements.  We, the employees of Game Ireland, believe the way we are being treated is wholly unfair and unjust.  We are now sitting in our stores as a form of protest until Game and PricewaterhouseCoopers address our concerns.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That takes us back to the first sit-in which got prominence, which involved the Waterford Crystal workers.  Then we saw what happened with La Senza, Vita Cortex and now with Game.  A Labour Party motion was tabled in this House which called for an increase in the notice period an employer would have to give workers from 30 days to 60 days.  That is something we must seriously consider.  There are also provisions in the industrial relations Bill which exclude companies that are in receivership from having to give such notice.  However, an anomaly arises in cases such as this where a company may not be solvent in this country but is operating in the UK or elsewhere.  It should be liable while it is still generating profits and making money but not paying workers just entitlements.  There are legislative gaps and they must be filled.  We cannot continue to have such sit-ins and protest where workers are simply demanding basic entitlements.  It is high time the Government acted on what is happening in these areas and put in place legislation to enhance employment rights in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am responding to the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2011, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is then entitled to a rebate from the State.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the social insurance fund.</P>
        <P>The insolvency payments scheme operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984, and is designed to protect certain outstanding pay related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  Such entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, and payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Social Protection has no plans to change this legislation.  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001 provide that, if an employee has been in continuous service with the same employer for at least 13 weeks, the employee is entitled to a minimum period of notice if the employer terminates the contract of employment.  The Acts, which are under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, do not prevent an employee from accepting payment in lieu of notice.  The period of notice varies according to the length of service as follows: 13 weeks to two years service &mdash; one week&rsquo;s notice; two years to five years service &mdash; two weeks&rsquo; notice; five years to ten years service &mdash; four weeks&rsquo; notice; ten years to 15 years service &mdash; six weeks&rsquo; notice; more than 15 years &mdash; eight weeks&rsquo; notice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under redundancy payments legislation, an eligible employee must receive at least two weeks&rsquo; notice.  This two-week notice period can overlap with the minimum notice period provided for under the minimum notice legislation.  The minimum notice legislation provides a means of redress for an employee who believes he or she has not received his or her entitlements, whereby the employee can make a claim for compensation to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I am informed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, that he has no plans to amend the existing minimum notice legislation.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State&rsquo;s statement indicates that the Minister for Social Protection has no plans to change the legislation on redundancies and also that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has no plans to amend the existing minimum notice legislation.  My simple question is what the Minister of State has to say to the workers who are engaged in a sit-in in Game.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did not realise the Senator was raising a particular case.  If he had given notice of that we may have been in a position to respond more adequately to it.  If he is in a position to give me details of the case he raises I am happy to raise it with the Minister for Social Protection whom I expect will revert to him on the matter.</P>
