      <P>I have received notice from Senator Colm Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to outline the procedures in place to prevent counterfeit pesticides from being sold in the Irish market.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Averil Power of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance, given the success of the action taken by the IBRC to overturn a recent adjudication of bankruptcy in the United Kingdom, to discuss with NAMA the need to appeal the recent UK court decision declaring the bankruptcy of the Priory Hall developer, in order to thwart his attempt at bankruptcy tourism and discourage others from taking the same route.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jim Walsh of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to make a statement on the forthcoming legislation to amend our outdated bankruptcy laws.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">Go dtabharfadh an t-Aire Sl&aacute;inte soil&eacute;iri&uacute; maidir le todhcha&iacute; na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; fiacl&oacute;ireachta, go h&aacute;irithe do ph&aacute;ist&iacute; i gConamara agus &Aacute;rainn.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>

      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>

      <Col N="930" />
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to change his policy on ministerial school visits, and that he visit schools around the country which should be an essential part of his duties.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Colm Burke, Power, Walsh and &Oacute; Clochartaigh and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, referral of the report of the Joint Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions on &ldquo;Revised Orders of Reference for the Joint Committee&rdquo; to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to be taken without debate; No. 2, referral to the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture papers connected with the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee under the Broadcasting Act 2009, to be taken without debate; and No. 3, statements, questions and answers on agriculture and fisheries, to commence at the conclusion of No. 2 and conclude not later than 1.45 p.m., with the first hour confined to agricultural matters and the second to fisheries, the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed five minutes on each topic, Sinn F&eacute;in contributions not to exceed two minutes on each topic and those of all other Senators not to exceed one minute when asking a question of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins">

      <P Just="Left">The Minister will contribute for ten minutes on agriculture.  We will then proceed with the agriculture debate.  The Minister will then contribute for ten minutes on fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the proposal to take No. 1 without debate.  I do so on the basis that the Joint Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions was set up prior to the decision of the people in the referendum to reject the proposed 30th amendment to the Constitution.  As the Government&rsquo;s proposals were not acceptable to the public it is not acceptable that this committee should sit at all.  It is a cross-over of the Committee of Public Accounts and a number of other committees.  At the very least, this motion should be debated.  Every Member should be aware of the terms of reference of the new committee and of what it will do.  Will it be a toothless committee?  I suggest that it will be.  On that basis, I will oppose the proposal to take No. 1 without debate.  We could afford some time next week to debate it.  We should put aside an hour next week to look at this motion and discuss it.</P>
      <P>I give a guarded welcome to the Government&rsquo;s eventual publication of the personal insolvency Bill, to deal with the mounting crisis in unsecured personal debt and mortgage debt.    This is a substantial Bill and we will be looking at it in detail.  The draft will have to go to committee and the Bill will be considered by the Houses but my main concern is that it leaves the power with the banks to make the final decision.  It does not set up an independent statutory office, like the debt settlement agency Fianna F&aacute;il proposed, to look at difficulties of mortgagee and the bank&rsquo;s position, and then rule on the debt.  The Bill leaves it to the banks to play ball.</P>
      <P>I put this reservation, particularly in light of Mr. Richard Edelman&rsquo;s trust barometer which was published this morning.  It shows that only 9% of Irish people have any trust in the Irish <Col N="931" />banking system.  The fundamental flaw in the legislation is that it is left to the bank to decide the amount of mortgage debt, if any, it will write down.  That is not how we should go forward.  I would like the Leader to outline the timeframe for the Bill.</P>
      <P>Last week, the HSE published its 2012 service plan.  There does not appear to be any proposal to debate this document in either House.  I ask the Leader to set aside time next week to have a proper and full debate on the HSE service plan for 2012 and to cover a number of items across the sector.  Concerns have been raised regarding the agreement of the Minister for Health to close up to 900 public nursing home beds.  In this regard, the Minister has a conflict of interest.  He should not be overseeing nursing home policy because of his own business interests in this area.  At the very least this plan should be debated.</P>
      <P>The plan was raised yesterday in the D&aacute;il in the context of the number of midwives in Limerick who will shortly retire.  In the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, 11 midwives will retire and eight will retire in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, a short walk from Leinster House.  What plans has the Government put in place to fill those vacancies?  We were told the Government would do as much as possible to protect front-line services.  I have genuine concerns in this regard.  Two of the most important maternity hospitals in this city will be down 19 midwives between them.  Does the Minister for Health have any plans to sanction the filling of those posts?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Skills has allowed retiring teachers to come back to finish the examination year.  That makes sense.  We are talking about the birth of children and about losing people with vast experience in the Rotunda and Holles Street hospitals.  I am sure the Government will not turn a blind eye to this problem.  What plans has it in place to fill those vacancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s debt and bankruptcy relief plan and the publication of the draft general scheme of the personal insolvency Bill.  I have the draft scheme here.  It is a very lengthy scheme.  It was circulated yesterday to the members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  We will be conducting public hearings on the Bill.  To follow what Senator O&rsquo;Brien said, the scheme is still in draft format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P>It is subject to legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, to a report by the joint committee and to submissions from anyone who has an interest in the area.  The Minister has let that be known.  Changes may still be made.</P>
      <P>From my first reading it is not my understanding that it gives powers to the banks.  Rather, it will assist the 30,000 home owners who are in arrears and provide, for the first time, a series of measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Senator to read the draft again, because the power is with the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P>They include a State-run insolvency service, a system of debt release certificates for forgiveness of debt for those who have no assets and no income and are unable to meet qualifying debts totalling up to &euro;20,000, a debt settlement arrangement scheme and a personal insolvency arrangement.  A series of measures are set out in the scheme.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The joint committee has been told we have a tight timeframe to report to the Minister.  We will be having meetings with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and with the Irish Society of Insolvency Practitioners on 15 February and we will be preparing and pub<Col N="932" />lishing a report on the heads of the Bill by the end of February.  A meeting is scheduled for 22 February.  Things are moving very swiftly.  There is also a need for consultation on the Bill.</P>
      
      <P>My own reaction to the report on trust in the banking system was amazement that as many as 9% of people still have trust in the banks.  I thought it would have been closer to zero.</P>
      <P>I welcome the news that the first sale of Irish bonds since 2010 was made yesterday by the National Treasury Management Agency, which sold just over &euro;3.5 billion worth of three year debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh">

    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time any of the three eurozone economies in bailout has succeeded in selling bonds of this maturity.  That is an important point.  It is welcome, particularly on the day when an unwelcome repayment was made.  Those of us on the Government side are, of course, most unhappy at paying the Anglo Irish Bank bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Another U-turn.  Another Labour Party broken promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P>We saw it as a necessary evil.  That was clearly set out by the T&aacute;naiste and by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  It is very much an evil and we do not like to have to do it.  However, it is a strategy that appears to be working and we are going to work with it in an attempt to ensure that we achieve growth.  No real or practical alternative has been offered by those who have been shouting about repaying this bond.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail">
      <NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I, too, would welcome a debate on No. 1 on the Order Paper.  It may be due to my own lack of experience, but I do not know what it is about.  The Independent group of Senators is not represented on the Joint Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions.  I would welcome a debate and an information briefing for the Seanad on the matter.  I support Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I also commend the House for the excellent debate last evening on the Independent group of Senators motion on disability.  I attended the debate but did not speak. However, as the Seanad can do, it taught me an enormous amount about the issues facing a rights based approach to disability and Government policy. The debate was rich and informative, as was the quality of the contributions from all parties and all sides. There was no political point scoring either and the debate showed how the Seanad can deal with contentious and sensitive issue imaginatively. My lasting impression was of the contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who was passionate, informed and on top of her brief. I believe in her commitment to resolve the issue of individualisation and look forward to her making progress on it. </P>
      <P Just="Left">One of the themes that came out of the debate was of the conclusions and recommendations of the Ryan report. We are coming to the third anniversary of its publication in May. In this regard, I highlight my concerns at the detention of children in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution in Dublin, which is a part of Mountjoy Prison. St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is a medium security prison where male offenders between the ages of 16 and 21 are detained. Although children under 16 are detained in the children&rsquo;s detention schools, boys over 16 continue to be detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, in an environment considered wholly inappropriate for their needs. This <Col N="933" />is an arbitrary distinction on the grounds of age and has no basis in law. On 15 June 2011, there were 41 boys aged 16 and 17, which is wholly inappropriate. </P>
      <P Just="Left">A briefing from the Irish Penal Reform Trust has called for an immediate end to the detention of children in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, as has the Ombudsman for Children. I understand the Ombudsman for Children is also responsible to the Oireachtas in this matter. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail">
      <NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have two questions, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and thank you for reminding me.  They relate to this issue.  Before I ask the questions I will mention the proposal for Oberstown.  The programme for Government includes a proposal to build a detention centre there but there has been no final decision on it.  I know funding for the project is being investigated.</P>
      <P Just="Left">My two questions are these.  First, can the Leader ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for an update on the Oberstown capital project to house children in detention?  Second, I ask the Leader to lead a call from the Seanad to extend the power and remit of the Ombudsman for Children to hear complaints from children held in prison, on the same basis as children detained elsewhere.  This issue emerged in the Ryan report.  Children are detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  This is why the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, whose former chief executive is our colleague Senator Jillian van Turnhout, gave an F grade to the Government.  To give this extended remit to the ombudsman would be a simple cost effective measure.  It would not cost &euro;60 million or &euro;100 million.  The Ombudsman for Children should hear complaints and should be able to listen to children who are detained in adult institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RonanMullen">
      <NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba bhre&aacute; liom tac&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Mac Conghail.  I wish to be associated with everything he has just said.  Is there anything the Seanad can do to contribute to greater clarity on where a referendum fits into our plans for the fiscal compact and our agreement with our European partners?  There seems to be an element of confusion about this.  Listening this morning to a member of the fiscal advisory council suggesting that it was not desirable to hold a referendum, it quickly became clear that Professor McHale was referring to the idea that a referendum would be a means to entrench whatever agreement might be made and to require that Irish law would follow whatever agreement might be made.  He suggested that would not be sufficiently flexible to deal with various eventualities, on which I agree with him.</P>
      <P Just="Left">However, that is a separate question from whether a referendum is needed in order to permit Ireland to make a treaty of the kind that is proposed.  We should not be confused on this point.  Professor McHale seemed to be suggesting that our European partners might be looking for a degree of certitude about every member state&rsquo;s participation and that each country would be constitutionally required to follow the terms of a particular treaty.  While I do not believe I would be very happy with that, whether a referendum would be necessary in order to allow us to participate in such a treaty at all is a separate question.  Therefore it would be wrong for anybody to take from this morning&rsquo;s discussion that there was some kind of serious objection to holding a referendum <i>per se</i>.  It may very well be that a referendum is needed before the country can even participate in such a treaty.  I note the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reticence about giving a commitment on whether a referendum will be held. It is a matter we could attempt to debate here. The issues are not so unclear as to prevent our making some kind of analysis of whether a referendum is needed. </P>
      <Col N="934" />
      
      <P Just="Left">I wish to mention the cause of guidance counselling in secondary schools.  There is considerable concern about how the change will impact on the personal support given to students in our schools.  I noted this morning&rsquo;s debate between Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in of the Labour Party and a spokesperson for chaplains.  It is very regrettable that some people seem to be using the very legitimate cause of guidance counselling as some kind of stick with which to beat school chaplaincy, which is wrong.  It would be very welcome if the Institute of Guidance Counsellors were to make it clear that it does not want to see its very good cause advanced on the back of some kind of attack on school chaplaincy.  One thing that has come from this debate is that the relatively small sum of &euro;9 million being spent on school chaplaincy is entrenched with the deeds of trust of community schools and so on, but there is an inequality in that system in that voluntary schools have not had access to paid chaplains over the years.  This is one of a number of inequalities that has been to the disadvantage of voluntary schools over the years.  It is difficult to get any progress on such an issue given the current economic circumstances but it is a matter to which we will need to return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaitKeane">
      <NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to raise the issue of JobBridge with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  Certain sectors of society are disenfranchised and cannot apply for the JobBridge scheme, including the disabled, lone parents and widows.  As employers can now push workplace placements into JobBridge, it further disenfranchises those sectors of society.  If they want to do an internship &mdash; very often the only avenue now available to those people is through the JobBridge programme &mdash; it is discriminatory.  As we all know there are many types of disabilities.  I know of one person who is studying journalism and when he has finished, it would be ideal for him to get that type of experience.  However, because he is in receipt of a disability allowance, that avenue is closed to him.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">Advertisements for three organisations have come to my attention.  The Irish Wheelchair Association and the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind have advertised positions for which, owing to the rules of JobBridge, disabled persons cannot apply.  Even the Irish Family Planning Association advertised a job for which single parents cannot apply.  I ask that the Minister, Deputy Burton, review the scheme to open it to disabled people on equality grounds.  I commend her for the introduction of JobBridge.  I know of employers who have had a great experience with the people they took on under the scheme and whom they will hire when the scheme finishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane">
      <NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Mac Conghail on the very constructive debate we had on the issue of people with disabilities.  Since the first sitting of this Seanad I have not raised the issue of the future of the Seanad because it is important for us to get on with the business we were elected to do and not continually discuss the future of the House.  However, the Leader and the Chairman of the petitions committee should introduce a work programme for the year.  This is one of the new departures we all welcome.  A number of ideas have already been floated regarding investigating the retail sector, young people, suicide and others.  We had a very good discussion on human rights.  We should go further than just bringing in advocate groups for meetings of the petitions committee.  We should consider publishing joint agreed reports on those issues.  Those reports should not be just reports, but action plans which could then inform public debate on these important issues.  That would be the most powerful thing we could do coming out of those committees.</P>
      <P>The motion we debated last night proposed to compel the Government to do certain things and was about action.  While the petitions committee is a new and welcome departure, if nothing comes out at the end of those engagements, it could be seen as another talking shop and that we are not getting what we should be getting from those engagements.  The sittings we have <Col N="935" />had have been very constructive.  I ask the Leader to accept the constructive element of my proposal.  We should not simply have those sittings but should also publish reports which would add weight to the status of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The petitions committee of the Seanad is known as the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, but I am sure the Leader will be able to respond to the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Deputy Leader in welcoming the progress the Government has made in addressing the issue of personal insolvency, personal debt and mortgage distress.  I am surprised at the negative tone of Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, given a very positive contribution by his party&rsquo;s justice spokesperson on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning when he very much welcomed the heads of the Bill and rightly indicated that he will be proposing some amendments during the course of the Bill&rsquo;s passage.</P>
      <P>This leads me on to a very prestigious housing affordability study which indicates that housing prices are now back within the reach of ordinary workers for the first time in a long time.  During the madness of the Celtic tiger an ordinary home cost ten times the average industrial wage, whereas it is now back within three times the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>The Leader will be pleased to know that the most affordable place in Ireland to purchase a home is Waterford.  I am sure his colleague will also be pleased to hear that.  It is closely followed by Galway, Cork and then Dublin and Limerick.  This should be exceptionally good news, particularly for people who have full-time permanent jobs and are in secure employment.  However, there is a problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">The problem is that the banks are not lending to people who are in permanent, full-time secure employment in order that they can purchase homes.  I ask the Leader to make some arrangement for consultation with representatives of the banks to see what progress they are making in freeing up badly needed finance for people who wish to purchase their own homes.  Many affordable homes are available but people cannot get mortgages.  I have been contacted by people in my own constituency who have permanent full-time jobs, and some also have land, but they cannot get money from the banks.  Despite what the banks are telling us, the money is not flowing.  We need to do something about this.  I ask the Leader to liaise with the Minister for Finance in order that we can have a briefing, at an early stage, as to what progress is being made to force the banks to lend to legitimate borrowers. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkDaly">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I, too, call for a debate on the recommendation of the Fiscal Advisory Council.  The council produced only one previous report to the Government.  Prior to the budget it suggested cuts of &euro;4.8 billion, which the Government rejected out of hand.  The council is now saying there should not be a referendum on the forthcoming intergovernmental treaty.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has embraced this advice, which suits the Government&rsquo;s agenda.  It is sensible that such fiscal constraint should not be written into the Constitution but should be dealt with by way of legislation. However, the Fiscal Advisory Council is not addressing the transfer of democratic power to the EU in the forthcoming treaty. While it is all well and good to talk about budgetary measures, and <Col N="936" />sensible that Ireland would retain control of our own budgetary situation in terms of borrowing money when we get back into the market, transferring democratic powers to Europe and allowing EU oversight, as the Bundestag had oversight of our budget, is another matter. </P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkDaly">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is, can we have a debate on the forthcoming EU treaty?  As has been pointed out, Ireland does not have a position.  We are going into the negotiation with our hands hanging.  We have no position paper and we have not debated the treaty here or in the D&aacute;il.  We will be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>.  There is a democratic deficit in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  We will be shown a treaty when it is completed and told there is no need for a referendum.

      <P>I remind Members of the Seanad of the provision in the Constitution that if 31 Members of this House and one third of the Members of the D&aacute;il call for a referendum the President can be petitioned to hold one.  This could be done, despite what the Government is trying to do, which is to take powers away from the people of the country.  This power rests with Members on the Government side of the House.  Whether Government Senators are for or against the treaty, the people should have their say.</P>

It is a huge burden.  I am really looking forward to debating a Bill that will help Irish families to feel less worried and to grow again.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House for a comprehensive debate on small rural schools?  I asked for this on two occasions last week.  The Minister came to the House yesterday, but it was to debate the Education (Amendment) Bill and it would not have been appropriate to raise this subject.  Small rural schools are at a juncture. Many Senators will agree with me that this matter deserves time and debate.  I want us to have that debate. Otherwise we cannot possibly represent the real concerns about Gaeltacht schools, rural DEIS schools and disadvantage in rural areas. The difficulties of multiple classes in rural schools, as distinct from single classes in urban schools, are not really understood. Let us have this debate in the House. </P>

While the Bill contains many welcome features, many of them were included in the Bills Fianna F&aacute;il put forward and which were defeated.  Those Bills are ready to go and could still be implemented.</P>
      <P>As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the proposed Bill will leave the banks in control.  There is nothing in the draft Bill published today that the banks could not do themselves if they wished.  What makes the Minister for Justice and Equality thank that when we pass the Bill the banks will adopt its processes as a way forward?  We must have an independent authority, as proposed in our Bill.  I implore the Labour Party and Fine Gael to go down that route.  Otherwise banks will not engage in the way required to help families.</P>

There were two amendments, one in the name of the Government and one in the name of Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is significant that they were both withdrawn.  The Minister of State accepted what was said graciously and spoke passionately on the issue.

She was not a member of the criminal community and was part of an extended family with no criminal associations.  She came here from Romania in order to continue the work she had been doing looking after younger members of that family.  They lived in derelict conditions in a roofless house and did some begging.  We should register in this House that the Roma community, which is so often despised and which was targeted by Hitler and put in concentration camps, and which is despised all over Europe and held up to contumely and contempt routinely in the media here, does contain decent people.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pursued its investigations quietly and patiently and I hope an arrest will soon follow and that it gets the conviction that looks likely.  It is important to state that not all the members of the Roma community are as portrayed in the media.</P>

I would welcome a debate on Government policy on this and feel it is important to get ideas on it and to bring joined-up thinking to this area.  I also welcome the fact the ESB has announced it is putting a 110 Kv line into Connemara in the near future.  However, we have already heard from people trying to develop wind energy that they will not be able to link into that.  It is important therefore to have joined-up thinking on these issues.

      <P>I wish to add to what my colleague Senator C&aacute;it Keane had to say on the JobBridge programme.  When it was introduced, a public nursing home applied to be included in the programme, but it was advised it could not be part of it.  However, representations having been made to the Minister, she changed the regulation so that now people who want to get experience of working with elderly people can apply to public nursing homes and get on to the JobBridge programme.  This is working out well.  I spoke to the matron of the nursing home in question yesterday and she advised me that this is working out very well.  This is about training people and making them available then to work with elderly people in the community, which is welcome.</P>
      <P>The next time the Minister is in this House, it would be appropriate to have a discussion on the JobBridge programme to discuss what further changes could be made to include more people in it and to encourage employers to give them the experience they need to work in different areas.  There is a need for training in caring for the elderly and working in a public nursing home would provide significant experience that could then be used for the benefit of <Col N="940" />others.  The next time the Minister is here we should include in our discussion a review of the progress of the JobBridge programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin will be the European City of Science for 2012, with a major symposium in July with a focus on scientific achievement in this country.  I was pleased to note recently that Ireland has now been ranked third in the world for immunology, which is a burgeoning and critically important area of human biomedical science.  It is also ranked eighth in the world for field of material science.  We have come a long way in terms of advances in science which can bring huge spin-off benefits for the country.</P>
      <P>I would like the Leader to raise two points with the relevant Ministers.  I tangentially touched on the first point previously.  There is a core need for the Department of Education and Skills to develop a core science curriculum for those who will not pursue careers in science but need to understand the subject because it is the language that governs the universe in which we live.  Science should be mandatory in the same way that English, mathematics and a foreign language should be mandatory until the day young people leave secondary school.  It is an essential part of the skill set that people need to bring with them as they journey through life.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On a second specific point, I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Ministers for Health and Education and Skills moves that are afoot in Europe as part of a harmonisation process of the recognition of medical schools to derecognise medical school programmes lasting fewer than six years.  These moves reflect a traditionalist European model of medical education.  The North American model is for four years of general third level, science-based education followed by four years of postgraduate specialist medical education.  Many medical educationists around the world consider the American superior to the European model in the sense that it encourages those who have shown an aptitude for science and biology and attained a level of chronological maturity &mdash; usually their early 20s &mdash; at the time they made the decision to go into medicine.  This approach is in contrast to what happened in my case where, at the age of 14 years, I chose the subjects I would do following the intermediate certificate examination in order that I would be well positioned to get into medical school.</P>
      <P>In addition to the issue of graduate medical schools, the other issue that arises is the fact that many of the medical schools in Britain and Ireland provide medical education over five years.  As Ireland follows a British model of medical education, there is a real prospect that there will be a systematic derecognition of medical schools in these islands if the proposed European regulation is pursued.  I have been approached by representatives of the Irish medical schools seeking to ensure that this issue is placed on the agenda for public debate.  It is the kind of technical, niche area that could easily slip under the radar screen, which could be catastrophic.  As we try to position Ireland as a leading country for science, technology, medicine and health care, both in terms of service provision and manufacturing, it is vital that we have the highest possible standard for our medical schools and in terms of international recognition.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the relevant Ministers in order that they can raise it in the relevant European fora.</P>

      <P>The way in which the House conducted its business last night elevated the standing of the Seanad.  It was a new departure in terms of policy making, policy discussion and policy delivery, which is the reason Senators are here.  We saw significant movement in the right direction last night.  People with disabilities will have their rights enshrined in legislation and we will see long overdue legislation on mental capacity.  I hope 2012 will be a pioneering year for people with special needs and physical and intellectual disabilities.  If the Government wishes to do something memorable, it should deliver this policy early in the programme for Government.  I appreciate the contributions made in the House last night.</P>
      <Col N="941" />
      <P>The issue of small rural schools is an important one which warrants a debate in some shape or form.  Education ensures people have equal opportunities and the best possible chances.  Early intervention is crucial in this regard.  While I do not have all the answers, a debate on education similar to the debate on disability last night and job creation last week could generate ideas which would benefit the formation of educational policy in government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome in general terms the publication yesterday of the heads of a Bill to deal with the personal and mortgage debt crisis that is gripping the country, unfortunately the proposed legislation does not go far enough.  This is particularly the case when one considers the point raised by Senator MacSharry concerning individuals who are in difficulty due to mortgages and other forms of debt but do not have an independent means of liaising with a financial creditor.  The onus of responsibility for finding a solution ultimately rests with the creditor, in other words, a financial institution or bank, none of which can be trusted to find solutions.  An independent agency or authority must be established for this purpose and it is unfortunate the heads of Bill do not make such provision.  I hope the House will have an early debate on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I also ask for a debate on banking and the absence of a flow of funds to businesses seeking credit.  The flow of funds is the lifeblood of the economy but banks are not lending.  The House should have a detailed debate on the role banks are playing in the economy.  While we can discuss finance and banking generally, we also need a specific debate on the role of banks in stifling the economy.  Past and current bankers are a disgrace and senior bankers should hang their heads in shame.  While they claim to be making funds available, we all know from what is happening on the ground that this is not the case.  The Seanad should hold banks accountable.  We should invite the Financial Regulator to the House for a debate.  The Minister for Finance should come to the House to be cross-examined on what precisely is happening on the ground.  We could all cite examples of what is happening.  I hope the Leader will organise such a debate.</P>

      <P>The Seanad played a significant role in the work that led up to the peace process, about which we are all so pleased.  It held regular and balanced debates and many of the contributions we heard were based on the personal experience of Members from their interaction with their counterparts in the North and its different traditions.  The achievements which have flowed from the peace process and Good Friday Agreement are exceptionally encouraging.  Members are involved in cross-Border committees, interparliamentary meetings and so forth and have learned that we share common problems.  Unemployment, for example, is common to both parts of the island.  Both jurisdictions have vulnerable members of the community and both must defend their position internationally.  These are common issues and it would be exceptionally helpful, in light of the role the Seanad played in the peace process, if the Leader were to consider establishing a process under which we would invite people from different political persuasions to the House for a debate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I was particularly gratified to receive a letter from the First and Deputy First Ministers, Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness.  The leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party has also been in touch with me.  I recently travelled to Derry where I attended a meeting at which representatives of all the political groupings, the chamber of commerce and the integration <Col N="942" />committee were present alongside the local police commander.  Not long ago, we could not have foreseen such an event in our wildest dreams.  Let us build on this.  I thank Senator Moran for raising the issue which is not about Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute;&Eacute;ireann or the Fleadh Cheoil but the opportunities available to the entire island at present.  We all accept there is a completely new dispensation between this island, the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe and the world at present.   Would it not be great if this House, which is so capable in this regard, tried to formalise that in some way?  It will probably not happen in the D&aacute;il.  That is no reflection on the D&aacute;il but this is the House to do it.  I urge the Leader, who played such a significant role in those debates in the past 15 or 20 years, to consider whether there is a way we could take it forward one step further.  Again, I thank Senator Moran for raising that matter.</P>

      <P>The threat to small rural schools is very real and the Government will have to revisit the issue.  Some concern has been expressed in the House, in particular by those on the Government side, which I welcome.  These schools are a very important infrastructure in what is left of rural Ireland, especially in our Gaeltacht areas where, as Members will know, the pupil-teacher ratio has received a double whammy.  We could finish up with just one school on the entire Corca Dhuibhne peninsula, from Tralee to Slea Head.</P>
      <P>I  do not know if Members are watching a wonderful programme on TG4 called &ldquo;Fearabh Fionntr&aacute;&rdquo; about the lifestyle, traditions and history of the Corca Dhuibhne area.  All the people who participated in the programme were educated in very small schools and achieved a lot in life.  It would be very serious if that attack on Gaeltacht schools, in particular, was allowed to mature.</P>
      <P>I support the comments of my colleague, Senator Mary White, on the future of local government.  Yesterday&rsquo;s presentation to us by the Local Authority Members Association executive was quite lucid.  The people have not really cottoned on to the fact that there is a serious threat to their system of local government which they trust and of which they feel they have ownership in a way they do not feel they have ownership of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  They know their local councillor and council, whether town or county council.  The Minister is bypassing the consultation process in this regard.  It is quite clear he is moving very swiftly to legislation.  We should insist this Chamber has a proper debate on the future of local government and, in particular, of town government which we have had since the late 19th century and which is clearly under threat by the Minister.</P>

Many commentators in the media have a lot to say about this House but we seldom see any of them in the House reporting on it.  This is something on which we will have to work.

      <P>Senators C&aacute;it Keane and Colm Burke referred to problems which have arisen with the JobBridge programme.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is very open to changes to improve the programme and I am sure she would welcome any suggestions in that regard.  It is an excellent programme and if it needs to be tweaked in some way, I am sure she would be very amenable to that.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator David Cullinane referred to the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, which has been very effective and worked on the rights of older people.  I wish to inform the Senator that its report is being prepared.  It was delayed because of research problems but we will have it within the next number of weeks.  It can be debated in this House, if necessary, but it is intended to hand it over to the Government and I hope it will be acted on.  That is the idea of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, that is, that we compile a report after each consultation, that it is debated, that it is handed over to the Government, that we see action on it and that the committee is not just a talking shop.  Unfortunately, the initial report has been delayed but I hope there will not be such a delay with the publication of subsequent reports.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Michael Mullins mentioned the cost of houses.  A number of people mentioned that the cost of houses was coming down but the problem is banks not giving mortgages, or freeing up finance for people who need mortgages.  That is not being addressed.  Despite what the banks say, the lack of credit is crippling not only businesses but also people looking for mortgages.  The Government will have to increase the pressure on the lending institutions in this regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators Healy Eames, Martin Conway, Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan and others called for a debate on small schools in Gaeltacht and rural areas.  Senator Healy Eames tabled a matter for the Adjournment debate.  We will endeavour to get the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss that matter specifically.  As the Senator mentioned, the Minister was in the House yesterday to deal with legislation.  He will be back next week to take Committee Stage of that Bill.  Getting him to return to the House for a debate on a different matter will be difficult but I will endeavour to do so.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Ivana Bacik addressed the personal insolvency Bill.  In terms of having a debate here and a similar debate at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, we should avoid duplication as much as possible in that regard.</P>

      <P>Senator David Norris complimented the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the investigation into the murder of a young Roma lady.  We would all like to compliment the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on their daily work and hope the perpetrators of this act will be brought to justice.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Sheahan mentioned Kerry, which his compatriot Senator Paul Coghlan mentioned last week, in complimenting Mick O&rsquo;Dwyer&rsquo;s inclusion in the hall of fame.  We had an intervention by the Leas-Chathaoirleach, a Cork man, but that had nothing to do with football.  We all compliment Mick O&rsquo;Dwyer.</P>

She referred to yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Local Authority Members Association, which expressed the concerns of local authorities with regard to proposed changes and local government reform. I will endeavour to have the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in the House to address these matters. Local democracy is important for everyone and the Minister should come into the House to discuss his plans. </P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators Moran and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the importance of the Fleadh Ceoil as an all-Ireland cultural event.  We agree with that and that music transcends barriers.  I  was involved with the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera for many years.  During the Troubles, societies from different traditions such as the Belfast Operatic Company and St. Agnes&rsquo; Choral Society could enjoy themselves in Waterford but when they went back to Belfast it was possible they would not speak to each other.  Music is very important; as such the importance of the Fleadh Ceoil cannot be overstated.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the development of natural resources.

The point can be debated when the Minister is in the House.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Crown referred to Dublin as the city of science in 2012, which we all welcome.  He also raised an important point about the de-recognition of medical schools the students of which study for five years.

    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney">
      <TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a script because I hoped this would be a question and answer session which Senators could get as much out of as possible, in terms of getting the information they are looking for.  I will try to keep my contribution as brief as I can.  We will spend the first hour on agriculture and the next on fishing.  One session can eat into the other if that is appropriate; I am in the hands of the House in that regard.</P>
      <P>I would like to focus on two things from an agricultural point of view.  First, we are going through a very good time in agriculture.  The year 2011 was a bumper one.  Prices, by and large, were strong, with one or two exceptions.  Markets are strong.  If one was to measure the success of the agrifood sector in 2011 in terms of exports, one would find 85% of everything we produce has to find a home and buyer outside Ireland.  One would have seen 12% growth.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Almost &euro;1 billion extra in food and beverage exports from Ireland was achieved last year, which is impressive.  More than one quarter of the total increase in exports from Ireland last year was directly attributable to agrifood.  On the dairy side, exports increased approximately <Col N="946" />17% last year on top of an increase of 17% the previous year, a 34% increase in the value of their exports from Ireland in two years.  The exports include cheeses, milk powder, infant formula, yoghurts, nutritional drinks, ingredients for dairy foods and so on.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the past ten years, particularly in the past three or four years, we have seen our top dairy companies move away from commodity-based products to become food companies.  Such companies include Glanbia, Dairygold, the Kerry Group and the Carbery group.  They are now leading names in areas like nutrition, flavours and the development of new exciting products.  That is very much where we want to go in terms of the food industry.  The basis of that is primary food production from our farms, which need to produce quality, safe, reliable, consistent and sustainable products.  That is the driver of all of the current policy direction in terms of efficiency and output.  My brief is also about broader rural issues, but in terms of the business of producing food that is what we are about.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">The beef sector also grew last year, not in terms of value but volume.  A lot of the increase in the value of the food sector and income for farmers has happened because commodity prices for grain, dairy products, beef, lamb and even pigs have increased significantly in recent years.  We have an obligation to try to build on the good fortune that we have in terms of commodity prices, which are catching up following a decade of stagnation in agrifood prices during the boom years in Ireland.  The irony is that during the golden so-called Celtic tiger period farmers did not do particularly well.  Now we are in a recession, European and global demand and food prices have caught up with a lot of other price inflation over relatively a short two-year period and we have seen a dramatic increase in the income of farmers to the tune of between 20% and 30% on average.</P>
      <P>Having said that, farming is still quite a low income industry.  The average income for farmers is approximately &euro;21,500 a year.  One has to take into account that half of farmers or farm families also have alternative incomes.  There are not too many millionaires in farming unless they have sold land.  Producing food for a living is a sustainable way of life and has become a more exciting business for people to enter. That is why we saw a 27% increase last year in the number of young people studying food science and agricultural science in our universities and colleges, which is a good thing.</P>
      <P>Young people are now investing in upskilling and educating themselves to take over farms and become involved in research and development on food and beverages.  It is a good sign for the future.  We need to deliver for those people to ensure they have a future that is about expansion, efficiency, improving margins, getting more from the marketplace and perhaps relying less on the support schemes that are there, even though those support schemes are hugely important, particularly for certain parts of the country.</P>
      <P>This is a sector that is going well.  We will have another strong year.  It will not be like last year or the year before in terms of this massive increase but if we can maintain a position where prices are strong, although we may have a slight weakening in some areas, particularly in dairy, prices should still remain strong in relative terms.  We can concentrate this year on consolidating the gains that have been made over the past two years and work hard to upskill farmers in terms of the margins they make and the efficiency they get into their business.</P>
      <P>The second important issue, on which I hope Senators will ask questions, concerns the Common Agricultural Policy.  We are at the start of a process of reforming CAP and there is a whole series of elements to that process.  From an Irish point of view, some of the proposals that are currently on the table from the Commission are very positive while others are of great concern.  Perhaps we can tease out some of those issues, if Senators wish.</P>
      <Col N="947" />
      <P Just="Left">There is one really big issue of concern in the current Commission proposals and there are many other issues where I would like to amend and improve what is being proposed.  For example, around greening proposals, we would like to see change as we consider that to have 30% of the overall payment being applied to a greening payment is too high.  We believe some of the conditions sought need to be more tailored for individual countries rather than being the same for everybody.  Applying the same environmental or greening requirements to Cyprus as to Sweden does not make much sense when one is talking about an entirely different type of agricultural structure, a different climate and so on.  I would like to see more flexibility in that regard.  However, these are issues we will resolve.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are also issues around the reference year of 2014, with which the farming organisations have concerns, as do many Senators and the farmers they represent.  We will find solutions to it over time during the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The big issue, however, is the proposal currently on the table for a redistribution of the single farm payment within countries and the fact this is based on an entirely new model from an Irish perspective, which is that it would be a flat rate, area-based payment.  This means that instead of relying on historical productivity as the basis for the single farm payment, one simply moves to this blunt model whereby the person gets a payment based on how much land is farmed.  Regardless of output from that land, its productivity or the investment requirement linked to the farm, the person gets the same payment.  In other words, a person who has 60 ha on the side of mountain, with very low stocking rates in sheep, gets the exact same payment for those 60 ha as a person who may be farming a highly intensive dairy farm in Wexford, who needs to spend a lot of money in terms of upgrading and so on.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is not in the interests of productivity or of the agrifood journey we want to create, which is around growth and jobs and expansion.  We are working with the Commission to try to find a solution.  While we will achieve it, it will take a lot of political effort and imagination to come up with appropriate models that are consistent with state aid rules, competition law within the European Union and also broader world trade talks limitations.  There are no easy solutions and those who pretend there are such solutions are deluding themselves.</P>
      <P Just="Left">That said, the big benefit of Commissioner Ciolos's visit to Ireland is that he has gone back to Brussels understanding in real detail the Irish problem as regards CAP, in particular this move towards a flat rate, area-based system that treats everybody the same regardless of productivity, whether one is a full-time farmer or hobby farmer or whether one is an intensive dairy or beef farmer as opposed to one who is essentially a landowner who just about qualifies as an active farmer.</P>
      <P Just="Left">What I am interested in doing is working in partnership with the Commission because Ireland will play a crucial role in terms of getting this final deal done.  Everybody accepts the CAP final deal will not be agreed by the end of 2012, yet we are all hoping to have a new deal in place and implemented from the start of 2014.  This means the deal must be done in the first half of 2013 at the latest.  Ireland has the Presidency of the European Union during that period so it is our job to get the job done.  We cannot do it on our own, however, and we will need to do it in partnership with the Commission and the European Parliament.  I am determined to try to achieve that.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We are making it absolutely clear to the Commission and to other member states that Ireland is serious about putting the resources and effort necessary into getting a compromise that all 27 member states can live with, but also, and most importantly from my point of view, getting a compromise that will take the Irish industry forward in a positive way.  We will not sacrifice Irish farmers to get a deal on CAP but, at the same time, we would like to be the country that gets this deal done because we think it is in the interests of everybody, including Ireland, that <Col N="948" />it is done next year rather than pushing it back for two or three years.  Who knows where the EU will be then?  Who knows where the political priorities may be then in terms of the allocation of significant budgets to the agrifood sector?  There is a political appetite to protect CAP funds and to keep a very significant portion of overall EU funding in the CAP bracket to support food production and to support farmers.  While that appetite is there, we need to get the deal done.</P>
      <P Just="Left">If Members have questions on any issue, I will try to answer them.  This House can play a very useful role in making a significant contribution towards the review of CAP and, indeed, the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  Both policies are being renegotiated at the same time and both will I hope come to a conclusion during the Irish Presidency, which is a very significant responsibility in regard to those areas of fishing, farming and the agrifood sector generally, which is the real heartbeat of the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill">
      <NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for being present and the Leader for facilitating the debate.  The Minister has clearly outlined the importance of the agrifood and agriculture sector within the economy.  As he said, there has been a 34% increase in exports in the past two years, which was in&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">That was in the dairy sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill">
      <NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">Yes.  In total, the sector is worth &euro;8 billion to the economy and we are exporting approximately 85% of the food we produce in Ireland.  The reality is that the economy is in a very difficult position but, through agriculture, we can work to stimulate it.  Reports show that every &euro;100 of agricultural output creates at least an additional &euro;73 for the local economy.  When we take on board the fact farmers spend about &euro;8 billion on living expenses and agricultural costs, and given most of that money is spent in the local economy, it is clear the benefit of agriculture to the economy cannot be overstated.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister has outlined some of the challenges facing the agrifood sector.  There have been huge benefits in terms of the Food Harvest 2020 report which is being implemented and which is trying to achieve the goals that have been set out.  The industry is buying into that, including the organisations representing farmers, as are the Department and the Minister&rsquo;s office, which are working towards those goals.</P>
      <P>The big challenge will be the proposed changes to CAP, which go far beyond the current CAP and some of which would almost go as far as the MacSharry reforms of 1992.  As the Minister noted, they include changes to the manner in which payments are made to farmers and challenges in regard to greening.  At the same time, many benefits and good suggestions are contained within the proposed CAP, in particular in respect of the benefits that might be available to younger farmers.  However, there also are difficulties.  The 30% figure for greening, as the Minister pointed out, is too high.  When the Commissioner attended the committee last week I made the point that perhaps greening should have been funded from the pillar 2 aspect of the CAP instead of from pillar 1.  The Commissioner did not agree.  A greening element of 30% will certainly affect productivity, in particular among larger farmers.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I take on board the point made by the Minister in regard to the difficulty the flat rate payment will provide within the Common Agricultural Policy.  However, we must also remember and never forget that many hill farmers are prohibited in many circumstances from increasing stocking rates because they cannot re-stock on the hills.  The Minister referred to one such farmer who has 60 hectares.  As a result, they cannot buy additional stock, even though many of them want to do so.  I do not believe they should be penalised by any reform in the CAP.  For example, if the funding in the single farm payment scheme were to be directed towards <Col N="949" />productivity we should not forget these farmers, particularly those in severely disadvantaged or hill areas.  They must be compensated.  We can discuss that issue later during the question and answer session.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The big challenge facing Europe is the financial one.  The fact there has been no agreement to date by the European Parliament on the multi-annual financial framework is a cause of concern to farming organisations, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe, especially as to whether we will have that framework in place in time to implement and activate the transfers from the CAP in 2014.  Perhaps the Minister might give us his thoughts on that matter.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will not continue because we will have questions and I do not want to encroach on the time of other speakers.  We will get to the crux of some of these matters when we get to questions, including regarding payments currently available to farmers and the reopening of a number of schemes.  The Minister may be able to throw some good light on these matters then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very welcome to the House where we are delighted to see him.  He has a very good brief on the entire subject.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We had a very good week last week when Commissioner Ciolas was in the House and we had the opportunity to put many questions to him.  There is a great deal of sorting out to be done but we will all work to try to bring about the best deal possible for farmers in Ireland.  I asked a question about young farmers and was particularly happy with the answer I got.  They will be very well looked after in the future regime.  That is only right because in the past eight or ten years we have seen many young and not so young farmers working without any single farm payment.  They continued trying to farm with no single farm payment.  One such farmer was featured on the programme, &ldquo;Ear to the Ground&rdquo; , a week ago.  It is difficult enough to farm with that payment.  I can only imagine what it was like to do so, keeping up the interest, with no such payment.</P>
      <P>We must consider some measure that will encourage older farmers to hand over their land at an earlier stage.  There used to be a farm retirement package for farmers who could retire at the age of 55.  There should be some little incentive for those aged 60 to 65 to hand over to younger farmers who are coming out of agri-colleges.  These colleges are full of young farmers who will be looking for some place to go to.  We should try to encourage the older farmers to hand over that little earlier.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the movement towards a flat rate payment.  It is very important that farmers in the more disadvantaged or hilly areas should get an increased payment.  The average payment has been approximately &euro;10,000 but in my part of the country many farmers would farm with a payment of less than &euro;2,000.  Some measure of flattening must be brought into the scenario.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill that many farmers were de-stocked in the year 1997-98 and were not in a position to put stock back on the hills.  I know the Minister will look favourably at that.  Something will have to be done because it will take a number of years for those farmers to get back in.  They will have to breed the stock on the hills and will not be able to buy them in because stock like that simply would not stay there.  There were cases like that in Cooley after the foot and mouth disease outbreak.  Farmers were not able to make the stock stay and so they must breed them naturally on the hills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomSheahan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not afford them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  At present they cannot do so.  The new system must be fair and must encourage people to farm for the sake of farming and producing material, rather than merely for the entitlements.  It must encourage young farmers to try to get onto the ladder.</P>
      <Col N="950" />
      
      <P>There are a number of other issues I wish to mention although I realise the Minister may not have the answers today.  In County Leitrim where I come from, representing the people of Sligo-North Leitrim, there are national issues.  The 80 km rule that was introduced in the budget is a little bit of a problem in that area.  We would have some of the poorest land in the country and people in the region must lease or rent land outside the area and travel 50, 60 or 70 miles to get to it.  They are prepared to do that, many of them being youngish farmers.  Some 60 people in County Leitrim are doing that kind of travelling and they must be catered for.  They are based in and spending their money in County Leitrim but they move out for this.  The option is to buy cereals and feed the stock indoors or rent the bit of better land where they can produce  better lamb or beef.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Stocking density is another small problem.  I know the Minister will consider this in respect of the commonage areas where people were not allowed to build up their stock.  There are hardship cases where people may have been affected by TB, or other reasons, and were not able to have the necessary stock in 2011, at point 3 of the programme.  We will continue to work on that issue.</P>
      <P>Another point, which is very important in my part of the country and which was touched on earlier, including by the Minister, is the greening or agri-environment options scheme, or AEOS.  The old REPS did the greening business for us.  In the future, if an AEOS scheme is in place, it will do some of that work for us.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Before I move away from the subject there is the issue of pillar 2 in the rural development programme.  There could be food processing industries in place.  It is possible that in County Leitrim we lost jobs to County Cork because of a technicality that existed.  People could not draw down a grant to produce food and we lost jobs.  We do not begrudge them to Cork but we could do with them in Leitrim.  It would be worthwhile considering this under the Leader programme and have people able to draw down a grant for food production in different areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan">
      <NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for the comprehensive briefing.  As many Members know, the agriculture sector is hugely beneficial to local rural economies.  The contribution made by farmers cannot be overestimated.  Farming and agriculture are the life blood of rural Ireland.  The Minister stated one will not see many millionaires farming and that is true.  When one considers the number of man hours and work time that goes into the industry one can see how labour intensive it is.  One starts at the crack of dawn and, at this time of the year in particular, one can be up at all hours of the night, with cows calving and so on.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about the growing relationship Irish agriculture has with the emerging economies and the opportunities that exist, for example, between this country and a place such as China.  Last year, after the visit of the Chinese Minister, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Chinese market is one of huge importance, being the world&rsquo;s largest food importer and the fifth largest exporter of agricultural produce.  With a population of 1.3 billion and rising, and with increasing organisation and affluence, China offers the Irish agri-food and fishery sector enormous potential in the future.  China is already a significant destination for exports of Irish agri-food and seafood produce and last year Ireland exported over &euro;170 million in food, seafood, beverages, forestry products and wool to China, as well as a further &euro;95 million worth to Hong Kong.  China can play a key role in fulfilling the ambitions of Food Harvest 2020 strategy in terms of increasing export value in the agri-food sector.</P>
      <Col N="951" />
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Minister also referred to combining the strengths of the Chinese agricultural market with the technological expertise of the Irish farming community in order that both countries would benefit.  He specified animal husbandry, food safety and fisheries as areas in which we could do business.  I would like to ask a few questions about this because a return trip is planned for later this year.  What is the Government doing to encourage Chinese investment in the food industry, given its potential?  Are Chinese food companies seeking a foothold in the European markets by setting up in Ireland and using it as a base?  Are they looking to expand their expertise?  If so, what opportunities are available to offer education and training to Chinese farmers and food producers?</P>
      <P Just="Left">With regard to CAP reform, the Minister said the proposals suggest that the individual historic reference to the single farm payment scheme will be replaced by a regional model rather than using national averages.  He also said that there is not a great deal of support among member states for the retention of the single farm payment model used in this state.  He is seeking as much flexibility as possible for member states to determine payment models based on the individual needs and conditions of the farming system.  Perhaps the Minister will provide use with a progress report on the proposal for us.  I thank him again for his time.</P>

      <P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I would like to raise a number of issues in this debate, which I welcome.  I echo Senator Comiskey&rsquo;s thoughts on the flat rate payment, as it could be positive for small rural farmers.  There are two types of farming.  Farmers engaged in industrial type production are doing reasonably well and driving export-led growth, which is welcome, but many small rural farmers are living below the bread line, earning less than the average industrial wage.  They also need to be supported by the Government&rsquo;s policies.  Some of the Commission's policies favour this group and I hope the Minister does not sway too far in favour of large industrial farming units.  We need to help rural communities to remain vibrant.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s reference to hobby farmers.  We have a different perspective on that in the west in that farmers have a number of income streams.  Some depend on a combination of farming, fishing and other work in the locality and we do not call them hobby farmers.  We should not lose sight of the fact that this is the integral part of the fabric of the society&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh">
      <NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that definition.</P>
      <P>I refer to the issue of branding.  While exports have increased, much of the prime beef is used for burgers in McDonalds restaurants throughout Europe.  Surely there is a great deal of scope to enhance the value of these products.  Where does the Minister stand on the branding issue and increasing the value of grass-fed beef?  I refer to the pathways for growth project mentioned by Bord Bia.  I agree with the call for including food production under the Leader programme.  The failure to include it has held many good projects back and if that could be alleviated, it would be positive.</P>
      <P>When Commissioner Ciolos was in the House recently, he referred to opening up the sugar beet market.  When does the Minister intend to do that to enable the production of sugar beet again?</P>
      <P>Where does he stand on the GM foods issue?  Are applications for trials on hand?  If so, is he in favour of approving them?</P>
      <Col N="952" />
      <P>What is the future of Teagasc from a funding perspective?  Will the Department continue to fund the agency?</P>
      
      <P>Another issue having an impact on small farmers is the necessity for a licence to pull a trailer with a car.  Many older farmers did not have a licence to do that and because the regulations were amended recently, this is causing problems in rural Ireland.  Those who do not have the correct licences are being asked to re-sit tests and so on.  Will he examine this issue in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government?</P>
      <P Just="Left">I get the sense that the Minister is pushing for the agriculture budget to be retained on an EU-wide basis.  I picked up from Commissioner Ciolos that he will have a battle on his hands at governmental level to maintain his budget.  He also mentioned the paperwork people who apply for funding sift through but he indicated that, much of the time, the Commission is not on its own seeking information as members states add a list of questions regarding information they are seeking.  Is the Government a culprit in this regard or is this practice confined to other member states?  If the information has to be sought in one member state, I expect it has to be sought in every other.  Has the Minister added to the paperwork?</P>

      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on protecting the agricultural community in the budget.  When quotas, especially milk quotas, are abolished in 2015, milk could become the driving force in the agriculture industry and with more farmers going into milk production, we may experience a major drop in the beef herd, suckler herd and sheep flock.  Will he put measures in place to ensure meat production is maintained?</P>
      <P>The health committee debated below cost selling of alcohol, particularly in supermarkets, earlier this week.  However, it costs approximately &euro;158 per tonne to grow potatoes whereas the price in shops equates to &euro;130 per tonne because the three major retailers control 80% of the market.  Some farmers are accepting &euro;70 a tonne in order that they will not have to store potatoes.  This is not sustainable.  Will the Minister put measures in place to protect potato growers?</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senators Comiskey and &Oacute; Clochartaigh regarding the flat rate payment.  I agree with the Minister that if we are to push on with production under Food Harvest 2020, it has to be done on productive land and a flat rate payment would not suit.  I wish him all the best in the CAP negotiations over the next year and I am sure he will do a good job.  He knows his brief and he will make sure to defend the agriculture industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister.  The area applied for permission for afforestation in 2011 was 38% lower than in 2010.  Is he aware that the change made by departmental officials directly contributed to the decline and, as a result, vast areas of productive land were excluded?  The grant and premium rates were also cut and severe restrictions were put on the area of land allowable.  Other issues are also under the control of the Department, such as acid sensitive areas, hen harrier designation and farmer status.  What does the Minister believe has caused the decline and what steps does he intend to take to remedy it?  If afforestation has decreased by 38% in one year, something must be seriously wrong.  There are people who want to plant land in areas of counties Cork and Kerry, for example, but we are down 38% because the unenclosed land has been cut out for grants and rates.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for giving us his time.  He referred to exports and companies such as Kerry Group and Glanbia.  I ask him to put more emphasis on indigenous artisan food companies which cannot access credit.  Grant aid for such companies is very limited and anything that is made available comes with the caveat that 50% of the funding must be provided by the companies concerned even though they are unable to get the necessary funding from banks.  They are unable to complete the cycle for this reason.</P>
      <P>The issue of calf imports has been raised with me by a couple of people who fear an outbreak of blue tongue.  It would be helpful if the Minister could dismiss such fears.</P>
      <P>Young farmers have to be protected within CAP.  The hobby farmers mentioned by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, or slippers farmers as I believe they are also known, are the individuals who sit inside looking out at their land while doing nothing to it.  Productive farmers will have to be protected, however.  Clarity and security are needed in respect of the reference year of 2014 because farmers will not invest if they do not have confidence in their future.  As the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Ciolos, was a rural development officer in his former life, Pillar II will be very important to him.  The Minister will have a tough fight on his hands but I have every confidence in him.</P>
      <P>The only question on forestry concerns unenclosed land.  The issue of acid sensitive areas has been addressed in Sweden and it can be managed here with further science.  I commend the Minister on the issue of forestry.  His ministerial colleagues want to know how he managed to juggle the figures for the budget because he did an excellent job.</P>

      <P>Senators may be surprised to find I am interested in farming but my grandfather was a farmer and my maternal ancestors had land in County Laois for many centuries.  I compliment the Minister on the work he has been doing and I am glad the Government has negotiated some improvement in fisheries.  Like other Senators, I received a document from the IFA which showed that farm incomes have increased.  I welcome this increase, which farmers have needed badly for a long time.</P>
      <P>My question pertains to free range pig farming.  A couple based in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency run a very good business supplying free range pork.  However, a difficulty has arisen in regard to labelling.  Can anything be done about this issue?  I understand that a business can register the description &ldquo;free range pork&rdquo; as a trading name and its products can be sold in supermarkets as free range pork simply because it is produced by a company with that phrase as its registered business name.  Is it possible to introduce regulations to define what can be described as free range?  The best definition is that given by the aforementioned husband and wife team, whose name I cannot recall.  They allow their animals to range freely out in the open, with access to food and shelter as necessary, and the quality of their meat is significantly different as a result.  If something can be done about the issue through regulation, it would be welcomed by this valuable niche industry.</P>

In the context of the Government&rsquo;s plans to introduce a Bill providing for a quota for women standing for election, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to a misogynist organisation called the ICMSA.  Its council <Col N="954" />comprises 93 members but there is only one women on it.  In contrast, the IFA has implemented an equality agenda under which at least 25% of voting delegates at county level are women and it goes out of its way to ensure women are included as voting delegates.  As wives and partners, women are the backbone of a dairy industry that produces exports worth &euro;2.6 billion.  Why was an unjust act committed against Eileen Callanan, a dairy farmer in west Cork?</P>

      <P Just="Left">As someone originally involved in a small food business and now in a large food exporter, we must pressure the dairy industry to diversify away from the UK.  It is not good enough that 41% of food and dairy exports go to the UK.  The industry will have to look to China, India, Russia and South America.  The Minister has to drive that diversification.  I commended the T&aacute;naiste on the reception he held as part of his efforts to reach a trade agreement between Ireland and Russia.  However, while it is lovely to go to receptions and trade fairs for canapes and glasses of wine, it takes a strong stomach and shoe leather to increase sales.  Increased sales will create more jobs.  I want to see the food and export industry get out of that sheltered area of Britain.  I am not saying we are not appreciative of the British market, but we have to reach the hundreds of millions of people who are living out there in India and South America.  I am relying on the Minister to get democracy into the misogynist ICMSA.  I will watch this very carefully.  It is my duty here to promote the role of women in society.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to indicate whether he is reopening the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  He indicated last week at the IFA AGM that he would consider opening it on a limited basis.  That would be welcome in Donegal and on the west coast, provided that commonage land and natural heritage areas are eligible, along with special areas of conservation; that mountain-type land that would not be included is also eligible for payment; that the restriction on feeding concentrates to sheep during lambing season on species-rich grassland is removed; and that the commonage and SAC payment is increased from &euro;75 to &euro;150, as I mentioned the last time we had questions and answers here.

      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">As I am anxious to answer as many of the questions as I can, I will try to be quick.  If there are some detailed questions I cannot answer, I will correspond bye-mail with the Senators.</P>
      <P>First, I want to clarify a number of things about the new eligibility criteria for disadvantaged area payments.  It is important that people know what we are talking about here, because there seems to be a misunderstanding.  We acted as we did because we worked with farming organisations, farmers and all sorts of stakeholders to try to come up with a way of saving money under the disadvantaged area payment scheme, because we had to find money somewhere.  We have managed to reduce the cost of running my Department and its agencies by &euro;18 million in one year, but it was not enough.  We had to find money from somewhere else, and there were only two schemes we could consider making savings from.  One was REPS, which was a very successful but quite generous scheme, and we have made savings there.  Farmers are not happy about it but they understand why we have targeted that area.  The other was the disadvantaged area payment scheme.  Targeting AEOS, which already involves low payments, would have been impossible.</P>
      <P>I said to farmers that I would do everything I could to ensure I did not touch the rate of their payment or the amount of land on which they could apply for a payment, which is currently 34 hectares.  In other words, active, practical farmers who are farming to a reasonable stocking rate and are keeping their stock for a reasonable amount of time in the year would not see any reduction at all in their payments.  That is what we were trying to do.  There are certain people who have very low stocking rates and are keeping their stock for the bare minimum time, <Col N="956" />which was three months of the year, who really are not farming at all; they are putting stock on land in order to draw down payments.  We wanted to ensure that the limited money we do have was given to farmers who are actively farming and making an income from farming.  In an effort to do that, we decided to change the eligibility.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The stocking rate required to qualify for a disadvantaged area payment was incredibly low, at around one sheep per hectare.  We have doubled that now and asked farmers to have two sheep per hectare, which is less than one sheep per acre.  This is still a very low stocking rate.  We also said that instead of having to keep their stock for three months of the year, farmers would have to keep their stock for six months of the year.  In other words, farmers would have to be farming.  We could not have a situation in which people were swapping stock in order to qualify, with stock spending three months here, three months there in order that two farmers could qualify, and so on.  What we are saying is that as we have a limited amount of money to spend, let us give it to the people who are actively farming and who need that income the most.  That is what we have done.</P>
      <P>Certain categories of people who may be vulnerable as a result of those changes, including people who are required to have a low stocking rate because they are in a commonage framework which does not allow high stocking rates, will be exempt from the changes.  They still qualify, there is no change for them.  Let us be clear on that.  People who are farming in commonage areas, particularly in the west and north west, and who have had low stocking rates enforced on them by the National Parks and Wildlife Service or my Department in an effort to protect the environment, will continue to get disadvantaged area payments, uninterrupted, regardless of how low their stocking rates are.</P>
      <P Just="Left">For people who have genuine reasons for having a low stocking rate in 2011 &mdash; if, for example, there was a death in the family or a disease in the herd, or a young farmer was taking over and had stock for only four months of the year rather than six months &mdash; we will establish an appeals mechanism which will make relatively quick decisions, although obviously all cases must be examined.  I have given an assurance to farmers &mdash; I mean it &mdash; that we will take a progressive approach towards that appeals mechanism to try to support people who are genuine farmers.  However, we cannot have a situation in which people see a change in the rules and buy in an extra sheep to try to qualify all of a sudden.  As we have to make some savings, we cannot allow people to simply change the way in which they manage their stock in order to continue receiving payments.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have agreed with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, that our two Departments will examine the commonage framework programmes.  In many mountainous areas, we are actually undergrazing land, which is doing as much damage as overgrazing.  If a hillside is undergrazed, elements of growth on that hillside will make it unfarmable in the future, and ultimately, mountainous areas that would previously have been managed through grazing by hill stock will be taken over by aggressive weeds.  As undergrazing does as much damage, potentially, as overgrazing, we need to reassess some areas and increase stocking rates to improve management of that land.</P>
      <P>This represents a commercial opportunity for farmers.  An exodus from hill farming is the last thing I want to see.  I am not going to punish those people either in terms of single farm payment allocation under the CAP or in terms of disadvantaged area payments or other mechanisms under pillar 2, which pertains to rural development.</P>
      <P>There is a distinction between pillar 1 and pillar 2 in terms of direct payments and rural support mechanisms in the CAP.  Single farm payments are primarily intended to support sustainable, safe, environmentally friendly and efficient food production.  The scheme recognises <Col N="957" />the fact that European farmers must operate within restrictions that do not apply to farmers in other parts of the world, and as taxpayers who demand those standards from our food producers, we need to pay for that.  That is the primary basis for direct payments.  This is not unusual in other parts of the developed world.  Every country in the developed world, with the exception of New Zealand and possibly Australia, has mechanisms to support primary food production, and Europe is no different.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The primary focus of direct payments is on supporting food production in areas of high and low productivity.  We are to see a redistribution of single farm payments.  The question is the level of redistribution.  What I am saying to farmers is that the current proposals wouldmean the most productive farmers would lose an average of 60% of their payment, while farmers in less productive areas would gain an average of approximately 85% in their payments.  This level of switching resources will significantly damage the productivity of Irishfarming in terms of the capacity of the productive sector to invest and expand as we would like it to do.</P>
      <P>We need to change but the idea that the <i>status quo</i> remains intact, whereby the most productive farmers continue to receive the extremely high payments some of them do versus less productive areas, is not acceptable either.  The idea that in 2019 single farm payments would be based on productivity in 2002 and 2003, on which the current single farm payment is based, is also a nonsense.  Some redistribution of these funds is necessary and we are trying to put in place a mechanism which will allow for this without a massive resource shift from the productive sector to the less productive sector.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We have submitted proposals to the Commission, and the Commission has made a proposal based on a redistribution of direct payments between member states because historically some countries have done much better than others.  Many countries joined the European Union halfway through the last CAP process and do not have the same level of direct payments as countries such as France, Germany and Ireland.  The Government worked hard with the Commission to put in place a formula to calculate who is doing well and who is not doing well and how EU moneys might be redistributed between member states to ensure everyone gets a slightly fairer deal.</P>
      <P>The formula divided the national envelope of direct payments received by countries by the eligible hectarage in those countries and calculated the average payment received by countries.  Everybody over the average is doing better and everybody under the average is not doing so well.  The formula the Commission has on the table in its proposals is for approximation, which is to move everybody towards the average but not equality.  It would mean everybody under 90% of the average payment would be moved towards 90% of the average figure by one third and this would be paid for by everybody over the average.  This is not about bringing everybody to the same payment because the cost of farming in some countries in the European Union is not as expensive as in others with regard to the cost of labour, inputs and machinery because of how those economies have developed historically.  However, we are moving everybody slowly in the direction of the average.</P>
      <P Just="Left">If we used the same philosophy with regard to the distribution of the single farm payment in Ireland it would mean a redistribution but instead of the productive sector on average losing 40%, 50% or 60% it might lose 10% or 15% and instead of the less productive sector gaining 70%, 80% or 90% on payments it may gain 20%, 30% or 35%.  This is the type of compromise towards which we are trying to work and it can be sold to both sides of the equation, including those farming in less favoured or disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The alternative, which is what the Commission would like us to do, is that we use flexibility to break up the country into various regions which would receive differing flat rate payments. <Col N="958" /> Will Senators imagine the political challenge of trying to break up Ireland into 20 or 30 regions with each region receiving a different direct payment based on geography?  It would be impossible and would cause civil war throughout Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator.  I hope I have clarified the issues on disadvantaged area payments, commonage and new eligibility.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators have asked about the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  To be absolutely clear I would love to be able to introduce a new REPS that would be generous and encourage environmental and sustainable farming but I cannot afford to do so.  We do not have the money to do it.  When one must make choices with the money one has one must choose the key areas to which one allocates one&rsquo;s resources to obtain the maximum dividend from an environmental point of view or from the point of view of whatever other target one sets.  I do not have the money to put in place a full AEOS for all farmers leaving REPS at present.  If I find the resources to do so in the meantime I will happily re-examine it but what we are trying to do is introduce a limited AEOS.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This year may well be about drawing down payments next year, but limited to the areas which need priority treatment which are special areas of conservation, SACs.  Someone farming in an area with a series of limitations because it is a special area of conservation, which include determining the amount of fertiliser one can use and one&rsquo;s stocking rates, must be compensated for this.  We are trying to put in place a limited AEOS, which will not be as generous as the previous REPS but at least will be an acknowledgement that those farming in special areas of conservation must have some preferential treatment in terms of support schemes put in place.  This is why in AEOS 2, which I put together last year, those in SACs automatically qualify.  Those outside SACs will qualify if they are under the ceiling in terms of the number of applicants.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am not in a position to promise any more than this but the Department will try to follow through on my commitment to put together an AEOS for SACs.  It may not be sanctioned by <Col N="959" />the Department of Finance because it does not like new schemes because they cost money and will continue do so; it is not about only one year.  We will try to put it together and I am reasonably confident we will be able to do so.  However, we must find savings elsewhere to finance it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Another question I wish to answer, because I do not want to return to the matter of the disadvantaged area payments scheme, is on the 80 km rule and farmers in disadvantaged areas trying to expand their productivity by leasing land outside of the disadvantaged area.  If one&rsquo;s primary farm is in a disadvantaged area, leasing land in a non-disadvantaged area will not impact on one&rsquo;s payment.  I clarified this recently at the AGM of the IFA.  If one&rsquo;s primary farm is in a non-disadvantaged area and one leases land in a disadvantaged area to obtain payments, one will receive a percentage payment based on the percentage of the overall land holding which is in the disadvantaged area.  Someone outside the disadvantaged area taking land for perfectly valid reasons in a disadvantaged area is not in the same category in terms of being a disadvantaged farmer as someone whose entire holding is in a disadvantaged area.  This is why these changes have been made and they were worked out while listening to the concerns of farmers.</P>
      <P>I take Senator White&rsquo;s point on male dominance in some organisations.  To be perfectly honest I cannot answer on behalf of the ICMSA.  I am not familiar with the case and it would be dangerous for me to start making comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator White on the role of women in farming.  I made a point of speaking at the women in farming conference organised by the IFA last year.  To be perfectly honest it was a fantastic conference and a very good experience and I got much good feedback from it.  All of the research on women&rsquo;s involvement in the running of a farm business shows if two business partners &mdash; a man and a woman &mdash; run a farm, the productivity and profitability of the farm is significantly higher than if there is not.</P>
      <P>The role of Irish women in agriculture is often underestimated and understated.  If the Senator has a specific case that she wishes to raise with me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unfairly, I have got a bit of stick about the advisory group on horse racing.  No one on that committee is paid anything, be it expenses for mileage or so on.  Its members are entirely voluntary and we meet every second month or so.  I put the advisory group in place because horse racing was one of the areas in my portfolio about which I was not comfortable I had detailed knowledge.  I am comfortable in most of the other areas and am becoming more knowledgeable on horse racing, but I felt the need to put in place a group of people I trusted who understood and were stakeholders in the industry.  I take advice from them and they supply it when I ask for it.  That is all they do.  It is a good group and I thank the key people for being on it.  They are great and are committed to their sector.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I probably know a great deal more about sports horses.  I often clean out stables on a Sunday afternoon when my wife is out on her horse or my daughter is out on her pony.  The sports horse industry is very valuable and is worth approximately &euro;700 million to the economy each year.  Unlike racing, and unfortunately from my perspective, my Department does not have primary responsibility for it.  Rather, sports horses are covered by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It would be helpful if the responsibility for sports horses was in the same Department as the responsibility for race horses, but this matter must be worked out within government.</P>

My counterpart has visited Ireland and we signed a memorandum of understanding on new trade and investment opportunities, which are progressing.  Our relationship with China is very much about that, namely, relationships, and personalities trusting one another.  It is a different type of economy and political structure on which to make an impact than, for example, the US.  Great efforts are under way in this regard.  The Deputy Premier of China, an influential and powerful politician, will visit Ireland from 18-20 February.  Ireland is the only European country that he will visit.  He will travel from the US to Ireland to Turkey before returning home.  It will be a significant visit.  He is likely to be the next Premier of China, arguably the most powerful politician in the world.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I am familiar with the sugar beet industry.  My family farm used to produce sugar and I used to deliver much of it to what was then the Mallow factory.  There may be a future for sugar production in Ireland.  Due to a demand and supply problem, the price of sugar rocketed last <Col N="961" />year.  A rough rule of thumb is that, as long as processed sugar stays above &euro;500 per tonne in global pricing, producing it in Ireland is viable in terms of farmers getting the returns they need.  When it falls below that level, making a commercial case becomes more difficult.  The current price is more than &euro;600 per tonne.  It was between &euro;700 and &euro;800 for most of last year.  I hope that once we pass beyond the current system of sugar quotas, which is due to end in 2015, opportunities will open up for Ireland.</P>

I have maintained the suckler cow welfare scheme despite the pressure applied by many people to get rid of it.  I do not want to allow the beef sector to become a by-product of the dairy sector, which will be a danger as excitement around the dairy industry grows in the lead up to 2015 when milk quotas will vanish.  Milk prices will remain strong in the meantime.  Half of Irish beef comes from the suckler herd and half from the dairy herd, but nearly all of the top quality beef comes from the suckler herd, in which case we need to try to keep suckler farming intact.  We have a major job to do in upskilling suckler farmers so that they can make more money from the marketplace and be less reliant on schemes.  For this reason, I have set aside &euro;5 million to put in place a beef discussion group model, whereby we will bring suckler beef farmers into a room and discuss with them how they can upskill and get more out of their businesses.

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the sensitive and compassionate way the Minister dealt with the tragedy off Glandore.  He showed an interest in the situation.  I was present a few evenings as well.  I hope the other two bodies will be found in order that some closure can be brought to the matter for the community.  I acknowledge the tremendous voluntary efforts of the community.</P>
      <P>I will ask a number of questions, as I do not want to make a long statement on fisheries.  The Minister might indicate whether he or his Department intends to revisit the 2006 fisheries Act with a view towards introducing administrative sanctions.  The issue was a millstone around my neck while I was a Deputy.  In the last D&aacute;il, some Fine Gael Deputies gave a commitment to revisit the Act and to replace the criminal sanctions with administrative sanctions, if possible.  Will the Minister assure me that, where administrative sanctions are concerned, the cure will not be worse than the disease?  Some of them might not be exactly what the fishermen want.  The Minister need not answer today, but the matter has been on my mind.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Noel Dempsey, revoked the wild salmon fishing licences by statutory instrument.  Some fishermen were compensated.  In some quarters, commitments were also given &mdash; I do not know how sincere they were &mdash; to the effect that, after five or six years, the situation would be revisited.  It is good news to see that salmon stocks have greatly recovered.  Is there some way to grant wild salmon licences in a regulated fashion?  If the science is against it, I will understand, but the commitment was that everything would be rosy in the garden were there a change of government.</P>
      <P>In the House, I wished the Minister well in his pre-Christmas negotiations on total allowable catches and so forth.  I have said this privately as well.  I congratulate the Minister on his achievements as it is an ongoing see-saw battle each year for whatever Minister is in office.  Historically, we all wear the green jersey when we go to Europe, including Members from the Opposition in the previous D&aacute;il and Seanad, and even the fishing organisations praised the Minister for his efforts.</P>
      <P>One of the great success stories has been the recovery of herring in the Celtic Sea.  Five or six years ago there was little interest from many boat owners because of a depletion in herring stocks and there was not much money to be made.  We must credit organisations and fishermen for allowing the recovery, which was industry-driven, as the Minister would acknowledge.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about a number of areas.  The Celtic Sea herring issue might be like the miracle of the loaves and fishes, so will the Minister give priority to the boats with a track regard in the area, especially in 2008, 2009 and 2010?  In so far as is possible, will the Minister provide regulations in order that the boats fishing the Celtic Sea herring land those fish in the Republic of Ireland?  The Minister will be aware that a few years ago we had 16 processing plants but we now have four: two in west Cork, one in Dingle and one in Rossaveal.  What is important is continued supply when we talk about jobs through fishing.  I know from an interest in fishing that some vessels land frequently in places like Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveal or Baltimore, and there is a continuity of supply.  For the 12 or 14 weeks involved, there is also a continuity of employment, which is very important.  I would like the Minister to be mindful of that when he comes to his decision.  It is critical to support the jobs on the shore.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Will the Minister ensure that some of the larger oceangoing vessels in the fishing fleets are not allowed to come in to rape the Celtic Sea?  I should be careful using that word.  It took several years to build up stocks and there is no guarantee that in three or four years there will not be a return to the 4,000 or 5,000 tonne limit.  We should carefully monitor Celtic Sea herring and ensure that those who stuck with that stock and depended on it for many years are not excluded to the benefit of the super-trawlers.  I know the Minister has a difficult job trying to keep everyone happy but he should be mindful of the reference years, like those in farming. <Col N="963" /> The reference years for the Celtic Sea should be 2008 to 2010, and the boys fishing out of Dunmore East and Wexford should see fair play.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have a particular interest in the mariculture and aquaculture industry, and the Leader has said there may be a debate on this before Easter.  I have criticised previous Ministers on my own side in the past ten or 15 years &mdash; I have been in these Houses for many years &mdash; because a proposal was put forward in the early 1990s for mariculture and aquaculture to reach certain targets.  That would have created many jobs onshore and produced value-added products such as mussels, farmed salmon or oysters.  Unfortunately, for different reasons we seem to be standing still, having peaked in the mid-1990s.  I am not sure what can be done but the Minister might offer a brief comment &mdash; not necessarily today &mdash; on the area and how jobs can becreated.</P>
      <P Just="Left">One of the big challenges facing the Government is the creation of jobs and there is a potential along our shore.  Nevertheless, there is a notion of waiting six or seven years for an aquaculture licence.  It is something the Minister has inherited and I blame previous Governments.  This issue should be dealt with more efficiently and we could create 200 or 300 jobs in west Cork, Kerry, the west in general, Waterford or Wexford.  There is potential but something is clogging the process and we are not moving forward.  We have not reaped the rewards in the way places like Scotland, France, Norway, Chile and others have.  We seem to be standing still rather than making progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I am learning the brief on the marine and over Christmas I learned quite a bit.  There was very good news before Christmas when the Minister announced the large increase in quota.  That has brought its own problem, which the previous speaker mentioned.  I had a meeting with some of the people who work the Celtic Sea and the west coast over Christmas and they indicated they had managed fish stocks in the Celtic Sea over the previous years, and with the increased quotas, large boats are now coming from outside the area, taking huge catches.  That is affecting fishermen&rsquo;s livelihood.  I was told it could be possible to increase the number of jobs in the factories along the west coast and in the south if the boats with a tradition of fishing in those areas could be given the quota in preference to the larger vessels.  Perhaps that could be considered, and I believe a paper has been sent to the Minister from those people, and I have done likewise.  It is the same as a farmer on a commonage or hill area with a quota but somebody being able to take it from that farmer.  It is a significant issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is much potential for salmon farming off the west coast, as the Minister has mentioned before.  It could create a significant industry.  Many of the boats which fished the herring and mackerel took the catch to Norway and France for processing, which took jobs away from this country.  It is important to create those jobs here, as we need them badly; therefore, we should focus on the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh">
      <NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and concur with many of the points made by the previous Senators.  Some of them were made at the presentation yesterday by Iascair&iacute; Int&iacute;re &Eacute;ireann and the seafood producer groups.  I hope the Minister will not follow in the footsteps of previous Administrations, because we have seen a very lopsided approach to the distribution of quota in this country over recent years.  It is difficult to see what benefit has accrued from this to the country because a small number of huge ships have taken much of the mackerel quota, decimating the smaller fishing industry along our coast in the process.  Even a slight adjustment would do, as Senator Comiskey mentioned, which would create a livelihood for many people on smaller boats along the west coast, who will land in the Republic of Ireland and keep fish producers and factories working.  There is much evidence pointing to that.</P>
      <Col N="964" />
      <P Just="Left">I echo the calls with regard to the Celtic Sea, and the Minister might consider changing the proposals per boat of a 5% catch in recent years to something like 35% of quota in the past two or three productive years.  That benchmark should be used for active fishing boats in those areas in order that the people really fishing the Celtic Sea would get the benefit.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Is it possible to consider a derogation for the inland fishermen who have boats smaller than 50 m long, as suggested by the TASTE Council?  It could be like an artisan fishing fleet in order that the smaller boats can fish all species within a number of miles of the shore.  That would rejuvenate rural communities throughout the country and bring in jobs that we need.  We must consider the overfishing of lobster, which was also highlighted.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I congratulate the Minister on granting licences for mussel farming in Killary Harbour.  The policing of the licensing regime has been raised, as well as administrative sanctions in the Fisheries Acts.  It is essential that the issue is revisited in order not to criminalise fishermen around our shores.

      <P>I understand.  I am setting the context for the question.  Food exports seem to be relatively small in comparison to computer services and chemicals.  I know about Food Harvest 2020 but it seems there is very real potential here.</P>
      <P>I noticed in the media in the past few days that Bord Bia will launch a &euro;350 million marketing campaign to open up new markets for Irish food produce.  Perhaps the Minister willclarify&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context, does the Minister believe there is a need for some sort of focused group which will look at how we can develop value added fish products?  As Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan said, this seems to have been lying there for several years.  Although the intention seems to be good, the execution of it is certainly questionable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ImeldaHenry">
      <NameTxt>Senator Imelda Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  My question is on salmon fishing on Lough Gill and I will give a little bit of background information.  Tourism is of particular importance <Col N="965" />in the Sligo area and, as we all know, the county has outstanding natural beauty and is very suited to the promotion of a wide range of outdoor pursuits to attract tourists.  One such activity is angling.  The county has two major salmon rivers, the Ballisodare River and the Lough Gill and River Bonet system.  These have the potential to attract a considerable number of overseas and Northern Ireland anglers and it would certainly benefit tourism generally.</P>
      
      <P>What can be achieved in this area of salmon fishing is clearly seen in the Moy catchment area of County Mayo where angling is regarded as probably one of the main tourist attractions.  Unfortunately, salmon fishing on the Lough Gill and Bonet River system, which enters the sea in Sligo town through the Garavogue River, is now seriously restricted in order to facilitate the recovery of stocks.</P>
      <P>This reduction in salmon stocks is a reasonably recent occurrence in terms of the long history of salmon fishing in Sligo.  A report from the mid-18th century referred to Sligo salmon being caught in nets in the bay as reckoned to be the best in Ireland.  This activity of fishing, by way of nets, was continued well into the middle of the 20th century where the fishery was owned by the Wood-Martin family and operated as a commercial venture with up to six men employed full-time during the salmon season operating the boats which stretched the nets across the mouth of the estuary of the Garavogue River right into the heart of Sligo town.</P>
      <P>Now, according to local angling interests, only 15 gill tags are available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ImeldaHenry">
      <NameTxt>Senator Imelda Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This has resulted in great annoyance and, indeed, dispute among long-term anglers, almost three quarters of whom will not be entitled to take a single fish in the current year.  All of this has caused ill-feeling and failure to reach agreement as to how the available 15 gill tags will be distributed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ImeldaHenry">
      <NameTxt>Senator Imelda Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a good example of what can be achieved by a serious scientific study of a salmon river system, which was implemented on the Ballisodare River.  A similar study of the Lough Gill and Bonet River system would be of immense encouragement to local anglers and would indicate the urgency with which the angling and tourism potential of this important salmon river is being tackled at national and regional levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an overview of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy and the discussions taking place at EU level in that regard?  The inshore fleet, in particular vessels under 15 m, are finding it difficult in many inshore bays due to outdated by-laws.  For example, trawlers coming into Inver Bay in County Donegal are tearing up the habitat of local species and are causing damage to fish farms.  The implementation of a by-law dating back to 1875 would impose a fine of two shillings and six pence on those trawler owners.  Those by-laws are outdated and I have spoken to Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which indicated that the by-laws need to be updated.  Will the Minister consider updating these by-laws to give protection to local inshore fishermen?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider increasing the quota, in particular in regard to herring and mackerel, for small inshore, regulated and licensed boats on a seasonal basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames">
      <NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">We are delighted with the work the Minister is doing.  He is really thorough and his interest is very obvious.  My first question relates to his big project, the organic salmon project off Inis Oirr.  I received a proposal which I sent to the Minister from some small fishermen keen to invest in it.  I know Bord Iscaigh Mhara is going all over the world <Col N="966" />to try to get investors but would the Minister allow Irish fishermen or coastal communities to invest in it?  It is a great sign of confidence.  There is an issue of fish lice there and the concerns of those on Inis Oirr who will see this project from their island, yet they will not be able to benefit from it because of their issues with the pier and the breakwater.</P>
      <P>My second question relates to the oyster fishery in Clarinbridge which, as the Minister knows, is world famous.  It is doing great and has considerable exports but it is not getting enough dredging licences because of a new birds and natural habitats regulation.  If the fishermen cannot dredge the bay, they will not renew it and the oysters will not grow properly.  They are happy to engage in any fishery management plan but I agree with them that it was a bit unfair that the day they were refused the licences was the day they were asked for the fishery management plan.  They have no difficulty with consultation.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister&rsquo;s China memorandum on trade and investment extend more broadly than food &mdash; agriculture and fisheries &mdash; because I am involved in a China-Ireland initiative and we believe that what is needed is bilateral investment between Ireland and China &mdash; government to government because, as the Minister said, it is a hierarchical society &mdash; and to attract foreign direct investment into Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a similar theme, which was also raised by Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, there are tremendous opportunities to create jobs, specifically in the areas of aquaculture and fish farming.  Obviously, there are difficulties with licensing, as there have been in the past.  What plan is in place to expedite licences and to eliminate the bureaucracy which has been evident on previous occasions?  The Minister mentioned supply not being able to meet demand in China and other areas where fish, including salmon, is concerned.  Is there a plan in place to develop this area, which needs to be developed and which can create jobs into the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief comment on something Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan raised at the start, namely, the tragedy in Union Hall.  I have spent two afternoons there but I would have liked to have spent more time there because at times like this, I have a responsibility to try to support communities linked to areas of my responsibility.</P>
      <P>If ever one needed an example of the strength of a community, the tightness of an industry, the professionalism of the rescue services and the extraordinary generosity of volunteers, one will see it Union Hall.  People have opened their homes and handed over the keys to total strangers, in order to provide them with comfort and shelter.  Muslims are praying with a Catholic priest.  It is extraordinary to experience the community in Union Hall since this tragedy happened a little over ten days ago.  I thank everybody, in particular the Deasy family, who are deeply involved in the fishing community, and those from the south east, friends, family and relations of the owner and skipper of the boat and his wife, Caitlin N&iacute; Aodha, whom I know well.  The failure to recover the body of loved ones adds to the tragedy.</P>
      <P>We appreciate the fantastic efforts of everybody involved in the search.  I have spoken to the Garda and Naval Service divers.  BIM is now supporting volunteer dive teams from west Cork.  They are working in really difficult circumstances.  Much of the search was conducted with less than 2 ft. of visibility under the water.  Divers were thrown around by the currents and waves and were being dashed up against the hull of what is now a wreck.  The leadership of the Coast Guard in co-ordinating the search and rescue and the contribution of bodies such as Civil Defence, the RNLI, volunteers and BIM, the Naval Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is extraordinary during this emotionally difficult time.  Our efforts are to try to support the families.  The <Col N="967" />extraordinary community in Union Hall could not have done more and I have nothing but good to say about them.</P>
      <P>This tragedy is an unfortunate way to start the year and is a reminder of the dangers of fishing.  In the broader industry, however, there are opportunities.  One of the positives is that Ireland negotiated a good deal in December because we based our arguments on science and took political opportunities as they came.  We have got significant increases in the white fish quota and the pelagic quota.  It is a done deal and I do not want to crow about it.  It is a really positive sign for the industry.  For the first time the Irish fleet will be allowed to catch in quota over &euro;250 million worth of fish.  We acknowledge we have problems in how we allocate that quota in terms of Celtic Sea herring and other fish stocks that are up significantly, such as cod, haddock, whiting.  We must make difficult decisions on the herring and boarfish catch.  Boarfish is a new species, that only had a quota for the first time last year and has seen a dramatic increase this year from just over 30,000 tones to 82,000 tones.  This new species presents us with an interesting and exciting opportunity.</P>
      <P>To those who talk down the fishing industry, referring to the end of fishing communities in an industry without a future, let me tell them that fishing has a strong future in Ireland.  We are exploring the potential of new stock, increasing and managing quota, better than we have ever done in the past.  We have a marine institute, funded by &euro;6 million each year, to assess and manage stock.  It ensures we are making the right arguments to the Commission, and the correct decisions in terms of managing those stocks.  There are good things happening in the industry.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We were rightly questioned about the fishing industry.  We are looking at ways in which we can add value to the product.  Traditionally, fish have been caught and exported more or less intact as a commodity.  We are now looking at ways in which we can add value, get more fish, grade it, process and package it and redesign it for the Irish consumer.  Last year we spent &euro;2.5 million through BIM to leverage &euro;10 million of expenditure in the fish processing sector and we created many jobs in doing that.  We will continue that into this year.  We are looking at ways in which we can get non-Irish boats to land in Irish ports, in order that we grade and process their fish for them, because that is where the jobs are.  Approximately 1 million tonnes of fish are caught in Irish waters each year and less than 240,000 tonnes of those fish are landed in Irish ports.  That is not good enough.  At a time of increasing fuel prices, it makes more economic sense for trawlers to land their fish close to where they are catching those fish.  A great deal of fish is caught close to Ireland.  We have the infrastructure and can build on it to deal with an increasing throughput of fish, which I hope we will be able to deliver.  BIM is working hard on that issue.</P>
      <P>To respond to the question on aquaculture, we are doing a great deal to develop this area.  Licensing has led to a great deal of frustration, but I have granted a series of aquaculture licences in the past few weeks.  We must be consistent with EU law in habitats directives, including the Natura 2000 directive.  Unfortunately, practically every bay around the coastline of Ireland is a Natura area.  There are a few exceptions in west Cork, one or two in other parts, and Bantry Bay for example, is an exception.  Generally in order to put a fish farm or any development that potentially changes the eco system in those harbours, one has to go through a process, which is laborious, difficult, expensive and time consuming.  We are trying to do that as quickly as we possibly can.  Unfortunately we are at the mercy of the European Commission because the way in which we provided aquaculture licences in the past was not up to scratch.  The Commission took a case against Ireland and won it.  We are now being forced to put in place a gold plated licensing system.  This is time consuming but we are staring to get through the applications for bays and will continue to work as fast as we can.  In the meantime we are trying to shift the whole dynamic in fish farming.  We are supportive of exploring the potential <Col N="968" />of bays for fish farms, having considered the friction with anglers and their concerns around issues such as disease, lice or whatever caused by fish farms only and will grant permission only when it is appropriate to put salmon farms there.  I believe there is capacity for much more fish farming in bays, but outside of that we are moving to a new horizon.  Next week I will have a licence application on my desk for a 15,000 tonnes salmon farm off the west coast, but which one cannot see from the mainland.  It is nearly 2 km east of the southern most Aran island.  One can barely see it from the southern most island on a clear day.  We have put the buoys out on the sea to see it visually.  I have seen the photographs from that planning.  We are trying to take advantage of the extraordinary demand for organic Atlantic Irish salmon.  There is extraordinary demand for that product worldwide.  We currently have an output of some 12,000 tonnes of farmed salmon each year.  If permission for this farm is granted, having gone through a rigorous licensing process &mdash; I cannot show any favouritism here &mdash; this farm will more than double our national output of salmon.  We will have three of these applications in place by the end of the year.  We may have six such applications done and granted within two or three years.  Scotland produces 150,000 tonnes of farmed salmon.  Norway produces more than 1 million tonnes of farmed salmon and wants to increase it to 2 million tonnes.  This is the market in which we are playing but the difference is that the world prices for salmon from Norway fell by nearly 40%.  The price for organic, Irish farmed salmon remained steady and strong because people associate Irish product with very high quality, high end premium salmon for which they are willing to pay a premium.  The challenge for us, and this applies to the food industry generally, is where there is a clear opportunity in terms of markets, we need to keep the standards we have managed to develop in what is currently a relatively small industry intact but work on increasing the volumes and outputs, thus growing the number of jobs.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The capital cost of developing salmon farms will be approximately &euro;50 million.  Based on the current price of salmon, the farm to which I alluded would have an annual turnover of &euro;103 million and would employ between 300 and 400 people.  The reason I am able to provide such precise figures is that the largest salmon farming company in the country, Marine Harvest, produces between 10,000 and 12,000 tonnes of farmed salmon annually and employs 280 people.  These jobs are located in areas which need employment.  The development of salmon farms will feed into the processing sector and build a reputation for Ireland as a serious seafood producer, both in terms of volume and quality.  We will also start to move from the current crazy system in which many of our fish processors import Scottish salmon to be processed and rebranded and sold as Irish salmon.</P>

      <P Just="Left">Many believe little is happening in the aquaculture and fish farming sector.  We are about to change the fish farming landscape in Ireland in a manner with which non-governmental agencies and individuals who have concerns about the salmon farming industry will be comfortable.  The scale of the proposed salmon farms is such that they will be offshore &mdash; up to 6km to 7km from the coast &mdash; and virtually out of sight.  As I stated, it is not possible to operate such farms in the open Atlantic.</P>

      <Col N="969" />
      <P>Regardless of how I distribute the Celtic Sea herring quota I will probably be taken to court because I will upset someone.  When the quota for a valuable stock such as herring significantly increases, as occurred in the past year, everyone wants a piece of it.  We also have a herring fishery off the west and north-west coast, close to County Mayo, which was historically larger than the herring fishery in the Celtic Sea.  The Department is in the process of drawing up a management plan for this stock to enable the herring fishery in that region to achieve similar levels of growth as the herring fishery in the Celtic Sea.  I am engaged in a consultation process and have invited all the stakeholders to comment on an initial proposal from me on the distribution of the valuable herring quota.  All submissions have been received and we will have a round table discussion on the issue as I am legally required to listen to the views of all stakeholders before making a judgment call.  As I indicated, some people will be unhappy regardless of what call I make.  I am obsessed with ensuring the process proceeds correctly and all parties are given an opportunity to be heard and make their point.  Ultimately, however, it is my job to make a judgment call as to how we can maximise the benefit of our natural resource of herring for the fishing community, coastal communities and the fishing industry generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my only objective and it is the reason for the proposals I have made.  I am somewhat restricted legally in terms of what I can say, including on which way I am leaning in this regard, because whatever I say will be used as part of any argument that may be made later.  However, if Senators wish to speak to me afterwards, I will certainly discuss my position with them.</P>
      <P>We are trying to apply the same principles to the Celtic Sea as we are applying off the west and north-west coasts in respect of herring.  I hope quota increases will be granted in that herring fishery of a similar magnitude to those approved in the Celtic Sea.  Everyone will benefit from such increases.  This is an issue of sustainable stock management and linking science with fishing experience to manage and build stocks.  It was on that basis that we managed to secure such extraordinary increases in some stocks this year.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On wild salmon, the management of inland fisheries is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  I do not have any role in salmon licensing or the linkage between angling and tourism.  That may not be as it should be but it is the current position.  I have some influence on the relationship between aquaculture and fish farming, on the one hand, and angling on the other.  If at some point we are reviewing policy in this area, I may consider ways in which small artisan fisheries could catch salmon.  It is my job to speak to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, on these issues if we are developing new approaches and so forth.  However, I do not wish to raise any hopes that the Government will allow wild salmon to be caught again any time soon.  It is good that wild salmon stocks are starting to increase.  Angling tourism is a significant industry and we can strike the right balance between angling interests and allowing the commercial, sustainable exploitation of the salmon stock.  While this relationship is consistently fractious, we must all have an open mind on it.</P>

If the issue is one of dredging, it is probably not the responsibility of my Department.  However, if I can be of assistance in the matter, I will examine it.  When specific cases are raised I prefer to ascertain what is the exact position to enable me to provide a proper answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames">
      <NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine.  What is the position on the memorandum with China?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s seafood exports to China are increasing.  To give an idea of the size of the market, China consumes 91 million tonnes of seafood every year, of which 70% is farmed.  Most regions of the world farm a substantial amount of the fish they consume.  This is not the case in Europe which is behind the curve in this area.  On the basis of current demand trends, the United Nations predicts that we will need to produce an additional 42 million tonnes of seafood each year to continue to feed the world population.  Although this additional amount must come from the sea or water, it will clearly not come from wild fish stocks.  We need to try to maintain what is currently described as maximum sustainable yield in terms of commercial exploitation of fish stocks while ensuring they remain intact.  We will secure significant increases in volume either by finding new species such as boarfish or through fish farming and aquaculture.  The challenge is to achieve this objective in a manner that is acceptable to those who live along the coast.  It must also complement our tourism objectives and be environmentally sustainable.  The deep sea salmon farming project is a good response to this challenge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked about the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, and perhaps we will need another discussion on this.  The key issue of concern in that regard is the proposal from the Commission with regard to introducing a system of individual transferable quotas, ITQs.  Currently, the way we run our system is that the quota the country has been allocated is reallocated to boats that are then allowed to catch that quota.  They are given certain security in terms of access to quota, but the boats do not own the quota.  What the Commission proposes is that we change the ownership or control model of quota from being State controlled and owned to being controlled and owned by companies and people who own trawlers so as to give them certainty in terms of quota.  The problem with that is that it is like having privatisation of fishing quotas, because this creates a trading market for quota.  In that scenario, the wealthiest people would buy up more and more quota, the fleet would get smaller, the boats would get bigger, the number of fishing ports would decrease and we would have consolidation in the industry.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Many want consolidation, because it is easier to monitor in terms of fish stocks and so on.  However, that is not what I want in terms of trying to feed local coastal economies with economic activity.  Commissioner Damanaki, with whom I have a very good relationship, knows <Col N="971" />this.  She is genuine about what she is trying to do, but what she proposes does not suit Ireland or the Irish fishing model.  There is huge danger that not only would there be huge consolidation within the Irish fleet, whereby the wealthy guys would buy up everybody else&rsquo;s quota, but those people might then be bought out by foreign interests.  The Commission may say that is not the intention and that it will put restrictions in place to ensure the trading of quota can only happen within national fleets.  However, under EU law one cannot stop a Spanish fishing company setting up in Ireland and buying up quota through buying Irish trawlers.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Irish white fish quota could easily be bought up by Spanish interests, because they have a huge interest in increasing their quota in white fish.  The Dutch might also try to buy up a large part of the pelagic quota, because they have colossal vessels that make our biggest vessels look small.  Much of the fishing industry in Spain and the Netherlands is not about family owned trawlers or groups of trawlers.  It is about multinationals running fleets of trawlers and they have the buying power to buy quota.  It may make sense to the Commission to change the system in terms of managing quota, but it makes no sense in terms of keeping coastal communities intact and reliant on fishing.  We are insisting on flexibility to allow Ireland not be forced to opt into the ITQ system.  We do not have a deal on this &mdash; far from it &mdash; but we have made a strong case and the Commissioner knows where we stand and that I am very firm on it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Another issue relates to discards.  This is something on which I agree with the Commissioner, although I do not agree entirely with her solution.  The idea that we would continue to dump hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish over the side each year because our trawlers do not have the quota to catch them and do not want to bring them ashore means we are throwing dead fish back into the sea at a time when we are trying to improve stocks.  Dumping fish that is marketable on shore is immoral.  In some species we are killing three, four or five juvenile fish in order to catch one adult marketable fish because we do not have the necessary targeting mechanisms or do not use the available technology and design to allow juvenile fish to escape.  This is not acceptable.  The situation needs to change.  The industry accepts that and is working with me on the issue.  We are making progress with some pilot projects and will continue topush hard to make the change.  I hope Ireland will give leadership in Europe on the discard issue.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">As I have answered the question on adding value, I will move on to the question on the Fisheries Act.  In the programme for Government we have made a commitment that we will try to introduce legislation that will move away from criminal sanction for certain breaches of the law and replace it with administrative sanctions.  Nobody likes sanctions, but we cannot fail to introduce administrative sanctions, despite the industry&rsquo;s dislike of them.  If people break the rules, there must be consequences.  I am uncomfortable &mdash; I was uncomfortable in opposition &mdash; with the fact that fishermen who break the rules in a relatively minor way acquire a criminal record which affects their capacity to, for example, enter the United States or other businesses.  I see that as being over the top.  Therefore, we have given a commitment to look at this issue.  We have asked the office of the Attorney General to examine the issue and it will not be an easy provision to make.  We are now looking at the issue because of a commitment in the programme for Government on which I would like to deliver.</P>
      <P>The legal solution is not as straightforward as one might have thought.  The former Deputy, Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, put legislation together on this issue which was used as a basis for testing the issue with the office of the Attorney General.  We now need to return to the Attorney General to see if we can progress a short Bill that will ensure that fishermen who do not significantly breach the regulations are not punished in a way that does not fit the crime and are not given a permanent criminal record.  This is not to say that we do not need to enforce <Col N="972" />the rules.  We do.  We need to protect fish stocks and the rules are there because they are needed.  However, the sanction must be appropriate and we are making efforts in that regard.</P>

        <NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am sure he is well aware of the despicable situation in which the residents of Priory Hall have found themselves.  Following a case brought by Dublin City Council, families have been forced to move out of their homes before Christmas, with little certainty for the future.  Their apartments were not just badly built by Coalport Limited, they are very dangerous.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council has sought at every juncture to avoid responsibility.  Its officials have displayed no humanity since the beginning of this debacle.  It has also been clear from the outset that it is acting under the advice of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, yet to date the Minister will not even meet with the families concerned to listen to their stories.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the residents are still facing a very bleak future, they now have to stomach watching the developer, Thomas McFeely, become the latest high profile Irish businessperson to avail of bankruptcy tourism in the UK, deliberately evading proceedings that are already under way in the Irish courts.  Mr. McFeely will be free of restrictions in 12 months, having been declared bankrupt by the UK courts.  He will be able to go about his life and his future business interests in his nice house on Ailesbury Road, without the slightest thought for the families affected by his shoddy, dishonest and cruel business practices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister of State is aware, Se&aacute;n Quinn also attempted to avail of the UK&rsquo;s more lenient bankruptcy laws, and was declared bankrupt in the North on 11 November.  The IBRC was successful in having that adjudication of bankruptcy overturned by the High Court in Belfast on 24 November, by establishing that his centre of interest was not in Fermanagh, but in the Republic.  This has allowed his case to be heard by the Irish courts, as is proper.  The Se&aacute;n Quinn case has established a precedent that bankruptcy tourism can and should be challenged.</P>
        <P>While Mr. McFeely was declared bankrupt in London almost two weeks ago, I understand that NAMA still has not sought to have that overturned, and it is being left to a private individual to do so.  A lady who was a victim of Mr. McFeely&rsquo;s shoddy practices in another development went to the distress of bringing him through the Irish courts and won a judgment against him for damages and costs, yet two years later he still has not paid.  She has now filed bankruptcy proceedings in the Republic and he has now gone to London &mdash; his own lawyers claim in the newspapers that they did no know about this &mdash; and has been awarded bankruptcy there.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State think it acceptable that NAMA is standing by while one of its creditors uses the much more lenient bankruptcy proceedings in the UK system?  If he does not, will the Government indicate to NAMA that it should seek to have the judgment in the UK overturned?</P>
        <Col N="973" />
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to meet the residents and listen to their stories, and I appeal to the Government to change tack.  So far, it has shown no support for the residents.  I appeal to the Minister of State to change that approach and help the people concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  NAMA has assured me, and has stated publicly on many occasions, that it will pursue all debts to the greatest extent feasible, in order to achieve the best achievable financial return for the State.  Where debtors are refusing to co-operate, it has been necessary for NAMA to adopt a number of approaches, depending on the legal advice received in each case.  Not all cases are the same, as the Senator is aware.  Based on those legal opinions which come before NAMA on the particulars of each case, an individual view is determined as to which approach to follow.  This may involve the pursuit of personal guarantees through the courts and in some cases, will require litigation to reverse asset transfers where the original intention appears to have been to place the assets concerned beyond the reach of NAMA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not wish to comment on the position of any individual debtor or any particular existing or proposed legal proceeding.  As the case referred to by the Senator is <i>sub judice, </i>it would not be appropriate for me to comment.  However, I would make the following points to address the general issue raised by the Senator.  Debtors do not normally inform their creditors in advance of their intention to pursue bankruptcy proceedings, and neither NAMA nor any other institution can prevent a debtor from applying for bankruptcy in Ireland or elsewhere if he or she has a legal right to do so.  However, NAMA has advised me that where one of its debtors seeks to pursue bankruptcy proceedings outside of Ireland, and where NAMA does not believe that it is bona fide, it will challenge the court decision in such instances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The general test applied in most jurisdictions as to whether a person is eligible to petition for bankruptcy in that jurisdiction is where that person&rsquo;s centre of main interests, or COMI, is in that jurisdiction.  In England and Wales the threshold to establish COMI is comparatively low.  The profile of some of NAMA&rsquo;s substantial debtors is of persons with some business interests in the UK and often there may be a well established pattern of travelling and staying in the UK in connection with these interests.  The frequency and duration of such visits to the UK may have increased substantially in recent years as the Irish property market stalled and the UK market remained reasonably buoyant, particularly in London.  Accordingly it has proved possible for certain NAMA debtors to legitimately pass the COMI requirement in the UK and seek to be made bankrupt there.</P>
        <P>Where an individual has been made bankrupt in the UK, it is open to NAMA as a creditor to appoint a trustee in bankruptcy.  The trustee will generally be an individual from the private sector and a licensed insolvency practitioner.  He or she is charged, among other things, with maximising the return to creditors.  The trustee has the power to summons the bankrupt to be examined as to his assets and to conduct investigations for hidden assets.  NAMA advises me that it has already appointed trustees in bankruptcy who are carrying out such work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The trustee in bankruptcy has the ability to apply to have the 12 month timeframe extended where there is non-co-operation from the bankrupt, or where there is evidence of assets being hidden.  The point NAMA makes there is that people should not automatically assume, when NAMA appoints an individual to pursue debtors in this or other cases, that work is not ongoing.  When published, a bankrupt in the UK may be discharged from bankruptcy after a lapse of one year, with a further two years during which he or she is monitored.  In Ireland, it currently <Col N="974" />takes 12 years.  As proposed in the draft Bill introduced yesterday by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, that period will be substantially reduced.  The draft personal insolvency Bill provides for automatic discharge after three years in place of the current 12 years.  Hence, there is an element of convergence which may make the UK process less attractive to some NAMA debtors in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is committed to introducing fair and appropriate revisions of bankruptcy laws as soon as possible.  In the interim, NAMA assures me it will be using all of the powers available to it, within the existing legal framework, to ensure that developers face up to their responsibilities and maximise the return to the State on loans transferred to it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AverilPower">
        <NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
        <P>With respect, that is an extraordinarily hands-off reply given the general policy implications.  What message does this send out in the current environment, not just to Priory Hall residents but to individuals and families who are under huge pressure?  They can see their assets being taken from them and are worried about being able to pay their mortgages and feed their children, yet they can see developers and other business people taking a quick one-hour flight and availing of lenient measures in another jurisdiction.  Given the broader policy implications, this is an issue that the Government needs to be much more hands-on about.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State speak to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and request that he meet the residents concerned and listen to their side of the argument?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes">

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">Also with respect, as I pointed out, this matter is <i>sub judice</i>.  The Senator is well aware &mdash; or if not, she should be &mdash; of the clear constitutional barriers that exist between the courts of this land and the decisions of this or the other House.  With regard to NAMA, to which these dubious assets have been transferred &mdash; an agency, I hasten to add, that was established by the Senator&rsquo;s own party &mdash; we have a responsibility, in the firstinstance, to maximise the amounts of money returned to the State.  While I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s concerns about this case &mdash; concerns that are equally borne by the Government &mdash; we must deal with this in a way that stands the test of legal challenge.  I do not believeshe should automatically assume, in this or other cases, that NAMA is not pursuing this matter in the way in which it normally does its business, namely, appointing persons who normally act in cases of insolvency and then trying to maximise the amount of money reclaimed from debtors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will transmit to my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the Senator&rsquo;s views that he should meet the group concerned.  I give her my word that I will say that to him.</P>

      <sTitle>Counterfeit Pesticides</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke">
        <NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
        <P>My question is about the sale of pesticides.  While I know there is comprehensive legislation dealing with this matter, I would like to ask about counterfeit pesticides.  My understanding is that there is a major trade in counterfeit pesticides across Europe, although the authorities are working hard to combat this problem.  A loophole has been iden<Col N="975" />tified.  It is illegal to sell counterfeit pesticides, but it appears there is a deficiency in the legislation in some European countries, and the legislation in Ireland lacks some clarity with regard to whether the authorities have the right to confiscate.  In a recent case, 135 tonnes of counterfeit pesticides that were being transported between Germany and Lithuania had to be returned to the owners because the legislation there did not allow the products to be confiscated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Now we are facing into the spring season, in which there is substantial use of pesticides in this country.  In fairness to farmers in this country, they are careful about what they buy and who they buy it from, but it appears this is a growing problem across Europe.  What checks have been established in this country?  Do we have adequate legislation to ensure we can impound any product that is proved to be a counterfeit?  As the people who are bringing these products to the market use false information on the containers, it may be hard to identify what is counterfeit unless there are adequate testing procedures.  Does the Minister have concerns about this matter?  How are the products coming into this country checked?  How can we ensure our legislation in this regard is adequate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am glad he did so because it has forced a focus on this issue in my office that perhaps was not there previously, although there is a strong focus on it in the Department, as I have found out since the Senator tabled his motion.</P>
        <P>The placing on the market and use of plant protection products is regulated in Ireland by SI 83/2003.  This instrument implements European legislation that lays down the procedures and decision-making criteria that must be used for assessing risk and for approving active substances and the plant protection products containing them.</P>
        <P>The pesticide registration and control division, PRCD, of my Department has primary responsibility for the implementation of the legislation in this regard.  The registration of plant protection products is a two-stage process.  First, the active substances are scientifically reviewed at a European level and, following approval, are included in a positive list of approved substances.  Following this inclusion, each member state is required to carry out a detailed scientific review of products containing that particular active substance so that the products may be placed on the market.  This review includes a detailed assessment of all properties of a product.  It assesses the impact on human or animal health and on the environment that may arise from use of the product, along with its biological effectiveness.  Almost 850 such pesticides are registered for marketing in Ireland.  Products demonstrating unacceptable impact on health or the environment or without suitable effectiveness cannot be approved or registered.</P>
        <P>In addition to the registration process, my Department is also responsible for enforcement of the Chemicals Act in so far as it relates to pesticides.  The Act implements procedures to regulate the import and export of dangerous pesticides and improve the regulation of pesticides, especially in developing countries, by requiring prior informed consent from an importing country before import or export can take place.  The Act also deals with the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals, including pesticides, and lays down strict requirements in this regard.</P>
        <P>Authorised officers of my Department ensure compliance with the legislation through an enforcement programme, which involves a planned series of inspections of wholesale and retail outlets, sampling and analysis of the pesticides offered for sale to ensure they meet FAO tolerances, namely, that they are what they say they are, and residue testing of Irish and imported primary food products.  Approximately 400 wholesale and retail outlets are inspected annually, and wholesalers receive at least three annual inspections to ensure compliance with <Col N="976" />the regulations.  If unregistered products are found several courses of action are available to the authorised officer &mdash; this is the key issue for the Senator &mdash; which may involve seizure and destruction, the recall and re-export of the product to the country of origin and-or a criminal prosecution.  However, it is fair to say the majority of non-compliance encountered by authorised officers relates to a failure to fully comply with the registration procedures.</P>
        <P>An annual formulation sampling programme is conducted in order to verify that the products on the market comply with the registration specification.  Samples are taken again at retail and wholesale levels and analysed by the pesticide control laboratory.  It is accredited to ISO 17025 standard and is equipped with the latest analytical technology.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine carries out a comprehensive pesticide residue control programme, whereby approximately 1,500 samples of produce, both Irish and imported, are analysed for some 340 pesticides.  The results indicate substantial compliance with the legislation.</P>
        <P>Since the Senator has raised the issue I will revert to the experts in my Department and discuss the issue with them.  If he has specific examples or anecdotal evidence that further legislation or enforcement are needed I would like to hear about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke">
        <NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
        <P>My understanding is that there is adequate legislation but the problem is the impounding of products.  There is concern that the EU regulations, which we have followed very carefully, involve a technicality about the impounding of counterfeit pesticide.  The issue has been raised at European level.  I do not know whether there is a proposal to introduce amending regulations to deal with it.  It has not been a problem and the Minister has given a very comprehensive reply, for which I thank him and his staff.  My only issue is that if such products are found we have the right to infringe them.</P>

        <P>I drafted my Adjournment matter about two weeks ago but it has been overtaken by events yesterday.  In that regard, I welcome the publication of the heads of the Bill to deal with this fairly intractable problem.  The 12 year bankruptcy provisions we have are the most onerous in the EU and are very punitive.  They apply to a different era and are badly in need of updating.</P>
        <P>I am glad personal insolvency has been included.  There is now real urgency about tackling the personal debt issue and this is an attempt to move in the right direction.  We are three and a half years into the financial crisis and many people have been struggling during that period.  It is time that people saw some light at the end of the tunnel.  We have been addressing the question of the banks being bankrupt and it is time we addressed personal indebtedness and bankruptcy.</P>
        <P>A presentation was made to us last week, with which the Minister of State might be familiar, by the CSO and Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  They showed that there is a huge problem in the 30 to 39 year old age group, which has negative equity of &euro;7.1 billion.  The next highest category is those aged between 40 and 49, which has negative equity of &euro;2.1 billion.  The figures show where the concentration of this problem lies.  The Minister said this is not a <Col N="977" />negative equity issue, rather it is about indebtedness and the capacity of people to be able to meet it, which is an important point.</P>
        <P>I am moving between the mortgage side and the individuals who have given personal guarantees to  banks.  Many have gone to Britain, where the bankruptcy provisions are more lenient, and dealt with the issue there.  That is not good for a number of reasons.  We may be losing people to other jurisdictions who in the past have had very good credit and entrepreneurial records and created many jobs in this country.  Given our population size, it is important that the coterie of people who found themselves blown away by the current global economic downturn are in a position to re-enter the business market here.  We need to concentrate on ensuring that happens.</P>
        <P>In doing that we have to be mindful we are balanced because the interests of the taxpayers, who are funding the banks, and moral hazard have to be taken into account.  Having said that, if we do not have a proper functioning economy with business leaders who will drive we will not have growth or be able to deal with the sovereign debt issues.  The issues are interlinked and we have to deal with them in a sensible way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have to be cognisant that this is the greatest downturn any of us have ever seen in our lifetimes.  To a great degree it replicates what happened during the Wall Street crash and Great Depression in the 1930s.  That puts the issue in context.  We cannot and should not, from a moral point of view, bail out banks which acted irresponsibly and put all the blame on those who perhaps borrowed irresponsibly.</P>
        <P>I welcome the reduction to three years, which is significant.  I suggest the period should be between one and three years and that judicial discretion could be exercised because of the unprecedented position we are in this.  If we were in normal economic times I might suggest a period of between two and five years but we need to address the current crisis.</P>
        <P>There needs to be absolute discharge.  One cannot have an overhang where the Revenue Commissioners can look to be paid back or a person is charged for the cost of bankruptcy.  I have seen nothing in the heads of the Bill to deal with the exorbitant cost of legal fees.</P>
        <P>There is no mention of any debt resolution agency.  Such an agency would be the kernel of what we should try to do to ensure there is appropriate balance between individuals and banks.  Voluntary schemes will only work if both parties come to an agreement.  There needs to be pressure on both to reach that agreement.  There is now an imbalance that favours the banks.  We need to enable people to recover quickly from the current crisis in the interests of all of us and the economy.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the important issue of reform of our bankruptcy law and practice by way of Adjournment debate today.  It gives me an opportunity to inform the House of recent developments, to which the Senator has already referred, regarding the reform of our personal insolvency regime.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, asked me to convey his apologies for not being here today as he is attending a meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Denmark.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators will be aware that earlier this week the Cabinet gave its approval to the proposals of the Minister for the drafting of the personal insolvency Bill.  On Wednesday, 25 January the Minister launched the comprehensive reform of our insolvency law and practice following the Government&rsquo;s approval of the general scheme of the personal insolvency Bill.  The detailed and comprehensive heads of the Bill are available on the Department of Justice and Equalitywebsite.  I am sure the Senator has already seen them.  They are being referred to the Joint<Col N="978" />Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality with a request for preliminary observationsby 1 March next.  I agree with the Senator that we cannot hang around in this respect.  It has to be done as quickly as possible.  The members of the committee, and other Members of both Houses who wish to attend meetings of the committee, will have time to consider the proposals and to make an input into the substantive provisions the Government will ultimately adopt.A Bill is to be developed on a priority basis so it can be published by the end of April,in line with the revised commitment in the EU-IMF programme of financial support forIreland.  The legislation will also fulfil the relevant commitment in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reforms set out in the document that was published yesterday constitute the most radical reform of our insolvency laws since the foundation of the State.  The reform of bankruptcy law invariably focuses on the length of the discharge period that will apply to the person adjudicated bankrupt.  This point was debated in both Houses during the passage of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, which contained some early reforms of bankruptcy law.  It provided for a reduction in the period that applies to court applications for discharge from bankruptcy from 12 years to five, subject to the conditions in place.  For the first time in Irish law, a system of automatic discharge of bankruptcies has been introduced, to take effect on the 12th anniversary of the bankruptcy adjudication order.   These provisions were commenced with effect from 10 October 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was decided that the question of a further reduction in the period for automatic discharge of a bankrupt had to be addressed in the consideration of more comprehensive reform.  Opinions vary as to the appropriate period.  There was reasonable consensus that the one-year period that applies in the UK is too short but anything beyond five years is too long, particularly if the bankrupt person has been fully compliant and not behaved fraudulently in any way.  That is the Senator&rsquo;s central point.  Given that our neighbouring jurisdictions operate the most liberal bankruptcy discharge regime in the world, the Government has to be conscious of not incentivising forum shopping.  As we have seen in certain cases recently, however, such efforts are not always successful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has decided that a three-year automatic discharge period is the most realistic approach in the circumstances.  The approach that has been chosen means a fixed period for applications to the court for discharge of a bankruptcy &mdash; at present five years &mdash; is no longer required.  Senators will agree that the reduced time period for automatic discharge from bankruptcy is a significant reform.  To ensure there is no temptation to seek to unjustly exploit this provision, the proposed personal insolvency Bill will provide for a number of other measures.  A discharge from bankruptcy could be delayed by the court for a period up to a maximum of eight years &mdash; the Senator made this point &mdash; for non-compliance or for fraudulent or dishonest behaviour by the bankrupt during the process.  A court may make a payment order requiring the discharged bankrupt to make certain payments in favour of creditors, allowing for reasonable living expenses, for a period of up to five years.  There will be extended timeframes in regard to possible fraudulent transfers or settlements of assets by the applicant for bankruptcy.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Full disclosure and realisation of all the bankrupt&rsquo;s assets and interests for the benefit of creditors has always been and will continue to be a requirement of our bankruptcy law.  If full disclosure and realisation has been made, there is no reason to deny or delay a discharge in respect of any person.  I understand the proposed legislation does not refer to &ldquo;full discharge&rdquo;, but I am sure that is its intent.  In developing the scheme of the personal insolvency Bill, the <Col N="979" />Minister for Justice and Equality has taken account not only of the extensive recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission but also of the Cooney report, the Keane report and other relevant reports.  He has done this with a view to formulating proposals for the comprehensive reform of bankruptcy law and the creation of a new non-judicial debt settlement scheme, which is another one of the issues raised by the Senator.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The personal insolvency Bill will propose to put in place, for the first time, a non-judicial system for the settlement of debt.  Three new non-judicial debt settlement systems are being introduced, subject to relevant conditions in each case.  The debt relief certificate system will allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt concerning debtors with &ldquo;no assets and no income&rdquo; up to &euro;20,000 after a one-year moratorium period.  The debt settlement arrangement system will allow for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt of &euro;20,001 and over.  The personal insolvency arrangement system will allow for the agreed settlement of both secured and unsecured debt of &euro;20,001 and over.  The personal insolvency arrangement system provides for a unique and specific mechanism to assist in resolving the difficulties confronting thousands of home owners in negative equity with mortgage arrears who are genuinely incapable of discharging their monthly mortgage repayments.  The use of this mechanism has the potential to allow agreed debt settlement arrangements to be put in place which will enable people to continue residing in their homes and avoid judicial bankruptcy.</P>
        <P>The Bill also proposes the establishment of an insolvency service to operate the new non-judicial insolvency arrangements.  Senators will appreciate that reform of our personal insolvency regime is not a simple task.  It is a very complex area of the law.  The consequences and implications of new policies in this area need to be carefully assessed.  A delicate balance needs to be struck between the various legal rights of the parties involved.  The intention behind the proposed personal insolvency Bill is to design a system which is fair to both creditors and debtors.  Any failure to do so would make worse a situation that is already extremely difficult for both parties.</P>

Many have committed suicide.  There is a need for urgency in this respect.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in that regard.  She did not mention anything about the debt resolution agency.  I urge the Government to consider it as a means of ensuring people have allies when they try to reach settlements with banks.  People should not be dealt with in a totally impersonal way by banks that do not recognise the difficulties they are in.  The discharge after three years should be absolute.  There should be no problems with cost hangovers or preferential creditors, including the Revenue Commissioners.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Finance the need for determination in this regard, given the circumstances we are in.</P>

According to this material, it is intended that the adjudicators or mediators in this respect would be the agencies with which we are familiar, including the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  Those bodies, which have a remit in this area, will be named in the Bill.  In addition, I understand it is intended to provide for absolute discharge in the legislation.  I do not think the notion that a bankruptcy could be discharged while additional costs arising from <Col N="980" />the bankruptcy remain is being entertained.  I am sure the Minister will clarify all of these matters during the debate on the legislation.</P>

        <NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas l&eacute;i as ucht teacht isteach chun an cheist seo a phl&eacute;.  T&aacute; an fhadhb seo beag, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, i gcomhth&eacute;acs na t&iacute;re, ach t&aacute; s&iacute; m&oacute;r d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d ar a bhfuil s&iacute; ag cur isteach.  The major cutbacks that have been made to dental services throughout the country since budget 2011 have had a big impact in smaller rural areas.  These problems have come to the fore in the Connemara area in recent weeks.  The chief executive of the Irish Dental Association, Fintan Hourihan, said last year that Irish dental care is in a state of emergency and requires urgent assistance as a result of a mixture of official neglect and ongoing cutbacks.  He continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">Two thirds of dentists say they are now referring more patients to hospitals while 73% are referring more patients to HSE dental clinics.  We predicted this would happen when the cutbacks were announced.  We now fear that patients are in for a lot more pain and delays because the system is buckling under the pressure.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Early last year, subsidies for dental care under social insurance were slashed, as were entitlements to routine dental care for medical card patients.  Some 88% of the dentists who were polled did not believe the public is aware of its remaining entitlements under two dental health schemes.  This is having a particular effect on small rural communities, such as those in &Aacute;rainn and Connemara.  Local people in Carna were not given any news on the ending of the dentistry service that had been provided by the HSE and the health services for many years.  They only heard about it in the last couple of days.  The dental services provided in Connemara will be reorganised from next month.  Alternative arrangements are being made to replace the service provided from the health centre in Carna one day a week.  This decision was made on account of staff shortages and the HSE being unable to replace staff who leave the service due to the public service moratorium on recruitment. </P>
        <P>Currently, a limited service is provided by a dental hygienist in Carraroe and from February a dental team will be in Carraroe for one day per week to provide an elective and emergency service to the area.  Patients who currently attend the one day per week clinic in Carna will be asked to attend clinics in Clifden or Carraroe.  We are told the dental team will contact patients to rearrange appointments in Clifden or Carraroe.  This will affect students in nine national schools that are served by the clinic in Carna.</P>
        <P>The children of the area are being unfairly targeted due to the harsh cutbacks and the moratorium on recruitment in the HSE.  This is inequitable, unfair and unacceptable.  It is also very unfair to expect people to bear the extra travel costs pertaining to attending the basic services, as outlined, which could have a detrimental long-term effect on their health.  I urge the Minister to use his influence to ensure that these services remain in Carna where they are accessible to the community, rather than take them out of the community.</P>
        <P>The children in Carna are having their one day per week taken away and it is being given to the community in Carraroe, where we have already had a bad service.  There is quite a distance between the two places and there is no direct bus service between Carna and Carraroe or between Carna and Clifden.  Anyone who does not have a car cannot get to the clinic.  Travelling also means taking children out of school for half a day and parents having to take time off work.  The move strikes me as being very unfair.</P>
        <Col N="981" />
        <P>I urge the Minister to see if there is any way the moratorium on recruitment can be addressed in this situation.  I know that exceptions have been made in some cases and this is an area where an exception should be made.  It would be for the benefit of those children.  This is a very important service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  No matter where a service is provided parents will have to take time off work to take their children to dentists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh">
        <NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>They might not have to spend half a day travelling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that and the distances involved.  I say this because I am not certain anything I have in my reply is any different from what the Senator has said.  I hope he accepts that.  I accept that there are huge distances involved.  I understand that the distances and the nature of the terrain mean this case is different.  That is accepted.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the provision of public dental services, in particular for children in Connemara and the Aran Islands. The public dental service provides emergency, routine and preventive oral health services to children under 16 and to people of all ages with special needs.  The services are delivered by dentists, dental nurses and dental hygienists employed by the HSE.  Galway local health office area provides dental and other health services to Galway city and county.  It has a population of approximately 254,000 and is served by nine dental teams.  Services provided by the dental teams include services for those with special needs; general anaesthetic services for both those with special needs and children requiring same; emergency services; screening and treatment for all 6th class children before entering secondary school;  and orthodontic assessments.</P>
        <P>Where resources permit, additional school classes are screened and preventive care and treatment provided.  Staffing for dental teams in Galway is expected to reduce after February 2012 due to early retirements.  Galway local health office area teams will be further reorganised at that time to include realignment of staff to ensure that equity of services is maintained across the area.  The vast majority of children from the Aran Islands avail of services provided in Galway city.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE is to consider the possibility of providing a school screening service on the Aran Islands so as to reduce the need for children to travel to the mainland.  From next month, the dental services provided in Connemara will be reorganised.  Alternative arrangements are being made to replace the one day a week service currently provided from the health centre in Carna.  Patients who currently attend the one day a week clinic in Carna will be asked to attend clinics in Clifden or Carraroe, as the Senator has outlined.  The dental team will contact patients from the nine primary schools served by Carna to rearrange appointments for them in Clifden or Carraroe clinics.  This centralisation of the service is necessary to ensure that standards for infection control are maintained at all of the clinics within the Clifden Primary Care Network.  Refocusing services to fewer clinics ensures maintenance of standards.  Centralisation is necessary also to ensure that sufficient staff are available regularly to service all of the clinics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The clinic in Carraroe has been upgraded recently.  It has a limited service provided by a dental hygienist.  From February a dental team will provide an elective and an emergency service in the area for one day a week from the Carraroe clinic.  Works on the clinic in Clifden are under way to ensure that it meets the national standards for infection control.  The Clifden primary care network area which includes the dental clinics at Clifden and Carraroe and also a clinic in Oughterard serves a population of approximately 34,000.  Dental services are provided six days per week from this primary care network.</P>

        <P>The Minister of State mentioned that the Carraroe clinic was recently upgraded for reasons of safety and standards.  Does that mean the clinic in Carna which was upgraded only in the last year or so is not up to a sufficient standard?  It is my understanding that the clinic was only set up in the last year or so.  If so, how did that happen?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has not addressed the issue.  These cutbacks are very unfair.  I ask the Minister to discuss this matter again with the HSE.  The new arrangement will place a huge burden on the children and parents in that area.  It is very unfair.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The issue is not merely one of standards.  There is also the issue of staff, as the Senator  mentioned.  We will have a huge difficulty with early retirements and it will affect all areas.  I will, most definitely, take the Senator's remarks back to the Minister.</P>
