      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the U-turn confirmed yesterday by the Minister for Education and Skills, that he will reverse the proposed cuts to disadvantaged DEIS schools.  I have a major concern, however, because in my view the Minister is setting one child off against another.  On the basis of this review, which overturns the previous decision on DEIS schools, he is now increasing the cut to capitation grants for all other schools.</P>
        <P>We have had lengthy debates here on education.  It seems to me that this proposal was stopped because the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, strong-armed the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, on DEIS schools.  However, what about smaller schools and minority faith schools, which I have mentioned on numerous occasions in the House?  In the minority faith schools, 65% of Church of Ireland schools are negatively affected by the Government&rsquo;s proposals, yet when the issue was debated the Minister did not see fit to come to the House but sent in the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon.  Will the Leader and the Government parties ask for a review in respect of smaller, rural and minority faith schools?</P>
        <P>I draw to the attention of the House the impending crisis in the children&rsquo;s hospitals in Dublin.  People may have heard a radio interview this morning on foot of the fact that trolley waiting times in Crumlin hospital have increased 700% in the past three years but have become partic<Col N="3"/>ularly acute in the past 12 months.  That also relates to the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital in Temple Street.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has come in and made great play of the special delivery unit; that seems to be all he speaks about here.  What specific plan has the Government in place to address the fact that a sizeable proportion of children who are going to the children&rsquo;s hospital are being discharged without seeing a consultant or doctor, given that the waiting times have increased by 700% in the past three years and have been particularly acute in the past 12 months?  We have discussed the importance of education for children.  All of us would agree that health and health care for children are of paramount importance.  What will the Minister do in respect of the two children&rsquo;s hospitals in the city?</P>
        <P>At 10.30 this morning the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, announced his plan for the sale of State assets.  I reject the fact that the Minister is announcing the plan to the media rather than the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He is attending a press conference.  This is the trend with the Government &mdash; all major announcements are made to media when they should be made to the elected Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The Government keeps trotting out the excuse that the sale of State assets was agreed by the previous Government.  That is not true.  The original memorandum of understanding of December 2010 refers to the possible privatisation of State assets.  The Government agreed and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, confirmed this on 5 October 2011, when he said &ldquo;we included a figure [we, being this Government] of &euro;2 billion in this regard in the programme for Government and we intend to realise that&rdquo;.  I ask the Leader to give a commitment to provide time next week to debate the sale of State assets because at 10.42 a.m. the media will already know, ahead of elected Members, what the Government is proposing to sell.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>At the very least I want a firm commitment from the Leader that he will set aside time next week for a debate and invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to the House.  It may be difficult as I know he is precious from time to time but I respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I ask Senator O&rsquo;Brien to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concluding.  It would be important for all of us that elected Members of the Oireachtas know what the Government is doing in advance of the media.  Perhaps the Minister would address the issue next week by coming to the House and setting aside appropriate time for discussion on the Government&rsquo;s plan to sell State assets.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will refrain from comment on the issue of Ministers being precious because there were plenty of Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers who were very precious about many things when they signed us up to the memorandum of understanding that brought about the necessary sale of State assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the Government&rsquo;s memorandum and another broken promise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the review by the Minister for Education and Skills of DEIS schools and the fact that staff provision in DEIS schools and the legacy posts issue have been resolved.  I am delighted that has happened and it has been welcomed across the House, albeit somewhat grudgingly by Senator O&rsquo;Brien&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>There are additional cuts in other schools, including capitation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is a sign that the Minister has been responsive to concerns raised by many people about the impact of the staffing changes for students in disadvantaged schools.  We all welcome that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Another U-turn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on prayer and the fact that we will have a much more inclusive start to business every day with a few moments for silent reflection as well as a prayer.  It was something that was adopted unanimously at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on foot of a suggestion from Senator Mullen and me.  It is a sign that the House can be responsive and that we can work together to make changes in procedure.  It is an important change that marks a spirit of inclusivity in our procedures.</P>
        <P>I welcome the news that the constitutional convention is to be launched.  Many of us had hoped it would be launched before now.  However, it is welcome that it is being launched and it is also welcome that we will look at a wide range of issues relating to constitutional change.  In particular, there is one area of constitutional change that is long overdue, for which I think there will be unanimous support, the deletion of the current phrase which recognises only women&rsquo;s place in the home and the duties of mothers in the home.  Again, in a spirit of inclusivity we would all recognise that both parents have a place in the home and that in 2012 there should not be any reference to women having an exclusive role in the home.  I am optimistic that will be one of the first changes the constitutional convention will recommend.</P>
        <P>Some years ago an expert review group on the Constitution recommended a new provision on recognising the role of carers in the home which, I think, would be supported by everyone and would be an important change to make.  I hope that is one of the first things the convention will do but, of course, there are many other important issues it will look at, including same sex marriage, voting age, length of the term of the President and so on.  I would like if we in the Seanad could have a particular role in respect of the constitutional convention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The future of the Seanad should be part of that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I note Standing Order 18, prayer on commencement of sitting, put before the House today and call for a respectable debate around that area.  Our group of nominated Senators has divergent views and that divergence of views should be reflected rather than passing it through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and presenting it here.  The <Col N="5"/>Chamber has a mutual respect among all of us and the debate around Standing Order 18 on the commencement prayer should be a full debate in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator proposing a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I am calling for a debate on the issue.  I propose an amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is the Senator proposing an amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If he had not done so, I would have proposed it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that a debate take place on Standing Order 18 to reflect the divergent views, not only among our group, but among Senators on the matter.  That would be healthy.</P>
        <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the soundings emanating from the Cabinet on the establishment of a constitutional convention particularly if the report that the involvement of citizens in the deliberation of political reform of the Republic is correct.  It would be a good day if, with elected representatives, citizens had an opportunity to participate in a decision-making process which will not only have a profound impact on the future but in turn, result in increased political participation.</P>
        <P>As the House may be aware I was involved in a non-party political initiative last year, We the Citizens, which proved conclusively that citizens&rsquo; assemblies can and will work here.  For us to change the political culture of the Republic, citizens need to be involved in a greater and more imaginative way in a participatory democracy.  Ireland has changed and citizens are seeking new ways to engage in the civic and democratic life of their communities and country.  That was the message we heard as we travelled through Ireland during summer 2011.  We found that a great deal of common sense is generated when people get together to work things out.  People came together at our events not because of vested interests or political persuasion but as individual citizens willing and ready to contribute to the future of the Republic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  We the Citizens has shown that when people are given objective information and the opportunity to deliberate not only do they make informed decisions they also feel a greater connection to the democratic process.  It is a matter of public record that citizens&rsquo; assemblies work and that the expertise published by We the Citizens is free and publicly available to members of the House and to Government.  In that regard, I welcome the comments by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, that he would look at this model of a citizens&rsquo; assembly, the context of a constitutional convention and that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan&rsquo;s commitment to political reform is constant.  I understand draft proposals regarding a constitutional convention will be published over the coming week and consultation will be sought with the Opposition on the format.  Will the Leader ensure all leaders of parties and technical groups in the Seanad are consulted and given the opportunity to contribute to deciding the format of this convention?  Will he also set aside time to debate this important and historic convention?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien on the Government&rsquo;s approach to the announcement of the sale of State assets.  It is one of the more regrettable developments in politics in recent years that the Oireachtas is bypassed when news must be told to the people.  In a sense, it shows the authoritarian nature of our political system in that <Col N="6"/>government commands and oversees all while it does not give the Oireachtas the respect it is due.</P>
        <P>I recall when I was young boy in the 1980s the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on the very same subject of the sale of State assets saying one can sell the family silver but only once.  I would welcome a debate on this in the Seanad.  I hope Ireland&rsquo;s long-term national interest will not be damaged by the sale of these assets.  While we must have in mind the future profits of profitable enterprises in electricity and gas, we must also bear in mind the costs of redundancies and unemployment.  I hope the figures are being done in the round so that Ireland is being enabled by the troika to act in its long-term best interest and not in the short-term interest of lowering our debt.</P>
        <P>On the subject of giving business every chance, I am concerned about the impact of the Occupy Dame Street protest on local businesses in the vicinity.  I am sure Members have received correspondence about this.  One local businessperson wrote to me about how this encampment is causing major problems for local retailers, how footfall in the area has dropped drastically since the camp was erected and how the public does not venture near the Central Bank plaza because of a kind of intimidation &mdash; people turn away from barriers and fencing like that.  Would a Traveller encampment be treated with the same respect?  I say that with the greatest respect to Travellers.  Is there a hands-off approach to lifestyle protestors?  There is an articulate but small group of people keeping this protest going which might be impacting negatively on local businesses.  Perhaps it is an issue to which we should turn our attention.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator Bacik&rsquo;s comments on the prayer.  We did some good work at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP.  It is about trying to find a way in which all traditions can be valued.  As I have said before, the people who see themselves as representing the new Ireland must not trample on those who they see as representing the old Ireland.  The faith traditions are very important as they contribute so much to social solidarity.  It is important they are fully respected even while we respect other viewpoints.</P>
        <P>On the subject of religious toleration, it is Christians who are the most persecuted minority in the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, gay people are the most persecuted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The 20th century was probably as bloody as all other centuries put together.  I hope all Members will have a received a note that the archbishop of Orissa, John Barwa, will give a briefing tomorrow at 12.15 p.m. in Leinster House about the persecution of Christians, particularly in his area, one of the poorest states in India.  At a time when we are talking about human rights in China, this is an opportunity to get up close and develop our awareness of the suffering of our fellow brothers and sisters in the world, not just Christians but those in our common humanity.  There are people suffering in the world and it is important we face our challenges that we would not ignore their plight.  We have a good opportunity tomorrow to hear at first hand some of what people in the world are going through.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has brought forward proposals on sick pay arrangements.  While the Government does not create jobs, it is there to create the environment for job creation.  It is employers who create jobs.  I believe the Minister&rsquo;s policy on sick pay is flying in the face of employers not only trying to maintain jobs, but also creating new jobs.  It is fundamentally an aggressor to the policy of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to come before the House to discuss her policy and proposals on sick pay?</P><Col N="7"/>

	<P>I second Senator Mac Conghail&rsquo;s proposal on the change, if any, to the prayer at the start of business.  I understand there will be 30 seconds of silent reflection but the prayer is staying intact, thanks be to God.  There is no change to the prayer really so there is nothing to debate but I will second Senator Mac Conghail&rsquo;s proposal.</P>

	<P>Mr. Se&aacute;n Cottrell of the Irish Primary Principals Network said that robbing Peter to pay Paul was the philosophy behind last night&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, on disadvantaged schools.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this particular issue?  I welcome the fact the Minister will retain 235 teachers in the DEIS scheme.  However, the line is that &euro;5 will be taken off the capitation grant per pupil to all national schools on top of an already &euro;7 per head reduction from &euro;190 to &euro;183.  This means from January it stands at &euro;178 per pupil.  That is quite a reduction when one considers the grant was originally over &euro;200, particularly when costs are rising.  For instance, an average school could use between &euro;7,000 and &euro;10,000 in heating oil every year with a VAT charge of 13.5% on it that goes back to the Government.  I accept it depends on school size, the use of the heating system and how efficient it is.  On top of this, other costs are incurred such as electricity, refuse collection and maintenance which will not be covered by the reduction in the capitation grant proposed in the budget.</P>

	<P>That is such a serious matter that this House should have it investigated. I wish to raise adoption rights.  Such rights in this country lag far behind those of adoptees in England, Scotland and Wales to mention just our nearest neighbours.  We are still governed under the 1952 Act, even though an Adoption Act was introduced in 2010 but it did not address rights.  In terms of search and reunion, when people seek their birth parents they can only retrieve non-identifying information from the social work agency at which they were adopted but they are not given automatic rights to their birth certificate.  They are given these rights in <Col N="9"/>England and Wales and in Northern Ireland since 1975.

	<P>I am sorry.  I beg Senator Leyden&rsquo;s pardon.  I echo what Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said on the upsetting state of the children&rsquo;s emergency health service.  The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine said this morning that children are spending more than 12 hours on trolleys.  Let us stop for a moment to contemplate the situation.  Most of us have children.  What is more important than looking after the health of our children in this country?  To echo Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, the number of children remaining on trolleys has increased by 700% in three years.  It is worrying that, according to the association, the rate of children leaving hospital without being seen has increased.  The Children&rsquo;s University Hospital in Temple Street is also reporting that the overcrowding situation has significantly worsened.  I am aware that the new children&rsquo;s hospital will help to ease overcrowding but we need a plan in the short term to deal with this serious situation.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on children&rsquo;s services, especially health services, given the worrying trend of overcrowding.</P>
        <P>To return to the Jack &amp; Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation charity, in October I raised the issue of trying to get &euro;240 a week for a child in Tipperary to be nursed at home.  Now we seem to have a problem nursing children in hospitals.  We cannot seem to nurse children at home, which is far better value than nursing them in hospitals.  We should reflect on what we are doing if we cannot look after the sick children in this country.</P>

	<P>During the recent presidential election campaign several different views were put forward on what it means to be Irish and what vision we have for the Republic.  I congratulate Senator Norris on the inclusive views he put forward at that time and also President Higgins.  I have been paying attention to what the President has been saying since, and his appointment of Ms Sally Mulready to the Council of State in January is very much to be welcomed.  She is the only member who lives outside the State.  She is best known for her work among the Irish community in London.  It was a wonderfully inclusive gesture by President Higgins.  The President has a vision which is characterised by inclusivity which made me think recently about what our vision of this country should be.  It is all the more important as we <Col N="10"/>approach a series of centenaries which have defined what we are today.  President Higgins&rsquo;s views are a long way from the narrow nationalism that has become associated with republicanism in this country.  One example of what I mean occurred during the Queen&rsquo;s recent visit.  I noticed a tiny number of protesters as I was driving along the road.  Some of them were carrying the national flag and were using it as a symbol of a very narrow view.  I looked on in amazement as they finished their protest because as they walked away they trailed the flag behind them on the ground.  It struck me that such a level of casual carelessness with a national symbol would never happen in any other country.  It would be inconceivable to see an American or someone from the United Kingdom trailing their flag behind them on the ground.  The challenging nature of what it means to be Irish was summed up yesterday by a Catholic priest from Northern Ireland whom I heard on the radio.  He stated that it was his opinion that most of his parishioners would not wish to be part of a united Ireland.  I ask the Leader to consider devoting time in the Chamber to a full debate on what it means to be Irish in the 21st century, in particular as we approach a number of important centenaries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to follow on from what Senator Keane said.  It was important news about the banks.  The financial situation is a matter on which I have consistently sought debates.  Today, I seek that one aspect of the matter should be debated, namely, the question of eviction.  I did not think I would live long enough in this country to see eviction being reintroduced.  I send my congratulations to the homeland of my ancestors, County Laois, where in Mountrath, a town with which I have strong connections, the Defend Our Homes League prevented an eviction in a civilised way by quoting the article in the Constitution that protects citizens in their homes.  Attempts were being made to evict people, ultimately in the interests of German and French banks.  As Senator Keane pointed out, there was corruption in the advice received, if the radio reports are true, that should abrogate the situation.  The deal should be off the table.  We should not have to pay another single penny if the deal was corruptly done because there was a conflict of interests.  That is what I will call for, but before that, there should never be eviction in this country.  I am proud to have an ancestral connection with County Laois, which is the homeland of James Fintan Lalor.  I wonder what he would think if he knew that in 2012 we were using the instruments of the State to try to get evictions.  It was a very civilised event.  The neighbours and people from the surrounding area collected together to assist their distressed neighbour.  The Garda and the sheriff also behaved well because they departed when they were confronted with the peaceful protest and the article of the Constitution was read out to them.  We have enough of evictions in this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am concerned with the information Senator Keane has put before the House today.  However, I am also deeply concerned that some of the accountancy firms that audited and signed off on the books and accounts of institutions such as Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society are still in business today and still advising central banks and other financial institutions.  Something must be done.  I question whether any of them has ever been held accountable for some of their work.  I am doing research on it at the moment and I will revert accordingly.</P>
      
	<P Just="Left">I support the invitation to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to come to the House in the near future to discuss privatisation.  Certain companies could easily be privatised.  The Government will learn the lessons of the botched privatisations that have taken place in the past.  What happened with Eircom was a national disgrace.  Not alone did <Col N="11"/>we sell what was on the silver tray, but we sold the silver tray as well.  I have no problem selling what is on the silver tray because it can be created again but a problem arises when one sells the tray itself.  If we had the network Eircom and previously Telecom Eireann had established around the country, every single house would have high-speed broadband.  Unfortunately, not alone did we get rid of the company, we got rid of the infrastructure as well.  I assure all parties that the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are no longer economically independent.  However, the infrastructure will not be sold.  At the Leader&rsquo;s discretion, could he arrange for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to attend the House in the coming weeks to clarify for the doubting Thomases that this is what will happen?</P>

T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-dheacair sin a dh&eacute;anamh nuair a fheicimid an bealach a rinneadh an cinneadh sin agus beidh m&eacute; ag iarraidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta leis an Aire l&aacute;ithreach le himpleachta&iacute; an chinnidh sin a phl&eacute;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was hoping to be able to praise the Minister for the change in respect of DEIS schools, but it would be difficult to do so, given the double-edged decision taken.  His decision is a double whammy for rural schools.  Not only does it favour urban schools &mdash; it is obvious that he has rolled over in the face of the urban lobby within the Labour Party &mdash; but it places an extra burden on rural schools that have already been hit by cutbacks in teacher numbers.  The capitation grant to each is being reduced.  I am sick to the back teeth of attending public meetings with Government representatives who are in tears over the cutbacks being implemented by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, yet who vote for those same cutbacks in the Houses.  Why has the Minister not included rural DEIS schools in his decision?  Why are urban DEIS schools to be allowed more teachers &mdash; they need them and the numbers there should never have been decreased &mdash; while rural schools are still to see cutbacks?  Why has the Minister not made a U-turn on one-teacher to four-teacher schools in rural areas?  Why has he decreased the capitation grant? </P>
      
	<P>We want the Minister in the House, not the Minister of State.  I call for an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that we should ask the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to attend the House today.

At the risk of sounding trite, there is a wonderful line in &ldquo;Jurassic Park&rdquo; from the scientist who correctly predicted that it might be unwise to make dinosaurs.  When they saw the dinosaurs eating the people who believed it was a good idea to make them, he stated: &ldquo;I hate being right all the time.&rdquo;  This is how I feel about the health service at times because, like a number of others, I pointed out three or four years ago that the core deficiencies in the service were related to staffing and resources.  When a system has the lowest number of doctors, a shortage of operating theatres and absurdly low numbers of scanners, it will produce waiting lists.  We were told that if we corrected the consultants&rsquo; contracts everything would magically fit into place.  That happened four years ago but the figures to which Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien referred reveal that the number of children awaiting admission in emergency departments have increased by 700% in <Col N="15"/>the past three years, which is roughly the period over which the previous Minister&rsquo;s reforms should have been having an impact.</P>
        <P>This goes to show that it is not possible to put 2lbs of salami in a 1lb bag.  We are being told that if we can make more efficient use of that 1lb bag we will be able put more salami into it.  That is not going to happen.  We have to fundamentally reorganise the way we appoint doctors at all levels and honestly assess the adequacy of current numbers of operating theatres, X-ray departments and beds.  The data released by the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine reveal that the problem arises from the shortage of beds rather than the emergency rooms.  They cannot get the kids out of the emergency departments and into the beds because beds have been closed.</P>
        <P>It would be welcome if the Minister could come into the House to clarify for us his strategic vision.  I have great faith in his plans to reform the system but I ask him to tell us what measures will be taken to relieve this acute shortfall in the short term.</P>

        <P>My colleague, Senator Leyden raised the issue of the schools building programme.  Could savings be made in this area?  It appears to take forever to take a project from start to finish.  Surely in this day and age we should be able to set out a start time and a finish time based on the accepted length of time involved in building an extension or a new school.  This is an area where money could be saved.  Administrative costs appear to be significant and ought to be examined.</P>
        <P>Overall, however, the Minister made the correct decision in the interests of the children of this country and that should be welcomed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business because, while I welcome aspects of the Minister&rsquo;s announcement, it does not go far enough.  It is ridiculous that rural schools have not been adequately dealt with within this framework in terms of achieving &euro;15 million in savings.  As I noted several weeks ago in a debate which gave Members an opportunity to vote on this issue, &euro;15 million is not much compared to the value to this Government of holding rural Ireland together.  As the Sinn F&eacute;in Senator rightly pointed out, the situation of rural schools will now worsen as the cost of saving some of the DEIS positions will be spread over the entirety of the country through cuts to capitation grants.  Notwithstanding the difficulties that every Administration faces in providing funding on an <Col N="16"/>ongoing basis, the current Government will go down in history as the most anti-rural Government.  It is appropriate that the Minister be asked to come to the House to explain his decision because the situation as it stands is simply unacceptable to many parts of rural Ireland, which constitute a large proportion of the country from a geographic and population perspective.</P>
      
	<P>I support Senator Keane&rsquo;s call for a debate on the procurement of advice by the Government and State agencies.  All of the professional advice sought by the Government on an ongoing basis is provided from between the Royal Canal and Grand Canal in Dublin.  How is that competitive?  How does it support small businesses throughout the country?  Can Senators point me to one Department or State agency which procures legal services from a firm in Athlone or accountancy services from a firm in Donegal?  There is none.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I do.  I call for a debate on procurement because it has come to my attention that some of the tenders for professional advice to State agencies are written specifically for the winning applicant.  The parameters are so narrow that they exclude the vast majority of people who provide these services, with the exception of the chosen few firmly embedded within the gin and tonic belt in Dublin 2 and 4.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Sheahan, for a debate with the Minister for Social Protection on the statutory sick pay scheme.  There is no doubt that the scheme as it is currently envisaged will damage small businesses.  I would like to widen this debate on sick pay to include the schemes that are in operation throughout the public service.  There are opportunities to make significant savings and I hope the Minister will give us an opportunity to contribute to a wider debate.  Everything we say and do in this House has to be pro-business and we must do everything possible to create jobs.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Mullen that we should take on board the concerns expressed by business people who are impacted by Occupy Dame Street and Occupy encampments in other towns.  If people are breaking the law, why are they being tolerated?  Why is a small handful of people being treated differently from others who might break the law?  We have to consider the impact on tourism and jobs.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the relevant Minister on the Occupy situation so that we can analyse it and decide what needs to be done to ensure the law of this land is upheld by all its citizens and that no section is treated less favourably than others.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Taoiseach or the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Last month the European Commission announced in a very public way that it intended to send an action team to Ireland to discuss the issue of youth unemployment.  Yesterday this team came and went without any public consultation or discourse with public stakeholders.  As soon as Commissioner Barroso announced the initiative, I wrote to him and to the Department of the Taoiseach to seek a meeting so that I could inform the process by sharing my views with the action team.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, Commissioner Maros Setcovic stated that 7.5 million young people across the EU are not in employment, education or training.  In this State more than 80,000 people under the age of 25 are unemployed and 12 people will emigrate from each of the electoral divisions of the State this year.</P><Col N="17"/>
      <P>The refusal by the Department of the Taoiseach to facilitate even a brief discussion on what the Commission described as a serious challenge that can only be properly addressed if all stakeholders, including political parties like Sinn F&eacute;in, play an active role despite my having requested a meeting well in advance of the team&rsquo;s arrival in Ireland raises serious doubts about whether this was anything more than a public relations stunt.  Young people are only mentioned once in over 100 pages in the jobs plan announced last week.  We need to stop dealing in press releases and get serious on the issue of youth unemployment.  The Taoiseach, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach or the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation should come into this House to discuss this issue properly because we cannot continue to pay lip-service to it.  It is a serious issue that affects every community and family in this State.  I ask the Leader in the nicest possible terms to facilitate a debate on it at the earliest opportunity.</P>

        <P>One of the great dilemmas facing the Minister for Education and Skills is that along with the 850,000 pupils in primary and post primary schools, an additional 70,000 children are due to join the system.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and others are aware of the grave problems the Department has in balancing the books as it tries to deal with an increase in the numbers of children.

	<P>I echo the sentiments of Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien on the urgent need for something to be done on the care of children in hospitals.  Yesterday I had to attend the hospital in Crumlin with one of my children and saw at first hand an overcrowded waiting room, which seems to be the norm.  One of the nurses informed me that the hospital now deals with 50 patients in a clinic that five years ago dealt with 30 patients with the same staffing level.  I could not fault the level of care, support and concern.  The staff still had time to talk to the children and I do not know how they do their job.  The room was overcrowded with anxious parents standing and anxious children waiting.  The room was unhealthy in a supposedly medical care building.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the announcement of the PayPal jobs as I did not have the opportunity to do so yesterday.  I am so glad that Dundalk has been chosen for 1,000 jobs.  It is strategically located being 50 miles from both cities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the steps forward in establishing the constitutional convention.  I ask the Leader to ensure the convention is inclusive in its composition and engagement.  The State has a great opportunity to properly engage with as many citizens as possible on the future of the Constitution and the country.  It would be the perfect opportunity to address some of the issues raised by Senator Gilroy regarding what defines us as Irish people and as a nation.  The Constitution is one thing that does that and it provides opportunities.  I also echo the call a previous Senator made.  Seanad reform should and must form part of the constitutional convention.  However, so should D&aacute;il reform.  If the constitutional convention does not deal with the future of the Seanad or the D&aacute;il, it will represent a significant missed opportunity.  I ask the Leader to convey the message to the Taoiseach that my party would support the inclusion of the issue of the future of this House.  We need to ensure that we do not simply abolish the Seanad without considering what should replace its powers and functions.  The place to do that is in the constitutional convention.  If we do not allow the convention to consider the future of the Oireachtas and the D&aacute;il, it will represent a missed opportunity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Moloney&rsquo;s criticisms of how the PCRS is handling medical card applications.  We raised the matter in the House on numerous occasions and the Minister has intervened.  While he got assurances from the PCRS that everything would run <Col N="19"/>smoothly in the future, that is not the evidence on the ground.  I often help people complete applications for medical cards and I know that if they are not fully correct when they are submitted, there will be a problem.  Therefore I ensure they are completed fully correct.  Even though I ensure that every document in the file is stapled together and sent off in one envelope, the applicants are getting calls a week later telling them that something is missing, when I know that is not the case.  That forces me and other Oireachtas Members involved to photocopy complete files in order to prove that the information is with the file as submitted.  Either somebody is sabotaging files or there is gross incompetence in the way the PCRS does its business.</P>
        <P>I call on the Leader to follow up on a recommendation made by a fellow Senator that a delegation from this House should go to the PCRS offices to see how it does its business.  We need to understand what is going wrong.  I know another Oireachtas committee is planning to do that and I would like to be part of that if the Leader could allow it to happen.  I know Senator Moloney would also like to do likewise.</P>

It will not be part of the constitutional convention. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mac Conghail proposed an amendment to the Order of Business on Standing Order 18.

I have no problem whatsoever holding a <Col N="20"/>debate on it and I will order it for tomorrow immediately after the final item on the agenda.  When I organise the debate I hope there will be sufficient Members present.  On numerous occasions I have heard a clamour from many sides of the House from Members seeking debates, especially on health matters, but subsequently there were insufficient Members available.  Only eight or ten Members were in the Chamber following a call by 20 or 30 Members for debates on various subjects.  Let us be fair about it.  It is all very well shouting on the Order of Business but some Members vanish after asking a question and they are not here when the Minister comes to the House.  Let us play ball properly.  When Members call for debates, let them be here when the debate is granted.  We will have a debate on the issue raised tomorrow.</P>

This matter was discussed at length during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill while the Minister for Social Protection was here after Christmas.  The Minister hosted a consultation on the issue of statutory sick leave on Monday last.  The forum heard from speakers from the United Kingdom and the OECD.  I realise the response from IBEC and ISME has been negative, claiming that such a move would cost jobs and run counter to Government strategy on job creation.  No decision has been made by Government on the issue.  If there is a need for the Minister to come to the House to discuss it again we will have her in the House.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, will be here too and the matter can be raised with him when he is discussing the jobs plan on 6 March.  I assure the House that there will be ample opportunities for Members to raise the issue with both Ministers. </P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might be able to clarify a concern I would like to raise about section 6.  This section provides that the consent of the HSE must be acquired when someone requests to move to another location.  I am concerned that the absence of a right of appeal in these circumstances means judicial review is the only avenue that is open to a person who does not receive the consent of the HSE.  Perhaps provision has been made in an existing Act to deal with this issue, which has come to my attention.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for always making himself available to this House.  Given the busy nature of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, it is welcome that the senior Minister has always done so.  Legislation such as this, the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill and others are less of a priority in the public mind and I thank the Minister for attending the Chamber on these matters.  While we all support the Bill, I ask the Minister to monitor a number of points.  I refer to the out-of-hours coverage that will be available and the viability of practices.  There is an expectation that there will be a flood from the Beara Peninsula into Cork city rather than ensuring adequate services are made available.  I refer to coverage in less popular locations.</P>
        <P>Following the debate on Second Stage, I pointed out the concern about GPs in certain parts of the country where there is a casualty unit nearby and that there is a tendency to refer patients to casualty departments.  I mentioned how GPs might like to play golf on a Wednesday afternoon.  <i>The Medical Independent</i>, which I must praise for its monitoring of debate in the Seanad, has written an article specifically highlighting the negative points made in the debate about certain GPs not making themselves available to the extent that they might.  I have clarified the point on its website and no offence was intended to the hard-working GPs throughout the country.  The vast majority make themselves available, however true my point is about some who do not.  We should monitor the situation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="25"/>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for dealing with this, which is an important development.  I always wondered why this issue was never challenged in the courts over the past ten or 15 years.  This is welcome and it opens up an opportunity for young, trained people to begin a career where they can make a contribution.  It is important to give recognition to the contribution medical practitioners make in their local community.  Sometimes we tend to ignore their contribution, whether helping out the local rugby club or a GAA club or giving leadership in their communities.  They have been very good at doing this and we should give recognition to their efforts.</P>
        <P>I raised a number of concerns with the Minister about people in the training process and the perception of a small minority of them that GPs work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday and that coverage at weekends is someone else&rsquo;s problem.  The intention and ambition of the vast bulk of people is to serve and work for their patients.  A service should be available seven days a week and my colleague, Senator MacSharry, referred to coverage out of hours.</P>
        <P>It is also necessary to ensure there is not a watering down of the primary care system, which is important.  Too many people attend accident and emergency units when many issues could be dealt with at a local level.  GPs have the competence to deal with many of the issues that end up in accident and emergency units.  We need to give that assistance to the hospital service to ensure we are not clogging up an already overburdened facility.  The number of young people who have contacted us looking for the Bill to be passed at an early date is an indication of the enthusiasm of those who want to provide a service.  They have the qualifications and experience and this Bill allows them to provide the service.  I thank the Minister for bringing this forward and dealing with it in an timely fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator MacSharry, I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has always been amenable to the House and has been in the Chamber more often than I have.  I welcome the Bill and the fact that it opens up competition, which will hopefully reduce prices.  GPs charge for writing letters to help someone to get a medical card when that person is probably living below poverty guidelines.  Charging &euro;50 to write a letter to help achieve this should be outlawed.  A similar case involves doctors&rsquo; certificates to get disability benefit.</P>
        <P>Regarding the out-of-hours service, with more GPs coming on stream there may be an opportunity to consider services such as WestDoc because people have not bought into it and it does not work.  Some of the newer, younger GPs may be willing to be on call at weekends and perhaps it will revert to the better service that it was historically.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  We said everything on this matter on the last day and the warmth of the support for the Minister in this measure is reflected by everyone.  As Senator Burke said, the competition aspect of what we did previously must have been open to challenge.  This measure will allow young, enthusiastic new doctors to practise and it may be just what the health service needs.  To achieve universal support for the measures should embolden the Minister on his reform agenda.  We look forward to hearing more about that and supporting him.  If we get the new enthusiastic GP service, it affords the opportunity to move people to GPs from outpatient departments, which costs several multiples of a GP visit even though they are financed differently.  Over 90% of outpatients are not admitted to hospital and I wonder if they could have gone to a GP.  The Minister referred to group practice GPs, where specialties can be split between the practitioners.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm&rsquo;s book suggests pressure to equip 3,000 beds should be resisted until we get reforms.  Do we really need them and is there too much hospitalisation, which costs thousands of euro every night?  We know this from the hotel costs from health insurance bills.  There is a real chance to reconfigure the health service, starting today, with less hospitalisation, fewer <Col N="26"/>outpatients and more being done in GP surgeries.  Senator MacSharry mentioned the data on de-skilling GPs, to which the Minister referred.  If GPs operate too close to a major hospital, they may become de-skilled by referring many people to that hospital.  Perhaps this should be considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister for the booklet Health in Ireland: Key Trends 2011, which he circulated among us.  It contains facts that get lost in the current debate.  While there are now cutbacks because of the financial difficulties, the number of medical and dental staff has increased by 20.2% in the past decade.  There are 44% more consultants in the system and 48% more GP agreements.  Page 57 of the booklet shows that, with expenditure of 11.4% of gross national income, Ireland does not underspend on the health service.  Our expenditure in this regard is nearly two percentage points greater than that of the United Kingdom.  The idea that the health service has been starved by evil people in the Departments of Finance or Health is incorrect.  We must circulate the facts.  The number of staff has been doubled since the 1980s, from 55,000 to 110,000, and we have invested resources.  The economic recession affords the Minister the opportunity to carry out reforms that should probably have been carried out already.  We have certainly fired a vast amount of money at the health service, and reforms such as the one in question are most welcome.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about hospital stays and the Milliman index result that Ireland&rsquo;s average stay is over ten days.  Best international practice would require a reduction to 3.7 days.  As the Minister stated on the last occasion, there is intervention with the VHI to address the problem.  Keeping people in hospital for too long, at a cost of &euro;1,000 per night, is not only blocking beds but also costing the economy vast sums.</P>
        <P>I join all the other Senators in stating reforms such as this one contribute to making the professions more competitive and effective as the country attempts to trade itself out of its economic difficulties.  The Minister&rsquo;s colleague introduced legislation of a similar kind to open up the veterinary field yesterday.  He received the same ready reception in supporting the House.  I thank the Minister for Health.  The kinds of reforms on which he is working are very important because we have spent considerable money in this area, although the public believes we have not.  Sometimes it is necessary to put the facts before the public because the producers are pretty effective at lobbying.  Sometimes what they say is not supported by the facts, including the fact that a substantial number of extra staff were recruited over the past decade.  The data are in Health in Ireland: Key Trends 2011.  Those recruited have not all been bureaucrats as many others have been recruited also, even though there may be too many bureaucrats.  The system needs to be streamlined.</P>
        <P>I would like to have competitive health insurance extracting costs from the hospital system.  As the model is refocused, perhaps hospitals should be allowed to compete against other hospitals, rather than operate through the large health boards we built in the past.  This might improve the overall efficiency of the system.  This measure is a very good start and I support the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to respond and reiterate my gratitude to all the parties in both Houses for their support for this Bill.  I made it very clear that although this is a requirement of the troika, it is also a measure to which I was utterly committed when in opposition.  It is not right that properly qualified GPs are not allowed to treat public patients.  I am delighted to bring that day to an end.</P>
        <P>Let me comment on some of the matters raised.  I am concerned about the out-of-hours service.  Generally, it is a very important aspect of GPs&rsquo; work.  If GPs were to abandon it, they <Col N="27"/>would diminish themselves considerably.  Many GPs are aware of this.  I say this with the caveat that it is not safe to have doctors working night and day.  We can address that issue.</P>
        <P>I share Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s concern that the Bill could cause a movement towards urban areas, thereby stripping rural areas of service.  I have been very careful in the Bill to ensure that one cannot relocate without permission from the HSE.  This will avoid the problem.  From a policy perspective, we are entitled to support GPs, with additional measures, through grants for nursing, etc., in areas where we want them, be they urban areas such as Tallaght, or certain sections of Fettercairn which have not had a service for quite some time, or rural areas.  We do not want the legislation to lead to the establishment of five new GP practices on Grafton Street.  So be it if this happens but we will not support them.</P>
        <P>I raised the tendency to refer patients to emergency departments in the past.  I am concerned about the de-skilling that takes place when a large hospital is built in a general practitioner&rsquo;s area.  Equally, I am concerned that circumstances could arise in which locums, in particular, could be inclined to refer patients to hospital for suturing and other work that they should be well qualified to do themselves.</P>
        <P>GPs are hard working.  They see in excess of 100,000 patients every day whereas the emergency departments see approximately 3,500.  They comprise a crucial part of the health service, as it stands, and an integral part of the reform of the health service as we put more work in their direction.  GPs will not have to work harder but will have to work in a different, smarter way.  They will have to make more use of their practice nurses, primary care teams, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, counsellors and others.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of the China Business News delegates and Deputy Flanagan, who is accompanying them.</P>
        <P>The relationships between GPs and their patients last for decades, and this represents a great strength.  GPs know their patients so well and have an understanding of them, and patients understand their GPs also because they choose the GP they like.  There is not a great difference in ability among GPs but a difference in personality.  Some people find different personalities easier to get on with than others.  If one suffers from depression or another mental illness, there is nothing worse than having to outline one&rsquo;s whole history again to a stranger.  It is very comforting to return to the person who knows one&rsquo;s history, physical and mental.  This is a real strength of general practice that avoids much unnecessary testing.</P>
        <P>The visit over the weekend of Vice President Xi Jinping of China has strengthened our relationship with China.  This will be a very beneficial relationship.  I very much look forward to our Governments improving the living conditions, health services and economic opportunities of both our peoples.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke was concerned about out-of-hours arrangements also.  I have covered this but would like to elaborate on it.  I am concerned about the sort of work that is being done and the sort of work being referred to hospitals.  We need tighter protocols in respect of this and to audit constantly so there will be no slippage.</P>
        <P>A HSE survey indicates 90% of the population has access to out-of-hours GP services in 14 centres nationally.  Over 2,000 GPs provide services in the co-operatives.  They dealt with 931,305 calls in 2009 and 924,000 in 2010.  There were 859,778 contacts with GP out-of-hours services up to the end of November 2011.  The pertinent figure in this regard is 64,000, which represents an increase of 8% on the figure for the same period last year.  People are using the service and it is valuable, but that is not to say it cannot be improved.  The breakdown of contracts with the GP out-of-hours service is: 60% GP treatment centres, 29% triage, 10% home visits, and 1% other.  Attendance at a treatment centre would usually follow the initial telephone triage.  These are not walk-in centres but one can pick up the phone if one is con<Col N="28"/>cerned and talk to a nurse or doctor who will offer advice or indicate that a person should come in to see the doctor, or that a person might even need a house call.  Funding of &euro;89 million was provided for this service, which represents value for money.  If that service was not there our emergency services simply could not cope.</P>
        <P>The HSE has carried out a national review which was published in 2010.  There is a working group comprising the HSE, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Association of General Practitioners which will continue to implement that review&rsquo;s recommendations.  We should have another audit of what is happening out of hours, particularly between midnight and 8 a.m. as regards what is, or is not, being referred.</P>
        <P>Senator John Kelly mentioned charging for letters and I can certainly examine that matter in terms of a <i>pro forma</i> system.  From my own experience, however, I know that people can be sent by welfare officers, councillors and TDs to visit their GPs for letters.  They might be sent back to get a second letter because &ldquo;two are better than one&rdquo;.  This is time consuming, however.  Solicitors charge hefty fees for letters so let us be reasonable about this.  If the system did not encourage people to seek GPs&rsquo; letters for various issues perhaps that charge situation could be clarified.  The social welfare system pays for social welfare certificates, in a separate contact to GPs, so the issue should not really arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Younger GPs who have now come into the system will be willing to work.  Let us call it like it is.  I know from my own time &mdash; I think Senators will acknowledge this &mdash; that when one is in the nest-building phase of one&rsquo;s life, one is prepared to work harder and longer to get money together for a mortgage and raise a family.  As one gets older and less able to work those long hours, it is only right and proper that one should not have to do so.  I am not saying that younger people should have to do it either, but the opportunity is there for them.  Given their energy, they are often prepared to do it.  This is where having a good system of new primary care centres comes into play.  As I said before, GPs should invest in them where possible.  Many people will want to keep their centres open as long as possible, from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., to get a return on the investment they have made in the building.  If that happens, it will take pressure off a lot of other services.</P>
        <P>I much prefer the carrot to the stick, so we are working on a fund to allow for the roll-out of primary care centres.  We have reckoned that around 200 might be necessary but we are refining that work to see what size these centres should be.  We also want to see a roll-out of primary care teams.  These would be real teams, rather than teams in name only where somebody receives a letter asking if they are interested and, having accepted that they are interested, they are suddenly part of a team and this is expected to constitute a functioning entity.  It certainly does not.  I said that we would be transparent around these matters and we will be.  We are therefore determined to roll out the centres and teams.  I am working hard, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, to achieve this.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett raised the issue of expenditure.  We do spend as much now, and sometimes a bit more, than others.  For a long time, however, we underspent and must now catch up.  Even when we were spending we misspent, unfortunately, and did not get what we should have received for our money.  We now have a great opportunity to address this matter and tackle it.  We are 100% committed to doing so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree that VHI must address its cost base, in terms of its own administration as well as what it pays hospitals, consultants and GPs for services rendered.</P>
        <P>I am pleased with the special delivery unit.  Under the stewardship of Dr. Martin Connor, it has achieved remarkable things when one considers that for 14 years we threw money at the system and all people could do at the end of the day was throw their hands up in exasperation <Col N="29"/>as the trolley count got bigger.  I want to remind the House and the public that in January 2011 we saw 560 people on trolleys, and I said we would never see that again.  The special delivery unit has been hugely influential in achieving that.  Yesterday, we had serious pressure on the system due to flu and other reasons.  At 4.30 p.m. or 5 p.m. yesterday, it looked like we might have up to 500 people on trolleys today if we did not take action.  In the past, we would not have had the information because they did not count trolleys at 4 p.m. like we do, and the system was unable to respond.  I am happy to say, however, that across the system last night it did respond so that this morning there were fewer than 300 people on trolleys in our hospitals.  I think that is worth noting.  I want to record my gratitude to those who work in the special delivery unit, clinical programmes and on the front line across the system who made this possible, as well as the management who co-operated and supported those actions last night.  It is always a frightening experience to be admitted to hospital for care, but they have made it less arduous for those availing of our health services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  We are in talks with the gentleman who has raised that concern.  I did not hear his interview myself but I believe it was reasonable.  We will look at that matter also.  The special delivery unit has been engaged mainly with the adult service but Mr. Gerry Dwyer, who is in charge of the three paediatric hospitals, is engaging with Dr. Eoin O&rsquo;Sullivan.  I look forward to hearing the outcome of those discussions and what action we might have to take.  I have always said that we would commit to looking after the most vulnerable.  It is a measure of any civilised society and a compassionate government that the most vulnerable will be cared for, even when we are under such financial pressure.  That is why we are seeking to build the national paediatric hospital to improve outcomes for our children.  That is also why we will build a central mental hospital to look after those with serious mental health issues.  We are focused on ensuring that we have the capital programme in place to extend radiation oncology across the country for those who have the misfortune to develop cancer, which we know will become more prevalent as our population ages.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach and other Senators for their positive support for the Bill, as well as their many constructive comments and suggestions.  Today we have done a good job for future generations by ensuring that we will have the maximum number of GPs available, and that there will be no obstruction for those who wish to serve their communities as GPs in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for the invitation to speak on the important subject of media standards.  It is a subject that, I am sure, is close to the heart of not just those in the public eye but of all citizens interested in the quality of public debate and the health of our democracy.  Any modern <Col N="30"/>democratic society needs an active, diverse and robust media sector &mdash; it is a fundamental component of civil society.  It holds a critical role in ensuring that all of those in authority are held to account, that actions are reported and interrogated, that inaction is queried, that the established order of things is questioned and that all in society can expect to have their situation reported, regardless of their position.  This is what media does, or at least is supposed to do.  It informs, investigates and analyses all that goes on around us.  Without it, democracy or the modern state cannot function properly.  It is as simple as that.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, we have been lucky to have just such a broad and diverse media presence, characterised by some outstanding journalists and editorial staff, across a range of publications and broadcasters.  In general, they have done a good job, some recent oversights, economic and otherwise, notwithstanding.  The Constitution reflects the importance of the media in the lives of the citizen and the State.  They are referred to in the Constitution as &ldquo;organs of public opinion&rdquo; and &ldquo;rightful liberty of expression&rdquo; is constitutionally guaranteed.  That guarantee quite properly appears in the Constitution in the context of the personal rights of the citizen rather than the corporate rights of the media, because any diminution of these freedoms impacts on the right of citizens to receive and impart information and opinions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the State, we have an additional set of concerns about media that are worthy of note also.  As a small nation, which has operated within several interlocking spheres of media influence for many years, we are subject to global market forces in a way that other countries are not, a matter complicated by the fact that we share a language with two of the world&rsquo;s largest media players.  Irish media compete across print, broadcast and on-line spaces, with some of the world&rsquo;s largest and best funded media operators, and compete not just for audience share, but for advertising revenue also.</P>
        <P>We have successfully maintained a distinctive national voice in media, but technological and economic changes are making it increasingly necessary to consider how to ensure that we have players of sufficient scale to be able to compete on an increasingly globalised playing field.</P>
        <P>Media then is an integral part of our democracy.  Any diminution in the ability and status of media to report with absolute freedom, and from a number of perspectives, is a loss to everyone in society.  However, let us not delude ourselves, media freedom, objectivity or impartiality is not a given.  It cannot simply be assumed to exist at all times.  Critically, the maintenance of high standards in journalism, including editorial policy, is an oft maligned but still critical element of how media delivers on its functions.  It is entirely in society&rsquo;s interest that journalists are fair, honest, scrupulous and thorough, and devoid of commercial or personal motivations.  These standards can be, and sometimes are, challenged by a range of factors.  These range from outright editorial decision making to an over-concentration of ownership or control, and even by attempts to curry favour with the public, right through to old fashioned resource constraints.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Stepping back for one moment, it is important to recognise that it has never been easy to balance the commercial needs of companies with the higher minded goals of serving the needs of a society or democracy.  History is littered with examples of media owners who have used their companies for commercial, personal or political gain and, on a more mundane level, exercising editorial balance in a complex and rapidly changing world is not a simple matter.  Regardless of how much we might like to criticise media outlets, and I am sure we all do from time to time, meeting the standards we require of journalists today while also delivering interesting and insightful content is no easy matter and balance, as ever, remains a partially subjective thing.  One person&rsquo;s &ldquo;shameless exhibition of low standards in reporting&rdquo; is another person&rsquo;s idea of a good story.</P><Col N="31"/>
        <P Just="Left">That is not to say that journalists always abide by the rules or even the law.  The type of activity that the Leveson inquiry in the UK has uncovered is shocking.  We simply do not know whether or to what extent such behaviour may have been imitated in this jurisdiction.  Plainly, hacking telephone messages is a massive intrusion of privacy of the sort that requires some form of legislative redress.  However, despite the sometimes outraged calls from some quarters, press governance or regulation in democracies has to be approached with extreme care.  In democracies, freedom of the press is often taken for granted but it has to lie at the very heart of everything we do.  The political system and the media must remain as separate as possible for the good of both.  That is not to say that the political system cannot legislate for defamation or fill a gap in the market for the public good, when a pressing need arises.  The general rule applies, however.  We remember that detailed plans for a privacy Bill were put on hold to see how self-regulation under a voluntary Press Council might succeed in policing standards of media behaviour.  I believe, so far, this experiment has been successful.</P>
        
        <P>The example of the print media in Ireland is an interesting one.  The Press Council, an independent body drawn from and run by the print media industry, is facilitated by legislation in that members are granted some additional protections under defamation law.  As a model, this seems to have worked quite well.  That is not to say that it is perfect but so far it seems to have achieved a remarkable balance between allowing the press the freedom to operate while simultaneously implementing a code of practice and facilitating the extension of some additional protections under the Defamation Act.  The Press Council is evaluating its own effectiveness and keeping a close eye on developments elsewhere with a view to how it might be optimised to future challenges.  I had the opportunity recently of attending a seminar by the Press Council and I am sure the Government will look at its suggestions with interest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The media are not, of course, beyond criticism.  Our society has not toppled so many who exalted themselves above others in church and State to create a new and unaccountable elite.  There is no doubt but that the media are voracious for information but sometimes little enough concerned with quality control.  There are two trends in this.</P>
        <P>One can probably be traced back to the glamour days that surrounded the Kennedys in the White House, the American Camelot.  Camelot included not just President Kennedy, but also his wife and children.  It was about glamour, fashion and even interior design.  The people were presented with, voted for and greedily consumed a heady mix of youth, style and substance.  Politicians everywhere and ever since have sought to replicate the mix.</P>
        <P>From a politician&rsquo;s point of view, to be seen to be out and about is an inevitable part of the job.  Unless we are seen in a hard hat at a construction site, using a shovel or a trowel at a foundation-laying or topping-off ceremony, in a white coat in a hi-tech laboratory or wielding a scissors at an opening, then it seems to the media-consuming public that we have not bothered to turn up for work at all.</P>
        <P>While most countries, and most politicians, can never hope to re-create the glamour of the Kennedys, the more insidious trend is the promotion in sections of our media of a politics of anti-politics.  By this I mean a contemptuous denigration and rejection of all politics.  This approach feeds on understandable frustration, discontent and, nowadays, genuine fear on the part of the electorate.  It operated, however, just as strongly in the boom-time years.</P>
        <P>The practitioners, as often commentators as genuine news reporters, have as their chief weapon an unyielding cynicism.  Some elements of the bar stool commentariat do not have to analyse the issues because they look down on their readers and presume they would not understand them.  Luckily enough, they do not have to bother understanding the issues themselves.  Perhaps it is true such commentary helps sell newspapers.  However, the result is destructive both of politics and of journalism.</P><Col N="32"/>
        <P>Combine these two trends and one has what the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Attorney General, Michael McDowell, has described as &ldquo;the over-weaning power of the media as principals in our politics&rdquo;.  Ironically, perhaps, he raised the issue in his weekly column in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.</P>
        <P>Mr. McDowell continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our media are stridently demanding to determine the political agenda.  They are increasingly trivialising, distorting and denigrating our political process and discourse.  While posing as impartial ringmasters, the media are cracking the whip at hapless aspirants for, and holders of, public office who increasingly oblige as performing seals, tamed lions and pirouetting elephants [God, how I miss him] &mdash; all in the utterly vain hope of assuaging the hand that holds the media whip.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am not sure whether the former Minister&rsquo;s remarks are more critical of the politicians than of the media but there are members in every party who would not disagree with this warning.</P>
        <P>Broadcasting, an area falling into my ministerial responsibilities, has its own challenges.  In common with other European Union member states, we have an independent broadcasting regulator, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which fulfils several functions in respect of the entire broadcast sector in Ireland, or at least that element of it that is based here.  Not alone does this body draw up codes aimed at ensuring broadcasters keep to the standards established in legislation, it also ensures the public service broadcasters meet the targets set for them by dint of the fact that they are in receipt of public funding.  Moreover, it also operates a complaints procedure with more than one high profile complaint currently in train.</P>
        <P>Once upon a time, print and broadcast media was all there was.  The world is changing, however.  I said recently in a speech that anyone with a smart phone and an Internet connection could now be a journalist.  Someone responded by suggesting it took more than that, saying that it took talent, training, practice and years of dedication.  While I probably should have mentioned that good journalists take years to develop and train, I believe the point still stands.  In fact, I probably did not go far enough.  It might take talent and years of professional training to become a good journalist but today anyone with access to some readily available technology can create or capture content, edit it and publish to a global audience.  In effect, anybody can become both journalist and publisher in a matter of seconds.</P>
        <P>The transformative nature of this cannot be overstated.  The barriers &mdash; not the standards &mdash; to entry for journalists, for the media industry as a whole, have been lowered spectacularly over the past decade or so.  The ability to convey information or to express one&rsquo;s opinion on anything has been massively democratised by a complex of technologies made affordable and pervasive by mass production.  Journalism, indeed the media as a whole, is being remade before our eyes.</P>
        <P>The fact this has occurred somewhat gradually over the past decade has meant that we do not always appreciate the full import of what is happening before us.  One of the central tenets of societies in developed western market economies is changing right in front of us.  The model whereby a relatively small number of media organisations selling content, both retail and wholesale, to a mass market is being challenged by a monumental paradigm shift.  Advertising revenue and circulation figures for newspapers have tumbled across the developed world.  Radio and television are holding up for the moment.  One cannot but feel their time will come too and the television market is just too attractive a target to fully escape the Internet revolution.</P><Col N="33"/>
        <P>Moreover, consumers and citizens are faced with a broader choice of media than has ever been the case before.  The Internet allows everyone to talk to everyone else all the time.  In that clamour, new, original and vital voices mix with a universe of arbitrary comment, cant and bile.  All of human life is there.  While some existing media franchises and some dedicated online platforms continue to draw the majority of page views, clearly the ease of publication poses challenges for the maintenance of standards across the board.</P>
        <P>In turn, and leaving aside for the moment the possible consequences of these developments for media plurality, it is important to note that to a degree standards in existing businesses have suffered too &mdash; newspapers that could previously have justified having journalists specialise in a particular area or sector can no longer afford to do so.  The model of a journalist knowing their sector intimately, knowing the market and the key players, knowing the legislation and the technology, is fading rapidly.  Instead, the analysis that one might have expected 20 or even ten years ago, has been replaced, all too often, with broad general pieces or even with mildly reworked press releases.  Copy and paste has a great deal to answer for.</P>
        <P>The implications for policy and Government are severe and complex, not least because of the fact that the situation is evolving quickly, and there are no easy solutions to any of these issues.  Every country is struggling to deal with these challenges, and we are no different.  We do, however have a good start, in that we have a number of strong institutions, such as the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the Press Council, which are in place and are generally accepted.  Moreover, we have a number of models that offer some interesting possibilities for the future.  For example, while the Press Council already has members who publish exclusively online, there remains the possibility of placing this on a more formal basis using a similar dedicated self-regulation model for online news media, allowing those outlets that would welcome adherence to a code of practice to join, and leaving more ephemeral outlets to a different process.</P>
        <P>In addition, the BAI codes are subject to ongoing review, including a draft code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs, which is at present open for public consultation, and which I am sure will receive plenty of interesting and informed comment.  Forthcoming developments in media mergers policy will too, I hope, be able to play a part.</P>
        <P>Maintaining, strengthening and developing standards in media would, in the best of times, be an ongoing issue, but we are not in the best of times &mdash; far from it.  Instead, as in so much else, we are considering these issues in light of almost overwhelming economic and technical changes.  In light of the nature, extent and speed of these challenges, both Government and industry are faced with a profound responsibility to ensure that standards in media are preserved.  The means by which that is to be achieved are far from clear, nationally or internationally, but it falls to all concerned to engage on this subject in a constructive and open manner.  As I have suggested, there are options available to us, complex and difficult though they may be, and I would be happy to hear the views of Members and their suggestions on these important issues.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome the Minister.  I found his contribution though provoking.  He made a great effort to bring balance into it.  That is the experience we all have when talking about the media.  On the one hand we see the great good which they do, because most organisations in this country, whether they are political or otherwise, need the oxygen of the media to get their message across and to look for support.  On <Col N="34"/>the other hand there are times when we are disappointed, in particular if we see individuals being in some way defamed without any substance underlying it.</P>
        <P>I recall many years ago when the late President Childers asked for more good news in the media he was told that good news does not sell newspapers.  There is an element of truth in that but, in fairness, we do not agree with that either because if we look at the way the media covered the visits of the many dignitaries to this country, they did it exceptionally well.  That was the case recently with the visits of the Vice President of China, the Queen and President Obama.  We all felt particularly proud with the way the media dealt with those visits.  There is no doubt either that it has a certain currency for Ireland because those from whence the visitor comes take note of what is being said in the media.  That is the good side of the news and it does help to sell newspapers as well.</P>
        <P>There are some issues which need to be examined, namely, competition and monopolies.  I was always disappointed when I found local newspapers falling into the hands of one single consortium, whether it is the Scottish media group or another group.  People say it does not change the editorial content but I still feel that it is particularly important that we must avoid monopolies.  In the area of competition, because the media has so many diverse elements, we must bear in mind that it also tempts people to become somewhat sensationalist in order to make sure that they have a good balance sheet.  The Minister has referred to that in regard to the commercial side of the media and also to the democratic responsibility.  Any of us who have spoken in this House over the years on the lack of human rights in other countries were always aware that there was not press or media freedom in those countries and we realised how important it was.  When one has it, one must guard it jealously.  We need a continuing partnership and dialogue between the media, people in public life and businesses generally.</P>
        <P>I often felt perhaps a greater effort could have been made when the recession came upon us for the media to try to lift the morale of the people.  I do not say they have not done it on occasion.  They have, and they have done it exceptionally well.  It is very interesting when one sees something of that nature in the media how it becomes a discussion point among people.  Very often it is an antidote to all the pessimism and negative approach.  Therefore, the power of the media is unique.  Some would say for instance that it is akin to wanting to be king-maker.  One issue in particular strikes me, namely, what happened in the famous presidential debate and the news that came on board that particular night and the difference it made in the presidential election.  That should remind us, in particular with the broadcast media, because it is instant and urgent, how quickly a change can take place.  There are many other things I would like to say.  There is a positive and a negative.  We should have an ongoing debate on the subject as that is good for the media and good for society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Thomas Jefferson said that if one expected people to be ignorant and free one expected &ldquo;what never was and never shall be.&rdquo;  At the time he was talking about education.  In today&rsquo;s world he would be talking about the media and the importance of its role in ensuring freedom.  We have seen in the Arab Spring how media, in particular social media, played their role.  We need a free media in order to ensure that democracy in all its flaws is maintained in order that people can be informed of the facts about what is happening not only in their country but throughout the world.  Nowadays, it is difficult to see the balance between the facts and the opinions portrayed by some members of the media.  Facts are portrayed as opinions and <i>vice versa</i>.  Not only are they reporting the agenda but they are driving it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An interesting comment was made by a Nobel Prize winning physicist, Richard Feynman, who wrote a book, <i>The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</i>.  He was talking about experts on television and he said he knew what it was to find something out; therefore he saw how they <Col N="35"/>got their information.  He did not believe that they knew it, as they had not done the necessary work or checks and they had not taken the necessary care.  He was suspicious that they did not know, and that they were intimidating people.  As a Nobel Prize winning physicist he has said that before he even puts pen to paper, he knows how much he needs to know, before he would be able to tell people with certainty that those are the facts but that today economic experts and commentators on all areas of political and social life go on television and portray what they are saying as facts.  Mr. Feynman has questioned how much research they have done to be able to communicate what they say as facts to the public because once people hear it they believe it to be true.</P>

	<P>&ldquo;Standards&rdquo; is a word we use daily, whether it relates to the standard of debate in this House, the standard of service we as elected representatives get from Departments or the standards that the public rightly expect of us.</P>
        <P>Oireachtas committees monitor how we behave, for example, the Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which was established under the Ethics in Public Office Act.  It is right and fitting that we have standards, but they must be of the highest level.  If we allow them to slip, we open ourselves up to debate and scrutiny in terms of why this House should exist.  I do not need to remind Members of either House of several examples of what the late Garret FitzGerald called low standards in high places.  It must be exposed every time it occurs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The chief investigators into such happenings are the media.  The Fourth Estate is recognised as the press or media in its various elements.  It can constitute photographs, journalism, television or radio.  It wields immense power in our everyday lives.  It influences what we think, what we consume, where we live and how we interact with everyone else.</P>
        <P>With this power comes responsibility and the media must follow standards.  They must be kept high.  In fairness, this is the case in Ireland.  This is achieved through regulation by the Office of the Press Ombudsman, the Press Council and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  We have codes of practice for newspapers and magazines, but we also have a sense of what is right and what is wrong.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Who decides the standards that the media follow?  Is it the media barons, for example, Rupert Murdoch and his stable of media outlets, be it Fox News, Sky or <i>The Sun</i>?  Do they influence what commentary appears in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i> or <i>The Irish Times</i>, what story will be covered on radio or how discussions will be handled on television?  We have seen how Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s media empire operated in the UK, in that it may have made inappropriate payments.  The independent Press Complaints Commission is investigating the matter now.  We would not want the same situation to develop in Ireland, but who knows what is occurring at this minute?</P>
        <P>There are those in the media who will look on any review or oversight as interference and as a way for politicians to muzzle or bash the media.  I am not here to bash anyone but I will speak out if anything has been wrongly treated in the media.  No one is above the law or criticism.  We must be honest with ourselves when problems need to be examined andsolutions found.</P>
        <P>What has happened to require us to discuss standards in the media?  The advent of the Internet has changed the ways in which and how quickly events and stories are covered.  A tsunami hits the coast of Japan and, in minutes, a live feed from the disaster zone has been uploaded from a mobile telephone and is being relayed via Twitter, Youtube or Skype.  This is great, but it can also pose risks.  A story can appear on the wires and, before it can be verified, it can be on blogs, online newspapers and online television.</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P Just="Left">The media are under pressure, as we the public have been insatiable in our hunger for the latest news.  We want it now and we want it delivered to us almost before it happens.  We want it to be racy and fast.  Due to the migration to online content and the loss of advertising, financial pressures are dumped on the media, which can result in cutbacks in pay, the quality of programming and the time spent doing proper checks of the veracity of a story&rsquo;s content.  This leads to slipshod journalism and we run the risk of our current affairs programmes getting issues wrong and ending up in court.  There have been classic examples of this lately, with unprofessionalism leading to large pay-outs to victims.  The media needs standards to be maintained at the highest level.  We do not want to see anyone crucified on page 1 and apologised to the following week on page 15.</P>
        <P>During the era of the Celtic tiger a week did not pass without a large glossy feature in every newspaper promoting this or that development.  We seemed to gloat in the way that property prices kept increasing.  There were stories of people camping outside estate agents overnight so that they could be in with a chance of getting houses in phase 1 of developments, knowing that the same houses and flats in phase 2 would be &euro;20,000 more expensive.  Revenues from advertising went though the roof and the party was in full swing.  Taxes were flowing in and a number of individuals in the media who stated that it was all madness and would not last were dismissed as party poopers or merchants of doom.  When the penny finally dropped with the former Government and it realised that the situation could not last forever, we were told through the media that we would have a soft landing.  If this has been a soft landing, I would hate to see a hard one.</P>
        <P>We have gone to the other extreme, in that everything is doom and gloom morning, noon and night.  I am constantly being told by constituents that they no longer want to listen to talk radio or the news or read a newspaper.  Is it any wonder that so many people know how the latest act is doing on &ldquo;X Factor&rdquo; or &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent&rdquo; but no one who is asked can recall a good news story?  The media is a force for good and needs to bear good news.  There are good stories and people want to hear about them.  I am not saying that the media should not question, probe and investigate, but I hope that the pendulum will swing back towards the middle and that a bit of common sense and high standards will prevail again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending the House for this debate, which we called for some time ago.  A broad range of issues under his portfolio must be addressed, including the questions of media ownership and control, the challenges posed by new media and the survival and sustainability of the regional press, which performs an important function in our communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will concentrate on two main points.  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion on these matters.  First, we are entitled to expect certain standards of fairness and impartiality in public service broadcasting.  I am not referring to the usual suspects when people discuss poor standards, red tops or tabloid media.  We depend on the State broadcaster to set the highest standards.  The issue of the licence fee is under review and the Minister discussed broadening it.  At &euro;160 per annum, the fee is not to be scoffed at.  It is more than the household charge and septic tank registration fee, which vexes many people, combined.  We are entitled to ask about what bang we are getting for our buck and to what end the money is being channelled into public service broadcasting.  For example, is it being used to sustain an unsustainable wage model for celebrity presenters at a time when the station is losing up to &euro;30 million per annum?  That figure was mentioned by Senator Walsh, who posed the question of whether it was feasible for anyone in the State broadcaster to earn more than the Taoiseach.  This is a fair question, although I do not wish to pick on anyone.</P><Col N="37"/>
        <P>Last June, the Leader wrote to the director general of RTE regarding its coverage of the Seanad.  We received a letter on 4 July.  Whatever use the licence fee is being put to, it is not being used to cover the Houses.  The director general&rsquo;s letter amounted to giving us the two fingers.  He stated that there was nothing of note or merit worthy of coverage in the Seanad at all that day.  I was taken aback.  Yesterday, the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture met from noon until 8 p.m. and received a number of outstanding, informative and influential submissions from all stakeholders, including State agencies and the public at large, on the issue of the undergrounding the interconnector based on the independent commission report authorised by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.  Many people across the country would have found the deliberations and conduct of the committee interesting and reflective of real concerns in people&rsquo;s lives.  I call on the Minister to support the efforts being made by the Ceann Comhairle and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to urge the State broadcaster to take up this opportunity to run a parliamentary channel similar to BBC Parliament so that the public can see matters of interest being deliberated upon by committees and Houses.  If RTE is not interested, fair enough, but a section of the television licence could be diverted to TG4, which might take up the same opportunity.</P>
        <P>Second, I wish to address the question of the code of practice to which the Minister referred and that the BAI is proposing to introduce under section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 in line with its obligations.  Broadcasting contains a great deal of cronyism, vested interests and conflicts of interest.  One suggestion in the draft proposal is that presenters should not give their own opinions.  This is unwieldy and unrealistic and is tantamount to a thought police.  The world would be a poorer place if presenters did not put their opinions into the public domain as part of a discourse.  However, vested interests pose a clear problem, in that some people are engaged as media coaches and spin doctors to handle the media message behind the scenes on the one hand and, on the other, appear on programmes masquerading as independent analysts and pundits.  Where there is a direct conflict of interest, no good journalist has anything to fear from this register of interests.  It rightly applies to politicians and it should also apply in the broadcasting area.  Since I raised this issue on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; on Monday, an economist has challenged me to a duel because he claims I impugned his integrity.  Fortunately, it was an intellectual duel.  I know I have no chance in that regard.  It was not pistols at dawn.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>People with vested interests and conflicts of interest are appearing on television programmes.  In some instances individuals with stakes in other financial products and currencies are talking about the collapse of the euro.  This needs to be addressed and no good journalist has anything to fear from putting everything into the public domain.  It is vital that we have a strong journalism and broadcasting sector which demonstrates impartiality, integrity and credibility.  One cannot serve two masters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister but was disappointed in his speech, which was pretty limp and failed to address the serious problem of standards and ethics in journalism.  There are very few of them around.  I have been a paid up member of the National Union of Journalists for many years.  For three and a half years I worked honourably for what could be described as a tabloid newspaper.  Since 1982 I have warned, in this House and elsewhere, of the malign influence exerted by people like Rupert Murdoch.  I knew I was taking my life in my hands politically for doing so and I will probably be punished for what I am going to say today because we are brazenly told this is what happens.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to address not only the bullying of public figures and private individuals and the invasion of their space by the media but also the bullying that takes place in every <Col N="38"/>newspaper office.  I have proof of this practice.  The worst aspect of this bullying is that the people who presented me with the proof are terrified of their editorial staff.  They have begged me not to identify them.  I am also in some difficulty because some of the matters I would like to raise are, or will shortly be, <i>sub judice</i>.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the relationship between the media and politics.  I am all in favour of a free investigative press but, with some honourable exceptions, it has not lived up to this standard.  The Minister stated that the political system and the media must remain as separate as possible for the good of both.  Why then did the editor of one of the tabloids tell me that what was happening to me in the media was payback for standing up for the victims of the invasion of privacy and, more particularly, for what I had done in respect of the Defamation Bill 2006, the first version of which Senator Walsh and I forced to be withdrawn?  It is a lovely relationship between the media and politics if they can bully us as our masters.  Ten years ago, I was in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s office when Donie Cassidy was in the Chair and I was the only person who stood out against the editors.</P>
        <P>The Minister must be joking about the Press Council when he suggests it is of any use.  It is not even as useful as the Press Complaints Commission in Britain, and the chairperson of that body has acknowledged it is a farce.  I advise those who want to know about bullying not to look to me because I may be biased but instead read <i>The Journalist</i>, the magazine of the National Union of Journalists, which arrived in my post-box today.  The owners and editors of the newspapers did everything they could to prevent journalists from having privacy because they were terrified to give evidence.  These were the very groups that were understandably seeking anonymity for themselves.  The general secretary of the NUJ, Michelle Stanistreet, stated that a journalist would have to be a brave person to spell out what life is like working for his or her current employer.  There are fears that journalists who blow the whistle could render themselves unemployable in the future because they would be marked out as disloyal or untrustworthy.  I have that in writing from people who are afraid to talk about the issue openly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our newspapers published editorials calling for independent regulation of every profession but their own.  They are the exception.  The Minister put it well when he stated: &ldquo;[t]he Press Council, an independent body drawn from and run by the print media industry, is facilitated by legislation in that members are granted some additional protections under defamation law&rdquo;.  How wonderful.  It is self-regulating and there is no problem with conflicts of interest.  We protect them because the Minister brought back the defamation law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his statement to the Leveson inquiry, the lawyer, David Sherborne, accused newspapers of illegally accessing private voicemail messages, bribing employees into divulging personal information, blagging sensitive details through deception and trickery, blackmailing vulnerable or opportunistic individuals into breaking confidences about well-known people, blatant intrusion into the grief of victims of crime, vilification of ordinary members of the public unwittingly caught up in such events, hounding various well-known people and their families and friends purely to sell newspapers and bullying those who in seeking to question these practices were merely exercising the same freedom of speech behind which much of this behaviour was shielded or excused by the press.  I firmly believe that all those practices can be found in this country.  Some of those who gave evidence boasted about what they had done.  Has the Minister sent anybody to represent the Irish victims of these newspapers at the Leveson inquiry?  Will we conduct an inquiry of our own?  I have had to change my telephone number on three or four occasions.  How did grub street get my changed telephone number within 12 hours?</P>
      
	<P>I wish there was more time.  I hope we will have a proper debate in which we do not shilly-shally and that we will have the guts to address the issue because there is not a newspaper, radio station or television station that has not vilified, blackguarded, defamed or libelled me.  I <Col N="39"/>know many Senators are terrified, as are the unfortunate journalists who are bullied in their offices but until the day I die I will tell the truth and take the consequences.  Several times during the debate on the Defamation Bill I argued that, as truth is immutable, we should not lower the standard of truth for people who give public service.  That is an outrage in my opinion.  Tell the truth or pay the price should be the standard for Irish journalism.</P>

Is fi&uacute; sin a th&oacute;g&aacute;il san &aacute;ireamh nuair at&aacute;imid ag pl&eacute; ceisteanna na m&eacute;an.</P>
        <P Just="Left">&ldquo;Comment is free, but facts are sacred&rdquo; was the maxim of C. P. Scott, who 100 years ago was the editor of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, now <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i>, newspaper.  His aphorism stands as a remarkably succinct summation of the role of journalists and how they should conduct themselves.  They are free to air their views and challenge received wisdom but they have a duty to highlight issues which would not ordinarily be in the public domain and must always maintain high standards without bending the truth in any way.  Regrettably it appears C. P. Scott&rsquo;s wise words are not always remembered or considered in this and other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>Politicians have not entirely avoided this mistake either.  Certain Ministers, Senators and Deputies have made statements based on journalism that was inaccurate and, as a result, have had to retract them.  As politicians, we too must be careful when we make statements based on journalism.</P>
        <P>The Leveson inquiry and the disturbing tale of the hacked voicemail of the murdered schoolgirl, Milly Dowler, has had terrible consequences in other jurisdictions.  The media will certainly make mistakes as we all do, but incidents such as those I have just mentioned have a rather different character from mistakes.  They are the symptom of a hunger for the sensational story with scant concern for ethical journalism and in other instances dishonestly propagating an agenda which suits particular interests.  As to the latter, the regular and often inaccurate pillorying of the public sector within certain Sunday publications springs to mind.</P>
        <P>We have very limited interest in the media in a country where the interests of the wealthy and the views of the media concur in a way that limit the breadth of public discourse.  The extension of public service broadcasting, the print media, etc., are crucial.  We need to ensure that through the commercial media, space is made available for proper journalism and proper comment.  That needs to be part of the licensing regime for those media outlets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted the Minister has addressed the Seanad on the subject and I found what he had to say interesting.  The Minister said that the legislation &ldquo;ensures that the public service broadcasters meet the targets set for them by dint of the fact that they are in receipt of public funding&rdquo;.  Do I understand that only the State broadcaster receives the funding or does some portion go to others?  I know the Minister is a very fair-minded man.  We know how advertising has slumped and how the small local broadcasters have suffered.  Does <Col N="40"/>the Minister have a proposal to ensure a level playing pitch?  I have a very small interest to declare in this, about which we have all heard.  I am a small shareholder in one such radio station, Radio Kerry.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  My pirouetting elephant is ill at the moment so I will not be trying to perform for anybody.  The Minister is obviously aware that the submission process on the code of fairness, impartiality and objectivity is in train.  That code arises from the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Is the Minister satisfied that the code will address what is needed?  Will that be the end of it or will we see further codes or additions to that code?  As with Senator Paul Coghlan, I would like to know if there are any future plans to give any of the licence fee revenue to local radio stations, many of which carry out a public service remit.  Every weekday, Ocean FM in Sligo carries current affairs.  It is good local current affairs coverage with a national perspective where possible.  I know other radio stations do the same thing.  It is a matter we need to discuss in light of how the media are changing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Addressing the Leader briefly, it might be good if we could roll this debate on to a future date because I had some points and comments I would have liked to make.  However, I cannot make them now given that we are down to questions.  Perhaps we could be facilitated in that regard.  If the Minister were amenable to returning on some convenient occasion, it might be possible for more of us to contribute to the debate.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the relationship between the workings of the press council and the proposed privacy legislation.  He believed that the press council has been reasonably successful, which it is in many ways.  What does that mean for his intentions regarding privacy legislation?  Is his view that the press council has been a reasonable success so far based on any process of assessment within the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources?  Is it based on any consultation or analysis, or is it based on a general sense the Minister has, which, while legitimate in itself, might not be sufficient to enable him to form a view as to what ought to happen on the privacy legislation?  While I am not challenging him, I ask him to expand somewhat on what he had to say in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I refer to the RTE documentary &ldquo;AMission to Prey&rdquo; broadcast on 23 May 2011.  There were two segments in that programme, one of which has been very much in the news &mdash; the segment on Fr. Kevin Reynolds, which has been dealt with by the courts and is now the subject of a number of inquiries.  However, a second segment of that programme referred to Br. Dillon, who ministered for 60 years as a Christian Brother in South Africa.  His family feel that a profound injustice was committed in the transmission of this programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator quoting from anything in particular?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe there was a failure by RTE in fairness, objectivity and impartiality in the broadcasting of that programme.  Given the enormous and outrageous error that was observed in the Fr. Reynolds case, it is bizarre that it is not possible to have the only other segment of the programme that deals with previously unmade allegations reviewed.  I am very disappointed that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland returned the submission made by the family of the late Br. Dillon on the basis that it was not made within the statutory 30-day time limit.  I appeal to the Minister to have this segment of the programme reviewed in the interest of fairness to the family.  The person is deceased, but in the interest of natural justice, it is only fair that his family be shown due courtesy in having all aspects of this segment of the <Col N="41"/>programme investigated.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure the family can have justice in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  It is generally agreed that the subject matter of this debate is exceptionally important.  I agree with those who expressed the view that we should revisit the matter in a broader sense in the future.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider launching an investigation into the future of investigative journalism?  I say this primarily because the British House of Lords has already published such a report.  One of the subsequent UK-based blogs put it into context by stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . in the print press at least there is less spent on original from the ground up journalism.  This is particularly true at local level where circulations have plummeted and advertising revenue has fallen off a cliff in the last decade.  There is evidence that in certain local areas there is now sparse reporting of council meetings and court cases, and little scrutiny of other public authorities . . .  It [the report] also raises entirely valid concerns about the growth of public relations, and the opaque use of public relations material by journalists.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am sure Senator Whelan, from his time as editor, will remember getting all the press releases &mdash; a creeping disease &mdash; and trying to figure out whether they were objective.  The blog continued by quoting the excellent recommendation from the House of Lords report that: &ldquo;journalists themselves be transparent in their use of press releases particularly online where barriers to publishing links to press releases are low.&rdquo;  In other words, press releases are now ruling the roost because of lazy journalism.  Investigative journalism, which has been at the heart of much of what has been good in this country as the Minister mentioned in his speech, is under severe threat.  As a result of mistakes that have been made, others are now dumping on the concept of investigative journalism and suggesting that it is inherently flawed, when it should be at the core of what a free, open and transparent democracy should be about.  Does the Minister believe it is necessary to consider the future of investigative journalism here?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  In his speech, the Minister referred to the different tone of press behaviour in Ireland.  Naturally, we are all grateful that the press in Ireland does not cover Ministers snogging their secretaries in cupboards like it does in other jurisdictions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister prepared to keep the introduction of privacy legislation under review?</P>
        <P>My second question relates to openness and transparency, a matter raised by my colleague, Senator Whelan.  As we know those in political circles must make declarations relating to their holdings and so forth.  Has the Minister any thoughts about bringing such openness and transparency to the media?  I have in mind in particular the carry-on during the Celtic tiger years when property sections of newspapers fed what was at the time an insatiable demand for housing while at the same time pulling in extensive revenues.</P>
        <P>My third question relates to the best form of protection for Irish media.  We are aware of the pressures Irish media are under from abroad.  The Minister has referred to the issues of convergence of media.  Given the openness of the Irish media market, has the Minister considered giving extra resources to local media?  This possibility was mentioned by other Senators <Col N="42"/>as well.  It appears that local media are especially capable of defending themselves against this type of convergence.</P>
        <P>The Irish print and broadcast media are part of what could be termed the &ldquo;squeezed middle&rdquo;.  I refer in particular to the vulnerability of some of our proud titles to competition from overseas.  Does the Minister believe it would be appropriate to have a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign to protect Irish titles?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">At this stage the Minister must think I have some type of unrequited hero worship for him because I stated previously that he had the most important job in the public service when he was wearing his energy hat.  His role in this area is critical as well.  I am asked frequently about the major side effects of the treatment we provide for the disease I deal with as part of my day job.  My answer is that historically the greatest side effect in Ireland is not getting enough of the treatment because there has not been enough nurses or doctors to ensure one got treatment.  I have a similar attitude to the question of hypothetical intrusiveness on the part of the media.</P>
        <P>Let us consider modern history in Ireland.  What has been the major impact of the media&rsquo;s level of intrusion in public life?  One must conclude that it is negative because the media did not intrude enough.  I recall when I was a dirty-nosed student and a young doctor in the 1970s and 1980s.  At the time it was widely considered that several prominent figures in Irish politics might have had serious ethical questions to answer.  These should have been put to them and they should have been given the opportunity to answer those questions in the press.</P>
        <P>The watchdogs should have been the first line from which to launch the public interrogation.  For whatever reason there is a sense that this interrogation never took place, that we had a somewhat timid school of investigative journalism and that the watchdogs or the people involved had turned into poodles or even bichons.  Although some people make it in good faith there is no doubt that any attempt to enforce some level of policing of the investigative activities of the media is fraught and those involved can go far over the boundaries.  We have all seen it.  They can intrude into areas that are purely salacious and of no interest to the public while at the same time ignoring areas of critical public importance and interest.  The view is that we should simply suck it up, that this is one of the perils of being involved in various aspects of public discourse in Ireland and that we will have our dirty laundry or mildly unfresh laundry subjected to a level of scrutiny citizens without the same level of prominence are not subjected to.</P>
        <P>The downside of trying to increase the policing function of any part of the State over the way journalists go about their business poses a greater threat.  By way of recourse, there is no doubt that there are sharp journalistic practices here which, I believe, in some cases are unethical.  Once I mischievously asked a print journalist who was sharing a platform with me on a broadcast medium if there was any story that he would not publish if he knew it would sell newspapers and he knew it would not get him sued.  He paused for a moment and said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That was the answer.  The reality is that we must depend to a certain extent on the decency of the people in these positions to use the great power they have wisely.</P>
        <P>At the same time there may be gentle ways to increase the level of muscle that enforces or polices the more extreme types of behaviour.  I have no doubt there are people in the business who, from time to time, have published things they knew to be untrue because they thought they could get away with it.  For these more extreme examples we should consider whether there is some case to be made for introducing some element of criminal as well as civil liability.  I suppose hypothetically that if evidence came out in a civil case to the effect that someone had deliberately misinformed then such a person should also have some automatic responsi<Col N="43"/>bility before criminal law.  The free press is one of the most important things we have.  It is more dangerous for us to police it than to occasionally feel the sharper end of its barb.</P>

	<P>I realise the Minister has to leave.  This media standards debate is important but it should include social media as well.  Free speech is essential for a liberal democracy but the new media has increased its effectiveness greatly as well.  Let us consider the Twitter revolution in Moldova in recent times and the Arab spring.  These offer examples of how much free speech is enabled by social media.  Even Facebook cannot be blocked by the great firewall of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.</P>
        <P>Where are the boundaries in social media between the freedom of speech and privacy and freedom of speech and personal safety?  This question could be a great deal more significant than we realise.  What steps will the Government take to regulate social media to ensure appropriate protections to safeguard the rights of the person wrongly accused of something, wrongly attacked or bullied?  Cyber bullying is alive and well.  How can the perpetrator be punished if the person posting on social media is anonymous or if the Internet Protocol, IP, address of the person is registered in the United States of America and not traceable while he or she continues to wreak havoc?  I am keen to hear the Minister&rsquo;s answers to these questions.  This area is new for all of us.  However, it is alive and well.  I heard recently that the Office of the Press Ombudsman has no remit over local media.  Is that true?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is said that war is an extension of politics by another means and so it seems is the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  Every time we open the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, we see articles by Deputies Shane Ross and Willie O&rsquo;Dea, by Senators John Crown and John Whelan, by former politicians Eoghan Harris and Michael McDowell and, I am sure, several others.  I am vaguely uncomfortable about this.  The <i>Sunday Independent </i>seems to be more of a Leinster House appreciation society than a newspaper, yet it is a newspaper that forms the political agenda for a week.  It has 1 million readers and I find it uncomfortable to see the opinion <Col N="44"/>formers in this House also forming opinion in an opinion forming newspaper.  Could we have the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that?</P>
        <P>My other question concerns the Milly Dowler case, which involved the hacking of a dead girl&rsquo;s phone.  This case has exposed a particularly awful practice among some media in the United Kingdom and some newspapers from the same stable operate in Ireland.  Is the Minister confident we have robust enough sanctions available to our authorities to deal with the fall-out from this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no sanctions at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Are the sanctions strong enough to act as a deterrent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate we are in the Seanad.  I read recently that one of the first gazettes ever issued was the <i>Acta Senatus</i> from the old Roman Senate, which made proclamations of the work that could be done in the Senate.  Then through the Middle Ages, one of the first widespread publications throughout Europe promoting political views and commercial news was owned by a family called the Fuggers.  I can spell that in case it is lost in translation.  The Fuggers were a German family in the Middle Ages.  They are recognised as the first people to promote newsletters.  At this stage, that industry has become totally commercialised.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask a question that relates to an issue that was raised by Senator Gilroy.  I was recently subject to a misinformation story that travelled around the country.  The Office of the Press Ombudsman has no powers.  Until it is given some teeth, the power of the press will be used for the wrong reasons and will damage people.  We would be a poorer country if we did not have press freedom.  However, sanctions are needed in cases like the Milly Dowler case in the UK.  That was the ultimate example of journalistic decadence.  I ask the Minister for his views on the powers of the Office of the Press Ombudsman.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate.  I am left with the impression that we have revealed the tip of the iceberg.  I expect Senators will want an opportunity to return to this subject in more depth.  It may be the case that all we have done is touch the surface of the matter. I do not dispute what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said.  It is a truism that good news is not news, as Erskine Childers said.  One has to accept that in this business.  I accept what the Senator said about the excellence of public service broadcaster&rsquo;s coverage of last year&rsquo;s visits of the Queen of England and the President of the United States and last weekend&rsquo;s visit of the Chinese Vice Premier.  I agree that &ldquo;they did it exceptionally well&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We are living in rapidly changing times like we have never seen before.  The traditional media is under considerable pressure.  Considerable economic obstacles are preventing the traditional media from functioning as it did in the past.  The development of new media is inevitable.  I do not think there is a great deal of point in us juxtaposing one type of media with the other.  It is and is going to be one media.  The question of how we regulate that was raised by a number of Senators, most passionately by Senator Norris.  We need to deal with what the Senator referred to as an entirely unjustified &ldquo;invasion of privacy&rdquo;, for example.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Press Council was being established, consideration was given to whether it should be accompanied by a privacy Act.  The Government of the day engaged in negotiations on whether this country&rsquo;s press council should be formed on a statutory basis and accompanied by privacy legislation.  A number of Ministers in that Government went on the record to advo<Col N="45"/>cate the necessity for privacy legislation.  It was decided to &ldquo;suck it and see&rdquo;, so to speak.  In other words, the decision was to see how a non-statutory press council would function.  Senator Norris has dismissed the Press Council of Ireland with a wave of his magisterial hand.  My opinion is that it is too early to say, as Zhou Enlai said about the French Revolution.  It has been in existence for just four years.  I suggest that given the tasks that have been put to it, the council has performed much better than&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is no comfort to the families that have been violated.  I was punished by the media for raising their cases.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on the bullying of politicians by editors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The most serious thing I heard during the debate was Senator Norris&rsquo;s claim that those who take a stand on behalf of high standards in the media are being victimised.  He suggested that the bullying of these people takes place at the hands of their own editors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I have evidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is happening, it is immensely regrettable.  I should say, in defence of the remarks I delivered at the outset of this debate, that I was addressing the Irish situation.</P>

	<P>So am I.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from a glancing reference to them, I was not addressing the matters that are the subject of the Leveson inquiry.  The matters in question ought to concern any public representative and any fair-minded citizen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Every single one of them is happening here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the conduct of the Murdoch empire.  Senator Norris alleges that the same thing is happening here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I have to say I consider myself reasonably alert to these issues.  I rarely agree with much of what is written.  None of us, especially those of us in government, agrees with it all.  As Senator Crown said, in most cases I would defend the right of the serious content and criticism to be written.  I do not accept what Senator Norris has said.  I am open to being persuaded.  I am open to coming back to the House to clarify the matter.  I have to say in all truthfulness that I do not accept at this stage that we have sunk in this country to the standards we have seen in the neighbouring island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="46"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What I am saying about what transpired at the Leveson inquiry is that I do not have any personal knowledge of similar circumstances here.  Nobody has brought such circumstances to my attention.  I am not making any naive vow of incredulity.  I do not suggest that matters that have not yet come to light here are not happening.  However, I really do not think it has sunk to the level it has sunk to in the neighbouring island.  The points Senator Norris made about bullying are very serious.  When Senator Whelan spoke about the failure to cover the more substantial proceedings of this House, he could well have added that there is also a failure to cover the more substantial proceedings of the other House.  I do not know whether such matters &mdash; the substantial matters that happen here, as opposed to the trivial matters &mdash; are not reported because journalists are not filing stories.  Perhaps journalists know there is no point in filing stories about such matters because their editors will not publish them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a matter of concern if we had reached that stage.  I recall meeting the senior management of the Independent News and Media group in the mid-1990s, when I served as Minister of State with responsibility for commerce.  I also met some members of the board of the group, including its then deputy chairman, the late John Meagher.  He said to me that as far as the Independent group of newspapers was concerned, it was operating in a regional market.  The implication of his remarks was that the group&rsquo;s newspapers were competing with the tabloids that were coming through at the time, which would inevitably lead to the dumbing down of standards.  Members of the House will have their own views on what has transpired in the subsequent 15 years.  As regards the questions raised by several Senators about public service broadcasting and the television licence and all that kind of thing, the notion of replacing the TV licence, the notion of scrapping it and moving to a public service broadcasting charge, is motivated principally by the convergence of technologies which is happening before our eyes.  I presume that like myself, many Members of this House have observed the extent to which the next generation are not buying newspapers or taking their information from the print media but rather from their tablet or their iPhone or anywhere there is a connection to the Internet.  This is happening, whether or not we want to admit it.  Unlike the little boy we cannot put our fingers into the dyke because this is what is happening before our eyes.  </P>
        <P>The second reason is the extent of evasion which is significant at approximately &euro;30 million from the collection of the licence fee and this is a consideration.  Every time I say this it is misreported in some areas but this is not a new charge; it replaces the existing charge.  Despite all the complaints I receive about the TV licence I never receive a complaint about the subscription to Sky or UPC or whatever, to see, for example, whether Harry Redknapp won his last match against Sunderland.  I get a variety of very colourful complaints about RTE.  Senator Paul Coghlan raised the plight of the independent broadcasters.  I agree entirely with him that they play a very important role in provincial Ireland and in particular, his own station, Radio Kerry, the Kingdom radio, being an especially good example, including as it does the broadcasting of public service content.  However, the idea behind the TV licence was to foster and support public service broadcasting.  It is already top-sliced in a number of ways.  For instance, &euro;10 million is allocated by law to TG4 and a further 7% of the proceeds go to the Sound and Vision fund, the purpose of which is to enable independent producers to apply to that fund for programme resources.</P>

	<P>I thank the House.  In respect of the &euro;10 million and the 7% to the Sound and Vision fund, it is already top-sliced to some extent.  In reply to the matter raised by Senator Whelan, of course I am concerned about the finances of the national broadcaster.  I share his views about the necessity for value for money.  As it happens, I have a meeting with the board of the RTE Authority tomorrow.  I intend to tell the board that we cannot continue running deficits, that this must be controlled, that we must have value for the taxpayers&rsquo; money being expended.  However, in all fairness, it has to be acknowledged that we are working in a tiny market and the amount of resources available to RTE from the TV licence fund and from commercial revenue, is a tiny fraction of what is available, for example, to the BBC in the neighbouring island.  This has to be taken into account.  There is an irreducible minimum and going below that will not allow for quality public broadcasting of any kind.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Paschal Mooney asked about the future of investigative programming and I could not agree more with him.  I sincerely hope that the rocky times which the national broadcaster has encountered in recent months as a result of the programme to which Senator Michael Mullins referred, &ldquo;Mission to Prey&rdquo;, will not damage investigative journalism.  I agree with Senator Mooney.  The decision I took in that matter to require the intervention of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland was taken for two reasons.  First, the priest concerned has the same constitutional rights as the rest of us.  He has an entitlement for them to be vindicated and to be seen to be vindicated.  Second, the normally high standard of that programme should not be damaged and in my view this is best achieved by it being properly and independently investigated and let the pieces fall where they will.  In reply to Senator Michael Mullins the investigation is likely to be concluded very soon and in that context I am happy to look at the additional issues he has raised concerning a second segment of the programme.  We have referred certain correspondence in respect of that matter to both the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and to RTE.</P>
      
	<P>A difficult question was raised by several Senators regarding the independent broadcasters.  From my travels around the country I am familiar with their work.  It needs to be borne in mind that they were commercial enterprises undertaken at the time.  They are going through a <Col N="48"/>rough time at present, like many of the media, as a result of the decrease in advertising.  Any change to be made will be for the introduction of a public service broadcasting support.  Whether this means they undertake the kind of investigative legwork to which Senator Mooney has referred or whether they fund the RTE light orchestra or they invest money in the arts and culture or whatever, we need to hold on to this important resource.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown raised the question as to whether the media was as intrusive in the pastas it ought to have been.  The age of deference is certainly over now.  In the past, the TD, theparish priest and the Garda sergeant were shown tremendous deference throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>And now we show it to the press; the new tyranny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">All three of them ran into a spot of bother since.  As a result, we have gone from excessive deference to corrosive cynicism.  This is a real pity because the media is different.  Various Members have raised the question of competition and concentration of ownership, dominant position, abuse of dominant position, cross-media ownership and so on.  As I have said, it is different from making concrete blocks or producing widgets in the garage because the media conditions the kind of democracy in which we live and therefore, diversity of content and of ownership are very important.  That is why different rules must apply.  Several Senators had too little time to develop the points they wanted to make.  Senator Healy Eames and others asked about social media and new media and the balance between the public interest and freedom of the press.  No one in the western world knows the answer to some of these questions.  We are struggling with them.  Whether Senator Norris accepts it, there is a structure for the print media.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister send a representative to the Leveson inquiry?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>People are observing what is happening in the Leveson inquiry but the answer is that I do not have anyone over there.  The Leveson inquiry will produce a report that will be available to us all and I am happy to return to the House when it is available.  In the interim, we have the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman.  I am quite happy to engage in a private discussion with Senator Norris on this issue.  These bodies are doing a better job than was anticipated when they were established.  There is no similar organisations for online media, which has not subscribed to any similar controls.  That is the major challenge of our times.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; </P>
	<P Just="Left"> I am delighted the Minister of State is present and I will appeal to her sympathetic nature to legislate on this.  I ask her to take on board the issues and for any legislation to have these <Col N="49"/>issues included.  The debate may not take two hours and I hope for the full support of the Minister of State.  The purpose of this Bill is to bring regulation to the minimum distance between a wind turbine and residential premises.  At present, the distance is 500 m, a figure that has been in place for a number of years during which wind turbines have become taller.  Some turbines on wind farms are as tall as the spire on O'Connell Street.  The spire is very much in one's face when one is 500 m away from it. </P>
        <P>In 1988, the Aarhus Convention granted the public rights on access to information, public participation and access to justice in Government decision-making processes on matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment.  It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.  In 1988, all countries in Europe signed up to it except Ireland and Russia.  Subsequent to that, the EU signed up to it, meaning Ireland is legally bound to play by the rules of the Aarhus Convention.  They are not being implemented in this country even though there are many commonsense recommendations.  The main recommendation is that public consultation and participation is vital on environmental matters.  That is the only protection or safeguard for someone who does not want a wind turbine in their backyard.</P>
        <P>Developers drive around the country and see a site for a wind turbine or farm.  In the dark of night, they approach farmers and offer them sweet deals to rent land for 25 or 30 years for &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000.  They draw up contracts, which are signed, sealed and delivered.  Once that happens, the developers undertake the public consultation process but it is too late because they have contracts signed.  It is an unstoppable train in one direction.  Even where councils refuse admission, An Bord Plean&aacute;la grants permission.</P>
        <P>The UK authorities are going to do the same as what I am doing.  In the House of Lords, there is a Bill on Committee Stage along the same lines as my Bill except that the distances proposed are even further from private residences.  The UK Bill also proposes compensation for those affected by wind turbines.</P>
        <P>I am tabling this Bill on a matter of human rights because people should have the right to live in a healthy environment without noise or nuisance.  When wind turbines are foisted on people, that right is taken away.  Wind turbines also devalue property.  A couple of weeks ago, a couple in the UK were forced to leave their house because of the noise from the wind turbines.  They took the developers to court, won the case and were compensated.</P>
        <P>My Bill proposes that wind turbines between 25 m and 50 m should be 500 m away from private residences, those between 50 m and 100 m should be 1 km from private residences, those between 100 m and 150 m should be 1.5 km away, and anything over 150 m should be 2 km away.  In the UK, the required distance is 3 km from private residences.  I propose no minimum distance for wind turbines under 25 m.</P>
        <P>Learned Senators in this House have much to contribute on the related issue of wind energy.  There is a need for a debate on wind energy to see if we will achieve our targets or whether it is a pointless exercise.  However, that debate is for another day and the issue today is to protect people.  I would not like to count the e-mails I received from all parts of the country, complimenting me on publishing this Bill, since the start of the process.  Until this point, there has been no protection for people and Governments over the past few years, including the previous Government supported by Senator Leyden, have been promoting big business and walking on the small person who has no say.  It is time we stood up for the small person.  I want us to buy into the principle of the Aarhus Convention, which is a rights-based approach.  Current and future generations have the right to live in a healthy environment.  It is not a lot to ask for.  I look for the full support of the Minister of State on this.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="50"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to be able to second Senator Kelly&rsquo;s proposal.  I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House to take the Bill.  </P>
        <P>It is important to point out that no one here opposes wind energy or wind farms.  It is not a frivolous or trivial protest and is not based on trying to impede the roll out of new technology, green technology and wind energy.  As Senator Kelly pointed out, the jury is still out on the viability of wind energy.  However, that is not the matter before us today.</P>
        <P>There are no standards or best practice.  By their nature, wind farms will normally be sited in rural areas on high ground or coastal landscapes in order to function.  The Bill is straightforward and simple and in that regard it deserves cross-party support.  It should be accepted by the Government in order to protect homesteads and families.  It is fine for us to drive across Europe or Ireland and admire wind farms in the distance.  I am in favour of them in principle.</P>
        <P>There are proposals by Coillte to site a new wind farm on Cullenagh Mountain in an area which is not too far from where I live.  It has to go through due process and the project is currently in train.  Nobody should be expected to suffer from wind farms being imposed on them without some basic standards being applied with regard to minimum distance.  I would like to say I will not muddy the waters but I would include pylons and power lines in the requirements for minimum distance.  They are inextricably linked.  If a wind farm is built it has to be connected to the grid and requires power lines and pylons to transmit energy.  We should look at best practice and standards in other countries such as Denmark where provisions are made to protect homesteads, rural dwellers, farmers and families.  Minimum distance should be set out in regulations regarding the proximity of pylons and power lines to homes.  That is a row for another day.</P>
        <P>We are not tilting at windmills.  There is a genuine effort to reflect and respond to concerns that have been brought to the attention of Senator Kelly and other colleagues from people across the country.  I would like the Minister of State to take into account the remarks that were put on the record of the House which will be reiterated today by Senator Barrett.  He, with good science and statistics, continues to draw our attention to the concerns of the OECD about the viability and sustainability of wind energy.  It is important that we do not sleepwalk, as a community and Government, into the next big bubble and bet the house on technology that might not be sustainable.</P>

They have done the House some service by bringing the Bill to its floor.  They have raised issues of concern to constituents in Roscommon.  The Minister of State was a councillor and will be well aware of the issues that have arisen and will arise in the future.  As Senator Whelan said, the Bill is very clear and refers to the distance from houses.  The height being linked to the distance to a dwelling house is an ingenious formula.  There are different options.</P>
        <P>I do not want to rain on anyone&rsquo;s parade today but it is highly unlikely that the Minister of State and Government will adopt the Bill.  That can be taken for granted.  I shake the Senator&rsquo;s hand and congratulate him.  We will have refreshments.</P>

	<P Just="Left">To put things in context, the then Government let the Bill through, thanks to the late Brian Lenihan.  It was passed and approved unanimously by my colleagues at the time, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that connected to this Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  It is very relevant.  It refers to the passage of a Bill through the House, in which I am sure the Cathaoirleach is interested.  A question was put to me by Senator Kelly.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael supported my Bill unanimously in a previous House.  When I brought it back to the House both parties reneged on a commitment given.  The Bill would have been of benefit to people.  I am not finished with it and I will have to speak to the Taoiseach about the matter.  He may be the only one who can rescue it.</P>
        <P>The Bill which has been put forward today is admirably suitable and worthwhile.  I am a realist and have been in government.  Governments do not like Private Members&rsquo; Bills or anyone taking the limelight for himself or herself.  They like to bring forward their ideas and Bill.  The Civil Service will go out of its way to make sure the Bill never sees the light of day.  Fianna F&aacute;il would support this Bill.  Support might or might not be unanimous.</P>
        <P>Wind energy is a very important industry but is currently subsidised and is not necessarily the most economic.  However, it will be in the future given the rising cost of oil and so forth.  The issue of distance from houses is very important as far as Sliabh B&aacute;n outside Strokestown and Dysart in south Roscommon are concerned.  Residents in those areas are very concerned about the potential environmental damage to their lives and residences from wind turbines.  It is a reasonable point of view and has to be considered.  The point was made in other contributions.</P>
        <P>No environmental impact study of turbines is required in the areas to which I referred but they should have to be taken into consideration.  Those who benefit from turbines will make the point that they are of great benefit to the economy.  Those who do not benefit would experience unexpected major disadvantages in their environments.  No one would have expected the situation in Sliabh B&aacute;n to have arisen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Roscommon County Council has dealt with this issue in great detail.  Senator Whelan referred to power lines and telecommunications masts.  There are TETRA masts located beside Mr. and Mrs. Michael Hussey.  Senator Kelly is well aware of the family in which there are four young children.  This very large mast is just 30 m from the residence.  Planning permission was refused by Roscommon County Council and then granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The mast is far too close to the house and is a danger to health, particularly that of the children.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">On the points made by Senator Whelan, we could, if we proceed to Committee Stage, draft some amendments to take into account both telecommunications and power distribution masts.  I hope we have a debate on Shannonside radio on this matter to discuss the issues involved.  I congratulate Senator Whelan on bringing the Bill to the House.  I hope we will have a good debate on the old question of wind energy and its control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have any direction from the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, any other Minister or the Civil Service.  I do not know about Senator Leyden; perhaps he has more experience than I have.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes to regulate the distance between wind turbines and residential premises.  There are quite a few issues that must be evaluated when considering the Bill.  Rather than considering each in isolation, we should consider them all together.  Consideration must be given to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets and the benefits that can be accrued from using <Col N="52"/>cleaner, greener energy sources.  It is a question of striking a balance between human rights and energy provision requirements.  We must work on this.</P>
        <P>Renewable energy development is a vital part of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to tackle the two major challenges facing us today: ensuring a secure supply of energy and combating climate change.  Wind energy can be produced indigenously.  We had a great debate only a week ago on energy.  All the issues raised are very relevant today in the context of wind turbines.</P>
        <P>Recent volatility in fossil fuel prices has demonstrated that regions with high dependency on energy imports are exposed to a high level of risk.  This volatility makes it difficult for investors in the economy to make reliable long-term forecasts of their energy costs.  It is estimated that between 25% and 30% of capital investment in renewable energy is retained in the local economy.  All this must be taken into consideration in decisions we make on energy and masts.</P>
        <P>There are wind turbines that fall into the category of exempted developments.  They probably cause as much trouble as any other project. Section 3 of the Bill states no relevant authority may grant planning permission for the construction of a wind turbine generator unless it meets a minimum-distance requirement under section 4, subject to the exception in section 5, namely, the one based on the consent of the residents.  However, nothing is said about the current exempted developments.  S.I. No. 83 of 2007 was introduced into law as part of an attempt to ease the burden of planning for renewable energy systems, including wind turbines, solar PV systems, etc.  All of this must be examined.</P>
        <P>S.I. No. 600 of 2001 gives planners the right to refuse an exemption if it interferes with the character or landscape of an area.  There are many other issues in this regard that must be considered in conjunction with this Bill.  I understand where the Senator is coming from in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to domestic houses, the maximum permitted height of an exempted turbine from ground to blade tip is 13 m.  I presume this will still stand under the Bill.  There is no change being made because the Bill is silent on the exemptions.  I presume this silence means that the status quo remains.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The noise level should be taken into consideration when setting a new limit, as this Bill proposes.  There is a maximum noise level set at present.  We should consider it if we are taking distance into account.  There is currently no legislation in place prescribing the separation distance between wind turbines and residential properties but there are some safeguards and guidelines in place.  Suitable siting considerations are standard in planning processes, or should be.  Interpretation by many planners is wide open and this is probably what Senator Kelly is trying to counteract.  Local topography, ground cover, population distribution and acoustic characteristics all play a part in the planning assessment, which differs from site to site.</P>
        <P>The rationale behind the proposal to regulate the distance between turbines is well intentioned.  The planning guidelines are designed, or should be designed, to ensure consistency throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy developments.  I do not know whether a separation distance will lead to consistency nationally.  Some of the best wind sites may be excluded.  There is a lot of NIMBYism but not all objections fall into this category.  As Senator Kelly stated, human rights must be considered.</P>
        <P>How was the distance proposed in section 4 chosen and how were the figures arrived at?  Under the provisions of the Bill, a turbine of 24 m would involve no minimum distance from a residential dwelling whereas one of 25 m, which is only 1 m taller, would have to be 500 m therefrom.  Let no one misinterpret me because I am a believer in the setting of a minimum distance where a development may be harmful to the residents concerned.  For example, when I was a member of South Dublin County Council, I instigated a minimum limit of 100 m in <Col N="53"/>respect of telephone masts.  This was adopted in the council&rsquo;s development plan, although it was overruled on one occasion by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am not against limits but want to ensure there is a scientific reason for choosing one.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Connection to the grid and mast sizes comprise another issue.  Planners make it very difficult for wind energy providers when they ask them to provide a photomontage, which costs approximately &euro;10,000.  One planning condition that I came across was that tall, quick-growing trees should be planted in close proximity for screening purposes.  Is it sensible to grow trees that may block the wind close to a wind turbine?  Planning issues must be considered in this regard.</P>
        <P>Wind energy developments are required to demonstrate environmental benefits and how environmental and social impacts have been minimised through the careful consideration of the location, scale, design and other measures.</P>
        <P>When considering minimum distances, the Minister of State should bear in mind that the establishment of rigid separation distances and linking them to turbine height could actually lead to negative outcomes for householders.  For example, it could lead to proposals being submitted for the building a greater number of smaller turbines of 24m, which is below the 25m threshold.  Do we want this?  It is not sustainable for either energy producers or households.</P>
        <P>There are many questions I could ask.  I thank Senator Whelan for raising this issue.  We must put considerable thought into the matter if we are to secure energy provision and safeguard households.  I am open to persuasion on the scientific value of setting certain distances.  I have not conducted the research myself on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan.  When the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, was speaking in the House on 1 February, he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Towards the end of 2011, the International Energy Agency carried out its four-yearly review of Irish energy policy.  The review includes a detailed assessment of the efficiency of the Irish electricity and gas sectors, taking full account of the EU regulatory context for these sectors.  I look forward to receiving its assessment of our energy policy in a few months.  This analysis will feed into a review of the existing 2007 energy White Paper that my Department will carry out over the coming months in consultation with stakeholders and with a view to publishing during this year a new energy policy framework for 2012-2030.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On what oil price does each alternative depend?  Each is technically feasible and has very strong advocates, but sometimes what is possible in engineering terms does not make economic sense.  As the Minister of State knows, the OECD, in its review of the Irish economy, which the National Competitiveness Council includes in the competitiveness challenge report for 2011, advocated the discontinuation of supports for offshore wave and tidal energy.  In its view, these options are too expensive.</P>
        <P>The Competitiveness Council recommends that the price support scheme for onshore windmills should be revised so that as we move closer to achieving our renewable energy targets, price support levels for new projects are phased out over time.  There is &euro;35 million from the PSO levy on electricity users which goes to subsidise renewable energy at the moment.  It is recommended that the schemes should be discontinued for offshore wave and tidal energy, and scaled down for onshore windmills.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P>The council also points out that we will have to review policy because EirGrid 25 was based on anticipations of economic growth which, alas, we do not have.  In fact, Professor Colm McCarthy estimates that by 2014 we will be about 40% behind where we would expect to be in the national development plan in terms of GDP.  He has been making the point that one does not need the same volumes of investment to cater for an economy which &mdash; unfortunately, much as we wish to change it and will work to do so &mdash; will be substantially below what was predicted when the national development plan was drawn up.  Postponing capital projects is justified in that case.</P>
        <P>The Minister is undertaking the review, which I welcome.  We look forward to hearing his thoughts later this year.  I welcomed his speech here on 1 February.  Independent people have cast doubts on the offshore projects I mentioned, including wave and tidal energy, as well as biomass.  These are all technically feasible but they may not make sense unless the price of oil doubles.  There are similar concerns that we may end up with excess capacity because economic growth in a recession will be less than expected.  The &euro;35 million in support for renewable energy, including onshore windmills, should be revised as we move closer to the target.  The target will be smaller as we will be consuming less energy due to the regrettable recession.</P>
        <P>On pollution matters, An Bord Snip&rsquo;s suggestion is to price those benefits on carbon tax.  One can spend a lot of money for a small benefit but the carbon price gives us the shadow price.  We are not alone in this situation.  There has been such a strong surge without much analysis in favour of alternative energy that it is difficult to redress that.  In the United Kingdom the makers of solar panels pursued a successful law case against the government.  We can therefore build up irrational expectations that some activities will be worthwhile, but it would require a massive oil price rise to be so.  I do not know where we fit into the picture as regards gas coming from the Corrib field.  What will that do to Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements?</P>
        <P>Part of the success of wind energy in Denmark is due to a gas price which seems to be 50% higher than the price we pay in Ireland.  Things that are possible in Denmark, therefore, may not make economic sense here.  The Bill is important in opening up a discussion as to what the best energy policy is but we must include some numbers.  When do we flick the switch to bring in these various options?  Some have been ruled out, while others may be marginal.  As the Competitiveness Council has said, subsidies may have to be curtailed.  The fear is that if one does too much in this direction, one will reduce the chances of recovery in the overall export sector because we must keep our competitiveness strong.  Energy costs are a major factor in that and they are within our control, which is why I welcome the Bill before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend Senator Kelly for introducing this Bill.  This area requires much discussion and analysis.  From the perspective of this House, it is a first and positive step.  Many &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; have been expressed by a number of people.  I have been contacted by some groups in my area of County Clare, as Senators Kelly and Leyden in Roscommon and others have been.  Such groups have issues with the current law and the fact that wind turbines will be located near their dwelling houses.  County Clare is awash with wind as the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, knows well because she is a regular visitor.  Clare County Council was one of the first local authorities to adopt a proper wind strategy, including buffer zones.  Even with such a strategy, there are issues of concern.  Senator Kelly is proposing a 500 m buffer zone around wind turbines, but in some cases in Clare we are talking about a distance of 2 km.  I would be more comfortable having a minimum buffer zone of 1 <Col N="55"/>km.  A distance of 2 km should be standard, rather than 500 m which is extremely close to dwellings for noise.  In addition, wind turbines may interfere with panoramic views of the ocean.</P>
        <P>Clare County Council decided the best approach was to adopt a proper wind strategy.  The council went through the consultation process with various stakeholders on both sides, received their submissions and held hearings to come up with a proper strategy.  Even with that there are still significant objections.  A detailed national strategy is required at this stage to deal with the issue.  Arguments from abroad suggest that wind is perhaps not the best form of creating energy and that alternative ways should be examined.  Denmark and other countries are no longer convinced that wind turbines are either appropriate or efficient.</P>
        <P>Alternative energy is in its infancy here and we have not had a proper discussion on it.  My biggest fear is that we could irreparably damage our tourism product if we are not careful.  Just because an area has no dwelling houses, it does not mean it is not valuable in terms of its intrinsic beauty; it may be part of our overall tourism offering.  In Clare, hill-walking and rock-climbing are significant tourism pursuits.  Many foreign visitors come specifically for walking holidays, irrespective of the weather conditions.  We must not destroy our natural resources by locating wind farms in inappropriate areas.  What would have been regarded as wasteland before, is now part of our natural tourism resource because visitors are climbing mountains in remote areas.  The Minister of State will be aware of parts of County Clare which in recent years have begun to attract hill-walkers, especially at weekends.  Every year the numbers taking part in hiking and similar pursuits are increasing.  Such leisure activities could be compromised by the development of wind turbines.</P>
        <P>We must be careful and we do need guidelines.  We must also ensure that such guidelines are fair and take into account what we are trying to achieve.  Most of all, we must respect the integrity of people&rsquo;s homes.  When people buy a home they have certain rights and expectations that it should not be taken away from them.  I look forward to having a further, more detailed and comprehensive debate on this particular issue in future.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Ba mhaith liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Ceallaigh faoin mBille seo a thabhair chun cinn.  Is m&oacute;r an rud &eacute; do Sheanad&oacute;ir ar bith Bille a thabhairt chun cinn agus comhghairdeas leis faoi sin.  Ba mhaith liom a dheimhni&uacute; d&oacute; go bhfuil Sinn F&eacute;in ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta ioml&aacute;n don mBille, agus is bre&aacute; an rud an taca&iacute;ocht tras-ph&aacute;irt&iacute; seo a fheice&aacute;il.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtabharfaidh p&aacute;irtithe eile an Rialtais taca&iacute;ocht don r&uacute;n t&aacute;bhachtach seo.</P>
        <P>It is important to state that Sinn F&eacute;in strongly supports the development of renewable energy and maintaining a clean environment.  This Bill is an important addition to the framework of legislation, which we are happy to support.  I hope it will be passed by the House and that it will be debated in the D&aacute;il.  It is clear that primary legislation is required in this area, as there is no statutory obligatory distance requirement.  That means those who propose to erect turbines apply to erect them as close as 200 m from homes.  We have had first hand experience of such sitings in Connemara, which I mentioned previously.  It probably shows up some of the idiosyncrasies of the different approaches that county councils take to these developments.  Galway County Council has adopted a wind strategy which allows for the siting of wind turbines up to 200 m from a dwelling.  Planning permission was given for such a development, to which the locals objected and thankfully An Bord Plean&aacute;la has overturned that decision.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of Galway County Council&rsquo;s policy I find extraordinary is that when the areas that turbines can be built were marked out on the map, all the Special Protection Areas, SPAs, and SSE areas have been excluded.  My understanding is that European legislation states that a wind farm, or wind energy is allowable within an SSE area and not much else is allowable within those areas.  Donegal County Council has given permission and has included the SSEs <Col N="56"/>and SPAs in the areas where wind turbine and wind farms can be developed in County Donegal.   More direction for the different county councils is needed to ensure the country has a cohesive policy.  This legislation would add to the cohesion of policy across the State and would ensure that this important development can be done, but in such a way that it fits in with local communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have received an e-mail from a County Clare resident who is awaiting a decision on a proposal to have turbines the height of the Dublin Spire located as close as 430 m  from their home.  That is clearly unacceptable and will represent an unwarranted aesthetic and environmental intrusion on that community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are different regulations at local authority level and Clare County Council refused permission for the proposal to which I referred, which differs from the Galway scenario I mentioned.  Generally, in Clare County Council&rsquo;s administrative area, the distance is set at between 400 m and 500 m from the nearest dwelling; however, it has been argued that this is inadequate as it is based on the height of turbines that are now rarely installed and with the average height of modern turbines up to 155 m, developments of that height require to be located a much greater distance from dwellings.</P>
        <P>This Bill proposes that turbines should be placed no closer than 2 km from a residential premises.  Given the expectation that more investment will go towards the development of wind power to generate electricity, that does not present a problem and developers might argue that it would restrict the placing of turbines, certainly of the greater heights, making the project unviable.  Other structural issues must be looked at in siting wind farms.  I mentioned that the ESB is developing the electricity grid around the country but in some cases, as in Connemara, where it is developing a new 110 kV line, there is no access for the wind farms to connect into the 110 kV line.  In Galway, no more than in Clare, as Senator Conway has announced, where we are full of wind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>You said it, Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I knew that the Senator would not disagree with that.  It is important that we are able to access this type of energy, but if the grid does not allow for such connections, it seems that the two arms of the policy are fighting against each other.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While there are no statutory distance regulations in the United Kingdom, the guidelines in place in Scotland are that no farms be located within 2 km of a dwelling house.  Given that Scotland is a clear leader in this field, I suggest that bolsters the proposals in Senator Kelly&rsquo;s Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a broader level there is significant potential in renewable energy and that applies to wave power as well as to wind, yet, in spite of our natural advantages, there has been comparatively little done to develop this sector.  Given the current economic situation and the potential for job creation as well as addressing our energy needs, would the savings in import substitution that it would represent not suggest it ought to be prioritised?</P>
        <P>I was in Canada recently where I saw the great work that is being done on tidal energy but what impressed me was that Canada has taken on a co-operative community model for developing renewable energy, which we should look at here.  If a community group or a local co-operative wishes to set up a wind or a tidal turbine, there is grant aid available to set it up and in addition, the electricity is bought from the local community at a preferential rate. This helps the community to pay off the investment and invest any profits made after that into the local community.  That is something we should look at in this country.</P><Col N="57"/>
        <P>Scotland has set the bar very high on wind energy and I recommend that we follow its example.  It has set ambitious targets for renewable energy production and is confident of not only becoming 100% self sufficient but exporting &euro;2 billion worth of renewable energy annually by 2020.  Given our geography and natural assets in terms of wind and wave &mdash; the Scots are concentrating mostly on wind power &mdash; we have a realistic target to aim at.  We too ought to be aiming not only at becoming self sufficient in renewable energy but in becoming a net exporter within 20 to 25 years.  That is an ambitious, and some might say unrealistic target, given that we are importing almost 90% of our energy requirements in the form of expensive and potentially unpredictably sourced fossil fuels.  However, I believe it is well worth pursuing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan to the Seanad.  I add my full support for this Bill.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this topic.  I urge the Minister of State to listen to the valid points that have been raised by Members from all parties.  It is imperative that we introduce restrictions on the siting of wind turbines so close to people&rsquo;s homes.  I too, like my colleague Senator John Kelly, have been inundated with e-mails from all across the country on this issue, and specifically from the residents of my own area of Dundalk, where it is proposed to erect five huge wind turbines in Rockmarshall farm.</P>
        <P>I must point out, everybody is biased about his or her part of the county, that the Cooley Peninsula and the area around Rockmarshall, where it is proposed to site these wind turbines, is one of the scenic parts of the country.  As some of my colleagues have said, firms come along and decide to put in for planning permission but the scenery of the location must be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>The height of the proposed turbines for Rockmarshall farm is 390 ft., which is twice the size of Liberty Hall.  Can anyone imagine living 500 m from a development of that height?  Under the current legislation, the company would be able to build that close to a dwelling.  I have been reliably informed that 120 families in the area would live within 500 m of the proposed development, the distance of the present guidelines.  This would have an impact on the value of their houses and would have an effect on people.</P>
        <P>I would not like to live that close to a wind farm and I do not think anybody else would.  Anybody who has ever stood near a wind turbine will appreciate the noise that emanates from it and I know that just 800 m from the proposed turbines in Rockmarshall lives a family with two autistic children.  Anybody who is familiar with autism will realise that sensitivity to noise is a major part of this condition.  Such a development, as it stands, is hazardous and its proximity to houses impedes on peoples&rsquo; human rights.  The sheer force of the size of these turbines must be taken into account when planning these wind farms.  There is no doubt we will live to regret it if something is not done, just as we regret the erection of ESB pylons and masts so close to residential properties in recent years and learned of the proven health hazard when it was too late.  I welcome the argument put forward by Senator Whelan that the Bill be amended to include pylons.</P>
        <P>I am not opposed to wind turbines offshore or onshore but we need to take into consideration the vicinity and the fact that they are located so close to people&rsquo;s homes.  I appreciate their value as a sustainable energy source but if restrictions are not applied in respect of placing them, they will have a devastating effect not only on the countryside and scenery but on the value of homes.</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P>We need to look at the environmental impact statements. I have seen a number of such statements put forward for some of these farms.  There should be rigid compulsion to ensure they are of excellent quality.  Sometimes they can be vague or blurred but they should be compelled to be of excellent quality and done to a true scale to show exactly how they will impact on the local area.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call Senator Daly, I remind the House that the Minister will be called to reply at 6.05 p.m.  There are five other speakers before the Minister who will have ten minutes.  There are two speakers after the Minister and Senator Kelly will have the right to conclude at 6.25 p.m.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and look forward to hearing her reply on whether she will propose that the Bill move forward to the next Stage.</P>
        <P>This is an interesting Bill.  While we are not opposing it we seek more study of the issue.  This whole area needs to be regulated.  Unfortunately, as we have seen from other issues, whether mobile telephone masts, pylons or wind turbines, we have failed to put in place sufficiently powerful guidelines that have an effect on the organisations and companies concerned.  I am anxious to know whether provision will be made by way of primary legislation or statutory instrument or, alternatively, by the infamous guidelines which, more often than not, are ignored.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that wind turbines and their siting so close to houses have a detrimental effect on families and communities.  As in the case of mobile telephone masts, the guidelines state that they must be located a distance away from residences but they are never used by An Bord Plean&aacute;la as a reason for turning down any particular planning application.  In Kerry there is a one kilometre rule, which provides that any mobile telephone mast must be located more than a kilometre from a residence, as set out in the county development plan.  Given that public representatives include such a provision in the county development plan, I would have thought it would be adhered to but when it goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la that provision is trumped by the Government whereby it wants to roll out broadband and, therefore, planning permissions are granted time and again against the county development plan voted through by elected members.  That is why I am interested to hear what the Government proposes to do with the legislation and whether it will move on to the next Stage.  There is no doubt that primary legislation would give protection to the citizen above the institutions and the organisations and those who would site wind turbines next door to people.</P>
        
        <P>I have been on wind farms and have visited people&rsquo;s houses located in the middle of wind farms. It is like being at an airport when they are going at maximum capacity and there is nothing anybody can do about it.  The previous Government, of which I was a member, failed to regulate the issue.  While the legislation is welcome, will the Minister of State support it, or give platitudes to the Senator, say it is a nice idea and kick it back to the Department?  Some 75% of the laws in any given year are made by way of statutory instruments.  The Bill accounts for only 25% of the laws made in Ireland in any given year.  It goes to show that the country is run by the Departments rather than the legislators.</P>
        <P>With respect to the Senator, subject to some amendments we would like to support the legislation but I am not sure we will be allowed do so.  I do not think anybody in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will allow this to happen and will put forward various reasons it should not happen.  That is why the Seanad and the other House only account for 25% of the legislation passed in any given year.  That in itself is a tragedy but <Col N="59"/>the Minister of State will be told the issue can  be dealt with by statutory instrument.  The statutory instruments will be lobbied on by the people in the industry, by former members who are being paid to tell the Minister of State it can be done by means of guidelines.  Guidelines are useless.  Primary legislation means the citizen can be defended.  We have guidelines on so many things and they are ignored time and again.  There is also no recourse.</P>
        <P>We have had a debate on media standards.  We have a press council and Senator Norris told the House how ineffective it is, given that there is no recourse.  With legislation the issue can be taken to court and one can get a judge to make a decision.  That is what primary legislation is about.  I am afraid the Minister of State&rsquo;s script will not be as encouraging as we would hope and it will go back to the Department and sink into the mire.  The Bill will not be passed but the statutory instruments will continue to come into force.  However, we do not examine them because there is no provision to oversee them in an effective manner.  I will listen to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and the contributions of colleagues.  Subject to amendment we will support the legislation but will we be given the opportunity to do so?</P>

I wish the initiative had been taken a long time ago by members to protect people who have had mobile telephone and broadband masts erected in their back garden.

	<P>I am not opposed to wind turbines and the masts but I am opposed to their location.  They are being located too near to people&rsquo;s houses.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the precautionary principle which was introduced in Europe to protect people&rsquo;s health but it is never applied.  Every time a person appeals against the erection of masts under the precautionary principle, it is never applied.  I cannot stand here and claim mobile telephone and broadband masts cause cancer.  Equally, I cannot claim they do not cause cancer and neither can any other Member.  We should apply the precautionary principle and take the time to investigate planning applications for wind turbines fully.  As Senator Daly said, in Kerry we adapted what is known as the 1 km rule into the county development plan.  Accordingly, every planning application for a mobile telephone or broadband mast that was within 1 km of a residence was turned down by the county council.  Subsequently, these applications went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which overturned every refusal and granted planning permission to the operators.</P>
        <P>We need to protect people&rsquo;s homes and health.  In a scenic area, An Taisce will protect the environment and its amenities.  Who will protect the people?  We are elected by the people to present their views here.  Their view is they do not want these wind turbines next to their houses.  I cannot blame them.  Members have outlined various concerns already such as Senator Moran who explained how wind turbines can affect autistic children.  I believe the precautionary principle should always be applied.  In one area in Kerry a wind farm interfered with the television reception of a local resident.  I presume this problem was sorted but how do we know?</P>
        <P>County development plans dictate where wind farms can be set up.  One only has to check any county development plan to find they already have designated areas for wind farms without <Col N="60"/>the locals getting a say in it.  It is at local level at which we must determine whether the land is suitable for wind farms.  Once land is designated in the county development plan for a wind farm, an operator can set one up with the people having no say in the matter.  It is just imposed on people.</P>

        <P>I want to bring the Minister&rsquo;s attention to a proposal for a wind farm on the Cooley Peninsula, already referred to by Senator Moran.  If the Minister can visualise the beautiful Cooley Peninsula, she will know the site of this proposed wind farm at Rockmarshall Mountain is in a highly scenic area.  The mountain itself is only 250 m.  The proposal is to build five turbines at a certain distance on that mountain which will protrude over its highest point.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, both Senators Kelly and Moran must have been reading my script because I also wanted to draw a comparison with the Spire on O&rsquo;Connell Street.</P>

	<P>The Spire is 121 m high while Liberty Hall, once the tallest building in the country and now the third tallest, is 60 m high.  These proposed turbines, as already said, will be twice the height of Liberty Hall.  I did not realise how high the proposed turbines at Rockmarshall will be.  Can the Minister visualise the impact they will have on the local area, which is highly scenic and a tourist attraction?</P>
        <P>While the turbines will be eight miles from my home and so outside the 2 km zone recommended by this Bill, the people in the area have concerns about the noise, health and other implications of these turbines.  We must listen to their concerns and protect them.  Two private residences will be 502 m from the nearest mast.  Up to 120 houses will be within 1,500 m of the said development.  My concern is these will be located on a side of mountain forested by Coillte which means it gave its approval for the project.  It was not a question of money being paid to a local farmer as was mentioned by Senator Kelly already.  The Bill proposes that the turbines planned for this location should be a minimum distance of 2 km from the nearest house.  This is unattainable in Rockmarshall unless we shift the residents away from the site.</P>
        <P>I support this Bill and believe it is important it applies uniform standards to wind turbines.  County councils have different guidelines which vary from county to county.  We should establish uniform criteria on building distances and so forth for all local authorities.</P>

        <P>I congratulate Senator Kelly, a new Senator, on his excellent Bill.  I am not sure if he had the assistance of the drafting service but I want to take the opportunity to welcome the fact that for the first time we now have the assistance of a drafting service in this House.  It is a very important service of which I am availing currently.</P>
        <P>I am all in favour of wind turbines and we are moving to 16% of our energy needs being created by them.  It is a new and welcome phenomenon, as is wave power.</P>
        <P>I am not sure if it has been mentioned by previous speakers but I was greatly moved recently by the story of a woman with an autistic child whose neighbour erected a wind turbine right beside their boundary.  This neighbour had a field an acre away which could have been used as an alternative location.  The noise from the turbine activated the most severe problems for her autistic child.  As I said this morning, there is under the Constitution the right to the proper enjoyment of one&rsquo;s home.  I accept wind turbines are very beneficial and it is great to generate electricity in these difficult times, saving money for oneself while feeding surpluses to the grid along with getting back some payment.  That is wonderful, but could we please have respect for neighbours?  That is the only thing I wish to say.  If Senator Higgins wishes to take the time that is left, that is fine.  If she wants to take her own time, that is equally fine.  I have made the point I wanted to make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House to hear our views on the proposed introduction of legislation for wind turbines.  This is an issue which has concerned both my Labour Party colleagues and I to the extent that we felt strongly about rectifying the current situation.  I commend them on showing unequivocal foresight and unanimity on progressing the matter.</P>
        <P>As we are all aware, the erection of wind turbines is a cost-effective way of generating electricity in households.  Wind is free and, arguably, there is a lot of it in this country.  Once one pays for the initial installation of a turbine, electricity costs are significantly reduced.  Not only that, there is a potential for proprietors of turbines to export any excess electricity to their local grid and get paid for it.  However, as I understand it this country is somewhat behind in terms of capitalising on this resource and we must rectify the situation as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Colleagues have referred to a number of negative attributes attaching to the erection of wind turbines.  That is why as a group we consider it necessary for further regulation of them.  The noise of the blades rotating can be akin to bass notes from loud music or the sound of a helicopter at a distance.  A group of turbines rotating together can produce sounds of greater effect when they synchronise.  There is no doubt that residents in surrounding areas can be disturbed and distressed by such.  To date, without targeted regulation there has been no success in reducing the noise, which can continue largely unabated day and night for extended periods and can sometimes travel several miles.  A well-established body of evidence has been collected worldwide that demonstrates the harmful effect of turbines for at least some of those who live close to them.  In the United Kingdom, UK, in particular, complaints are made continuously to the environmental health officers of local authorities such that in February 2009 the renewable energy foundation produced a roll of 27 out of 133 wind farms in the UK which had given rise to noise complaints.  The number subsequently rose to 46 out of 217 complaints relating to <Col N="62"/>wind farms in April 2010, with 285 complaints in total having been recorded.  This must be of concern to us given that there are recognised health problems arising from such, for example, pulse irregularity and sleep disturbance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Not only does the erection of wind turbines or wind farms affect people&rsquo;s health but they also affect the geography of an area and its flora and fauna.  We only have to look at the situation in Derrybrien in County Galway where there was a landslide in 2008 as a result of a failure to carry out an environmental impact assessment prior to granting permission for a wind farm there.  Approximately 450,000 cu. m of peat became dislodged over a 32 km area which led to the pollution of a river in the area killing 50,000 fish.  At the very least we need to legislate for this finding by the European Court of Justice in order that a disaster of this magnitude will never affect any part of this country again.</P>
        <P>However, while we debate the regulation of wind turbines we must be mindful that debate over governmental regulations should be more broad based and focus more on engineering issues and robust scientific evidence and less on politics.  We must call for more research into aerodynamic modulation which is the swishing noise made by turbine blades.  Currently, the causes and treatment of the problem needs further research.  Turbines are designed in all shapes and sizes and we must take that into account when framing legislation.  We must also go further than the current Bill and look at the situation in Scotland whereby it is not permissible for anyone to erect a wind turbine farm within 2 km of the edge of cities, towns and villages.  We should look at that as being a standard bearer for all wind farm developments in this country in the future.  It is essential that we retain such a separation distance in order to curtail visual impact.  While impacts vary considerably depending on the scale of projects and the proposed location it is imperative that we ensure that we do not allow for significant long-term detrimental impact on the amenity of people living nearby.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is welcome to the House.  I wish to preface my contribution by saying that I got this brief only six or seven months ago and it is an acquired knowledge at this stage.  There are few jobs in wind energy.  There is the job of bringing in the turbine and erecting it and then it only requires to be maintained once a year, which means that few jobs are created in the management and maintenance of wind turbines.  The work is predominantly done by German and Danish companies.  We have a terrible habit in this country of getting an idea and going for it bald-headed.  We must look more broadly at alternative energy and consider combined heat and power plants which would burn timber and biomass as they would create much farm income.  We must be careful that we do not put all our eggs in the wind basket because it will not produce the jobs we need.</P>
        <P>REFIT 3 provided permission to be granted for wind farms around the country that will never be built because they are on special protection areas, SPAs, and special areas of conservation, SAC, there is no planning permission and the people involved do not own the land although they own the quota system for them.  Those wind farms cannot be built.  I do not understand how we will meet the targets to which we have committed.  We should examine that issue given that we are a year in government and perhaps consider district heating and power plants.  I can provide the Minister with information in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am in favour of the general direction of the Bill.  There is a growing fear in certain parts of the country that local communities will be imprisoned by their close proximity to large wind turbines and that the landscape will be blighted by miles and miles of wind turbines.  That is the result of bad planning and the conditions that were set down when the Gate 3 process was laid down.  Serious lessons must be learned.  The Bill must set down standards that will recognise the rights of citizens.  It is proposed to erect up to 47 turbines in the beautiful village of Doon<Col N="63"/>beg, some up to a height of up to 415 ft., only 500 m from some of the local houses.  In Moneypoint, which is not too far from the village of Doonbeg, the ESB proposes to erect another seven turbines up to a height of 515 ft.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware that I have spoken in the House previously on the need for this country to move away from a 90% dependence on imported fossil fuels to produce our energy requirements and our need to move to renewables.  With some of the best natural resources in the world, namely, wind &mdash; which we are using &mdash; wave, tidal, hydro and biomass forestry, we can reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  We now import approximately &euro;6 billion worth of imported fossil fuels every year.</P>
        <P>I fully support the Government policy outlined in the programme for Government:</P>
        <P LI="1">We will ensure that future wind farms are built in locations where wind regime is best and that they are built in large numbers or in clusters to reduce the cost of connection to the grid under new plan led Gate 4 process as opposed to the existing developer led system.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P FLI="0">Planning is key to how this is will be achieved.  We have the wind resource and it should be harnessed but we must listen to what people on the ground have to say in areas where wind farms are planned.  No one wants to wake up some morning to find that a construction crew has arrived in the next field to erect a large turbine.  Local authorities such as Clare County Council can identify areas where the least amount of impact can be achieved on residents.  That is already being done.  The distances that are listed in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill make sense but we must be careful about how this would affect our need to reduce the amount of overhead power cables erected.  We cannot end up with a situation of single turbines being erected in the countryside miles apart from the next one and a sky line that has a lattice of power lines linking them up.  That would not make economic sense and it would destroy the appearance of the countryside.  Those who want to build wind farms must consider how they will compensate residents for any loss of value to their homes from the construction of a new wind farm in close proximity.  We must ensure a high degree of fairness when these issues are being addressed.</P>
        <P>We must bear in mind that this country has binding commitments with the EU on the amount of energy we must produce from renewables by 2020.  Wind is only part of the mix.  There is the potential for considerable job creation between the construction, maintenance and in certain locations the fabrication of wind turbines for the domestic and export market.  C&amp;F are currently constructing turbines.  In its 2011 to 2050 wind energy roadmap report the SEAI estimates: &ldquo;We have the potential to create 20,000 jobs in the installation operation and maintenance of onshore and offshore wind farms in Ireland by 2040.&rdquo;  However, I question whether it is possible to deliver the number of jobs specified.</P>
        <P>This generation is the guardian of the landscape and, as such, we must protect it but we must also develop it for future generations.  That can be done if we consider the environment and come up with ways to have the least possible impact on it.  New ways of generating power and heat should be a major element of this plan.  Combined heat and power district plants, which use locally grown timber and biomass, are used worldwide.  I firmly believe that local authorities should also be considering potential areas in close proximity to industrial estates where these plants would get the green light to go ahead.  Currently, in the UK approximately 6 GW of power is generated by combined heat and power plants.</P>
        <P>Mr. John Sauven, director of Greenpeace, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Energy technologies like industrial-scale CHP beat nuclear and old-style coal plants on every front.  They&rsquo;re cheaper, they&rsquo;re much quicker to construct, they&rsquo;ll cut more carbon <Col N="64"/>emissions, they could halve gas imports and they won&rsquo;t leave behind an expensive radioactive legacy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It makes sense that we should build clean power plants beside the end user, as this would reduce the need for miles of new power lines criss-crossing the country between existing stations.  Areas that are zoned as industrial or commercial could be the sites of the new plants.</P>
        <P>If there is one thing that this country can do, it is to grow things.  Our temperate climate allows us to grow trees and biomass well.  Land that is not suitable for grazing could be used to grow crops that could be converted into energy.  Significant low-carbon biomass can supply a significant percentage of our renewable energy.  We need to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we produce annually.</P>
        <P>Wind power has one major disadvantage &mdash; what happens when the wind is not blowing?  One would need a pumped hydro facility &mdash; one can store electricity from such a facility, but not from a turbine &mdash; in close proximity when wind speeds are low.  On the other hand, wood biomass power plants can operate 24 hours per day all year round and are not intrusive on the landscape if they are sited in close proximity to their customers.</P>
        <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  It should form part of where we go from here in our drive to develop green energy.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, to the House and thank her for attending throughout the debate.  Her presence has been useful.  I am glad to be involved in this debate.  I wish to pay tribute to Senator Kelly, who has pioneered the Bill on behalf of the Labour group with a bit of help from some of us.  To respond to Senator Norris, the Bill would have benefited from greater consultation with more drafters, but we wanted to put the issue on the Seanad&rsquo;s legislative agenda and, importantly, to ensure that the Bill&rsquo;s principles were accepted at governmental level.</P>
        <P>As Senator Kelly stated, the Bill is based largely on legislation tabled before the House of Lords by Lord Reay.  The concept is the same and quite straightforward, namely, one should incorporate into general planning a rule about the proximity of wind farms and wind turbines to residential houses.</P>
        <P>Our Bill is not against wind energy, a point that other Senators have made.  We are in favour of developing renewable and sustainable energy sources.  As someone who has been involved with Friends of the Earth Ireland since its founding, I am strongly in favour of developing renewable energy sources, including wind and wave energy.  Offshore installations in particular possess significant potential.  I am also one of those unusual people who find wind turbines quite beautiful to look at, albeit from a distance.</P>

	<P>I accept that I do not live near one.  We are not against wind turbines.  Far from it, as we are optimistic about wind energy&rsquo;s potential.  The programme for Government accepts that, while we want to develop and expand our reliance upon renewable energy sources, we must avoid a detrimental impact upon the people living near them.  In this light, the Bill aims to impose a reasonable restriction on the placing of wind turbines in close proximity to houses.  It also recognises that there may be serious noise pollution and health issues for people living in close proximity to them, as Senator Kelly mentioned, as well as a visual impact.  Others <Col N="65"/>have spoken strongly about the detrimental impact of wind turbines that are located too close to homes.</P>
        <P>We hope that the Bill will be accepted and that this principle will be expressed into binding law by the Government.  The principle is accepted across the House.  We are delighted to see the support coming from both sides of the House and I am grateful to other Senators for their comments.</P>
        <P>In introducing the Bill, we also wanted to make a point about the use of the Seanad as a genuine Chamber for proactively introducing legislation on issues such as quality of life as well as other issues on which the D&aacute;il might not be focused.  This is the second Bill that the Labour group has introduced in the House.  The first was accepted by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and had to do with civil registration, in particular the registration of humanist wedding ceremonies.  Prior to this term, the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill 2011, which is about to conclude in the D&aacute;il, was initiated as a Private Members&rsquo; Bill and was accepted by the Government.  There is a powerful precedent for the use of the Seanad in introducing this sort of legislation and debating it in a collegial and constructive fashion.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s support in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and am delighted to contribute to this debate.  I commend the Labour Party on introducing this Bill.  I support accelerating the green energy resolution.  Renewable energy reduces dependence on fossil fuels, increases security of supply and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, thereby creating environmental benefits, delivering green jobs to the economy and contributing to national competitiveness.  As has been stated, we import approximately &euro;6 billion worth of energy derived from fossil fuel.  It is important that we put the necessary mechanisms, policies and legislation in place to promote green energy.</P>
        <P>According to the Irish Wind Energy Association, IWEA, Ireland&rsquo;s total capacity is 2,031.25 MW, which is generated by 170 wind farms in 27 counties.  The west has a predominantly higher capacity for onshore wind energy than the east coast does.  This is only natural, given our exposure to the western seaboard.</P>
        <P>This Bill will facilitate a system of gaining planning permission for wind turbines.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been identified as the relevant authority in this regard.  It is important to set a minimum distance between wind turbine locations and residential properties.  Section 4(3) states: &ldquo;the minimum distance requirement applies to each wind turbine generator individually.&rdquo;  This is necessary and will ensure that no erected wind turbine will unduly encroach on residential properties, including farm houses.  Section 4(6) adequately addresses this requirement in respect of wind turbines of less than 25 m in height.</P>
        <P>Section 5 seeks to safeguard home owners from being unlawfully coerced into agreements to erect wind turbines close to their homes.  There must be written agreement in those exceptional circumstances in which a wind turbine&rsquo;s location does not meet the minimum distance requirement.  This is a practical proposal.  This legislation will minimise the negative effects that wind turbines could have on properties and home owners.</P>
        <P>I will address the question of renewable energy.  The National Renewable Energy Action Plan, NREAP, sets out the Government&rsquo;s strategic approach and concrete measures for delivering Ireland&rsquo;s 16% target under Directive No. 2009/28/EC on the promotion of energy from renewable sources.  The development of renewable energy is central to overall energy policy.  While 2020 is rapidly approaching, plans and targets are being devised at EU level for 2030 and beyond.  The challenge to promote renewables will not end in 2020.  The decisions <Col N="66"/>and actions taken up to that point will pave the way beyond for a resourceful and efficient use of onshore and offshore renewable energy.</P>
        <P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, report &ldquo;Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020&rdquo; estimates that wind energy will account for 85% of our renewable energy by that year.  Jobs are directly and inextricably linked with the promotion of renewable energy.  Giving projects the green light will create jobs for architects, engineers, suppliers and construction workers.  There should be further positive public acceptance campaigns to ensure that communities and interest groups can appreciate the benefits of such projects in their local areas.  Wind generating companies are prepared to put a percentage of their profits into communities, for example, GAA and soccer pitches, churches, schools and so on.  This is a positive approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Labour Party for introducing these proposals and look forward to their enactment at an early date.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me time at short notice and just prior to the Minister of State, who I thank for attending.  I will lend my support to Senator Kelly&rsquo;s Bill on wind turbines.  I will also echo Senator Bacik&rsquo;s comments on the use of the Seanad in introducing ideas and concepts that the D&aacute;il cannot take on board, given the number of other issues that it must address.  Senator Daly expressed concern that the legislation would be submerged in the Department.  It will take time for planning regulations to change in reflection of our changing communities.  Five or ten years ago we were not discussing whether wind turbines should be located beside people&rsquo;s homes or farms.  As someone who grew up with an understanding of the concept of bungalow blitz and the nightmare of bungalows spreading in an unplanned manner across rural Ireland, I hope the Government will find a way of incorporating this Bill into planning law so that we will not face some kind of turbine terror in 20 years&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>We are right to be excited about the potential for green energy and green jobs in this country but we should not lose sight of the need to exercise care with our planning.  This proposal is only the beginning of a debate on the many issues that the Government will have to take on board in the context of planning for wind turbines and other sources of green energy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kelly for bringing forward the Wind Turbines Bill 2012, as well as speakers on all sides of the House for their constructive remarks on specific issues relating to the Bill and more general issues pertaining to sustainable and renewable energy.  My specific remit as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is in planning but much of this debate revolved around the more general issue of supply of energy.  As Senator Barrett noted, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is carrying out a review of this area.  The question that arises for me, however, is whether we should use guidelines or primary legislation to govern our planning decisions.  I am happy to engage Senators on that question.</P>
        <P>The issue of wind energy specifically and the wider related matters of energy security, emissions reduction, economic renewal by harnessing our abundant renewable energy sources and job creation are high on the Government&rsquo;s agenda.  We have set challenging international and domestic targets in this area but are preparing to meet them head on.</P>
        <P>Under the renewable energy directive to which Senator Comiskey referred, Directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland was set a binding national target by the European Union of ensuring that 16% of all energy consumed will be from renewable sources by 2020.  National targets of 40% <Col N="67"/>electricity, 12% heating and cooling and 10% transport are commensurate with our overall target.  Renewable energy supplies of approximately 1,800 MW are currently operational, with just over 1,500 MW coming from wind power, 240 MW from hydro-generation and 30 MW from biomass renewable generation.  Operators of a further 1,000 MW of new renewable generation from the gate one and gate two group processing series have signed grid connection offers and are awaiting grid connection, mainly in the next year or two.  As part of the gate three process, offers amounting to an additional 3,900 MW have issued to renewable generators.  This quantum of renewable generation is in line with achieving Ireland&rsquo;s target.</P>
        <P>While wind energy development has been taking place in Ireland for some time, ocean technologies are still at the research and development phase and wave energy devices do not operate on a commercial scale anywhere in the world.  Nevertheless, our universities and the Marine Institute are pursuing research and other initiatives in the ocean energy sector and a test site for devices has been established in Galway Bay.  The eventual intention is to be able to test full scale grid connected pre-commercial wave energy prototypes and to facilitate the achievement of this goal the ocean energy development unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has been pursuing a strategy of developing a site where this testing could take place.</P>
        <P>The importance of planning for this type of development is fully recognized by the Government.  The programme for Government states that a future gate four, if required, will be plan-led.  In other words, future wind farms are to be built at locations where the wind regime is best and in numbers or clusters to reduce the cost of connection to the grid.  Clearly, our ambition in the area of renewable energy requires that our planning system is properly equipped to play its part in a way that achieves the optimal balance between the delivery of key national energy infrastructure and the land use impacts of such development on local communities and the environment.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly is proposing the introduction in primary legislation of binding distance requirements from private homes with the specific distance being determined by reference to turbine height.  The Bill is closely modelled on a Private Members&rsquo; Bill presented to the House of Lords last June, albeit with some lessening of the required distances for each of the four size categories of turbine.  I appreciate the concerns that have prompted Senator Kelly to bring this Bill before the Oireachtas and I commend him on his work.  I agree with Senators Bacik and O&rsquo;Keeffe that the Seanad is an appropriate venue for bringing forward this type of legislation.  However, we need to consider whether legislation, particularly when legislating in this manner, is the most appropriate way to address those concerns.  I advise Senator Daly that I am keeping my mind open on that question.</P>

	<P>That was important legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not be too cynical about it.</P>
        <P>There are at present no specific conditions in the legislation covering the distance from sensitive properties, including houses, at which wind turbines should be sited.  I understand that the issue was considered when the existing wind energy guidelines were prepared in 2006 but it was decided that it would be impractical and inappropriate to set a minimum distance because distance alone does not dictate noise levels from wind energy developments.  A wide range of other factors can also impact on noise, including background noise levels, topography, local climatic factors and type and height of turbine.  A number of Senators raised the issue of valuing the beauty of places like the Cooley Peninsula, north and west County Clare and Connemara.  That factor also needs to be considered.  If a decision was made to legislate or to impose rigid criteria in respect of one of these factors, it would be necessary to impose binding specifications in respect of all of them.  We should consider the practicality of introducing binding legislation rather than guidelines.  I refer to guidelines rather than statutory instruments in this context because, as Senator Daly will be aware, guidelines are already in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Statutory instruments are slightly more powerful.  Guidelines are only worth the paper on which they are written.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The guidelines state, &ldquo;[i]n general, noise is unlikely to be a significant problem where the distance from the nearest turbine to any noise sensitive property is more than 500 metres.&rdquo;  They advise planning authorities to seek evidence that the types of turbine proposed in a particular development will use best engineering practice in terms of noise suppression and provide specific limits to permissible increases in noise above background noise from wind energy developments to protect neighbouring properties.  The current system, therefore, provides for a degree of specificity and uniformity across all planning authorities while also leaving the final decision in the hands of local decision makers, who will have the benefit of submissions and observations from third parties.  There is a national background but also the guidelines would suggest some provision to listen to arguments at local level.</P>
        <P>The Bill would effectively take away the scope a planning authority has to apply its knowledge of the local factors and circumstances that might make a site especially suitable for wind energy.  For example, a site might have such other factors as topography or the presence of other buildings mitigating noise impacts.  By introducing mandatory minimum distances we would effectively prohibit a planning authority from considering these thereby ruling out development that may otherwise be acceptable or even desirable from a broader energy policy perspective.</P>
        <P>While planning legislation, both primary and secondary, is highly detailed and process driven, the forward planning process must provide an enabling framework for planning authorities to take the right decisions locally.  Generally speaking, matters of technical detail such as noise or electromagnetic interference are dealt with under planning guidelines or in the development management sections of development plans thereby allowing for these issues to be properly addressed in the local context.  While the task of reviewing or producing planning guidelines is not a simple one, it is generally less complex and onerous than amending or preparing primary legislation.  Guidelines therefore allow for the establishment of flexible parameters within which developments can take place taking account of changing circumstances and technical advances.  One of the Senators made the point that technical advances are constantly being made in these areas.</P><Col N="69"/>
        <P>I also have a concern over the degree to which the proposed approach could impact on our ability nationally to meet the targets we have set for renewable energy and on the capacity of the sector to create and sustain jobs.  The imposition of the distance limits set out in the Bill would inevitably limit the number of sites where wind energy developments could be located.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Kelly on bringing this very important issue to the House and on all the positive contributions made.  The issue for me is whether primary legislation is appropriate.  Residential amenity is a key consideration in the planning system regardless of development class.  I welcome the Bill and the way in which Senator Kelly and other Senators have addressed some of the concerns being articulated on the impact of wind energy development on residential amenity and other factors such as health.  I will consider all the points made here and I look forward to engaging with the Seanad further on these issues.  I am not opposing the Bill.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s final words were that she was not opposing the Bill, which I appreciate.  I was getting worried that she was complimenting me so much that she might have been killing me with kindness.  One way or another we need to legislate for this issue.  The debate focused on whether we were so concerned about meeting our green energy targets that we might disregard the rights of the ordinary citizens.  I do not want their rights to be forgotten.  All the Senators in the House supported the Bill, for which I thank them.  At times the debate turned into a discussion on renewable energy which is not the remit of the Minister of State, for which I apologise.  However, as the matters are intertwined it is hard to get away from it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I reiterate that we do not oppose green energy and are very much in favour of it.  Senator Leyden mentioned some wind farm developments in my county.  Sliabh B&aacute;n is the most beautiful mountain in County Roscommon and a developer wants to destroy it with dozens of wind turbines.  There is an attempt to force windmills on the residential community of Dysart &mdash; they have no rights.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said that when we discuss green energy and windmills, we are no longer interested in habitats, birds and bats, and that special areas of conservation no longer matter.  However, we are banned from cutting turf because of the special areas of conservation.  A few years ago when I was a member of Roscommon County Council, a developer wanted to build a hotel in Boyle, a town that badly needed one.  That development was blocked because of a lesser horseshoe bat and a pine marten.</P>

	<P>Who was the Martin who blocked it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>A pine marten.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe that if we do not play our cards right we could end up with ghost wind farms unless we review the green energy policy as a matter of urgency.  On the importance of the Seanad, I agree with Senators Bacik and O&rsquo;Keeffe that this is the kind of thing we should be doing here.  One Deputy recently said to me when we were discussing the future of the Seanad that if it was not for the Seanad the elderly people in nursing homes today who are long-term smokers would have to go outside the building to smoke.  These were things that the Seanad found to be flawed &mdash; things that the D&aacute;il simply does not have the time to discuss and trawl through.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Much is written about wind farms and I do not want to make too much noise about wind farm development.  However, noise and vibration coming from large wind turbines result in an increase in heart attacks, migraines, panic attacks and other health problems according to <Col N="70"/>research by an American, Dr. Nina Pierpont.  Kevin Myers has written many articles on it.  <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> in Britain stated: &ldquo;Denmark has long been a role model for green activists, but now it has become one of the first countries to turn against the turbines&rdquo;.  Another headline in a British newspaper stated: &ldquo;101 Tories revolt over wind farms&rdquo;.  On 13 February <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> stated: &ldquo;The National Trust [the equivalent of An Taisce here] comes out against the public menace of wind farms&rdquo;.  We need a debate on wind energy so that we do not lose the run of ourselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Conway&rsquo;s suggestion that 2 km should be the distance from residential premises.  I reduced what was proposed in the UK to try to get people to meet us halfway.  My approach was not that because the UK wanted 2 km or 3 km we should go with 4 km.  I reduced the distance considerably to try to get the Government to buy into this.</P>
        <P>It is very important that anybody who has not done so should stand beside a wind turbine.  While it is grand looking at them from a car window, I can tell Senators what it is like standing beside them.  If Senators look out the window they will see a big tree but it is possible to see the big building behind it approximately 200 m away.  If a wind turbine were placed there and I looked out the window all I would see would be the wind turbine and would no longer see the building.  That indicates the scale of these huge wind turbines, beside some of which I have stood.</P>
        <P>I am amused by the suggestion of Senators Daly and Leyden that this is dead in the water.  I know a councillor who keeps reminding me that governments come and go, but the real government is still there &mdash; meaning the Civil Service.  I would be delighted to see where this goes from here.  Along with other Senators we will keep our eye on this issue and will push it because it is important to respect people&rsquo;s human rights.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Is the Minister for Social Protection in a position to consider the provision of social welfare support for once self-employed people who now find themselves unemployed?  As the Minister is aware a large number of people who were formerly self-employed and who are now unemployed are entitled to only a limited range of social welfare supports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The importance of providing support for people who are unemployed or unable to find work by virtue of illness etc. cannot be overstated.  However, this facility is not available to the self-employed.  Self-employed people pay PRSI at the S rate of 4%.  People who come under this category include farmers, professional people, certain company directors, people who run their own businesses, sub-contractors and a range of self-employed people.</P>
        <P>Class S PRSI contributions provide cover for widow&rsquo;s pension, the contributory pension, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and bereavement grants.  However, it does not provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  The Minister will agree that while this cover is welcome, it is limited in scope.  In the past decade, self-employed people have made a considerable contribution to the country and the economy.  It is safe to say that the small and medium-sized enterprises have been the backbone of the country and will remain so.</P>
        <P>If we recover economically there is no doubt the SME sector will lead the way in that recovery.  Unfortunately, we have seen a stark contraction of this sector in recent years.  Many businesses have closed and many self-employed people have found themselves out of work.  They do not appear on the live register.  In the third quarter of 2011, some 12,900 self-employed people lost their jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Extending social welfare protection to self-employed people achieves at least two objectives.  First, it secures a measure of social justice which I believe the Minster has a deep interest in pursuing.  It is not right that self-employed people should have to use their life savings or the earnings of their partners.  This is a matter of fairness.  Second, it reduces the risk for those entrepreneurs who wish to start up their own businesses by providing a safety net.  This makes perfect sense at a strategic level as well.  We are committed to building an indigenous sector based on small- and medium-sized enterprises.  However, we must put in place structural reforms to do so.  Many reforms are needed and I release the Minister is playing her part in this area.  Providing social welfare support for self-employed people should be a part of this process.  I have spoken to many people in the sector who have confirmed that they would be more than happy to pay full PRSI.  I call on the Minister to give consideration to this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Senator stated, self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%.  This entitles them to access long-term benefits such as the State contributory pension and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension.  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in a combined rate of 14.75% per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%.  It may be noted that self-employed workers generally achieve better value for money by paying social insurance compared to employees.</P><Col N="72"/>
        <P Just="Left">The 2005 actuarial review of the social insurance fund found that a self-employed contributor can expect to receive more than ten times what he or she contributes to the social insurance fund compared to the employee who, on average, receives only three times what he and his employer contribute.  This is despite the fact that the range of benefits available to employees is greater.  In this context Senator Landy should note that the market cost of an inflation-linked annuity with &euro;12,000 per year in initial benefits is in excess of &euro;300,000 without any associated survivor&rsquo;s benefits.  The figure of &euro;12,000 is the approximate value of the State pension to which self-employed people gain access by virtue of the PRSI currently paid.  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, to self-employed people would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contributions payable.</P>
        <P>I established the advisory group on tax and social welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the programme for Government.  The advisory group will examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons to establish whether such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  In addition, the actuarial review of the social insurance fund, which is due to be completed in 2012, will examine this matter.  This will be most helpful in the discussion.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on a low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take into account the level of earnings in the previous 12 months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed unemployed claimant of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the means of a husband, wife, civil partner or cohabitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I know how concerned he is about it.  I await the views of the advisory group on social welfare on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for what I consider to be a positive response.  I accept that self-employed people are allowed to apply for means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  However, as the Minister is aware this is a cumbersome process that can take up to six or eight months and in the meantime people have nothing to live on.  In the context of trying to kick-start the economy the Minister will be aware that for every job we can create, we take one person off the live register and save approximately &euro;20,000 per person per year.  Through county enterprise boards and the Leader programme etc. I have been involved in helping people to start up businesses.  The main issue is the concern that if the business is not successful, then they have no fallback position and this is a deterrent for people to start a business.  I call on the Minister to keep this issue live.  I look forward to the response from the group she has set up and from the actuarial review as well.  I hope we can revisit this in the coming months.</P>

	<P>This time last year we were in the run-up to voting day of the general election.  One of the most memorable features of the election campaign for Members on all sides and one of the saddest things was the number of people in construction who were involved in good firms which gave good employment and who found that everything had disappeared.  Many of these are the people to which Senator Landy has referred.  Senator Landy also raised the possibility that people might be allowed to make a voluntary contribution, amounting to the current total of the employer and employee&rsquo;s contributions.  That merits examination <Col N="73"/>because the distress level of self-employed people can be very high.  Also, many of these people ran good businesses and worked hard, particularly those with a construction background, during the boom.  It is important we help them as much as possible to get back on their feet.  I will return to the Senator with information when I have the actuarial evaluation and the report of the advisory group.  I am grateful the Senator has acknowledged that in the current climate there are cost issues of which I must take account.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I submitted this matter to highlight the fact that a young man of 18 years of age in County Clare has been refused disability benefit, although he has been diagnosed with ADHD.  This young man will not work for the rest of his life, because he is incapable of working.  His comprehension ability, delayed reaction and a myriad of other conditions feed into his overall inability to work.  He is hyperactive at times and completely inactive at others.  Anybody who met this young man would know he would never be capable of holding down a job, yet despite medical support he has been turned down for disability benefit.</P>
        <P>I realise, better than anybody, that granting somebody disability benefit is a big step for any government or Minister, because once somebody receives disability benefit, he or she tends to hold it for a long time, unless their circumstances change significantly.  However, there comes a time when common sense must prevail.  Families already under pressure from looking after a person of this age need a break and should not be in a position where they have to fight the system and the Department.  If this family did not provide the care it does to the young man in question, he would be in care and would cost the State significantly more.  We should empower these families rather than be confrontational with them.  While I understand that people have a responsibility to do a job, there comes a time when it is as clear as the day is long that a disability payment is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Disability allowance is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability whose income falls below certain limits and who are aged 16 and are under 66 and who are deemed to be habitually resident in the State.  The qualifying conditions for disability allowance are provided for under Part 3 Chapter 10 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as amended.  In order to qualify for disability allowance a person must be suffering from an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental illness or defect which has continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for a period of at least a year and where, as a result of the condition, the person is substantially restricted in undertaking work which would otherwise be suitable having regard to the person&rsquo;s age, experience and qualifications.</P>
        <P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 10 May 2011.  The medical evidence supplied in support of his claim was referred to one of the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors, who was of the opinion, based on the information supplied, that the person was not medically suitable for disability allowance.  The deciding officer accepted this opinion and the claim was refused and the person was notified in writing of this decision.  Further medical evidence subsequently received from the person was referred to another of the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors, who was also of the opinion based on the information supplied that, while the person suffers from a degree of disability, he is not medically suitable for disability allowance.  The deciding officer accepted this opinion and the original decision to refuse the claim remained unchanged.  The medical opinions on suitability for disability allowance, based upon the medical evidence supplied, were reviewed and confirmed by the chief medical assessor of my Depart<Col N="74"/>ment.  The person was notified in writing of this outcome on 7 February 2012 and of his right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>As set out in the guidance given to the person in the decision letter, if he wishes to appeal this decision to the social welfare appeals office, he should do so in writing stating the grounds of his appeal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept there has been a medical review carried out, but knowing the young man, I would have a different view.  Will the Minister instruct her officials to facilitate this family with an oral appeal allowing it make the case in person, rather than a written appeal which is turned down by letter?  I would be most grateful if the Minister would facilitate an oral appeal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will ask the officials if it is possible to arrange that.  I would like to stress again that with regard to disability, the decisions are made on medical grounds and made by medical people.  This case has been considered a number of times and it is not the social welfare general staff who have made the decision.  The decision has been made on medical grounds.  However, I will certainly advise the officials that the Deputy has requested an oral appeal in this case.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for being here to respond on this matter.  I raise this issue because this week is national awareness week for eating disorders.  I have always had an interest in this area because individuals and families who have been faced with this issue have come to me over the years because they have not known where to turn.  The more one gets involved in this area, the more one realises the lack of services, although there have been some improvements, particularly with the provision of beds for children and adolescents with mental health issues.  Nonetheless, we need greater awareness of this issue and of the need for services at GP and primary care level in the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I pay tribute to BodyWhys, an organisation which carries extensive advocacy work in this area.  By coincidence, it had a briefing for Oireachtas Members today at which it informed us it had in excess of 300,000 calls last year.  This week, BodyWhys has made available a resource for the schools&rsquo; SPHE programme, entitled, Responding to Eating Disorders and Body Image Issues.   This provides information on what an eating disorder is and how it can be recognised.  It explains how teachers can recognise them and respond in the school environment and how best to work with the parents of those affected.  This will be a valuable resource.  The more information we have available, the more individuals, particularly young people, can be helped.</P>
        <P>The statistics involved with eating disorders are frightening.  The average age for the onset of anorexia is 14 years of age and for bulimia it is 17.  However, children as young as nine have been affected by the disorder.  Early intervention and treatment are recognised as the most successful method of dealing with eating disorders.  It is not only girls who are affected, although 1.2% of Irish girls are at risk of developing anorexia nervosa and 2% at risk of developing bulimia.  Males are at risk also, although a smaller percentage of them.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;35 million has been ring-fenced for the provision of mental health services in our community.  This is part of the programme for Government and the promise was repeated in the HSE service plan.  I would like to know how much of this &euro;35 million will be dedicated to services for those with eating disorders and their families.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this important issue, which affects a large number of young girls, in particular, and families.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is responsible for these matters.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to confirm to the House that it is planned that some of the additional funding that was allocated to the mental health area in budget 2012 will be used to support the treatment of eating disorders.  It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes, which are currently being developed.  The three specific areas that will be prioritised in 2012 are the treatment and care of patients with eating disorders, early intervention in psychosis and suicide prevention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A fundamental principle of early intervention for any health condition is that identification, diagnosis and treatment should occur as early as possible to maximise the likelihood that interventions will successfully minimise the burden of suffering.  By strengthening our community mental health teams and enhancing the capacity of primary care to deal with people with mental health issues, it is hoped we will go a long way towards achieving that goal.  Therefore, the &euro;35 million in funding will primarily be used to strengthen community mental health teams in adult and children&rsquo;s mental health services.  It will ensure at least one person from each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.  Over 400 additional staff will be recruited to support initiatives under this &euro;35 million package.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise that the primary care sector has a significant role to play in the management and treatment of eating disorders.  Individuals with eating disorders frequently present to primary care practitioners with complications of their conditions.  Early intervention at this level greatly improves outcomes.  There is a need to enhance the capacity of primary care to recognise, assess and treat a range of mental illnesses within the primary care setting.  To this end, the HSE and Dublin City University have developed a mental health in primary care accredited training programme for primary care practitioners.  The programme aims to give primary health care staff the necessary knowledge and skills to respond to the mental health care issues that arise in primary care.  I understand it has been very well received.</P>
        <P>Services for people with eating orders are also provided in the voluntary sector.  The HSE provides funding to BodyWhys, which is a national voluntary organisation that supports people with eating disorders.  BodyWhys provides a range of support services for people affected by eating disorders, including specific services for families and friends.  BodyWhys also offers a range of supports to health promotion departments throughout the HSE.  This interface provides welcome expertise from the service user perspective.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the additional &euro;35 million that has been provided for mental health in 2012 will ensure that improved services are provided to people with eating disorders.  I accept that the expenditure reductions in 2012 will challenge all areas of the health system to provide continuity of services that are appropriate and safe for patients.  As in other care areas, efficiency and other savings will be required from the mental health service nationally.  This will necessarily involve some rationalisation and reorganisation of services at local and regional level.  We are fortunate that the additional resource which has been made available in mental health gives us an opportunity to prioritise areas for development.  I am conscious that development funding for mental health was diverted in the past.  I assure the House that the Department of Health will work closely with the HSE to ensure the &euro;35 million that has been provided in this case will be used to fund the commitment in the programme for Government to develop the necessary community-based mental health services and the other essential initiatives I have described.</P>

	<P>I am glad the Minister has said, on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, that eating disorders are recognised and that the funding to be provided in the community mental health area will be used to help those with eating disorders.  As this week is eating disorders awareness week, it is important that we are debating this issue and making a public commitment to it in this House.  I thank the Minister for that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I concur with what the Senator said about BodyWhys.  I know of families that have been affected by eating disorders.  It is an incredibly painful issue not only for the individual, but also for the members of his or her family, who feel helpless they watch as an active and lovely young child growing into somebody with a difficult eating disorder.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</P>
