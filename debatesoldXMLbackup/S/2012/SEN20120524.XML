      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, statements, questions and answers on the 2012 sports capital programme, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 1.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes, the contribution of one Sinn F&eacute;in Member not to exceed three minutes and the contributions of all other Senators not to exceed one minute when asking questions of the Minister.  A Supplementary Order Paper will be issued later today to include the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) (Amendment) Bill 2012 once it has passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il.  I have been advised by the Bills Office that the earliest the debate on the Bill can commence in this House is 5 p.m., as previously advised in the schedule issued earlier this week.  If it is not improper to do so at this stage, it is proposed that the contributions of group spokespersons on Second Stage shall not exceed six minutes and those of all other Senators shall not exceed four minutes, with the Minister having ten minutes to reply to the debate, and that Committee and Remaining Stages be taken immediately thereafter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the fiscal compact treaty and the summit discussions which continued into the early hours of the morning.  The news has come from the summit that there will be no changes adopted to the treaty prior to its full implementation across the eurozone.  This is important because it sends a very clear message to the Irish electorate as it prepares to vote next week.  The other clear message stems from last night&rsquo;s news from the National Treasury Management Agency in response to questions put in the D&aacute;il by the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on finance, Deputy Michael McGrath.  That organisation is charged with the responsibility of obtaining money outside the country to fund public services here.  Effectively, if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; next week, it is almost unavoidable that Ireland will not be in a position to obtain money in international bond markets.  That should send a clear message to the people that we need the stability that will be provided by the European treaty and access to the ESM, should we need to access the funds available after 2014.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the Taoiseach to engage in a public debate on the national airwaves before the referendum to outline its importance to the people.  He is the leader of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign.  Our party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, is available to debate the treaty.  He has not received any assurance from the Taoiseach or, indeed, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, to engage in such a public debate on RTE, which has a public obligation to provide for such a debate.  The Taoiseach should reflect on his position over the next 24 hours and engage in a debate early next week.</P>
        <P>Students preparing for leaving certificate examinations will be affected by this morning&rsquo;s comments by the Higher Education Authority that it will issue a report over the summer months that could lead to student registration fees increasing to at least &euro;5,000, with additional charges also proposed, to fund higher education.  This is alarming.  If the proposal is accepted by the Government, it will be in stark contrast to what the Minister for Education and Skills said before the general election, when he categorically ruled out the introduction of third level fees.  Those words now ring hollow.  Will the Minister implement the recommendations of the Higher Education Authority or not?</P>
        <P>It was announced today that Hewlett Packard is to reduce its global workforce of 350,000 by approximately 30,000, which is an 8% reduction.  There are currently 4,000 employees in Hewlett Packard companies in Ireland.  What discussions has the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, had with the company?  Has he met or had any contact with the company, and if not, why not?  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come to the Chamber and enlighten us as to the discussions that have taken place to date.  Some 4,000 Irish people are worrying as to whether their jobs are secure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s comments regarding the summit and the stability treaty.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are to be congratulated on a successful summit, although the main summit will follow in a month&rsquo;s time.  I like the strong focus on addressing the problems of youth unemployment and infrastructure and on the idea that unused Structural Funds should be placed in a centralised pool for use by countries such as Ireland.   There is a strong package of stimulus measures which, I hope, will be signed off at the next summit in a month&rsquo;s time.  I also like the proposal regarding project bonds.  This is all positive for Ireland and I compliment the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
        <P>What Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said about the treaty referendum is important.  As he said, matters were clarified at the summit.  There has also been clarification from the Referendum Commission.  Everything the Senator said in that regard is true.  The treaty is simply about good housekeeping and good budgeting, which the country needs for the future.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also referred to providing access to funds.  Why should we cut ourselves off from those funds?  If further money is needed, and we hope it is not, it would be stupid not to have that insurance policy in place.  We need funds to look after our social welfare recipients and pensioners and to pay public service employees.  This is a prudent measure.  I am glad matters were clarified beyond all doubt at the summit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a crisis in the way culture and our living heritage is administered by the Government.  This is not about money but about the lack of vision and public consultation in the way our national cultural institutions are being treated in a profoundly secretive and cavalier way.  I am concerned about this and I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, to the Seanad for an urgent debate on the Government&rsquo;s cultural policy.</P>
        <P>As director of a national cultural institution, the Abbey Theatre, I am aware of cutting budgets, rationalising, sharing resources and, regrettably, letting staff go.  All my colleagues in national cultural institutions are trying to achieve this, yet there is no public consultation.  Thirteen organisations are under critical review or will be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished in 2012.  That is a tsunami of desecration and potential undermining of the whole cultural infrastructure of our nation.  The list of these institutions is as follows: the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Archives, the Irish Manuscripts Commission, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, the National Library, the National Museum, the Chester Beatty Library, the Placenames Commission, the Heritage Council and Culture Ireland.  Three of these organisations &mdash; the National Museum of Ireland, the National Archives and Culture Ireland &mdash; have yet to advertise the vacant position of director.</P>
        <P>I was appointed to the Seanad by An Taoiseach because of my work in this area.  My colleagues cannot speak either because they are civil servants or are in the middle of the crisis.  I come here to bear witness for them and to ask the House to invite the Minister to come to the House immediately &mdash; today &mdash; as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should move an amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this the end of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, initiated by the President when he was a Minister, and of the National Archives Act 1986?  Will the merger of the National Archives and the National Library succeed in saving money?  It will not.  I know there can be reductions in costs and more sharing of services, but to abolish or merge organisations without any public consultation or even publicly stated rationale is to be regretted.</P>
        <P>The State is to abolish the National Archives, which was established as the State Paper Office in 1702.  The National Library was founded in 1877.  A merger, in whatever form it takes, will create a new body that will wipe away 450 years of history.  As Mr. Fintan O&rsquo;Toole said, &ldquo;Two bits of the public service that actually work will be dismantled and the nation&rsquo;s memory banks will be entrusted to some as yet unknown entity.&rdquo;  What is the point of promoting Ireland as a nation that supports culture and attracts tourism and of talking about commemoration if we are to dismantle all this?  Probably the most successful cultural project of the past 25 years, with more foreign visitors than many organisations, is the online project of digitising the 1901 and 1911 census returns.</P>
        <P>This morning, I read in <i>The Irish Times </i>that one of our eminent historians, Professor Diarmuid Ferriter, has resigned from the board of the National Library.  This is worrying and a warning to us in this House.  Professor Ferriter, an extraordinary historian who has brought the archive into the folk mind of the way historians now talk about history, said there was &ldquo;&lsquo;little clarity&rsquo; from the Government as to the reason for proposed mergers&rdquo;.  Professor Ferriter also pointed out the irony of the Government working on a decade of centenary commemorations to mark the foundation of the State while it was intent on doing untold damage to the very institutions that are the custodians of so much of that history.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business calling on the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, to come to the House today to discuss this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my honour to second the passionate proposal of Senator Fiach Mac Conghail.  I agree thoroughly with what he is saying.  We are witnessing the dismantling of our cultural heritage.  I recently had the opportunity to visit a number of these institutions and to speak directly to the people in charge.  I know that what Senator Mac Conghail says is absolutely right.</P>
        <P>This is the consequence of the situation we are in.  It comes back to the economy.  I have just come from the conference in Buswells Hotel about the Laura Lynn foundation, which has had its funding cut by 16%.  The foundation helps children who are terminally ill.  This is the consequence of European policies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not media balance in the debate on the treaty referendum.  Deputy Gerry Adams appearing on television will not be a huge benefit for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies Pearse Doherty and Mary Lou McDonald are much more competent Sinn F&eacute;in spokespeople.  However, it is idiotic for RTE to bend the rules and give more time to the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, although he will probably be a disaster too.</P>
        <P>My good friend, Senator Paul Coghlan, spoke about an insurance policy.  This is an insurance policy where the premium will probably exceed the value of the thing insured.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the craziness of it.  We are mortgaging ourselves up to the hilt.  Some of these people should be brought and shown what they are doing to our culture and to institutions that help our children.  It is having an impact right across the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are getting it without a premium.  It is free.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If we look for example at the other issue that was raised, the question of education&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris should be allowed to speak, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not mind interruptions.  On the question of students and free fees, &ldquo;free fees&rdquo; is an ugly dishonest phrase.  It was dishonest on the part of the previous coalition with the Labour Party when it was introduced.  There is no such thing.  It is an oxymoron.  Either education is free or one pays fees.  I pointed that out years ago to students.  I knew registration fees would go up.  They were then a couple of hundred euro, now they have climbed.  If people have a conscience and put the interests of the community and the welfare of the people above the preservation of the institution, and if they accept that as a principle, then they would see that what is necessary is that they are going to have to have fees.  What they should be fighting for is the level of the means test to ensure the small assets that are available are directed at those who most need them.  It is a regrettable situation.  I am in favour of a proper universal free education system.  I am also fully in favour of a totally free universal medical system but I know we cannot have them in the current situation, in which case if one has any human decency at all, one would ensure the most vulnerable are looked after, which is what I would call for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I noticed on posters in Dublin this morning &mdash; fresh shiny posters &mdash; the words, &ldquo;Demand a better deal.  Vote No.&rdquo;  The posters are from an organisation that calls itself Libertas.  Those of us who know about these things know there is no organisation called Libertas.  It is just a front or pseudonym for Declan Ganley.  What is really going on is that Mr. Ganley wants a better deal, not for you or for me, but for Declan Ganley.  He represents&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>May I make a point of order, please&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>May I continue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris may make a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in the most orderly possible way?  It is with no disrespect to my distinguished colleague, but I am surprised the Cathaoirleach did not act, given the tradition that people who are not here to defend themselves should not be named.  I have no time whatever for Mr. Ganley, but he is not here to defend himself and the point could be made about the organisation without naming the individual.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for reminding me of that.  I ask Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe to refrain from mentioning names on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Libertas represents a new phenomenon in Irish politics.  It is called the privatisation of politics.  This is about people whose businesses are shrouded in secrecy providing funding for campaigns, largely in secret, and whose personal business aspirations are sidestepped every time they are raised.  This is a campaign being run for the private aspirations of private people.  I want to know what is going on behind the scenes, in particular with a man called Crispin Odey, who with his wife, Nichola Pease, have been called the Posh and Becks of finance in the UK.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Senator again about naming people who are not here to defend themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed.  I do not know what to say except that it is the truth of the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is out of the bag.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The truth of the matter is that this is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Deputy Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have.  I would like to ask the Leader to deplore what I describe as the creeping privatisation of politics in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>God knows, politicians take enough criticism, some of it warranted, but the idea that individuals with their own private aspirations can use a referendum to further their own ends is a disgrace.  I ask the Leader to condemn it unreservedly on the part of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were good points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy Leader in a position to indicate when the 2012 constituency review will be published?  The commission is chaired by Mr. Justice John Cooke, the Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il, the Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Deirdre Lane, the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, and the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Ms Geraldine Tallon.  It is important the document would be published because there are 165 concerned Deputies.  The 166th Deputy is automatically re-elected so he is not a bit concerned about the issue.  In the Fine Gael manifesto&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is defined by law; it is not a matter for the Deputy Leader.  I am sure the report will be published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been the tradition that there would be a debate in both Houses on the commission report.  That would be in order because there are many people in this House who will be candidates in the general election and who will be successfully re-elected, provided the constituencies are drawn up in a beneficial way to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We note Senator Leyden&rsquo;s renewed interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael manifesto promised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Deputy Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have.  This is the point.  The Fine Gael manifesto promised a reduction of 20 seats as part of the package of Oireachtas reform, but because it required a constitutional amendment, the party decided to drop the matter.  I hope it takes a similar approach in so far as the abolition of this House is concerned.  In the circumstances, such a referendum would probably be defeated as well.  I understand the number of seats will be reduced by approximately six seats.  The margin will be approximately 146 to 153, with the lower number possibly being considered.  It is an important issue for the career of politicians.  I have suffered from the gerrymandering of constituencies.  It was outrageous when Longford was brought in with Roscommon across the border of the River Shannon, joining two provinces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not discussing the issue today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important.  I understand the report has been printed but will not be released until the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;manifesto is out of the way because some Members in this House will not be back because of the situation.  They will be less than enthusiastic about canvassing for a vote in the referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is speculating on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not speculation.  The fact is the commission has signed off on the report and I ask the Deputy Leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a confidential report at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Noone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader of the House to provide time to discuss the report when it is published.  That is all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the news from Europe that there is to be no change to the proposed treaty.  That will bring the necessary certainty to the issue and the importance of the need for the public to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the forthcoming referendum.  Those advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote must take note of it and stop misleading the public.  I support what Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe said about Libertas in particular, which seems to be particularly unfocused when it comes to the referendum.  Its campaign is about all matters in the economy and says nothing about the treaty.  People must realise the treaty will represent stability and has nothing to do with austerity.  The idea of calling it an austerity treaty is flawed.  It is a gimmick.</P>
        <P>I also support what was said by Senator Mac Conghail on culture and arts.  It is startling to hear the institutions it is proposed to close.  I will not repeat what he said about history and the fact some of the institutions have been in existence for 400 or 500 years.  I also call on the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter.  It is of concern that there has been no public consultation on the proposals but at least we could have some consultation on the matter in the House.  I am sure the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, would be more than happy to come to the House.  I doubt he would be in a position to come today.  That is something the Deputy Leader will address.  Debates on arts and culture are welcome in the House but this specific matter is urgent.  I urge that we would have a debate on it in the coming week, if that is possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator Mac Conghail.  I come to the issue from a different perspective than Senator Mac Conghail.  I am very interested in family history and my ancestry and I have done extensive work on it.  I have had the pleasure of directly using the services of the National Archives and the National Library of Ireland.  They have provided exemplary work in this area.  I am also a subscriber to several US and UK publications on family history and ancestry which regularly praise the work of the National Archives or the National Library of Ireland as exemplars of how we should go about researching ancestry and family history.  I, too, was surprised &mdash; shocked, actually &mdash; when I heard Professor Ferriter had resigned.  I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning that he pointed to the irony of the Government working on a decade of centenary commemorations to mark the foundation of the State while it is intent on doing untold damage to the very institutions which are the custodians of so much of that history.  It makes me question whether this is the end of the arm&rsquo;s length principle between the Minister and the national cultural institutions.  Is this the Government&rsquo;s new policy on culture.</P>
        <P>There is an urgency in the issue, for which reason the Minister should attend the House today.  We must address the Government&rsquo;s policy on culture and send a clear message.  We are promoting the Gathering next year and are sending signals around the world.  This is a question of credibility.  The Minister must give the Seanad a clear answer today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will use this opportunity to mark the retirement of Mr. John Behan, the first parliamentary porter to retire from Leinster House.  Tomorrow is his last day but, as today is our last sitting day before then, I want to wish John well and thank him for his service down the years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just come from a briefing providing by the LauraLynn House, the first children&rsquo;s hospice in Ireland.  To hear its stories was heart-rending.  Since that presentation was badly attended by Oireachtas Members, we may reschedule the briefing in the AV room.  In due course, will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Health to attend the Seanad to debate the issue of funding for the hospice, as that appears to be its major issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure that all Members of the House would like to join in wishing Mr. John Behan the best of luck in his retirement.</P>

        <P>Ar an bpointe c&eacute;anna, tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta McGinley, a rinne f&oacute;gra ar&eacute;ir at&aacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach do Chonamara.

        <P>I wish to address last night&rsquo;s elaborate dinner in Brussels where it was, as is said in French, <i>plus &ccedil;a change</i>.  As the Government side has stated, there is no change to the fiscal treaty and we will vote on exactly what we have been debating in recent weeks.  The treaty contains no provisions regarding a growth and stability pact on which to vote.  We can discuss this matter until the cows come home, but we are voting on an austerity package.  We will certainly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>They probably had Brussel sprouts.  We are voting on an austerity package that will lumber us with extra austerity on top of what we are already suffering under the troika deal.  The people have not been hood-winked.  To clarify for the House, the debate that my leader, Deputy Adams, is willing to have is with the leader of the Government&rsquo;s campaign, namely, the Taoiseach.  He would have no problem with debating with Deputy Martin, but we view the latter as the second fiddle or the second-in-command.  We would certainly be willing to have a debate with Deputy Martin at any time and any place Fianna F&aacute;il wanted.</P>
        <P>It is important that we hold another debate on the issue.  Everything is changing day by day.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s rhetoric in recent days has been interesting, in that it appears to be setting the Government up for a fall and laying the blame at the Taoiseach&rsquo;s feet ahead of the treaty&rsquo;s possible defeat.</P>

This issue has been brought to the commission&rsquo;s attention by many households.

Perhaps that is so, but the Minister should investigate.  It may be too late for this referendum, but the policies and procedures that have been laid down in respect of delivering election and referendum literature should be adhered to.  If they have not been adhered to, An Post has broken the contract and we should be seeking the return of some money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I read this morning&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> with great pleasure, as they told of a serious strategic decision, namely, Intel&rsquo;s choice to use Ireland as one of the three locations where it will manufacture its next generation of computer chips.  This is the most significant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It must not be worried about the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;decision in a number of years that a computer company has made regarding Ireland.  The chips will be made at Intel&rsquo;s site in Leixlip.  Some 4,000 Irish people work in Intel.  The building of the new fab unit will create many construction jobs and the development will create many high-tech opportunities.  However, Ireland has a shortage of skills.  I call on the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to the House urgently to discuss the lack of skills that are necessary to take up these jobs in the computer industry.  PayPal in Dundalk needs people to speak 14 languages.  I do not understand why the new F&Aacute;S &mdash; SOLAS &mdash; and the Department of Social Protection cannot get off their you-know-whats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The number of young people who are unemployed and the lack of skills suitable for new jobs are the most serious issues facing us.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Mr. Eamonn Sinnott of Intel and Mr. Barry O&rsquo;Leary of the IDA on their achievement.  Intel&rsquo;s decision is the most significant that has been made in respect of Ireland and the computer processor industry.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator White made a valid point, in that some IT positions have gone unfilled.  However, progress is being made in this regard.  Some of our universities are offering graduates transition courses in IT to upskill them.  The Senator is right, in that a gap needs to be filled.  At a recent EU meeting that I attended, the EU Commissioner for the digital single market pointed out that, by 2015, the EU will lack an incredible 700,000 IT professionals unless we address the gap.  Since 2010, demand has outstripped supply.  A concern that we are encountering on the doorsteps in this treaty campaign is about those who caused the banking crisis.  People are asking when will those who caused the economic crisis, namely, the bankers, company directors, the regulators who did not do their jobs and those reckless in their behaviour, be punished.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to make an important statement which will be necessary prior to the referendum about this?</P>

We would all like to see the justice system moving much faster to resolve some of the ongoing situations.</P>
        <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the clarity that has emerged from the informal European Council meeting last night.  It has obviously confirmed the stability treaty is not up for renegotiation and will not change.  If we reject the treaty, Europe will move on without us and we will not have access to the new European bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.  What is of particular concern is that people who have a vested interest in seeing chaos across Europe and stand to gain financially are getting so much airtime on so many of our radio and television stations.  That is a matter politicians and the political establishment must deal with as my Labour Party colleague said earlier.</P>

	<P>This lady also expressed the importance of our students having a second language.

I know the Minister for Education and Skills has been in this Chamber many times and treats the House with the utmost respect but it is mainly for Bills.  I would like him to attend the House to outline what is happening at policy level in the Department of Education and Skills to promote the teaching of a second language at a higher level in our secondary schools.</P>

        <P>I agree it would be helpful if it were possible for the Minister for Justice and Equality to make a statement to give an indication on the progress the DPP is making in investigating the people who effectively wrecked this economy.  Their recklessness resulted in the bones of 500,000 people being unemployed and another 100,000 emigrating.  It would be helpful if we got an indication from the Garda Commissioner or the DPP on what point are the investigations to bring these people before the courts so they can answer for the crimes that have destroyed this country.</P>

	<P>I just want to comment on the clarification offered by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, yesterday following a helpful parliamentary question by the Fianna F&aacute;il finance spokesperson in the Lower House.  It stated its job to return to the markets next year would be made all the more difficult in the event of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  The NTMA has stated this unambiguously and with certainty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why we should go back and renegotiate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>This follows on from comments made by the IDA chairman.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was on the Pat Kenny radio show this morning, he made some excellent points about how certain agencies, such as the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, were criticised for remaining silent during the evolving crisis of the past few years but are now speaking out.  Certain media and political commentators try to have both sides of the same coin.  They criticise people for remaining silent and for not doing their job, while also criticising other independent agencies when they speak out.  I ask the Deputy Leader to facilitate a debate on this issue.  We have discussed the stability treaty but we should discuss it again.  I am in favour of sitting next week to discuss it.  I am sure that is a widely shared view.  I call for a debate on the role of independent agencies and their public utterances on ongoing and evolving policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of the stability treaty.  His comments were echoed by a number of other speakers.  We welcome the clarity brought to the stability treaty debate.  Following last night&rsquo;s meeting in Brussels, we know there will be no change to the text of the treaty.  I agree with the Senator who welcomed the NTMA comments, to which Senator Gilroy referred, pointing out that it would be more difficult for Ireland to obtain money on the bond markets with a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  That clarity on the consequences of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote is very important.  Many of us hope that will boost the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of the Taoiseach participating in a public debate.  He is leading and playing an active role in informing people about the stability treaty and in conducting debates daily in the other House.  This is the referendum campaign in which most information has been provided.  Therefore, people can be sure about what they are voting for and voting can be carried out in an informed way.  It is not about party political point scoring but ensuring people have the necessary information to make an informed vote and ensuring we pass the treaty which will be a positive step in Ireland&rsquo;s road to recovery.  The Taoiseach is travelling the length and breadth of the country conveying that message and will continue to do so in the coming days before the vote on Thursday.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also raised the matter of third level fees and the issue of funding for third level education.  This is a debate that has been sought on a number of occasions.  We will seek a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on higher education generally, during which we can debate the funding issue and other issues around third level.  I will advise the House as soon as it has been scheduled.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill moved an amendment to the Order of Business to have the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, come to the House today in response to the news that Hewlett Packard is reducing its workforce worldwide.  Such a request is premature and we cannot facilitate such a debate today.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Paul Coghlan who pointed out the prudence of the measures we are seeking to adopt in the stability treaty.  I agree with him in respect of the welcome clarification offered in Brussels last night.</P>
        <P>Senator Mac Conghail raised the issue of projected mergers in some cultural and heritage institutions.  I agree with the Senator that the proposed mergers would have negative consequences for cultural and heritage institutions.  Like the Senator, I was concerned at the announcement today of the resignation of a very eminent professor of history from the board.  I have inquired if the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan, will come to the House at an early opportunity and I have been informed a debate with him has been arranged for 7 June, the first week after the referendum.  It is a planned debate on commemorations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the eminent history professor&rsquo;s clear linking of the decade of commemorations with his decision to resign, I think we will be able to debate the issues the Senator has raised.  I certainly hope we can do that on 7 June.  That debate has been arranged.  I cannot facilitate it today but I have immense sympathy for the points the Senator made.  The mergers were proposed under the previous Government and I hope we can debate them in the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, they were also proposed by the current Government.  The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, is up to his knees in amalgamations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That debate has been arranged.   Senator Norris raised the issue of the LauraLynn Hospice.  I also attended the briefing this morning, as did Senator Marie Moloney and others.  We should facilitate a debate in which we can discuss the issue of funding for the Laura Lynn Hospice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris also raised the issue of students and free fees - I disagree with some of his views &mdash; and health care.  As the Senator is aware the Government is the first in the history of the State to be committed to universal health insurance and to ending the two-tier health system.  There will be universal support for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I await it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe raised the issue of Libertas and asked me to condemn the creeping privatisation of politics.  I condemn the creeping privatisation of politics unreservedly and would go further and say that if any individual, including an individual behind an organisation such as Libertas, has a conflict of interest because he stands to gain financially from the consequences of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, then he should declare that conflict&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader condemn the creep as well as the creeping?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in order that people are aware of the interest he may have and of the conflict he may have in campaigning for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>One could say the same for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I condemn it unreservedly and anyone who stands to gain from a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote financially, for example, if he or she has a company that trades in currency, should declare that conflict.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader extend that internationally?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden raised the issue of the constituency review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As he is not present, the Deputy Leader can ignore him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I should inform the House that Senator Leyden had to attend a committee meeting and conveyed his apologies to me.  He asked when the constituency review would be published.  I understand it has to be published by the end of June and we will have an opportunity to debate it then.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, will be in the House for a debate on a local government Bill on 6 and 7 June.</P>
        <P>Senator Catherine Noone welcomed the news in respect of the treaty negotiations last night, as did Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe.  She also supported the call in respect of the merger of cultural and heritage institutions, an issue I have dealt with.</P>
        <P>Senator Jillian van Turnhout referred to the cultural institutions.  The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, will be in the House on 7 June for a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Marie Moloney raised the issue of the retirement of John Behan.  We all join with the Senator in wishing Mr. Behan well in his retirement and thank him for all his work.  She also mentioned the LauraLynn briefing.  I agree with the Senator that a rescheduled briefing with the LauraLynn foundation, perhaps in the House, would be useful.  We can facilitate a debate in which we would raise that issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the matters of the cultural institutions and the Sinn F&eacute;in motion in the other House concerning Moore Street.  The Senator also sought a debate on the stability treaty.  We facilitated such a debate last Thursday and only 12 speakers, including myself, contributed.  I discussed with the group leaders at the time the issue of having another debate this week.  I was open to that and could have facilitated it.  However, following last week&rsquo;s debate, all the group leaders agreed there was no need for another debate.  As I said yesterday, next week we are better off out canvassing on whatever side.  Neither House is sitting next week given the referendum takes place next week.</P>
        <P>Senator C&aacute;it Keane welcomed the comments of the National Treasury Management Agency.  I was concerned at the information from the Senator that An Post has been asked to ensure no leaflets are included in the Referendum Commission booklet.  I was not aware of that as an issue.  I agree it is an issue that should be examined.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White raised the matter of Intel&rsquo;s choice to use Ireland as one of the three locations where it will manufacture its next generation of computer chips.  That is very welcome and is a sign of confidence that we will maintain a stable and steady path to recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not worried about the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting to note that American companies such as Intel, the chambers of commerce and IBEC have all called for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the treaty next week.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White also called for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to come to the House for a debate on jobs in the computer industry.  We can facilitate such a debate but not today.  The Government has done a lot in terms of reactivation measures to ensure upskilling of the type mentioned by the Senator.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, in conjunction with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, is restructuring F&Aacute;S and unemployment services to ensure more one-to-one connections will be made with those signing on.  An increased number of places has been announced for the Springboard programme.  We have had JobBridge and the action plan for jobs.  A great number of measures are being taken to ensure reactivation and upskilling.</P>
        <P>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames addressed some of the progress made to address the gap in skills.  I agree with her about the gap in information technology skills.  The Senator also called for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, to make a statement on the lack of prosecutions.  I have a lot of sympathy for the sentiments she has expressed.  We all have heard it on the doorsteps many times.  People are very angry that none of the bankers, none of those who caused the economy to collapse, has yet been prosecuted.  However, it is not a matter on which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, can make a direct statement.  We have an independent Director of Public Prosecutions, which is absolutely right and proper.  We also have an independent Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Like all others present, I deplore the delays in arresting and prosecuting individuals.  I am on record in this House calling for the use the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, under which there are a number of more straightforward offences that might well be relevant.  I understand there is great complexity in investigating and prosecuting corporate crimes.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister then answer the questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We can ask him what can be said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, somebody needs to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to understand also that there must be independence for the prosecution authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely, but somebody must inform the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We can all recall the collapse of one high profile prosecution in recent years because a Minister went on air and suggested somebody should be punished, or even convicted and punished.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Do it the right way.  That is what I seek.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We must be careful.</P>
        <P>Senator Diarmuid Wilson supported Senator Fiach Mac Conghail&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  He spoke about the Vita Cortex agreement; we all welcome the settlement reached.  He also called on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to intervene in the Lagan Brick dispute.  I agree with him that there are a number of disputes and that it is a matter of real concern that companies are not making appropriate and proper redundancy payments to their workers.  The specific issue mentioned is one for discussion on the Adjournment with the relevant Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael Mullins also spoke on the issue of the non-prosecution of bankers and welcomed the fact that there was clarity from the European Council in Brussels.  I agree with him in his comments.   I also agree with him in his comments on Sinn F&eacute;in, although his question was more suited to it than to me.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy raised the issue of PayPal and referred to the comments made on the need for a second language.  We are arranging a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills, during the course of which we might ask him to outline his policy and that of his Department on second languages.</P>
        <P>Senator Martin Conway spoke eloquently about the lack of prosecutions of those involved in the destruction of the economy.  Again, I share his sentiments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>

	<P>We will see if anything can be said publicly within the limits of due process.</P>
        <P>Senator John Gilroy mentioned the clarification provided by NTMA which was useful.  I will facilitate a debate on the issue in the coming weeks.</P>

    <Title>Sports Capital Programme 2012: Statements, Questions and Answers</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring, to the House.  Group spokespersons will have eight minutes to speak and Sinn F&eacute;in has three minutes.  Thereafter, questions, limited to one minute, may be put to the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the timely opportunity to address this House on the subject of the sports capital programme.  Senators will be aware that on 28 March I was delighted to launch the first round of the programme since 2008.  The programme is the main channel of Government support for developing sports facilities and purchasing sports equipment for sports clubs and organisations across the country.  The programme aims to foster an integrated and planned approach to developing sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the country.  In particular, its objectives are to assist voluntary and community organisations, the national governing bodies of sport, VECs and local authorities to develop high-quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities in appropriate locations and to provide appropriate equipment to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities; and to encourage the multipurpose use of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and the national governing bodies of sport.</P>
        <P>While I was delighted to have secured funding of &euro;30 million for allocations under this round of the programme, funding which shows the Government&rsquo;s commitment to encourage more people to take part in sport, the level of demand for grants will far outstrip supply.  We will not know how much funding is being sought until after the deadline of 1 June, but I can confidently predict that we will have requests for funding totalling hundreds of millions of euro.  This shows great enthusiasm for the sports capital programme, but it also means we will only be able to allocate a fraction of the funding sought.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>While the overall level of funding distributed through the sports capital programme is sizeable, what is more important is what this achieves on the ground.  Every pitch drained, every sports hall refurbished and every piece of equipment bought allows an increasing number of people to participate in sport to their maximum potential.  We are all aware that sports clubs have a very important part to play in society.  With so many unhealthy distractions for young people today, it is very heartening to see the great efforts being made to encourage young people to get involved in sport.  Participation in sport is good for one&rsquo;s health, it helps build confidence and gives young people a sense of their worth.  It really is a win-win situation for everybody.  Individuals benefit physically and mentally, and communities benefit by having people involved in healthy pursuits that divert attention and energies away from less savoury activities.  The country benefits by people living healthier and more productive lifestyles.</P>
        <P>It is beyond doubt that when my officials begin assessing all of the valid applications, they will face a very difficult task.  That has always been the case, but this year it will be more difficult than ever.  This is the first round of the sports capital programme since 2008, and clubs and community groups have been waiting for this moment with much anticipation.  In every parish in every county, there are people giving their time and energy to sports activities and many of these people are working very hard to provide or improve facilities that are fit for purpose and accessible.  We would love to support every deserving project, but the harsh reality of life is that there are limits to what we can do.  That is why expectations ought to be realistic.  The outcome of this is that there is a huge demand for funding.  While it is great to have secured funding of &euro;30 million, when it is spread out across all 26 counties there will be a large number of disappointed applicants.</P>
        <P>This time around, the programme will also be open to far more clubs and groups than ever before because the strict requirement on land ownership has been relaxed.  Heretofore, all applicants had to own their land or have it on a long lease.  Clubs that could not meet this requirement were ineligible for funding.  This time, we have decided these clubs will now be able to apply for grants of up to &euro;25,000 to upgrade facilities.  I hope that the effect of this change in policy will be most beneficial to clubs in poorer areas.  These clubs typically do not own their own land, nor do they have long leases or any real prospect of buying land in the future.  These clubs will now have to provide only a letter of comfort from their landlord stating he or she is happy to allow the club to use the facility for the next five years.</P>
        <P>In line with the programme for Government, this year&rsquo;s sports capital programme will have a stronger focus on projects which increase active participation in sport, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  Under the programme, pitches will be drained, floodlights will be installed, sports halls will be improved and dressing rooms will be built.  Thanks to these grants, people will have more opportunities than ever to become and stay active in a wide range of sports.  It will also have a positive impact on job creation in construction and related activities.  As many of the grants will be awarded to clubs in rural areas, this boost to the local economy will be very welcome and will have a knock-on effect throughout.</P>
        <P>Another notable improvement in this year&rsquo;s programme is that the minimum amount of matching funding that clubs and organisations will need to provide themselves in order to apply for a grant has been halved since the previous round of the programme in 2008.  Under this round of the programme, groups in RAPID areas will need to raise only a minimum of 5% of the project cost; groups in CL&Aacute;R areas will need to raise only a minimum of 10% of the project cost; and groups in non-disadvantaged areas will need to raise only a minimum of 15% of the project cost.  These are the minimum amounts needed to apply.  Clubs in these areas that provide more than these minimum amounts will improve their prospects of receiving a grant.  Funding is allocated to applicants based on a combination of factors, including population, the quality of applications received, geographical balance and the need to provide a variety of sports facilities.</P>
        <P>In assessing applications, the Department must consider whether the projects are realistic in terms of scale, costs and grant assistance sought.  This year, the maximum grant available for local club or organisation projects will be &euro;300,000.  The rationale for this limit is to try to focus applicants on being more realistic in their projects.  Of course, higher amounts may be allocated to national and regional projects, but with &euro;4 million available for non-local projects, the number of grants above &euro;300,000 will be quite low.  I hope that all applicants will be mindful of the amount of funding available and tailor their applications accordingly.  Ambition, in itself, is a laudable trait, but when spending money it needs to be tempered with realism.</P>
        <P>My staff, in assessing applications, will do their utmost to ensure that we achieve a geographic spread of funding and a spread across a range of sports.  The emphasis, as I have already said, will be very much on participation.  This is, after all, the name of the game.  It is great to watch exciting sports events on television, such as last Saturday&rsquo;s Heineken Cup Final between Leinster and Ulster or the start of the GAA inter-county championships.  I congratulate Leinster on a magnificent achievement in Twickenham and Katie Taylor on winning a world championship for four consecutive years and on qualifying for the Olympic Games.  She is a truly wonderful ambassador for sport, women&rsquo;s sport in particular.</P>

	<P>People will no doubt be glued to their television screens when our national team rightly and proudly retakes its place among Europe&rsquo;s soccer elite in Poland and the Ukraine next month.  It is hard to believe it is 24 years since Ireland took part in the 1988 UEFA European Football Championship in Germany.  We will all take a great interest later this summer when London hosts one of the world&rsquo;s greatest sports events &mdash; the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.  Events such as these offer great entertainment and provide role models for young people taking up sport.  We must always remember that life, especially sport, offers its greatest rewards to those who take part.  Sport is not just about medals and trophies, satellite subscriptions or millionaire lifestyles for the few; it is about people who make the conscious effort to improve their lives and the lives of others in ways that may seem small to some, but which are, in truth, deserving of great acclaim.</P>
        <P>Let me give Senators a couple of examples to show what I am talking about.  My first example is the Special Olympics World Games movement.  It is great to see people with disabilities taking part in the Special Olympics World Games; it is uplifting.  My first job as Minister of State was to go to Athens to see our special Olympians taking part.  I was proud of the way in which they were competing.  This is wonderful.  Our Paralympians will be competing in the summer.  We sometimes forget they lead by example.  They are people with disabilities.  When we talk about the Olympic Games, we sometimes forget about the Paralympic Games.  The participants are great role models for those who have had accidents or who have a disability.  They take part and have won world titles, gold medals and Olympic medals.  They do their sports, themselves and people with disabilities proud.  They show that a disability is not a hindrance to taking part in sport.  I congratulate every one of the participants.</P>
        <P>What would we do without volunteers?  Everywhere I go there are volunteers, men and women, giving of their time and effort.  What would the Government do if it had to pay for such voluntarism?  What would it do if it had to pay for everything done in sport?  It just would not happen.  We should thank those who get involved in sport.  We should praise them at every opportunity and I do so in every speech I make.  There are, however, the hurlers on the ditch and there are plenty of green areas if they want to play.  One should not criticise those doing good for their country.  One should not criticise those doing good for sport.  I say to those hurlers on the ditch that if they want to take part and give of their time to help young people, boys and girls, to get involved in sport, they should just go out and do it.  If they want to hurl on the ditch, they should stay away from those playing in the green areas.  Again, I thank those who give of their time to help.</P>
        <P>Let me say for the media &mdash; of course, they will not be here today and will not listen &mdash; that last year my Department announced two schemes.  Applications were invited from local authorities for shovel-ready projects to provide sports facilities such as multi-use games areas which could be used for activities such as five-a-side football, basketball, tennis and volleyball, mini-pitches and outdoor gym equipment.  There was also the local authorities scheme to upgrade swimming pools to make them energy-friendly.  This scheme has saved a number of pools throughout the country.  Let me say for Independent Newspapers, <i>The Irish Times</i> and those who want to listen that when these applications were placed before me, every local authority which had made an application received funding.  Some local authorities did not have title or deeds to their properties and were refused on that basis.  On swimming pools, there were no decisions to be made.  A number of local authorities made applications.  When we made an offer to them, they considered they would not be able to have the work done by the end of last year.  We gave them a second opportunity and every authority which made an application received funding.  I cannot understand the great headlines in the newspapers.  Let us be honest, just and fair.  There were no decisions to be made.  I want to inform Independent Newspapers and<i> The Irish Times</i> because perhaps they do not understand it that there was no sports capital scheme in place since 2008.  I allocated no funding to the sports capital scheme because there was no such scheme.  This will be the first scheme since 2008.  If they want to make a story where there is none, let them do so, but we should be honest and fair.  A total of 200 applications were received and 111 allocations were made, to a value of &euro;4.5 million.  The reason the other applicants did not receive an allocation is they did not fall within the criteria laid down.  The same applied in the case of swimming pools.  Every applicant received funding.  I am aware that in certain areas there is a difficulty with heating which pool operators are not able to maintain owing to the cost of fuel.  Any applicant which drew down a grant is now telling me that there is a saving of between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,500 a week on fuel.  I am glad to hear this.</P>
        <P>This is a great year for sport with the Olympic Games, the Paralympics, the European Championships, the GAA championships and the Heineken Cup taking place.  Our golfers have done us proud during the years and the Irish Open is being held again this year.  We are certainly punching above our weight.  I take the opportunity to wish well everybody who has qualified for the Olympic Games.  They will all give of their best.  I see Senator Eamonn Coghlan present.  He appreciates what I am saying.  These Olympians, no matter what their sport, are working hard to do themselves, their families and country proud.  We are not putting pressure on any one of them, but we wish them the best of luck.  We also wish the Irish team the best of luck in the European Championship.  It will lift the souls, the hearts and minds of the people.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to announce today in the Seanad that &euro;30 million is being spent.  I hope we can spread it equally and fairly around the country.  Expectations are high that everybody will receive funding.  We expect to receive applications for a figure up to &euro;300 million.  It might not be possible to provide grant aid for every club and organisation in the country, but we will see what we can do to spread the funding equally and fairly.  We will also see whether we can target disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>I hope I have covered most of the issues.  I will try to answer whatever questions are raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  His energetic and committed speech raised one&rsquo;s heart.  I echo his sentiments on Katie Taylor who has done us proud.  We wish all of our Olympians well in the months ahead.  In particular, I wish the Irish soccer team every success.  There was the first part of an excellent documentary about the boys in green broadcast on RTE last night.  We have come a long way since the hungry days when they hardly had laces in their boots, had no budget and no support.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in the reintroduction of sports grants.  As he will be aware, it was a Fianna F&aacute;il initiative which was successful for many years.  Unfortunately, owing to the economic downturn, it was not feasible to continue with it.  However, the Minister of State has reintroduced the scheme which, I hope, will be as successful for him as it was under Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  Certainly, in our time we transformed sports facilities throughout the country.  We gave a lift to small rural communities which were struggling.  Whether the grants were small, medium or big, they provided a much needed injection of capital, support and encouragement.  They were of huge benefit to the various codes, many of which were struggling to keep pitches open, make refurbishments, build small stands, etc.  One can see the good work done all over the country.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is making &euro;30 million available for successful applicants at local, regional and national level.  I strongly welcome his commitment to weight it in favour of disadvantaged communities.  It is particularly welcome that RAPID programme areas only have to come up with 5% of the cost.  The figure for CL&Aacute;R areas is 10% as opposed to 15% for all other areas.  That is both fair and equitable and to be welcomed.  I also strongly welcome the decision to waive the land ownership condition which stymied many worthwhile projects in the past.</P>
        <P>I have a number of questions to put the Minister of State.  There was a robust defence against his friends in <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>Irish Independent</i>, for whom I hold no brief.  There have always been suggestions of political bias and interference in the payment of grants and it comes as no great surprise that people are looking closely at the inordinate funding that seems to be making its way into County Mayo which I believe is receiving more than the entire Dublin region.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Not nearly as much was allocated to County Kerry under a previous Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the other big beneficiary so far is the constituency of Dublin West which, by a remarkable co-incidence, is the constituency of the senior Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  They stated the same about the former Minister, Mr. John O&rsquo;Donoghue, in Kerry South at one time.  What goes around, comes around.  I suppose there will be a raft of applications from every county.  As the Minister of State said, he has a difficult job and it is a matter of the loaves and fishes.  He does not have enough for everybody.</P>
        <P>I have one query.  The closing date is a little abrupt.  Online applications must be received by 1 June.  The Minister of State is aware that the forms are complex and that many committees employ consultants and specialists to help them.  I wonder if he would be prepared to extend that timescale by a month or two into the summer period to allow small struggling organisations the little extra time they need.  From telephone calls, there is possibly a lack of communication.  Naturally, most sports clubs can hear the grass grow and know when there is funding available.  However, there are other organisations which would not be as clued in.  I ask the Minister of State, if it is in his power to do so, to be somewhat lenient in this regard.</P>
        <P>Everyone has to be parochial and say something in respect of his or her own area and I am no different.  The great writer Dr. Bryan McMahon once said, &ldquo;If it is only a pup goat, you have to be in the middle of the fair with him&rdquo;.  I am in the middle of the fair with the Minister of State and I intend to take advantage of that.  There are some very good projects in train in Kerry at present.  The Minister of State will be aware of a very important flagship project, which is a joint venture involving the GAA, Tralee Institute of Technology and Shannon Development.  The aim of this project is to try to develop a centre of sporting excellence in Tralee, the home of Gaelic football.  I hope the Minister of State might be in a position to take a close look at what is going on in respect of the project to which I refer.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, has brought the Minister of State up to speed on difficulties that have been experienced in respect of the swimming pool and indoor leisure centre in Ballybunion.  Unfortunately, and as we enter the summer season, the latter was obliged to close due to a lack of funding.  Those who run the centre are seeking funding to put in place a heating and small energy plant in order to try to reduce costs.  It is almost impossible to break even in respect of a swimming pool, even in a resort centre such as Ballybunion.  I could refer to 20 further projects in my county but these are the two to which I ask the Minister of State to pay particular attention.</P>
        <P>The contribution of sport to the economy is well documented.  There is a win-win situation in this regard.  For every &euro;100 invested by the Government in sport, &euro;149 comes back in sports-related taxes.  Some 38,000 people &mdash; 2% of the national workforce &mdash; are directly employed in sports administration.  As the Minister of State indicated, everyone is aware of the importance of sport to people&rsquo;s health and well-being.</P>
        <P>Value for money is an issue to which the Minister of State will be giving careful consideration.  In the past there were some unfortunate examples of large sums of money being invested in major projects which turned out to be white elephants.  We must guard against any recurrences in this regard.  One can drive around the country &mdash; including through County Kerry &mdash; and come across projects which, despite the fact that successive Governments provided grants in respect of them, remain unfinished.  Value for money is critical.</P>
        <P>The integration of services is extremely important for those who are involved in sport.  If one is going to invest money in providing a VEC with playing pitches or whatever, it is vital that local sports clubs be given access to these.  If the money is going to the local sports club, then the position should be reversed.  At one point, there was an element of mutual exclusivity in respect of playing fields.  Local secondary schools used to have fine playing pitches, while the members of local GAA clubs were obliged to tog out and train in boggy fields.  There was no communication in this regard but the position is changing.  It is up to the Minister of State to ensure that such change continues.</P>
        <P>Like many colleagues, I was previously involved in local government.  We found that grants came with conditions attached, namely, that the moneys invested had to be underwritten in a doomsday scenario by local authorities.  Those who served on Kerry County Council when I was a member knew all about that because we were obliged to underwrite a project relating to the replica Famine ship, the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>.  The council nearly went broke as a result of this project, which was originally estimated to cost &euro;1.5 million but ended up costing &euro;12 million.  The county council and its ratepayers were obliged to bail out the project.  This was because of a condition attaching to the original grant to the effect that we were obliged to underwrite the project.  At the time, I was one of the few individuals involved who was not in favour of the project and who cautioned against it.</P>
        <P>Difficulties such as that to which I refer are now arising in other areas.  I have already referred to the position in Ballybunion.  According to this week&rsquo;s edition of the local newspaper, Kerry County Council is again going to be asked to pick up the tab unless the Minister of State comes to the rescue.  I hope he will do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In that event, I will raise anchor.  My final point is that local authorities should not be put in a gun-to-the-head situation in future.  Local communities are always asking their councils to underwrite projects with which they wish to proceed.  Councillors are vulnerable and we are all aware of the chaos that can ensue when pressure is exerted on them.  I wish the Minister of State well with his work.</P>

        <P>As the Minister of State indicated, this is the first round of sports capital funding for four years.  All Members should welcome that because it demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to encouraging more people to take an active part in sport.  There is a need to encourage all sporting organisations to share their facilities with others within their local communities.  The sports capital programme is aimed at ensuring that sporting facilities are not left idle at weekends, on weekdays or during the summer months, particularly if they can be used for the benefit of other sporting organisations or enthusiasts.</P>
        <P>The sports capital programme is the main channel of Government support for developing sports facilities and for purchasing equipment for sporting organisations ar fud na t&iacute;re.  It will be open to many more clubs and groups than previously was the case.  This is because the strict requirement relating to land ownership has been relaxed.  This reduction in the level of bureaucracy is to be welcomed.  In the past, all applicants were obliged to either own their land or to have it on a long lease.  Clubs are now able to apply for grants of up to &euro;25,000 in order to upgrade their facilities.  I am of the view that this will encourage greater participation on the part of the young and old in the sports which these clubs promote.  I understand that applications &mdash; approximately 500 in all &mdash; have been received from each of the 26 counties.  In addition, in excess of 2,000 further applications have been registered online.  I am sure that many more applications will be submitted before the deadline of 5 p.m. on Friday, 1 June.  No further applications will be accepted after that date.</P>
        <P>As a result of the grants to which I refer, people will have more opportunity than ever to get and remain active in a wide range of sports.  This will have a positive impact on job creation in construction, which is extremely important for everyone involved in that industry.  The total allocation of &euro;30 million will benefit sports clubs, community groups, local authorities, schools and the national governing bodies of sport.  Some &euro;26 million will be allocated to smaller projects and &euro;4 million will go to national and regional projects, with a maximum individual allocation of &euro;300,000.  I commend the decision to the effect that applications in respect of these funds can be made through the medium of Irish.  This was not the case in the past.  I welcome the change in this regard.  I also understand that community-based and shared facilities will be prioritised for funding.  In other words, one of the criteria involved will be that facilities that are being shared will be given priority.  That is a good development.</P>
        <P>All applications received by the closing date will be assessed on the basis of a number of criteria, such as the effect a proposed project will have in the context of active participation in sport and the level of socioeconomic disadvantage in the relevant area.  Evaluation of applications will commence in the very near future.  In light of the volume of applications and the detailed information contained in each, I am sure the process in this regard will take some time to complete.  Perhaps the Minister of State might provide an indication with regard to when an announcement will be made in respect of those applications which have been successful.  The Department is to closely monitor spending by clubs and organisations in order to ensure that the funding allocated will be fully expended for the purpose for which it is intended.</P>
        <P>What is proposed here is good news for many communities and organisations.  It is particularly good news for smaller clubs that were previously muscled out of the picture by larger organisations.  These were better organised and had the expertise to tap into the funding available.  This programme of funding is a just reward for the many volunteers who give of their time daily and weekly, to whom the Minster of State has referred.  Let us suppose there were no GAA, soccer or rugby organisations, no athletic clubs and no credit unions.  The Minister of State has referred to quantifying what they have contributed to communities for many decades.  One could not quantify it.  Although volunteers do not receive financial recognition for their efforts, the funding provided is most welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing back the sports capital programme.  As my colleague stated, he has the enthusiasm, energy and commitment to deliver these funds to the most deserving clubs and communities, from County Donegal to County Waterford and from counties Cork and Kerry to County Louth.  Like him, I recognise the many sporting achievements of our people, including those of Katie Taylor and the Leinster and Ulster rugby teams.  Rob Kearney is a native of my county and a neighbour.  Recently he was nominated as European rugby footballer of the year.  Incidentally, he started his footballing career at my club, Cooley Kickhams, which received an initial grant from the Taoiseach who, at the time, was Minister with responsibility for sport.  We were not classed as disadvantaged, but the grant received represented a major contribution to the magnificent sports facilities we now have available at Cooley Kickhams.  I congratulate the Minister of State who has the necessary enthusiasm.  I believe he will do the right thing.  As a sports fan, he is in the right Department and I wish him well.  I will do whatever I can to help.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>With the agreement of the House, I will share my time with Senator Jimmy Harte.  </P>
        <P>I compliment and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring.  I am pleased that he holds this position not only because he is a west of Ireland man but also because he is the best man for the job.  When his tenure comes to an end in four years time, we will see the benefits of what he will have done.</P>
        <P>I am keen to see the focus placed on disadvantaged areas and areas which have been neglected politically in the past.  I will welcome the Minister of State to Ballaghaderreen on 3 June for the opening of our GAA pitch.  He has an important portfolio, as no one should underestimate the value of grants to local communities and voluntary groups.  Apart from anything else, every grant the Minister of State will authorise will stimulate work in disadvantaged areas.  Creating jobs is what we are about.  Sometimes we forget that there are indirect benefits to grants for sports organisations, including considerable savings in the health budget as a result of participation in sport.  I was an active sportsman in my heyday.  Unfortunately, I have neglected to continue in that vein.  Years ago I used to call to the town of the Minister of State once every fortnight to climb the reek, simply for the fun of it, although the last time I did it &mdash; one year ago &mdash; I almost needed an air ambulance to take me away.</P>
        <P>In the case of every family I know, all of the children are involved in everything, including soccer, Gaelic football, basketball and so on.  I have often thought I should have three wives in order that we could have three cars and they could all move in different directions to fulfil the arrangements of everything the children are involved in.  Sport is huge in this country; I have never seen anything like it.  Occasionally, I hear parents complaining that there is not enough for children to do in town.  I simply laugh because the facilities are in place and the Minister of State will enhance them.</P>
        <P>Senator John Gilroy and I are involved in a project with the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI.  It is associated with the internship scheme and I understand the Minister of State will be launching it.  When we were discussing the project, the representative of the GAA informed us that there was a significant drop-out rate among boys who played football once they entered second level education.  This is an alarming statistic which we must address.  I realise it is not the exact responsibility of the Minister of State, but the more money he invests in sports facilities, the more he will be making a contribution.</P>
        <P>There was a good deal of political nonsense when it came to grants and how they were given out in the past.  In 2007 a grant was promised to a club in my locality, but it was given to a different club for political reasons.  The Minister of State is a fair man and I expect he will consider things from the right perspective, not from a political one.</P>
        <P>I have discussed the swimming pool programme with the Minister of State previously.  I thank him for his help and commitment to one project in my county which has only one public pool and one private pool for a population of 64,000.  I mean no disrespect to Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan who has just left the House, but I do not know how many pools there are in County Kerry.  There could be ten or 15 public pools and at least 20 private pools, if not more.  It was obvious that there had been a large investment in County Kerry during the years as part of the sports capital programme, while counties such as ours were neglected politically.</P>
        <P>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to value for money.  I have brought this matter to the attention of the Minister previously.  The way we used to do our business in respect of the swimming pool programme was open to question.  The view was that such a project was one for the Government and, therefore, should be put out to tender.  The companies involved in tendering submit &ldquo;Monopoly&rdquo; figures.  I know of many others, however, and if I asked one of them how much it would cost to provide a swimming pool in my town, I would receive a quote of &euro;2.5 million.  However, when one involves those who specialise in this business and informs them that a Government grant of &euro;3.8 million is available, the cost rises to &euro;10 million.  That is nonsense.  I have met some of the people concerned in recent times.  I have asked them, if there was a grant of &euro;3.8 million available and a local contribution of &euro;440,000, whether they could provide a pool in my town for that money, rather than expecting the county council to come up with a magic figure to boost the project for them in order that they could make a vast profit.  We must re-think the way we do business.  I realise the Minister of State is aware that we are involved in a process for that project and, further along, I will bring a proposal to the Minister.  I trust he will be amenable to considering it favourably.  I have great faith&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister of State mentioned the Heineken Cup, but the GAA season has begun also and we are heading to Euro 2012 in two weeks time.  Anyone travelling the country these days will see that every town and village has a 5 km or 10 km mini-marathon.  People are investing their time in the promotion of their health because it will be an issue in the long term.  Unhealthy lifestyles can result in a burden on our health services and the more money we put into sports, the more dividends are returned.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Minister of State dropped the clause under which the club needed to own the land because many small clubs cannot get money and have difficulty even renting a field.  Until now they were lost in that regard and small GAA clubs, new clubs, small soccer clubs or even a boules club, which are popular in certain areas, were in a quandary as to how to get funding, especially if they did not own the pitch.  It was a particular difficulty in agricultural areas where, traditionally, farmers do not sell land.  The provision of up to &euro;25,000 to get clubs operating again is welcome.</P>
        <P>I raised the issue of the European Championship recently.  The Minister of State might ask the telephone companies, on behalf of the Government or on his own behalf, about texting and roaming charges people will incur in Poland.  If Ireland qualifies, which we hope we do, the next round will be played in Ukraine, which is a different kettle of fish, so to speak, in that regard.  The telephone companies might make a gesture for the fans who will travel to Poland, many of whom are digging deep into their pockets to get the money to travel.  Reports out today indicate that approximately 10,000 or 15,000 people will travel to Poland at some stage, although perhaps not for the entire championship.  The Minister of State might make some inquiries of the telephone companies that they would help those supporters, of whom I will be one, because many of them might return to face a massive telephone bill.  It is an issue the telephone companies can examine.</P>
        <P>A Senator mentioned that certain areas got more money than others, which the Minister of State addressed, and that certain sports groups got more money because they were larger.  Senator Brennan said it is important the smaller groups such as boules clubs and marginal organisations are maintained.  The GAA, the FAI and the rugby organisation are well funded from their own resources in addition to television rights and so on, but the minority sports must be encouraged because not everyone is a runner, a footballer or a swimmer.  People participate in other sports such as snooker.  There is a social side to sport as well as a health side.  A small snooker club with perhaps a dozen members is as important as a GAA club in a community with a few hundred members.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for delivering this good news.  I am sure Donegal will benefit.  I look forward to seeing the Minister of State in Poland at some stage.</P>

	<P>I join my colleague in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, to the House.  I am delighted he is present for these contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House again.  First, regarding some of the criteria for the sports grant, previous speakers mentioned the relaxation of the land ownership requirement and that small clubs which do not own land can apply for grants up to &euro;25,000 to upgrade their facilities.  Mention was made also that Katie Taylor was a great ambassador for sport, and women&rsquo;s sport in particular, and of her major achievement in winning her fourth world championship and qualifying for the Olympic Games.  However, in the same Women&rsquo;s World Boxing Championships, Ciara Smith from County Cavan reached the last 16.  She is 19 years of age and is a member of Cavan Amateur Boxing Club.  The club was set up in 1982 and is one of those that does not own its own facilities.  It rents its facilities and any funding it is allocated goes solely towards equipment, which is essential given it is a combat and contact sport.  Given the demographics of many of the service users of that facility and those who play that sport, heavy demands are put on the club equipment and it is important that equipment is kept up to date.  That is the reason this grant, and the relaxation of that rule, is important.  I commend the Minister of State on that, especially in terms of opening up the fund to smaller clubs which were not able to access it in the past and which have, as shown by Ciara Smith, produced world class athletes.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the importance of sports clubs and that efforts are being made to encourage young people to get involved in sports.  Not long ago in this House Senator Eamonn Coghlan spoke about the importance of health and fitness.  To be parochial, one of my local clubs, Cavan Gaels, has been bringing not only young people into sport but also people of all ages.  I do not have a sporty bone in my body, but in addition to encouraging young people, this club is ensuring inclusivity among all ages through a range of different activities.  In its most recent initiative, Mission Slimpossible, it runs classes four times a week for people of all ages, which is of major importance to the town in bringing about a sense of community.  I recently moved into Cavan town and I almost feel closer to that community than I did in my home club because of the range of activities being introduced.</P>
        <P>Senator Harte is correct that there are many 5 km and 10 km mini-marathons being held in the area.  I constantly see people running on the roads and around the football pitches.  They put me to shame when I drive by them but it highlights the importance of sport and the importance of these grants to our local clubs and communities.  That cannot be underestimated because it is not just sport.  When I previously got involved in some of those clubs, I would have been quite ignorant of sport, but when one considers the social aspect to it and the level of community, especially in the two clubs I mentioned, I am hopeful they will succeed in their applications.  I commend the Minister of State again on reopening this scheme and relaxing some of the criteria to ensure clubs of all sizes can access vital funds to continue their good work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We now have questions from Members.  I call Senator Coghlan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonnCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Eamonn Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  In these economically difficult times, the &euro;30 million that will go towards sports capital grants is very welcome.  Investment in sports thus far has been proven by the fantastic results from our Olympic Games qualifiers, who number 53 and which figure is expected to go beyond 60.  When we consider they are involved in swimming, boxing, canoeing, triathlons, sailing and judo, to name a few, and not including my sport, they have gone beyond their expectations in a number of qualifiers.</P>
        <P>What can we expect from the sports capital grants?  The Minister of State alluded to volunteers.  I am a volunteer in the sport of athletics and can spend between ten and 15 hours a week coaching athletes and young children.  I see the additional hours other volunteers in my sport put in week in, week out and year in, year out.  In terms of what we can expect from this &euro;30 million, I am aware the Minister of State has been inundated with requests.  In the first week of applications in the last round in 2008, the Minister of State got 600 applications.  In the first week of this round, 1,600 applications were received.  Where will the funds go in terms of the spread?  Will they be spread nationally and will they benefit mainly the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI which have an opportunity to raise funds, as mentioned earlier, through gate receipts, television rights and various types of sponsorship?  The Minister of State said he is looking for high quality facilities.  With &euro;30 million and the spread expected in terms of the funds, I do not believe he will get high quality facilities.  I am concerned that this will be a sticking plaster measure for a certain number of sports facilities throughout the nation to satisfy some local politicians in the area.</P>
        <P>I have two questions for the Minister of State.  If an application is made by an organisation which is just outside the RAPID area, but the participants in that particular sport are from the RAPID area, will they be accepted in the scheme?  Would it be better to make a substantial investment in sport rather than a multitude of small sports?  That substantial investment in a particular facility can be of benefit to all the sports in the area, as opposed to little bits here and there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister of State to take three questions together, so I will call on Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and Senator Moloney.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming in again to talk about sport.  He has outlined how sport is important, and colleagues on all sides agree that any investment in sport provides an added yield to the economy.  That was evident back in 2008, when over &euro;600 million was spent on sport and there was a dividend back to the Exchequer of about &euro;900 million as a result.  Does the Minister of State feel that sport could be used as a stimulus in the economy?  In other words, if there is additional investment in sport and everybody partakes and goes to matches, could there be an additional yield back to the Exchequer?</P>
        <P>The &euro;30 million for the sports capital criteria is not an awful lot of money, but it is very welcome.  Will the criteria be capped in respect of the level of grant aid?  Obviously if there are two or three projects worth &euro;1 million each, they will eat up the grant aid.  There are loads of applications, as Senator Coghlan pointed out, but is there a cap involved?  For example, reference was made earlier to Mayo&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to Kerry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Kerry as well.  Perhaps Donegal could be included when Jim McDaid was the Minister.  The total allocation to Dublin last year was &euro;325,000, which is half of what went to County Mayo.  Both projects in Dublin were in the senior Minister&rsquo;s constituency in Dublin West.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct.  I will have to correct the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  It was brought to my attention and I said I would raise it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>It was brought to the Senator&rsquo;s attention by a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor who needs to get his facts right.  I have answered him twice already, but he has media presence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>If you could restrain yourself for one minute&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not making a political point.  I am trying to stress that it is important to get the geographical spread, the criteria and the upper limit right.  If the Minister of State wants to refer to councillors, there is a Fine Gael chairman of Westport Town Council, Councillor Christy Hyland, who boasted that because of the exceptional allocation of funding for sports in County Mayo, the Minister of State must have a direct line to Angela Merkel.  These were his words, not mine.   If the Minister of State wants to refer to councillors, there are councillors in all parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only because Fianna F&aacute;il let us down in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps when he is over, he can have discussions about the eurozone crisis as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours.  I completely support him on the development of sport.  It is a very important year, as Senator Eamonn Coghlan said.  I have a few friends who are travelling over and competing in the Olympic Games.  We wish them all well and we also wish the Irish soccer team well as they prepare for the European Championships in a few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My question was similar to that posed by Senator Eamonn Coghlan, so I will not repeat what he said.  As we speak, the swimmers are out in Hungary competing in the last qualification rounds for the Olympic Games.  I was again going to mention the issue of the 50 m. pools.  It is very hard for swimmers to travel to Dublin or Limerick when they are coming from all over Ireland, so there is much pressure on these amateurs to fund the qualifications for the games.  Before the last Olympic Games in Beijing, the UK invested heavily in cycling.  This led to good results among the athletes and in the health aspect as well.  Do we have any intentions of investing in any particular sport to produce results?</P>
        <P>I am a bridge player, but bridge is never considered a sport.  It is a very good sport.  I would like to see it considered a sport in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I will let the Minister of State out of the traps now.  He can respond in his inimitable style.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Thank you.  I will answer the spokespersons later, but first I will answer the three questions I was asked.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan made a point about the RAPID areas.  This is something we will look at.  This is where facilities are outside the RAPID area but the people are actually from the RAPID area.  We will give it a sympathetic view when the applications come in.</P>
        <P>The Senator also spoke about the bigger sporting organisations.  That is why &euro;4 million of the &euro;30 million is for regional and national projects.  I am taking the credit for that and I did that because if I left it open for the &euro;30 million, the money would be eaten up by the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA in a very short time.  The other &euro;26 million is for projects worth &euro;300,000 or less, to try to give the smaller organisations an opportunity.</P>
        <P>We have the National Aquatic Centre and we have been very successful in getting a number of teams to train there, including some British and American teams.  We have a number of events taking place there because of the facilities, but Senator Moloney is correct that we do not have enough facilities.  We will not be looking at facilities like that for the future.  We will be developing the aquatic centre, but we just do not have the money to develop them around the country.  When we had the money, we should probably have looked at getting more 50 m. pools, but we just do not have the resources now.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I want to put something on the record and put this story to bed once and for all.  A total of 206 applications were received for the scheme to which the Senator referred.  All eligible applications &mdash; 111 in total &mdash; were granted funding.  Every body that made an application received funding.  Applications were typically unsuccessful because the applicants did not own the land.  There was one simple criterion, namely, the land must be owned by the applicant.  The biggest offenders in not owning the land are not sporting organisations, but the local authorities, and Dublin is the worst of all.  Another reason for a refusal of funding is when the applicant would not have completed the projects by the end of the year.  That was a decision they made; not us.  We offered them the funding if they were eligible, but they did not draw it down.</P>
        <P>I hope Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, as an Ulsterman, does not object to what I am going to say.  On a <i> per capita</i> basis, Sligo received the most funding in 2011 for the pools and sports capital initiative.  The Senator is not far from Sligo so I hope he does not object to Sligo doing well when his party let them down over the years.</P>

	<P>I do not mind which Government gives money, but I object to the suggestion that Sligo was denied by the last Government.

He should be balanced.  I have always been balanced with him.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Sligo received the most funding  per capita at &euro;19.93.  I want Senator Mooney to listen to this, because he does not listen.  The second highest was Leitrim at &euro;17.49 <i>per capita</i>.</P>

	<P>On a raw cash basis, Dublin got &euro;1.74 million, followed by Cork at &euro;1.41 million.</P>
        <P>Dublin and Cork received the most.  I have no problem with this, but I do have a problem with those who say Mayo received more than any other county.  The Senator may not have heard my response to the allegations he made.  They are not true.  Dublin and Cork received the most money.  I was glad to inform the House which counties received the largest <i>per capita</i> amounts &mdash; Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Mayo.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me be serious for one minute.  The Minister of State has referred to sums of &euro;26 million and &euro;4 million.  It is my understanding that these sums would have always been provided.  Money is ring-fenced for national sports organisations in all sports capital programmes.  With regard to the sum of &euro;26 million, is the Minister of State thinking of capping it?  What would happen, for instance, if an application for a sum of &euro;1 million was received from an organisation in west Clare?  Does the Minister of State have advice for applicants on the criteria or the application of a cap in making applications?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot allow further interventions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>For the benefit of those Senators who do not know, the Minister of State and I come from the west and are the best of friends.  Like most good families, we have the odd spat, but when it comes down to it, we stick together.  He mentioned County Leitrim.  He provided a significant sum of money for the upgrading of a swimming pool my late father was instrumental in providing, with the help of the Department and the local authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a context to my question.  The Minister of State came to Drumshambo to reopen the swimming pool, for which my family, the people of Drumshambo and I were very grateful.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State touched on the sum of &euro;4 million for non-local projects.  He has a limited budget and must fund national bodies such as the GAA which has done very well from the sports capital fund, and rightly so.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan and others touched on the point I am about to make.  There is a need for a multi-sports approach in local communities, to which the Minister is moving towards in what he is attempting to do with local clubs.  In my home town of Drumshambo the dominant sports organisation, as in many rural towns, is the GAA, but there are children who, probably, do not want to be involved in Gaelic games and would like to be participating in other sports.  There is a lack of facilities for these children.  I see a start being made in this regard and have no doubt the Minister of State will be fighting tigerishly to ensure more money is provided for such facilities.  I would like him to follow on because he has made a very good start in providing multi-sports facilities.  I would be interested to hear his opinion on this suggestion, although I do not wish to deflect from the extraordinary work the GAA has done.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State consider pushing the GAA, in particular, towards local arrangements similar to what the association has done in the case of Croke Park?  I know this is a sensitive issue, but that sensitivity is now off the agenda.  There is a general acceptance among the GAA fraternity that the Croke Park sports deal was a good one for Irish sport.  Perhaps this idea might be linked with other large stadiums throughout the country and provide an opportunity for the GAA, at regional and local level, to make money from international events.  For example, Thomond Park is being looked at as a possible venue for international football games this summer, although there has been some controversy about bringing Barcelona FC and various others clubs here to play.  Could McHale Park in Castlebar, for example, host a major event that would benefit the local community?</P>
        <P>I was not aware that local government was involved in the topping up procedure.  That is good, as local authorities are in a position to identify priorities at local level.  Like the Minister of State, many Senators come from a strong local government background.  I see this topping up as strengthening local government.  In future allocations the Minister of State might look at how local government could play an important part in liaising with sports bodies.</P>
        <P>Overall, I applaud the Minister of State for the initiative he has taken.  As I said on previous occasions, he hit the ground running.   He spoke about <i>per capita</i> spending &mdash; I know that is the jargon used.  There are 30,000 people living in County Leitrim and, on a <i>per capita</i> basis, it looks as though the county receives a good deal of funding.  However, that is not to diminish the Minister of State&rsquo;s achievements.  We are very grateful for the money we receive.  Because it is a small county and the Minister of State has to consider the bigger picture, we have to fight a little harder to get what we want.  The Minister of State will agree that, on a global basis, the west in general has to fight harder than the rest of the country.</P>

To use a well known sporting colloquialism, they have necks like a jockey&rsquo;s you know what.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the funding allocations announced by the Minister of State.  Much of the land and many of the sports halls and community facilities used by sports clubs are not owned by the clubs but by community development groups.  Can these groups apply for sports capital funding or does an applicant have to be affiliated to a sports club or organisation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is the first opportunity I have had to do so.  He is made for the job and I wish him the very best of luck.  Apart from ring-fencing, if he will excuse the pun, money for County Mayo, I hope he will ensure County Cavan moves from fourth to first on this occasion.</P>
        <P>It is welcome that the Minister of State is considering grant-aiding facilities located outside RAPID programme areas.  In my town facilities are used by people who live in RAPID programme areas.  It is welcome the news that the Minister of State is looking at that issue.</P>
        <P>With my colleagues, I pay tribute to Ms Ciara Smith from County Cavan who reached the final 16 in the recent world boxing championships in China.  I also pay tribute to her coach, Mr. Brian McKeown, who has done tremendous work with young people in Cavan town for the last 25 years.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State be imposing a time limit in drawing down funding?  In the past clubs and organisations granted a sum of money sometimes took up to five years to draw it down, preventing others from applying for funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I am glad to hear his response to Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, or Joey Barton.  I hope he will show him a red card, which is what he needs.</P>
        <P>I do not think people fully realise the amount of work the Minister of State has done behind the scenes and the struggle he had with the Department of Finance to get this money.  I commend him for this, as he has done fantastic work.</P>
        <P>When the HSE PPARS computer project did not work, the then Minister, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, said the &euro;250 million that it had cost was only a small amount of money.  Are we saying that &euro;250 million was only a small amount of money?  Let us imagine what we could do if we had &euro;250 million to invest in sports development in this country.  Ms Katie Taylor was mentioned, and rightly so.  When I hear a reference to her being the best, I agree, because she is.</P>
        <P>My sport is soccer.  I am aware the Minister of State is a great supporter of women&rsquo;s soccer in particular.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is sponsor of the Women&rsquo;s National League which started recently.  I attended the sports awards recently with the Minister of State and we saw fantastic players coming through.  Ms Marie Curtin from Cork has secured a professional contract to play in Norway.  We will hear a great deal of talk about Ms Denise O&rsquo;Sullivan from Cork and Ms Stephanie Roche from Dublin.  There are many other female players who are pound for pound among the best soccer players, male or female, that I have seen.  They are fantastic.</P>
        <P>I have two quick questions for the Minister of State.  When are applicants likely to be informed they have been successful?  I travelled a good bit, at my own expense, in Italy and France in recent years to look at sports facilities.  The one thing that strikes me about them is the municipal nature of sports pitches which cater for rugby, soccer and running.  Provision is made for every single sport.  They are fantastic.  The economies of scale that can be achieved are fantastic.  It might be aspirational, but would the Minister of State be open to the idea of creating a series of municipal centres throughout the country if we got the money to do it?  Is it something he would be willing to consider?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin with the first of the four questions on shared facilities.  I agree with the Senator.  He is like me.  He is a sportsman.  I do not mind whether people play Gaelic games, soccer or rugby.  It does not matter what sport a person plays as long as they play.  I would not interfere with the day-to-day business of the GAA but the Senator is correct that at community level all the codes &mdash; soccer, Gaelic and rugby &mdash; are working together.  Priority will be given in this round to people who are sharing facilities because we do not have the resources.</P>
        <P>What happens is that when a GAA club gets an AstroTurf pitch then the soccer club wants one also.  There should be one pitch in a town.  There is no need for more than that.  We must examine the issue.  We will take such matters into consideration in this round.  It will be part of the sports strategy.  This is the first time we have ever had a policy on sport.  The number one priority will be shared facilities and carrying out an audit to see what is available in every town.  We will see what is in Roscommon, Cork and Kerry.  If facilities exist and another club is looking for the same facility, we will say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We will have to be strong.  We must make decisions based on what is good for sport.  That is what we will do in this round.</P>
        <P>A question was asked about the governing bodies.  The Senator is correct.  They have had a good run &mdash; the GAA, soccer and rugby authorities.  We are very proud of the stadia and how we can attract any international event to various locations throughout the country.  We do not have enough of them and wish we had more, but we do not.  This time I want to work from the bottom up.</P>
        <P>A Senator referred to boxing.  Last year I allocated &euro;1.25 million to boxing.  Again, I did not get involved.  I asked the federation to administer the scheme.  Not much of the money has been drawn down.  I am somewhat disappointed as I wish it had drawn down more.  The reason I made the allocation is that more women are now becoming involved in sport, including boxing, and it would be wrong if the dressing rooms and facilities were not available for them.  I asked the organisation to speak to the clubs and asked them to send in applications.  We provided &euro;25,000 per club to improve the facilities, in particular to provide facilities for clubs where women are involved.  The total allocated was &euro;1.25 million.  I targeted the boxing area because I felt that boxing had not done well from national lottery funding and sports capital funding in recent years.  As the Senator outlined, boxing clubs do not own their facilities.  That is why I introduced a rule allowing clubs to draw down &euro;25,000 if they have a lease and can provide a letter from the owner stating they will remain <i>in situ</i> for the next five years.  That gives clubs an opportunity and shows we respect boxing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>What a wonderful result we have had from the boxers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  They are performing well.  The sunset clause was always in place but it was never used.  A total of &euro;55.5 million has been allocated for projects.  The first thing that is said to me is that the money is in the Department.  It is not.  If everyone wanted to draw down the money at the same time we would have to get it for them.  The situation is that the money relates to grants that have been allocated five or six years ago.  We frequently write to ask what is happening.  I received a number of requests to extend the process and we gave them the opportunity.  As they are voluntary organisations, we want to give them the opportunity to draw down the funding, but a time must come to bring the process to an end.</P>
        <P>A question was asked about when we will make announcements on new grant allocations.  We have scheduled it for the autumn to winter period as there will be so many applications.  Given we do not have as many staff as previously, it will take a bit longer to adjudicate on them.  As soon as we have them ready, be it October or November, we will allocate the money and let people get started.  Too many clubs have too many allocations that are not being drawn down.  I do not say I will do it but I will consider putting a timeframe of perhaps 18 months to two years on allocations.  I will suggest starting the process from the day an allocation is received that there is no point in coming back after two years because if the funding has not been drawn down, it is too late.  What is happening is wrong because it is holding up the process.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to swimming pools.  There is a demand for swimming pools.  The programme is in place and money is available but people cannot get the matching funds to work on projects.  In particular, I am keen to give an opportunity to make applications to disadvantaged areas and places that do not have swimming pools.  The scheme is closed but I must try to open it again.  The problem is that commitments have been made on previous applications.</P>
        <P>The Senator is correct about shared facilities.  I was in Athy yesterday &mdash; it was a pleasure to be there &mdash; in connection with the local sports partnership of which Mr. Niall Quinn is chairman.  Between four and six schools had come together and located their facilities in one area.  It was managed by the VEC.  Everyone was happy.  What has been proposed is the ideal solution, if one could locate sporting facilities in a certain area in a town or county.  GAA pitches, soccer pitches and rugby pitches would all be together.</P>
        <P>Another speaker referred to local authorities.  I could defend the previous Minister who had responsibility for this area.  Sometimes in Dublin people tend to forget that local authorities play a major part in the provision of facilities and sports grounds.  That does not happen in Mayo or Kerry where local communities have to raise funding to purchase the grounds and fund the day-to-day running of the facilities.  It is easy for journalists to ask why money has to go to Mayo, Donegal, Cavan or Leitrim.  It is because local authorities do not have resources to provide the same facilities or they did not get involved in the same way as happened in Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why I asked the Minister of State the question about the role of local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mooney is correct.  I compliment the local authorities.  They were asked for a small contribution to the two schemes I announced last year and all the local authorities responded.  One often hears announcements on RTE radio on Sunday morning that such a field in Dublin is flooded or closed.  The local authority sends out the message because they have control of the facilities.  We would be delighted if local authorities in Leitrim, Mayo and Donegal would do that but that is not the case and communities have had to raise money by selling tickets to keep clubs going.  They are doing their best.</P>
        <P>We must be honest and fair.  There is no point in expectations being set too high.  There are politicians in this House and in the other one sending out application forms to people in every community.  It is only making fools out of them.  We do not have enough resources for everyone.  We have &euro;30 million.  We do not even have &euro;30 million for communities.  We have &euro;26 million, as &euro;4 million is to be allocated to regional schemes.  No matter how one divides it, one will not have enough.  That is why we must ensure, first, that projects are ready to go, and second, that they are projects that will be used and that no white elephants will remain.  This time people are more realistic.  They have been looking at ways and means of making the most of scarce facilities.  That is why I took stands out of the equation.  We do not want stands; we want people to participate.  Grant aid is no longer provided for stands, simply on the basis that we want people to take part and get involved in providing facilities and equipment.</P>
        <P>A Senator made a point that related to counties Donegal and Mayo as well as Gaeltacht areas.  I made a political decision because the previous Government made the wrong decision.  If I had not changed the rules and regulations this time, Gaeltacht areas would not have been included.  They were removed from the last sports capital programme.  A former Minister put them into another section under which no funding was available and they would have been unable to make an application.  I made the political decision to include them in this scheme even though doing so was a draw on our finances.  It would have been easier to leave matters alone, but preventing Gaeltacht areas from applying for funding would have been wrong.  They are as entitled to apply as everywhere else.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Excellent.  The Minister of State heard the Senator.  We can draw down that money.  The Government must honour its commitment.  Was Senator Kelly in favour of re-roofing the pool in Castlerea?  Is that his commitment as well?</P>

	<P>I will support the development fervently and, I hope, with a few bob.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s task is difficult and I wish him well in it.  He should not be shy when it comes to the west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  We always enjoy robust, forthright exchanges when he attends.  He is making a difference and we appreciate the more than &euro;140,000 that he invested in my local swimming pool in Ballinasloe to upgrade its energy efficiency levels and to improve access for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The miracle of the loaves and fishes comes to mind when one considers trying to distribute &euro;30 million among the many worthy projects.  The Minister of State has an unenviable task.  I do not know how he will approach it.  Every Senator would like to see more funding pumped into sport.  As a consequence, there would be a lesser need for resourcing some health areas, for example, particularly given the link between people leading active, sporting lives and a weaker reliance on health services.</P>
        <P>In light of the number of applications that will be received, will the Minister of State give priority to rural communities, especially those that share facilities?  I have in mind the Kiltormer GAA club, which has a fine sports complex that needs additional funding for upgrades.  It is also used by the wider, rural community.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State considering allocating funding on a county basis, will he try to spread it across sports or will he allocate it based on individual applications?  Given the volume of applications, how will they be processed?  Does the Department possess the necessary resources or will it employ additional resources?</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well.  I was disappointed that Galway did not feature in his league table.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The mental health benefits of sport have not been mentioned.  They are often understated.  What are the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinions in this regard?  The issue is aside from the sports capital end of this discussion.  I am involved in a group in County Donegal that was set up in January.  We go running early every Sunday morning and are trying to bring people with us who may have been involved in a local Solas group, which promotes mental health and well-being.  For the past two years, Solas has taken people suffering mental health issues into the outdoors &mdash; the green gym &mdash; on walks.</P>
        <P>On the other side of this issue is the question of general practitioners, GPs, referring people to gyms.  This practice should be radically promoted.  It is being done to a certain extent and the Minister of State has done some work in this regard.  The English model is excellent and we could promote it in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State concerning the Gaeltacht funding issue.  At least the scheme will now be available to Gaeltacht clubs.  To date, the Department responsible for the Gaeltacht had a sports capital programme.  The cap on funding was 70%, except in CL&Aacute;R areas where the cap was as much as 80% or 85%.  No funding is available in the Gaeltacht anymore because no funding is available from the relevant Department.  If the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department did not make sports capital funding available, there would be none for Gaeltacht areas.  Given the language considerations, will the Minister of State confirm the funding from the sports capital grant will be at the same level that obtained under the other Department, that is, 70% to 85%?  If so, the grant will be as advantageous as the scheme that operated when Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the future hold for the sports partnerships?  There has been some speculation about changes and that the partnerships will be absorbed into local government.  What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinion in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are enjoying this robust debate.  For several years, my area of Sligo-Leitrim North had fallen behind and we did not get the fair level of funding to which we were entitled.  The Minister of State has visited the area and will do so again tomorrow, which is welcome.  A number of projects in the constituency are worthy causes and applications will be made in respect of them.  I look forward to the drawing down of some grants in my area.  I thank the Minister of State for attending and we look forward to drawing the matter to a conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the question on CL&Aacute;R and disadvantaged areas, the rules and regulations will be the same for everyone.  I will not change them.  I reduced the local contribution in respect of RAPID areas from 10% to 5% and from 20% to 10% in respect of CL&Aacute;R areas.  I also reduced the overall contribution from 20% to 15%.  I could do no more.  There cannot be one scheme that is subject to two sets of rules and regulations.  The same rules must apply.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also made the point about health, and mental health in particular.  He is correct that sport is important.  One gets annoyed when funding is criticised.  Through the local authorities, we have invested a great deal of funding in terms of the green gyms to which the Senator referred.  People who do not have money can use green spaces and open spaces.  The only outlet for some people, such as those who have lost their jobs and are under financial pressure, is sport.  For this reason, I have called on the GAA, rugby and soccer bodies and all sporting organisations to try to make their activities family friendly and to consider disadvantaged areas when they are staging events.  In this way, it would be easier for people who did not have as much money as they used to previously to view and take part in sports.  Everywhere I go, local authorities tell me the green gyms are flying, so to speak, and people are using them.  People are more health conscious.</P>
        <P>It is important we provide facilities for people with any kind of illness, be it mental or otherwise, and give them opportunities to take part.  This was one of the cases I used when asking for funding for the sports capital programme.  If we spend money on sport, we will not need as many consultants, doctors and hospitals.  We need to make it easy and simple for people to get involved in sport.  One has only to consider our successes.</P>
        <P>We are reviewing the local sports partnerships.  They do not work well in every county.  We are examining the counties that are doing well and will discuss the matter with the Irish Sports Council to try to assist those counties that are not doing well.  We are reviewing the overall sports strategy and will not be making any decision on local sports strategies for a while.  We are reviewing the counties that are doing well and getting the Sports Council to deal with those not doing so well.  The local authorities have a part to play in this.  It works very well where a local authority is supportive of a local sports partnership.  It does not work well when the local authority has a resistance to the partnership.  In Mayo recently, I opened a mini-marathon in which 3,500 women took part.  The day was beautiful and it was a pleasure to see some running and some walking the course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister of State have a run himself?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not put the skirt on.  That mini-marathon was organised by the local sports partnership while <i>The Western People</i> sponsored it.  It is important to get the media to support these events.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s point about the Gaeltacht funding, it is important everyone gets an opportunity to apply for sports funding, but we cannot have two different rules.  It will take some time for us to deal with this year&rsquo;s applications as there is a small staff in the Department.  This time we will not be allocating money by criteria.  That happened in the past and is why we have &euro;55 million of project funding not drawn down.  The main criterion before was <i>per capita</i> each county had to get so much funding.  There is no point in giving funding for a project to Mayo or Leitrim that would have cost &euro;500,000 but then could not go ahead because the group did not have matching funding or title deeds, say, to the land for the project.  This time we are looking at shovel-ready projects.  Shared facilities projects will get extra points.  Employment will be created in developing and constructing facilities which will be important, especially in rural areas, as well as getting revenue back to the State.</P>
        <P>Sport, of course, will be the real winner in this.  It is important the &euro;30 million allocated for sports capital development is spent wisely and targeted where it is needed most.  I know there were previous arrangements in place with the GAA and the FAI.  To me everyone should have an opportunity to make an application.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State do away with the county minimum?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not made a final decision on it yet.  I will in the next few days.  That rule meant counties were getting moneys for projects that were not right.  We should be looking at ready-to-go projects.  There is enough to ensure there will be sporting facilities in every county and I will do my best to ensure it is spread out as evenly and as fairly as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is obvious from the numbers attending this debate there is much interest in sport.  I love sport and it gives the country a lift.  If we get this weather for the whole summer, do well in the European championships, the Olympics and the Paralympics, as well as the rugby, it will lift everyone&rsquo;s soul and mind.  We all need a lift and sport is the key for that.  We need to support the Irish team in the European championship and our athletes taking part in the Paralympics and Olympics.</P>
        <P>I am looking for suggestions for sports participation in next year&rsquo;s The Gathering festival.  The Navy-Notre Dame American football game will play here in September and already 40,000 tickets have been sold for it.  That means 40,000 visitors to Ireland.  There are many sports facilities such as the Aviva Stadium, McHale Park, Thomond Park and Croke Park of which the State can make use.  I know the sporting organisations will not be found wanting if there is a sporting event that can be hosted at these facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the allocation of &euro;30 million for sports capital projects.  It has been four long years since the money was allocated to sports projects.  Many clubs and organisations have been hard-pressed to provide quality facilities and services for their members.  Hardly a day goes by that we are not informed of the staggering increase in obesity levels, particularly among young people.  Much of this is accounted for by decreasing levels of activity.  Our health services have to deal with the complications of this every day, so I am especially pleased to see this new sports capital scheme will have a stronger focus on projects which increase active participation in sport, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>When the last allocation was made four years ago, many clubs and organisations took on to upgrade and improve facilities.  Some projects were never completed due to escalating costs and overrun of budgets.  Will such clubs and organisations be able now to avail of a grant from this scheme to complete any unfinished works?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Moran is correct that the whole point of sport is to get people involved for their health.  Another problem is that there are many other activities in which children can get involved.  In Athy yesterday, I noted a local sports partnership programme that targeted disadvantaged areas and children who may have gone off the rails a small bit.  Through the programme, the partnership is getting them back into the education system and boosting their confidence, as well as being good for their health.  It also sets an example for other children to follow them into sport, which is good for society.  Any organisation that has an unfinished project will have its application considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State be able to respond on the Ballaghaderreen swimming pool project?  The deadline for an application to the sports capital programme is 2 June.  Some organisations and clubs are asking me what is the best way to apply.  For example, a GAA club might be trying to finish off a project which has five or six different strands to it.  Does the club apply for the whole six strands or just two?  Clubs do not know whether they should look for a lot of money and get a little or look for a reasonable allocation and get it.  What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s advice on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The funding for Ballaghaderreen swimming pool is still in place.  It is a matter for the county council to make an application.</P>
        <P>Any club can make any application it wants but we must be realistic.  That is why I put the bar at &euro;300,000.  I want applications that can be achieved.  We have projects which, because of the downturn, could not be completed and some not even started.  For example, if a club comes up with a proposal for &euro;600,000 for a pitch, floodlights and dressing rooms, it must prioritise which of these three is the most essential.  There will be another round of funding allocation in 2015.  I am not saying they will get the three allocations.  If they say phase one is the first priority, we might give them phase one and phase two but not phase three.  It depends on the position of funding.  When a fund of &euro;26 million, plus &euro;4 million which is available for non-local projects, is spread out across all 26 counties it is not a huge amount in the overall context.  We are asking people to be realistic and to take on only what they manage and bring to a conclusion.  I do not want to come back here again on this issue.</P>
        <P>In 2008, some &euro;191 million was not drawn down.  During the past 18 months we have written to many organisations inquiring about their application.  We have not put pressure on them but many have replied, saying they are withdrawing the application because they are no longer in a position to proceed with plans proposed in 2006 and 2007 due to the economic situation.  On the previous occasion, the allocation from Government was approximately &euro;57 million each year.  As it is four years since the last round of sports capital programme funding, that puts pressure on communities.  With &euro;30 million we hope to get value for money on the basis that costs have reduced.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I have told the clubs that if they are getting professionals to do the work, not to inflate the application as they are only making fools of themselves.  If an inflated application is made to the Department, it will be put in the basket.  We want honesty is this round and to spend the money where it can be targeted.  I ask clubs to apply only for the facilities they can afford.</P>

	<P>It is great to have the Minister of State in the House for the debate.  I commend the Government, especially the Minister of State, on the sports capital programme.  The social gain for communities and the health gain for young people is huge.  There is an obesity timebomb in Ireland and it has gone off.  It will be difficult to quantify the value of the moneys invested.  I listened to a doctor speaking on this issue recently.  The proportion of three years olds who are overweight is frightening.  This is something new for Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no obesity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>When we were children, practically nobody was overweight.  The benefits to society are huge.  I heard what the Minister of State had to say in respect of applications.  If there is an application for &euro;300,000, how will the Department apportion the money fairly?  Will county level be taken into account?  I understand the money will be apportioned on merit, in other words the projects must be good.  I am aware of a number of applications that have been submitted.  Certain clubs have applied for grants of &euro;60,000.  Based on what the Minister of State has said, in the event the club does not get the full amount, can it broken down into, say, three phases?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of a soccer club which received an allocation previously but did not finish it off.  It will make its case on that basis but will seek the maximum amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Is this a once-off allocation if clubs are not prepared to make an application this year?  I have long experience of making such applications for my local club, as have other Senators.  I would like to see, not for political reasons, as many clubs as possible receive a small amount at this stage due to the financial position, particularly those who were not eligible in the past, for example, those that did not own the grounds and may have applied for grants for equipment.  I have in mind athletics clubs in particular.  As Senator Healy Eames said, obesity is a major problem.  In athletic clubs everybody takes part in the games.  There are no substitutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, obesity is a major problem.  Since I became Minister of State, one of my priorities has been to get more women involved in sport because they will bring the children and get them used to taking part in sport.  At my first meeting with the local sports partnership, I asked it to target persons with disabilities, women and disadvantaged areas.  That is being done.</P>
        <P>In respect of the applications, allocations will not be made on a <i>per capita</i> basis, but the system will be fair to ensure every organisation receives an allocation.  Projects must be examined.  While more than &euro;57 million worth of projects were drawn down in 2008, a massive sum of money was not drawn down. Allocations were made to counties on a <i>per capita</i> basis but the money was not drawn down.  That created a problem.  This time we will assess whether projects can start and reach completion.</P>
        <P>The first criteria for funding will be shared facilities, for which there will be a rating.  Second, the local contribution, whether 5%, 10%, 15% or more, will aid the project because it is clear the organisation will be able to complete the task.  Third, organisations that have not received a grant previously must be given an opportunity.  There are clubs with great committees which make an application to enhance its facilities.  However, if a club with great facilities and a club with no facilities makes application, the club with no facilities must be supported.</P>
        <P>We will seek to assist the disadvantaged areas.  The reason I have reduced the local contribution for CL&Aacute;R and RAPID areas is to give those areas an opportunity to draw down some of the allocations.</P>
        <P>We will do this as fairly as possible, but no matter what is done, one will be criticised.  A large number of applications have been received which may be valued at up to &euro;300 million.  However, we have only &euro;30 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>How many applications have been received?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The good news is we have &euro;30 million and it is the first sports capital programme since 2008.  The next round of the programme will be in 2015, depending on the economic situation and the hope of getting extra funding in the meantime.  Every euro spent on sport is money well spent.  When the Minister for Finance comes to the House, I hope Senators will make that point.  When a choice has to be made between health, education and sport, one is inclined to leave sport aside.</P>

    <Title>Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) (Amendment) Bill 2012: Second and Subsequent Stages</Title>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to the House.  We will deal with 1a. on the Supplementary Order Paper, Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) (Amendment) Bill 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to present the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) (Amendment) Bill 2012 for consideration by the House and I thank the Whips in this House as in the other House for their co-operation in ensuring that the Bill can be taken today.  The legislation seeks to cease the inclusion of the carbon revenue levy in wholesale electricity prices bid into the single electricity market.  On its enactment it will end the charging of the levy so that it can no longer be included in prices bid into this market.  This in turn will end the associated wholesale electricity price increase thereafter.</P>
        <P>The inclusion of the carbon levy in wholesale electricity prices is a result of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Viridian Power Limited and Huntstown Power Company Limited <i>v</i>. the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  The decision issued on 23 February quashed the prohibition of the carbon levy being included in wholesale electricity price bids in the single electricity market.</P>
        <P>The consequence of the Supreme Court decision to quash the prohibition means that the levy is now mandatorily included in all generators&rsquo; price bids.  As it stands, after the judgment and without any action being taken, electricity generators are not only allowed to include the opportunity cost of the free carbon allowances they have received in their price bids but also the cost of the levy they pay to the regulator, thus increasing the wholesale price of electricity by the amount of the levy.  The expected impact of the decision is to increase wholesale electricity prices by a figure estimated at between 3% and 6%.  This potentially could increase electricity prices to end consumers.  Certain large businesses have already seen increases in their prices because of the inclusion of the levy in the wholesale bids.  As time goes on, again assuming no action is taken, increases would also be expected to take effect in due course in the prices paid by medium and small business and those paid by domestic consumers.</P>
        <P>As Members are aware, prices in the retail electricity market for all business and domestic customers have been deregulated.  There is no ministerial or regulatory role in setting retail electricity prices.  It is therefore an entirely commercial matter for electricity suppliers to decide whether, when and by how much to increase or decrease prices depending, for example, on market circumstances, contract terms and hedging practices.  I note some electricity generators are also suppliers in the retail market, whether domestic or business or both.  The Government is also concerned about the potential impact on Northern Irish electricity consumers and this reinforces the need for urgent resolution of the issue.  The levy&rsquo;s inclusion in wholesale prices, again assuming no further action, would also have the effect of increasing wholesale prices in Northern Ireland, as well as in the Republic, because of the existence of the all-island wholesale market for electricity.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that the cost of energy in Ireland is a serious competitiveness issue facing energy consumers during this difficult period for the economy.  As I have noted, prices in the retail electricity market for both domestic and business customers are now fully deregulated.  Prices charged to electricity customers are wholly a commercial and operational matter for the suppliers.  Ireland&rsquo;s electricity markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about high oil and gas prices are shared at EU level and by fellow member countries of the International Energy Agency, IEA.  The EU and IEA agree that high fossil fuel prices underline the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by radically enhanced energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy.  At a national level, competitive markets in electricity help put downward pressure on prices.  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure the costs of energy are as competitive as possible, including sustained focus on energy efficiency measures.</P>
        <P>In view of the importance the Government attaches to electricity costs, for business competitiveness and because of their role in domestic bills, it therefore has agreed to end the charging of the carbon revenue levy.  This is to mitigate the increase in wholesale electricity prices resulting from its inclusion in generators&rsquo; price bids into the single electricity market, SEM.  The purpose of the Bill is to end the charging of the levy on enactment, thereby ceasing its inclusion in these bids and thus ending the associated wholesale electricity price increase thereafter.  Amending the Act in order to cease the imposition of the levy from the earliest possible date will ensure the wholesale electricity price increase has effect for the shortest period possible.  In this way, the inclusion of the levy in wholesale prices will have the least possible impact on retail prices.  This is vital for business competitiveness and for domestic consumers&rsquo; electricity bills.  Senators will appreciate, from what I have just said, the protection of the electricity cost competitiveness of Irish enterprise, as well as the impact on domestic consumers&rsquo; electricity bills, are the key motivators for this legislation.  The impact on Northern Irish electricity prices is also a significant concern.  I am confident that Senators will agree, for the reasons I have just outlined, as to the urgency of taking action to ensure such price rises do not happen and to minimise their duration if they do happen.  We had an unusual consensus in the Lower House, where across the divide in every sense of the term, it was accepted that the enactment of the legislation was an urgent priority.  Our collective concern, therefore is reflected in the urgent priority the Oireachtas is affording to this Bill, which I acknowledge.</P>
        <P>As I have previously outlined, the need for this legislation is to end the inclusion of the levy in price bids into the single electricity market and the associated wholesale price increase.  In turn, the levy&rsquo;s inclusion in these price bids is because of the Supreme Court decision quashing the prohibition on the inclusion of the levy.  Given this context of the levy and the judgment, as well as the undoubted complexity of these matters, it would be useful for all concerned for me to set out the wider background and explain how the levy came about.  This requires me to briefly explain carbon allowances under the emissions trading scheme and describe the wholesale single electricity market.  The manner in which carbon was allowed to be bid into electricity prices in this market is also relevant.  I will also speak about the nature of the legal challenge itself.</P>
        <P>Free carbon allowances originate from the EU emissions trading scheme, under which electricity generators have received these allowances.  The EU emissions trading directive, Directive 2003/87/EC, was implemented to assist member states in achieving reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases by establishing a carbon trading regime whereby large emitters of greenhouse gases were required to possess allowances for their emissions.  These measures were implemented following signature of the Kyoto Protocol.  The directive was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading) Regulations 2004, SI 437 of 2004.  These regulations led to the creation of national allocation plans, which determined how the allowances were to be allocated sector by sector.  Under the Irish national allocation plan covering phase 2 of the emissions trading scheme, which runs from 2008 to 2012, electricity generators receive the vast bulk of their required carbon allowances for free, with only a small amount of the allowances auctioned.</P>
        <P>The single electricity market created a single market for electricity on the island of Ireland.  On 1 November 2007, the market went live, commencing the trading of wholesale electricity in Ireland and Northern Ireland on an all-island basis.  In its review of Irish energy policy last year, the ESRI stated that one of the key successes of Irish energy policy in recent years was the implementation of the single electricity market on the island of Ireland and concluded that the single electricity market had ensured a secure supply of electricity at a competitive price since 2007.  The single electricity market committee, which comprises the energy regulators North and South and two independent members, is statutorily responsible for the regulation and oversight of the single electricity market.  The committee governs the operation of the all-island wholesale electricity market.</P>
        <P>Although generators receive the majority of their allowances for free under the emissions trading scheme, they are able to receive revenue for them from the single electricity market through a decision taken by the single electricity market committee.  In March 2008, the committee decided that regardless of how they receive the carbon allowances, all electricity generators must include the full opportunity cost of carbon allowances in the bids they submit to the single electricity market.  Therefore, generators participating in the single electricity market were allowed to bid in the opportunity cost of the free carbon allowances to the price they charge for electricity generation by this decision.  As a result of this decision, electricity generators receive additional revenues from the market due to the inclusion of the opportunity cost of carbon allowances in their allowable costs for the purposes of price determination in the single electricity market.  This is despite the fact that all or some of the allowances have been granted for free.</P>
        <P>The Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) (Amendment) Act 2010, which was enacted on 30 June 2010, amended the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  Its provisions allowed for the charging and collection of a levy from the electricity generators by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  This ensures a portion of these additional revenues &mdash; the opportunity cost of the free carbon allowances &mdash; are recovered for the use by the Exchequer.  The legislation provided that the carbon revenue levy would end on 31 December 2012 in line with the ending of free allowances and the requirement to purchase them after 1 January 2013.  The 2010 Act provided for the introduction of a carbon revenue levy payable by fossil fuel generators of electricity.  It provided that proceeds from the levy were disbursed into or for the benefit of the Exchequer.  It required the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to direct the regulator on how the proceeds of the levy should be disbursed in line with Government policy.  The proceeds of the levy have in this manner been utilised for rebates to large energy users to mitigate their electricity costs in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The large energy users that have benefited are significant employers with an indigenous and multinational base.  This rebate scheme is temporary and will be paid in accordance with the existing annual direction to the regulator.  There are no implications for the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>After charging and collecting of the levy had commenced, two companies sought to bid in the carbon revenue levy as an allowable cost for price purposes in the single electricity market.  In response, the single electricity market committee issued a determination confirming, in effect, that the levy could not be included in the electricity generators&rsquo; costs in determining the wholesale price of electricity.  Two private electricity generators, Viridian and Endesa, brought a High Court case against the regulator to challenge the decision that prohibited the inclusion of the levy in price bids.  This was decided in the regulator&rsquo;s favour in late 2010.  Viridian then brought an appeal to the Supreme Court stating that the High Court judge erred in his judgment.  The Supreme Court issued its judgment in February 2012, stating that the prohibition on the inclusion of the levy in the electricity generators&rsquo; price bids was incorrect.  The legislation was not challenged in the case and the Supreme Court judgment was not directed at it.  As a result of the judgment, the levy had to be included in wholesale electricity price bids in the single electricity market, with knock-on impacts on the wholesale price as I set out in detail earlier.  This required action to be taken to minimise the duration of the price increase.</P>
        <P>I will outline the main provisions of this short Bill.  For the convenience of the House, an explanatory memorandum has been published to provide a synopsis of the provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 is the substance of the Bill.  The single substantive provision of the Bill is to bring forward the end date of the final carbon revenue levy period as provided for in the original 2010 legislation.  I mentioned earlier that the end date was 31 December 2012, in line with carbon allowances having to be purchased after that point.  The legislation being discussed here today advances the end date from 31 December 2012 to the date of enactment of the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) (Amendment) Act 2012.  Part 2 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title of the Bill.  I commend the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) (Amendment) Bill 2012 to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  As he suggested, this provision will be not be opposed in this House.  How confident is the Minister that there will be a price reduction as a result of this legislation?  Will that reduction be passed on to the consumer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  There is a good chance that I will repeat some of the points the Minister has made.  It is important for Senators to understand the aim of this legislation and the positive effect it will have on the end users of electricity.  This Bill will amend section 40 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to enable the adjustment of the final levy period in which the carbon levy is payable from 31 December 2012 to the date of the passing of the legislation before the House.  The 1999 Act provided for the establishment of the Commission for Energy Regulation, as directed by the EU.  Under that Act, the Commission for Energy Regulation is empowered to grant electricity supply and generation licences to identified bodies and authorised to sanction the construction of power generation stations and transmission and distribution systems.  The 1999 Act gave the commission the following functions: to publish proposals for a system of contracts and other arrangements, including appropriate rights and obligations for trading electricity; to engage in a public consultation process on the procedures to be adopted by those trading; to advise the Minister on the impact of electricity generation on sustainability and international agreements on the environment to which the State becomes party; and to make regulations, where necessary, for those involved in the production and generation of electricity, including in areas such as safety, efficiency, security and supply.  A further important function of the commission is to promote competition in the market and in so doing facilitate an environment in which the consumer pays the lowest possible price for electricity.  This is an outcome all of us would welcome.</P>
        <P>Over the years, the functions and responsibilities of the Commission for Energy Regulation have changed to reflect changes at national and European Union level.  Our requirements regarding the amount of electricity we produce from renewable sources have increased and we have been required to reduce emissions from gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.  This has been reflected in the evolution of the 1999 Act.  The reason for the amendment to the Act is to ensure any increased charge in the wholesale cost of electricity is justified.  Electricity generators have been receiving free carbon allowances under the EU emissions trading scheme.  Those generators operating in the single electricity market, SEM, as determined by the single electricity market committee as per the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Single Electricity Market) Act 2007, were allowed to bid the opportunity cost of the free allowances, despite having received these allowances free of charge.  Additional profits were earned by the generators from this windfall gain.</P>
        <P>As with all legislation, certain amendments must be made over time and the 2007 Act was amended in 2010 by the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Carbon Revenue Levy) Act 2010, which allowed for the insertion of a section 40D in the 1999 Act.  This new section addressed the payment of the carbon revenue levy by each electricity generator through participation in the single electricity market in relation to the amount of emissions attributable to each generating station.  The levy was for the use of the central Exchequer.  A formula &mdash; &ldquo;E x P&rdquo; &mdash; was devised to calculate the carbon levy where &ldquo;E&rdquo; is the total emissions during the levy period and &ldquo;P&rdquo; is the average daily price for allowances, as determined by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The Bill before us addresses section 40D of the 1999 Act by bringing forward the end date for the final carbon revenue levy period from 31 December 2012 to the date of enactment of this legislation.</P>
        <P>As I noted, the Government wants the end user, namely, the consumer, to obtain electricity at the lowest possible price.  While we do not have control over certain external factors, including the price of oil and gas on the world market, where we can influence the direction of domestic costs, we must step in for the benefit of consumers.  The Bill will close the carbon revenue levy period and thus remove the ability of generators to receive an unearned windfall.  A High Court case was brought by two energy companies, Viridian and Endesa, against a decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation preventing energy companies from including a carbon revenue levy as an allowable cost in bids for wholesale price purposes.  The High Court found in favour of the regulator but Viridian subsequently appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which found in favour of the company at the end of February 2012.  The expected impact of the decision on wholesale electricity prices was estimated at between 3% and 6%.  With this in mind, the Government has been forced to act to protect small and medium business users as well as hard-pressed domestic consumers from unnecessary price increases.  For this reason, it introduced the Bill to shorten the lifespan of the levy from 31 December 2012 to the date of enactment of the Bill, thus closing the door on electricity generators&rsquo; ability to pass on the carbon revenue levy in the wholesale market and, ultimately, to consumers.  I fully support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the provisions and objectives of the Bill and commend it to the House.  I also commend the Minister on the prompt and expeditious manner in which he introduced the legislation.  The last thing commercial, industrial or residential users of electricity need at this time is an increase in the price of energy.  An increase of between 3% and 6% would be seriously detrimental to companies&rsquo; cost base and add to pressure on families.  I also commend the Senators opposite on unanimously supporting this sensible and sound Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Whelan in thanking the Senators opposite for facilitating the passage of the Bill.  In the process I give Senator Daly the assurance he seeks.  The entire purpose of the legislation is to prevent a knock-on to the consumer.  This has not yet happened and I hope the enactment of the Bill will halt such a possibility in its tracks.  This is one of the reasons for speed in having the Bill enacted before both Houses rise next week.  I should perhaps speak only for the D&aacute;il, the House I know best, as I do not know if the Seanad is in session next week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to have this legislation enacted this week as its purpose is to prevent any increase in the cost of electricity, consequent on the Supreme Court decision, by preventing the bidding in of the carbon revenue levy.  I greatly appreciate the co-operation of the House in this regard.</P>
        <P>While this is a minor Bill in terms of length &mdash; it contains a single substantive section &mdash; it is very important in terms of arresting a process to which some exception was taken in the other House.   Owing to my position, I cannot comment on the matter but a number of Deputies were critical of the Supreme Court decision.  Those of us who examined the judgment made in the High Court believed the regulator was on safe ground.  In any event, it is my duty to respond to the decision of the Supreme Court and the Bill seeks to do so in the national interest.</P>
