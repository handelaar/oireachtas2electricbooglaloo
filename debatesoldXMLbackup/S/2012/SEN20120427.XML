    <Title>Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill, which has been referred to the Seanad by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, is very important.  As Minister for Social Protection, the needs of the people who depend on social welfare for vital support are foremost in my mind.  However, I am also very conscious of the harsh economic environment within which the country now operates.  Spending on social protection cannot be viewed in isolation.  It takes place in the wider context of overall Government income and expenditure.  My Department currently accounts for approximately 40% of all current Government expenditure.  This means &euro;4 in every &euro;10 that the Government spends is spent on social protection.  Some &euro;20.5 billion will be spent by the Government on social welfare provision in 2012.  The adjustment in social protection expenditure this year will be limited to &euro;475 million, or just over 2% of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Balancing the needs of the people dependent on social welfare against the money available is extremely difficult in the current economic environment.  However, protecting the most vulnerable people, those in poverty and those at risk of poverty, still remains a primary priority of the Government.  In addition to supporting the direct recipients and their dependants, social welfare spending sustains economic activity.  It benefits workers, businesses, and the overall community.  Individuals such as Professor Joseph Stiglitz have long recognised that social welfare expenditure in western Europe is a very important form of economic stimulus in the Keynesian sense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill will give legislative effect to certain social welfare measures announced in the Budget Statement of December 2011 which are due to come into effect this year, in addition to a number of miscellaneous amendments to the social welfare code.  I am introducing a number of amendments to occupational pension provision in this Bill.  Encouraging, empowering and enabling people to participate in work is essential if we are to achieve the goal of a more active and inclusive society.  The process of moving from welfare dependence to paid employment can be challenging for the persons concerned and their families.  Despite this, it is through paid employment that people have the greatest chance of moving out of poverty and providing better lives and opportunities for their children.  While remaining dependent on social welfare payments, they will remain at risk of poverty, poor health and reduced life chances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was very struck by the ESRI&rsquo;s study, published yesterday by Dorothy Watson, Bertrand Ma&icirc;tre and Chris Whelan, that showed the children most at risk were those of lone parents who did not continue in education.  It is quite remarkable that where the education level of parents is higher, the economic outcomes for their children and the likelihood of avoiding poverty are much greater.  In general, the best route out of poverty is through paid employment.  A large proportion of lone-parent families have much higher rates of poverty and a much greater risk thereof than other working-age adults.  This was at the core of yesterday&rsquo;s report by the ESRI.  This is in spite of significant spending on payments and supports to lone parents.  The EU SILC figures of 2011 show that, in 2010, some 9.3% of lone parents in Ireland were experiencing consistent poverty, which is 50% more than the population as a whole.  In general, the best route out of poverty is through paid employment.  We recognise that work, especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of very young children, but we believe supporting parents in participating in the labour market once their children have reached an appropriate age will improve their and their families&rsquo; economic circumstances and well-being.</P>
        <P>Changes to the one-parent family payment were introduced in 2010 to make payment until the youngest child reached 14.  I am now introducing further changes so that, for new recipients, from May 2012 a one-parent family payment will be made until the youngest child reaches the age of 12.  From January 2013, it will be made until the age of ten, and from 2014 it will be made until the age of seven.  For existing recipients, there will be a tapered phasing-out period to enable them to gain access to education and training and prepare them for their return to the labour market.  The current age is 18 to 22 if the child is in full-time education.  Over time that will be reduced when the changes come into effect in 2015 and 2016.  If a parent is still in need of income support when the youngest child reaches the age of seven, he or she may be able to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or another appropriate income support payment, or, if in employment, family income supplement.  There are special transitional arrangements for parents with a child with a disability or parents who go back to education or training.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recognise the possible effects of these changes on the need of parents to access affordable, quality child care facilities where they are required to work to supplement income.  I am also aware that many lone parents will need access to education, training and enabling services such as child care provision to acquire the skills they will need to gain employment.  A wide range of education and training opportunities are available through my Department and the Department of Education and Skills for lone parents to strengthen their qualifications and skills base and accordingly maximise their chances of gaining employment.  I have committed to bringing forward further legislation in a future social welfare Bill to introduce later implementation dates if more time is needed to ensure the required level of services are in place.  I am confident this will succeed. In the 1960s, we introduced free secondary education which many people thought impossible at the time. In the 1970s, on the advice of the OECD, we introduced a system of regional technical education which now makes up the institutes of technology system. At the time many critics felt it also could not be done. In the 1990s, I was involved with the then Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party Government&rsquo;s initiative to introduce mass access to third level education through the fees initiative and the Early Start programme in primary school for preschool education. Although we may be in economic difficulties, in the past we have shown the striking capacity to expend the education base with enormous economic, as well as social and educational, returns. </P><P Just="Left">I will be engaging with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Education and Skills to achieve a co-ordinated, cross-departmental approach to ensuring the required level of services are in place to support lone parents as their youngest child reaches the relevant age thresholds. One of the most progressive statements by the Government was the appointment of a full Minister for children.  Inevitably, an initiative such as this takes time to bear fruit but it is an important and radical step. </P>

        <P>I am also bringing forward several other important changes to the social welfare system in this Bill.  The Bill will apply restrictions on the payment of mortgage interest supplement to provide that it will not be payable for a person in the first 12 months of the mortgage arrears resolution process, as set out in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears applying to mortgage lenders.  The intention is that the financial institution would provide at least 12 months forbearance to borrowers in respect of their mortgage obligations and only after this 12 month period would mortgage interest supplement be available.  It is important that borrowers who are experiencing difficulties with their mortgage obligations engage with their lender as soon as the difficulty arises.  In this way, they can work together to put in place a solution for both parties.</P>
        <P>There are two categories of people who will be affected by this change.  The first category comprises people whose mortgage difficulty is resolved within the first 12 months, for example, when they return to work, and potential claimants who will no longer qualify for a payment until they have received 12 months forbearance from their lender.  This year, the Department will spend at least &euro;50 million on mortgage interest supplement supports which, of course, goes to the banks.  Having listened to one mortgage difficulty case on the media this morning, it must be agreed that the supplement will have to be used in a way that compels lenders to engage with customers in a meaningful way rather than being a payment the banks can pick up automatically.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears makes specific provision for forbearance and all lenders are obliged to sign up to it.  MABS, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, gives detailed advice to people with complex debt situations.  It is important all our efforts go on stabilising family debt problems over time with the agreement of the lenders.  This will be included in the legislation on which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is working.  It is particularly complex due to certain constitutional problems that may arise.</P>
        <P>I will also be introducing several measures designed to tackle fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  Welfare fraud is a serious crime and the Department of Social Protection is doing all it can to crack down on people who abuse the system.  When high-risk areas are identified, targeted control measures are put in place to reduce the risk of fraud and abuse of the system.  Over the past year, Senators raised various concerns with me in the House about welfare fraud and I believe these are reflected in this Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department has begun the phased introduction of the public services card with key security features, including a photograph and signature, which will be used to authenticate identity of individuals.  One of the advantages of the public services card is that it will help to reduce fraud and error which result from the incorrect identification of claimants.  We have a growing problem in the system of claimants using multiple identities.  Under the existing legislative provisions there is no mandatory requirement for a person to allow for his or her photograph and signature to be captured and reproduced in electronic format for purposes of a personal public service number, PPSN, allocation, public services card and claims for social welfare benefits.  I will be proposing a change to provide for the introduction of a new condition for any new claim for social welfare payment that the claimant must satisfy the Department as to his or her identity, including allowing for electronic capture of photograph and signature.  I will also be strengthening the powers of social welfare inspectors to make inquiries in various circumstances at ports and airports, a point often raised here and in the D&aacute;il.  Inspectors will have powers to make inquiries with landlords in connection with rent supplement claims, obviously for the purpose of determining that the people availing of the accommodation are those in receipt of the rent supplement.  These powers will strengthen the interagency operations between the Garda, customs, Revenue and social welfare inspectors against social welfare fraud, giving them the appropriate powers to inquire in cases of suspected fraud.</P>
        <P>I am introducing a number of amendments to the occupational pension provision in the Bill.  The amendments provide for a requirement for defined benefit pension schemes to hold a risk reserve in addition to the funding standard requirements set out in the Pensions Act.  The sustainability of pensions in the longer term is a critical issue.  As the House will be aware, the OECD is looking at the direction of Irish pensions policy for the future.  The purpose of the amendments is to further underpin the legislative provision applying to defined benefit schemes generally and which is to help provide a secure pension for the members of defined benefits schemes in the future and ensure the sustainability of defined benefit pensions.  Defined benefit pension schemes are an important element of pension provision in Ireland.  However, the number of defined benefit schemes has been gradually reducing over many years.  At the end of 2010 there were over 1,000 such schemes with 222,000 active members, down from 1,500 schemes in 2003 and just over 2,500 in 1991.  Many defined benefit schemes are mature schemes and closed to new members.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following the downturn in the financial markets, the previous Minister and the regulator had the funding standard suspended in late 2008 to allow the trustees of pension schemes to assess the impact of historically high volatility in the financial markets and the significant losses experienced.  This suspension was extended on a number of occasions to allow for changes to the Pensions Act in 2009 and 2010 to assist trustees to respond to the funding difficulties facing many pension schemes.  A consultation process also took place on proposals for a new defined benefits model which would address the persistent difficulties being experienced by defined benefit schemes and support their sustainability in the future.  The amendments I am introducing facilitate the reintroduction of the funding standard and the full regulatory structure.  The proposal in the Bill to introduce a risk reserve reflects the outcome of the consultation process.  The introduction of a risk reserve will provide a buffer to assist schemes to absorb financial shocks in the future and in this regard will enhance the protection of the pension entitlements of scheme members against future volatility in the markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is recognised that many defined benefits pension schemes are in deficit and will need time to recover their funding position.  It is, therefore, intended to introduce the risk reserve requirement over an extended time period.  The funding standard will be introduced initially and from 1 January 2016 pension schemes will be required to hold a risk reserve.  However, schemes will be given up to 11 years from the reintroduction of the funding standard to satisfy the risk reserve requirement.  It is estimated that the risk reserve will increase the liabilities of a defined benefits scheme.  However, this will depend on the investment profile of each scheme.  Changes to the funding standard guidelines will give credit to schemes that reduce their equity risk and assist schemes to satisfy their funding requirements.</P>
        <P>Scheme trustees have options in this regard.  Legislation has been introduced to provide for sovereign annuities.  The Pensions Board published guidelines to assist potential providers with the development of sovereign annuity products.  As part of this initiative, the NTMA will issue, subject to market yields, sovereign bonds of a long duration that will allow pension schemes to better match their assets to their liabilities.  This initiative provides pension schemes with an option which was not previously available.  Irish pension schemes have the majority of their assets invested outside Ireland and as well as being a mechanism for more prudent investment, the initiative has the potential to attract pension fund investments into the economy.  There is in excess of &euro;70 billion in various pension fund products in Ireland, but most of this money is invested abroad.  There has been a great deal of work done to develop the sovereign annuity product in the Irish market.  The Pensions Board is also giving consideration to the provision of an enforceable employer guarantee to meet the risk reserve requirements.</P>
        <P>I am aware that many trustees and sponsors of defined benefit schemes have been working hard to enhance the sustainability of their schemes and making difficult decisions in that regard.  It is important in addressing current deficits in a pension scheme that the trustees are aware of changes to the defined benefits model in order that they can bring forward funding proposals which will meet the future requirements.  The amendments and the reintroduction of the funding standard will give trustees the certainty they need in preparing realistic funding proposals for submission to the Pensions Board.</P>
        <P>I am also introducing a technical change to ensure the revaluation rate required in respect of deferred members of a pension scheme does not put them in a more favourable position than active members.  This change will track the annual consumer price index rate and keep any adjustment to preserved benefits more in line with changes in the wage-salary rate.  The amendments are designed to make defined benefits pension provision more sustainable, stable and secure in the future.</P>
        <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title, construction and any necessary commencements.  Section 2 provides for the definition of certain common terms used throughout this Part of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for an increase in the minimum number of paid PRSI contributions required to be eligible to become a voluntary contributor from 260 to 520.  This affects no more than 1,000 persons who are special voluntary contributors.  There was some confusion that this provision had general application.  It is to meet a particular special voluntary contributor category.</P>
        <P>Sections 4 and 5 make a number of amendments to the one-parent family payment to provide for the phased reduction in the age limit that applies to the youngest child in the family for qualification purposes from 14 years to seven.  The age limit for the youngest child is being reduced in three steps: from 14 years to 12 from May 2012, from 12 years to ten from January 2013; and from ten years to seven from January 2014.  For those already in the system, these changes will take effect from 2015 and 2016.  The arrangements to which I referred apply to new recipients and there are transitional arrangements for others.</P>
        <P>Section 6 amends and extends the list of bodies specified in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as being authorised to use the personal public service number, PPSN, for the purposes of carrying out transactions with members of the public, for sharing personal data and information among themselves for the purposes of carrying out relevant transactions, and for exchanging data.  The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman is now included, while VECs are specified for the purposes of sections 262 to 270, inclusive, of the Act.  They are currently specified for the purposes of section 266 only.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides for an extension to the list of social welfare payments excluded from the disqualification of concurrent receipt of a weekly social welfare payment where a person is also participating in a community employment scheme.  It is now being extended to include all weekly and monthly supplements payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, that is, in addition to the current exclusion of rent supplement, mortgage interest supplement and diet supplement are also being excluded.  That is to ensure those participating in community employment schemes who would qualify for these payments can continue to qualify for and receive them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 3 provides for the amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 necessary to give effect to the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce a risk reserve to the funding standard.  The funding standard needs to be met by defined benefits pension schemes to ensure a pension scheme can live up to its pension promise.  This is intended to improve the sustainability of pension schemes and the security of members&rsquo; benefits and provide a buffer against the volatility of financial markets.  The measure will allow pension schemes a long lead-in time to develop the required level of risk reserve.  The level of risk reserve will be linked with the level of risk the pension scheme is carrying in its investment strategy.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Part 3 and sections 20 to 40 provide for amendments to the Pensions Act 1990.  Sections 20 and 21 provide for the definition of the principal Act for the purposes of Part 3.  Section 22 amends section 7A of the Act to provide that guidance issued by the Pensions Board or any other person specified by regulation under this Act cannot be changed without the prior consent of the Minister for Social Protection.  Section 23 amends section 33 of the Pensions Act to provide for a change to how the preserved benefits of deferred scheme members &mdash; former employees &mdash; are revalued in line with the consumer price index.  Section 24 amends section 34 of the Act to clarify that the Pensions Board can issue guidance on the calculation of the transfer value of pension rights.</P>
        <P>Sections 25 to 37 amend the funding standard to require schemes to hold a risk reserve.  The proposed amendment to the funding standard will require a defined benefit pension scheme to hold a funding reserve in addition to the level of funding required under the funding standard at present.  The existing funding standard provisions in Part IV of the Act, which require pension schemes to maintain sufficient assets to meet the liabilities of a scheme, will be extended to require pension schemes to hold a risk reserve.  The trustees of pension schemes are currently required to submit an actuarial funding certificate to the Pensions Board to indicate whether the scheme satisfies the funding standard.  If it does not satisfy the standard, the trustees are required to submit a funding proposal to the board to restore scheme funding.  The amendments to the Pensions Act will, in addition to the submission of an actuarial funding certificate, now require the trustees of a pension scheme to submit an actuarial funding reserve certificate.  If either certificate indicates that the scheme does not satisfy the funding requirements the scheme must, except in certain circumstances, submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore funding by the next funding certificate date.  The Pensions Board will have discretion to extend this period.  The provisions relating to the failure to comply with the funding requirement are also being strengthened.  Section 25 inserts definitions for the purpose of this Part IV of the Act.</P>
        <P>Section 26 amends section 41 of the Act to disapply the risk reserve requirement to regulatory own funds scheme as those reserve requirements are dealt with in Part IVB of the Act.  Section 27 amends section 42 of the Act to require relevant schemes to submit an actuarial funding reserve certificate to indicate whether the scheme satisfies the risk reserve requirement.  Section 28 amends section 43 of the Act to specify the date on which the assets and liabilities of the scheme for the purpose of preparing an actuarial funding reserve certificate are assessed and the timeframe for submission of the actuarial funding reserve certificate to the Pensions Board.</P>
        <P>Section 29 amends section 44 of the Act to set the level of reserve required to be maintained by relevant schemes.  The reserve will be the aggregate of two amounts.  The first is 15% of the amount of the funding standard liabilities less the value of EU bonds and cash and any other prescribed assets held.  The other is the amount by which the funding standard liabilities would increase on the effective date of the certificate if there was a 0.5% fall in interest rates.  The Minister for Social Protection will have the power to prescribe a higher or lower percentage.  Section 30 amends section 45 of the Act to change the reference from section 44 to section 44(1).  This is consequential to the insertion of section 44(2) by section 16.</P>
        <P>Section 31 amends section 46 of the Act to specify the matters to which an actuary must have regard when completing an actuarial funding reserve certificate just as the actuary is already required to do when completing an actuarial funding certificate under that section.  Section 32 amends section 47 of the Act to ensure there is no doubt as to the power of the Minister for Social Protection to prescribe different requirements for different calculations for the purposes of Part IV of the Act.  Section 33 amends section 48 to clarify the scheme liabilities which must be discharged before any resources can be returned to an employer on the wind-up of a scheme and to clarify the benefits to which the purchase of an annuity with fixed rate increases can apply.</P>
        <P>Section 34 extends section 49 of the Act to require the trustees of a pension scheme to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board where a pension scheme fails to satisfy the funding standard reserve requirements.  Pension schemes will be required to restore funding by the date of the next funding reserve certificate.  The Pensions Board will issue prescribed guidance setting out the requirements for a funding proposal and will have discretion to extend the date by which scheme funding must be restored.</P>
        <P>Section 35 amends section 50 of the Act to include failure to submit a funding standard reserve certificate as an additional circumstance under which the Pensions Board may issue a notice under section 50 to reduce scheme benefits.  Section 50 is also amended to oblige trustees to implement the benefit reductions proposed to the Pensions Board and to comply within the time limit for implementation of the proposal specified in the notice under that section.  Failure to comply could result in a prosecution.  A new subsection (4) is being inserted in section 50 of the Act to empower the Minister for Social Protection to prescribe the guidance of the Pensions Board as regards the form and detailed requirements of an application by scheme trustees to reduce scheme benefits.</P>
        <P>Section 36 extends section 51A of the Act to include the completion of funding standard reserve certificates in the responsibilities of actuaries in relation to pension schemes.  Section 37 amends section 53E of the Act by deleting the definition of &ldquo;funding standard liabilities&rdquo; which is being inserted in section 40 of the Act by section 12 of this Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 38 amends section 55 of the Act to require the trustees of a pension scheme to include a statement in the annual report indicating whether the scheme satisfies the funding standard reserve requirements.  If it does not it must notify the Pensions Board within a time limit which may be prescribed by the Minister for Social Protection.  Section 39 amends section 59G of the Act to require the consent of the trustees to an application for early retirement under the rules of the scheme where the actuary is not satisfied that the scheme would satisfy the funding standard reserve requirements at the date of the commencement of retirement.  Section 40 amends Part B of the Second Schedule to the Pensions Act and is consequential to the change to the revaluation of benefits at section 23 above.  Part B is amended to clarify the reference point for the revaluation of scheme benefits.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to the aforementioned sections, Part 2 of the Bill contains 12 other sections which make various changes in other areas of the social welfare code.  Sections 8 to 11, inclusive, relate to the PRSI system.  Section 12 limits entitlements to mortgage interest supplement.  Section 13 relates to the use of the PPS number in the education sector.  Sections 15 to 17, inclusive, give additional powers to inspectors for the control of fraud.  Social welfare inspectors will have powers to question people at ports and airports and make inquiries with landlords regarding rent supplement.  Section 18 is a technical amendment on the financing of the social insurance fund.</P>
        <P>We have to ensure that the neediest in society are protected and supported in these difficult economic times.  In particular, we must ensure for the sake of those who have contributed to the system, such as pensioners, that sufficient people of working age are employed to provide for retirees and young children.  All of us aspire to a good social welfare system which supports young people, children and pensioners in particular.  To make such a system sustainable, however, we must ensure people of working age, in so far as is possible, are contributors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government will invest &euro;20.6 billion this year in social protection for its citizens.  One of the greatest tasks I face is how to reform the system to ensure some of that spend is leveraged as an investment in people and to ensure that investment has consequences for our economy, where the people in whom we invest are in a position to contribute as workers to the economy and, thus, return to the system the investment in them.  Social welfare is a particularly western European concept which was developed more than 100 years ago, but, in the context of the frailty and turmoil of financial markets nowadays, we must see how we can look upon this figure as an important spending stimulus in the Keynesian sense.  American economists recognise that western Europe has a unique form of stimulus, which is its investment in widescale social welfare payments to people in different categories.  We must try to leverage that investment to help the economy to recover and grow, particularly in regard to people of working age in order that they will find work and become contributors in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our friends in the troika take a detailed interest in social welfare.  Sometimes they pore over expenditure in this area and they seem extraordinarily knowledgeable about the 50 to 60 schemes, categories of people and stages of life that social welfare covers.  They were satisfied with their current visit and presumably that means their continued approval of the country committing so much expenditure to social welfare, in particular to support people who are finding these times difficult.  My objective is to continue to do that with the support of the House and to leverage the expenditure in interesting ways to support the return to economic health of the economy.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome the introduction of the Bill.  The Minister will have realised since she took up office that Fianna F&aacute;il was most innovative with social welfare schemes.

	<P>However, every Fianna F&aacute;il Minister with responsibility for social welfare introduced more schemes than Ministers from other parties.

	<P Just="Left">I agree with the Minister's statement on 18 April that &ldquo;seven is too young for anyone to seriously contemplate any of these things without there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place&rdquo;.  She must be proud of her inheritance from Frank Cluskey.  I knew him well, having served in the D&aacute;il with him.  He was an extremely good Minister and parliamentarian.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Bill, the Minister should be open to amendments from this House.  The time limit is tight but there are experienced Members in this House, particularly in the child care area.   It is not beyond the capability of the Lower House to consider amendments from this House.  I served as  Minister of State and I accepted many amendments from this House because I found it always put forward enlightened views on legislation and pointed out provisions that needed amendment.  Though she stated it was unacceptable to lower the age limit of the youngest child to seven to qualify for the lone parent&rsquo;s allowance, she has provided for this in the legislation.  There is no need to include the provision, &ldquo;7 years in respect of any claim for one-parent family payments relating to any day occurring on or after 2 January 2014&rdquo;.  Her views are aspirational.  She wanted to put pressure on the Government to bring in better schemes in order that she would not have to implement this.  She rightly wants the Government to change its policy on child care facilities, yet she has the power to remove this provision from this Bill.  She did not secure Government approval in this regard.  Fine Gael is the majority party and it obviously was not prepared to give in on this.  The cut affects mothers who comprise the majority of one-parent families.  According to last year&rsquo;s census, one in eight people live in one-parent families, equating to 567,000 citizens in a population of 4.5 million.  That is why Fianna F&aacute;il has a particular interest in this area, as the Minister&rsquo;s proposal is contrary to our policy.  I compliment the staff of the House for ensuring the updated Bill was printed and available this morning.  I expected the Minister to have made an amendment in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to the amendment to pension provisions, the Minister said that in the case of a person who becomes a voluntary contributor paying contributions under the relevant chapter before 6 April 2013, the number of contributory weeks will change from 260 to 520.  What effect will this have?  How many people will be affected by this serious change?  It will affect people&rsquo;s entitlement to a contributory pension.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The total number of people affected is approximately 1,000, and this includes Members of the Oireachtas who may make voluntary contributions even though they receive no entitlements.  It is a small distinct group, most of whom have lived abroad or have returned to Ireland from abroad.  I will provide a note to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I sought clarification on the number affected but I am not sure whether it will have a greater effect than that.  That is the Minister&rsquo;s calculation at this stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that the Department has begun a phased introduction of a social public service card with key security features, including photographs and signatures.  I do not see why she could not provide for that in this legislation because it would not be before time.  The previous Minister&rsquo;s work on this was at an advanced stage.  It seems pretty logical to have a card with details including a photograph and signature.  That would eliminate much of the fraud that is taking place in the Department.  I do not understand the reason for the delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issues Senator Leyden has raised can be addressed by the Minister on Committee Stage, as the Senator is well aware.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a very obvious approach in this regard and I do not believe there is any objection from anyone in receipt of social welfare.  The small smart card has been introduced for medical card holders and again that should have a photograph, but that is a detail.  The technology exists and it is not rocket science to introduce those changes as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Regarding social welfare fraud, there has been an increase in the number of people sending in requests and information, some of it not very accurate.  I know the social welfare officers would be aware that some people would be concerned about their neighbours&rsquo; well-being and have submitted complaints.  The Minister has certainly received many complaints and requests in this regard, which is a reasonable point of view.  The principle of the social welfare system is that no one is entitled to claim social welfare without being entitled to it.  I am delighted with the clarifications in this regard.  Some people who have contacted me are deeply concerned about the contributory situation and the average system.  The proposal was that there would be a change in 2020 such that all contributions would be considered.</P>
        <P>Many people are entitled to British social welfare but are not claiming it, a matter I have raised previously.  They may have worked in Britain for ten years, for instance, and may be entitled to claim.  They may have included that in their claim for contributory Irish pension working in close collaboration with the British system, which is fair enough.  However, a number of people are not in receipt of a pension from the British Government.  I ask the Minister to update the position.  I have brought it to people&rsquo;s attention and while the amounts have not been great some people have received an extra small contribution from Britain for the work they did.  I believe the same applies to the United States.  The British system is very streamlined as is the Irish system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment the Minister, her Department and previous Ministers, in particular Dr. Michael Woods who introduced quite an innovation with computerisation.  The system is very effective and the system for Oireachtas support, which the Minister introduced, is working very well.  It is very public-friendly, for which I commend the Minister.  It is important to get a speedy assessment of social welfare.  I believe the Minister is saying that whatever is proposed in this House on Committee Stage in order to make the system fair and effective is worthy of consideration.</P>
        <P>I return to the issue of reducing the age limit to seven.  I believe she will change that provision in the future because it is not practical to have it as low as seven.  There is time to work on that in the meantime and we will table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for taking the time to listen to us.  She has a very important portfolio given that social welfare represents the bridge to work and also a bridge to education.  At times of recession it is arguably the most important portfolio.  The social welfare system is inherently essential in a democratic society.  It is an essential tool in aiding those who are struggling most.  The welfare is available to help the most struggling so that they do not fall into poverty.  It acknowledges how tough times are for many people.  However, the social welfare system must &mdash; I know the Minister is grappling with this &mdash; be a mechanism to incentivise work, to empower those receiving payments and encourage them to actively seek and gain work.  I say work as opposed to employment.  The difficulty is that we have educated for employment as opposed to educating to be employers.  This will be a very big change in mindset.  If we only educate to become an employee when there is a recession and jobs go everyone is stuck.  We need to educate to become self-employed and to provide a backup system for them.  It is wrong that when employers, who created the jobs, fall on hard times, they have no social welfare system at all.  I ask the Minister to address that in her closing speech today.  How is she advancing that issue because I know she was considering a social insurance fund for self-employed people?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another significant problem Ireland shares with the rest of Europe is youth unemployment, which is causing considerable fear &mdash; Hitler&rsquo;s rise to power came in such conditions.  We must tackle the issue head on and get our young people, who represent the future of the country, back to work &mdash; not just in employment &mdash; and towards a regular working life.  Social welfare is available for many people to get support if needed but they should not depend on these payments for a lifetime.  While we all agree with that, somehow the reality is that we do not accept it.  We create a culture that can at times be a dependency culture.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss one-parent families, the Minister&rsquo;s work on fraud, the amendments to the Pensions Act, the entitlement to mortgage income supplement, the voluntary PRSI contributions and how the review is getting on.  The literature indicates that a person who lives in a dependency culture for 15 years becomes embedded in that culture.  At the moment a parent is entitled to claim the one-parent family allowance until the youngest child is 14, which I believe is too long.  For a woman who becomes a mother today in the knowledge that she will have this one-parent family allowance for 14 years, there is no incentive to consider changing her circumstances and help herself.  I commend the Minister on reducing that upper age limit &mdash; with conditionality.  I take my hat off to lone parents who are doing a very difficult job.  Sometimes I feel that my husband is a lone parent, when I am here in Dublin.  When he is not there I wonder how we cope without each other&rsquo;s help.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The two-year lead-in time is critical.  It is important to poverty-proof it and continually monitor it as the Minister has promised.  The most important thing is that each lone parent is given a facilitator.  I know a mother who after 17 years and with the help of a person from the Galway resource centre has given up all social welfare assistance including her house.  How did she do it?  She had depression, etc., and only managed it because of the help of a facilitator.  The fundamental question is whether the decision we make today in reducing the child age limit to seven years for one-parent families will increase poverty and social problems or empower the lone parent to think ahead, plan the future for himself or herself and his or her children.  Fundamentally, will the over-dependency on it create a structural problem?  I believe we need to monitor it carefully.  I have done work on early school leaving and it is critical that child care support is in place, as the Minister stated, that the parent is supported with a facilitator and that at-risk families are watched.  The Minister mentioned families at risk of dropping out of education.  I know my fellow Senators are concerned about the fact this is not written into the Bill.  We have between now and Monday to look at ways to do so.</P>
        <P>With regard to the change affecting jobseeker&rsquo;s payments the Minister proposes to base it on a five day week as opposed to a six day week.  May I ask why it was a six day week benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to Senator Leyden speak about all of the schemes Fianna F&aacute;il introduced.  Its doing so is part of the problem because new structural difficulties in society were created as was overdependency.  I have been told in post offices that one of the 64 or 65 social welfare payments is for a washing machine and that everyone in the country is applying for it because it is a &euro;300 payment that is easy to get.  This definitely needs to be examined because it has been pointed out to me by people working in post offices that it is being abused.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment the Minister on her work on social welfare inspectors because we must follow fraud.  Senator Leyden raised the issue of e-signatures and photographs.  I apologise for having intervened when he was speaking but I spent Monday and Tuesday at a European meeting about this in Copenhagen.  It is quite difficult to introduce e-signatures because we must ensure they are secure and cannot be hacked.  How advanced are we in ensuring it will be a secure method?  The largest area of growth throughout the EU is the Digital Single Market.  However, it is the slowest area to introduce because of the structural change required for it to work effectively.</P>
        <P>It is mad that a person can live in another country and claim social welfare benefits here.  I know EU rules about this exist.  Is it now the case that child benefit can be claimed while the child is living abroad if one parent is working here?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit should be claimed only if the child is here and going to school, in a notified cr&egrave;che or in the ECCE scheme.  This needs serious consideration.  I understand the European rules but we have national authority here and it is possible to change this.</P>
        <P>With regard to the changes to the Pensions Act 1990 the idea of requiring 11 years to satisfy the risk reserve of the scheme is very good.  Has the Minister assessed the various pension funds which cannot meet their commitments?  Have they been informed?  Do their employees know?  In the event they still cannot fund pensions and the reserve risk is not met what is the fallback position for the people involved?  Everyone works and contributes with a view to retirement.  A baby born today could live to 100 years of age.  People live longer.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the fact that people cannot avail of mortgage income supplement for the first 12 months.  Is the point that the bank must give the person a holiday?  If so, that is fair enough.  We must move on the Keane report and the split mortgage proposal so a person is facilitated to pay back the bit he or she can while the other part is parked.</P>
        <P>I have found an anomaly with regard to voluntary contributions.  Prior to the changes being introduced a set of twins was about to qualify for the transitional pension and knew the application date was approaching.  One of the twins was late applying because of a family illness and therefore did not qualify.  This is dreadful.  She will now require 510 contributions which she does not have.  This is very hard and the case is with the Department at present.  It is under appeal but only after incredible pressure.</P>
        <P>How is the independent review body doing?  I made a submission to it but I have not yet received a response.  I have called for consideration of a movement away from individual schemes towards capping family social welfare income.  I am not stating this would not be without difficulty but I wonder how it is going.</P>
        <P>I am greatly concerned about whether the Minister&rsquo;s sick leave proposals would hurt employers who create jobs.  I would like to see employees take responsibility for sick leave after a certain period of time.  How is the Minister doing with regard to social insurance for self-employed people?  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry.  I am disappointed the Minister has just left.  Some of my comments will be aimed specifically towards her and I know the Minister of State will pass them on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><TitleTxt></TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>She will be well advised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate that.  Her role as Minister for Social Protection is critical and difficult.  She has already engaged in extensive debate on the Bill with our colleagues in the D&aacute;il and I listened very carefully to her speeches and her responses to the concerns and criticisms of Deputies.  What I heard which is positive and imaginative in the words of the Minister is that we should have a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place, similar to what is found in the Scandinavian countries; that we will have a reformed education and training system that takes a case management approach for each individual as outlined in Pathways to Work; that the Minister cares very deeply about these issues and was involved in designing some of the progressive social welfare schemes in the past; and that what is most critical is to provide access to training, education and employment for all of those out of work but with particular reference to effective solutions for lone parents.  In her wrap-up speech in the D&aacute;il the Minister stated we can make the next gain and the next step forward and that with a joined-up, cross-departmental approach with the Ministries of Social Protection, Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills we can open wider, better horizons for people who are parenting in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Please tell the Minister I am inspired by these words and I want to support her in implementing the reform necessary to realise this vision.  She knows I have worked for many years with people, especially women, parenting on their own in the social context of poverty, and these are precisely the kinds of reforms we need to support people to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, and to turn the tide of unemployment, inequality, poverty and child poverty that hundreds of thousands of Irish people find themselves in today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is because of this work and experience that I and other Independent Senators will offer amendments to some of the sections of the Bill, which I hope are passed, and why I decided to chair the press conference &ldquo;Seven is too Young&rdquo; to demonstrate my support for the analysis that OPEN, the National Women&rsquo;s Council and Barnardos has offered on the Bill.  After all the public and political debate I am convinced the Bill as it stands, coupled with section 11 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011, will have the effect of erecting barriers against lone parents working.  It will not support their movement towards a greater quality of life for themselves and their children through well paid and meaningful work, which will increase the number of children who are poor.  The impact of these two pieces of legislation could be to legalise an increase in poverty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The relationship between welfare and work is crucial during a time of recession.  Our welfare system is complex, but one of its strengths is how it operates to allow people to take up part-time work and to retain a portion of their social welfare payments.  In this climate, well-paid jobs are difficult to find, as the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, knows.  A system that encourages people to take up any kind of work must be a good one.  The social welfare Bill the Minister wishes to pass and the legislation that was enacted prior to Christmas disincentivise lone parents from taking up work because the earnings disregard for their type of payment has been lowered and the stated conditions regarding the availability of child care to implement measures to reduce the youngest age of the child are not part of the Bill before the House.  They should form part of the law in some way in order that they can be honoured.  Are we to proceed to pass laws based on trust rather than certainty?  The combination of these two legal changes &mdash; the lowering of the age of the youngest child to seven years without adequate child care and the lowering of the earnings disregard to &euro;60 &mdash; moves us in the opposite direction as envisioned by the Minister.</P>
        <P>I will address the proposed change on lowering the age of the youngest child to seven years by 2014 regardless of when lone parents entered the payments system.  The one-parent family payment ceases after that age.  If the lone parent still requires social welfare assistance, she or he will move on to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which requires people to be available for work and to be unemployed for three out of every six days.  The earnings disregard in this respect has also been lowered.  A jobseeker can only work three days part-time.  If he or she happens to get a part-time cleaning job for two hours per day and five days per week, he or she will not be eligible for any support.  The law states that one must be unemployed.  Technically, a person forgos unemployed status if he or she does any work on any day.</P>
        <P>The Minister has indicated that the lowering of the age of the youngest child will only affect a small portion of the 92,000 lone parents in receipt of the payment.  I received calculations from her Department stating that reducing the maximum age from 14 years to seven years progressively during the period 2012 to 2014 would impact on 170 lone parents in 2012, 765 in 2013, 2,210 in 2014 and 4,510 in 2015.  I was not given the methodology for these calculations.  I am still wondering what it is.  The changes contained in the Bill will affect all new lone parents.  Although we do no know their numbers, the birth rate is increasing.  Undoubtedly, the number of people affected by the change will be significant.  For such a parent, he or she can only access the payment from 3 May if his or her youngest child is less than 12 years of age and from January 2013 if his or her youngest child is less than ten years of age.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has also stated that these changes will only go ahead if she gets a credible and bankable commitment from the Government on the delivery of a Scandinavian-type system of child care by the time of this year&rsquo;s budget.  The Minister and the Minister of State know we do not have such a system.  We failed families during the boom years when we had the resources to introduce such a system.  We no longer have those resources because we are in the age of austerity.  Given this reality, the Minister&rsquo;s promise to obtain a bankable commitment from the Government &mdash; the dictionary defines &ldquo;bankable&rdquo; as &ldquo;acceptable to a bank&rdquo; &mdash; is not adequate.  Are we to believe resources will be located within the next budget? From where will they come? Those who no longer qualify for the one-parent family payment will seek the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if they are fit for work. If a single parent claims that he or she is only looking for part-time work because of child care costs, it is likely he or she will be refused payment. Assurances that claimants will be treated sensitively are not good enough. </P><P Just="Left">We are deeply concerned about the changes introduced through the Social Welfare Act 2011, including the lowering of the earnings disregard in respect of the one-parent family payment. It is at &euro;130 this year and will continue to decrease to &euro;60 by January 2016. We wish to recall the rationale for the introduction of the payment in 1997. It gave recognition to the greater practical financial burden faced by lone parents when trying to access employment and raise children, namely, the cost of child care. A greater income disregard was afforded to one-parent families who engaged in employment, usually part-time, so that they might retain part of their social welfare payment. With the reduction of that disregard and an inadequate affordable child care system, single parents are disincentivised to take up part-time work, even if they want to, and are genuinely unavailable for full-time work. This change increases the chances of ongoing poverty. </P><P Just="Left">In a simple exercise, I compared a couple in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance with a person in receipt of the one-parent family payment where both households took up part-time work for &euro;160 per week. Each family had a three year old child. In 2016, the one-parent household will have &euro;18 more income than the two-parent household. This money is spent on child care, amounting to &euro;60 to &euro;80 per week. If the single parent has two children, he or she will still only have &euro;18 more. Does this reform sit with the vision of the Minister? </P><P Just="Left">We are trying to submit an amendment to oppose the Bill&rsquo;s changes in respect of the mortgage interest supplement. We will argue that the relevant section should be deleted and that no proposals to limit the supplement further should be enacted until an overall package of supports is available to ensure the protection of borrowers who have the capacity to remain in their homes with appropriate targeted support. Without such supports, the proposed changes will undoubtedly have the effect of abolishing the mortgage interest supplement in everything but name. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry.  He is becoming a regular visitor and we are always glad to see him.  I am disappointed the Minister for Social Protection needed to leave, but she will return for Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>It would be great for social welfare purposes if no one ever got old or sick, was ever made redundant or was left to raise a family on his or her own.  Unfortunately, real life is not like that and we continue to need social welfare.  Every Senator agrees the Department of Social Protection has the greatest spend, at 40% of the overall Exchequer budget.  Therefore, due to the economic climate in which we find ourselves, cutbacks need to be made and savings need to be found within the Department.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s job to bring about these changes while imposing the least negative impact on people as possible.  I do not envy her her task.  Once cuts are made to social welfare, someone will always get hurt.</P>
        <P>The Minister has made a number of changes.  Some are small, but others will have a major impact on people.  One of the most contentious changes she is about to make is the amendment to the one-parent family payment to provide for the phased reduction in the age limit applied in respect of the youngest child in the family.  I have raised this matter with the Minister several times.  I see where she is coming from and I know her intentions are honourable.  I appreciate she is considering the issue of women&rsquo;s social progression.  I say &ldquo;women&rdquo; because it is predominantly women who are lone parents, even though more men are becoming lone parents.  Like many Senators, I have been approached by women who are finishing their terms on the one-parent family payment.  They really are lost.  They do not know where to turn, what income they will have or what they will do for the rest of their lives.</P>
        <P>The Minister is introducing these changes because the best route out of poverty and reliance on social welfare is through paid employment.  We need to eliminate child poverty in particular.  The Minister wants to prepare single parents to return to the workforce.  That time will come regardless.  Currently, it comes when a parent&rsquo;s child is 18 or 22 years of age, whichever the case may be.  It will now arrive a little earlier in the parent&rsquo;s life.</P>
        <P>To date, there has been no obligation on people to engage in or seek employment or to seek education or training.  Consequently, people who have been in receipt of the one-parent family payment have not had a good outcome.  However, we must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water.  While we are conscious of providing for the person who has left the payment and is returning to the work environment, we do not want to leave parents at the other end of the spectrum feeling vulnerable.  By dropping the age to seven years, we are making people vulnerable.  At that age, one cannot leave a child on his or her own after school or to get himself or herself off to school in the morning unless &mdash; this has been and will be stated in the Chamber time and again &mdash; the State puts in place proper, safe, affordable and accessible child care.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision not to reduce the age limit unless such facilities are in place.  I know that she is working on the issue with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is dedicated to providing child care services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I come from a rural area and, as such, wish to raise the issue of child care services in these areas with the Minister.  In the main, child care services are provided in urban areas.  While some rural schools have fantastic preschools, play schools and so on, not many of them provide after-school facilities.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  It would be impossible for a parent working in an urban area which could be miles from the school his or her child is attending &mdash; I sent my children to a rural school which was many miles from where I was working &mdash; to leave work to collect the child from school and take him or her to a child care facility and return to work.  The Government must, therefore, address the issue of rural child care services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Parents who are recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and so on must be available for work.  This requirement should not be applied as stringently to lone parents.  I have discussed this issue with the Minister.  Unless proper child care services are in place, in particular after-school services, in rural areas, the reduction in the age limit to seven years will not work.  The Kerry Diocesan Youth Service provides a fantastic service for parents in Tralee.  Children are picked up from school, taken to their centre and provided with assistance in doing homework which is followed by activities.  Funding will have to be provided to develop services such as these.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the Minister is looking at the relevant age limit applying to one-parent family schemes in other countries.  However, we must treat like with like.  Child care services are far more readily available in other countries.</P>
        <P>I have spoken on several occasions to the Minister about the one-parent family payment and how hard life is for such families.  I know that she is working towards providing a model which will make it easier for lone parents to work while providing for their children.  It is almost impossible for them to juggle working and rearing a family outside school hours.  It is welcome that the one-parent family payment in respect of children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will remain in place until the youngest child reaches 16 years of age, at which time he or she can in his or her own right claim disability allowance.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on being the first to tackle fraud in a vibrant manner.  I commend her for giving social welfare inspectors more powers to combat social welfare fraud and abuse at ports and airports and make inquiries of landlords.  Many might question the reason we are giving inspectors powers to make inquiries of landlords, but I am aware of people who are claiming rent allowance which never makes its way to the landlord.  Some people who have left the country are still in receipt of the allowance because there is no link-up with CWOs.</P>

	<P>Yes.  Previously, that was the case.  I do not know the reason it was changed.  Perhaps we should revert to the old system which would, at least, ensure rent was paid and a roof kept over a person&rsquo;s head.</P>
        <P>It is also welcome that the Minister is extending the list of social welfare payments excluded from the general disqualification for receipt of a weekly social welfare payment where a person is participating in a community employment scheme and providing for a risk requirement which will help to protect pension scheme members&rsquo; benefits against future volatility in the markets.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry Leyden spoke about the social services card.  While I agree with him that we must accelerate its introduction, I remind him that we are still waiting for the driving licence card promised 15 years ago by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is to be hoped it will not take as long to introduce the social services card.</P>
        <P>The provision in respect of mortgage interest supplement will make life hard for many.  While negotiating with the banks might be okay for some, for others it is tough.  Some people do not have good negotiating skills and find doing this hard.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry.  While, like others, I would like to have the ear of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, I am glad the Minister of State is present.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reforms, in particular the new methods of tackling fraud.  There is a need for a frank discussion on the amount of money we are spending on social welfare payments.  The Government is borrowing &euro;127 million every month to top up the funding required for social welfare payments.  It is estimated that to make these payments &euro;3.32 billion was borrowed in 2010 and 2011 and that a further &euro;1.3 billion will be borrowed this year.  There is, therefore, a need for a debate on the seriousness of this issue.</P>
        <P>I have looked at what other countries are doing.  The Minister of State and I share a background in the retail sector.  During a trip to S&acirc;o Paulo in Brazil I visited a beautiful supermarket which was the biggest I had ever seen.  When I commented to the owner that I was surprised by the number of men shopping there &mdash; it was an up-market supermarket &mdash; he told me they were chauffeurs who were shopping for their bosses.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>We learn from what others are doing.</P>
        <P>I find it interesting that the fifth review by the IMF states the social welfare system generates poverty traps for some groups and provides less targeted supports for others, an issue that has been much talked about this morning.  Potential reform options include moving towards a means-tested and integrated system of social welfare payments.  I am not sure, however, that is what we are doing and wonder how much of this message the Minister is taking on board and how she is overcoming the obstacles in the way of a means-tested system.</P>
        <P>There was an idea from Senator Noone, which we heard again today, detailing the issuing of a social welfare payment by means of a debit card which would only be usable in Ireland.  That would also include setting a fixed amount that can be withdrawn in a given week by using that card.  To add to this, I believe some other European countries have a card that can be used to withdraw cash from ATMs and Dutch banks only.  Although not completely ideal, this may be a straightforward solution to reducing fraud.  They use the system in Holland.</P>
        <P>In the United States, food stamps cannot be used to purchase alcohol or tobacco.  We pay child benefit in this country, but there is no control over how the money is spent.  We are aware that some people, on the day the child benefit is paid, commit abuses of the system.  The United States uses the food stamps system to implement control, so should we have more of a say on where social welfare payments are spent?  This also links to fighting childhood obesity which is costing the State millions of euro and which cost is rising every year.  There is much debate about it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on countries like the Netherlands, where social welfare is calculated on the applicant&rsquo;s average salary in the last tax year and how long the unemployed person has been working?  The issue of whether people should have to work after a particular length of time on social welfare should be raised again.  Many people say they would prefer to be doing something to help their community rather than just stay at home doing nothing.  In some European countries, following receipt of social welfare for 12 months, a person is required by the Government to take up a job.  That might be painting a local school or cleaning the floors of a local hospital, and it would be done in exchange for social welfare payments.  Many people would prefer to do this rather than be at home doing nothing, but is the issue taboo?  Could we have a mature discussion on it, as it is a worthy topic?</P>
        <P>In the United Kingdom, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition Government introduced a work programme based on social welfare reform similar to that introduced by President Clinton in the United States.  There is a payment for results and a contract with the private sector.  More than 500 businesses and voluntary organisations in Britain have signed up to get people back to work who have claimed unemployment for up to a year.  These contractors are only paid when the worker has held down the job for a certain period.  Mr. Chris Grayling, MP, is the UK Minister of State at the Department of Work and Pensions, and he has argued that this will transform the lives of millions of people as well as representing good value for the taxpayer because payments to contractors are dependent on results.  Much of the money is awarded to providers only when the jobseeker is placed in sustainable employment.  Mr.Grayling has indicated a Birmingham programme placed its 1,000th person in a job at the end of last year.  That is just one of the steps taken.</P>
        <P>In one centre set up in the UK and run by a private contractor, there has been an attempt to replicate workplaces.  Local firms can set up a shop in employment centres to test employees, which could be very useful.  Trade skills like plumbing and basic contracting skills are taught.  In classrooms, the jobseekers &mdash; known as clients, which I like &mdash; learn how to use the Internet and personal networks to find jobs.</P>
        <P>I will touch on another aspect for combating social welfare fraud with an interesting example from the Netherlands.  Local authorities have begun using social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn to hunt social welfare cheats in the first anti-fraud campaign of its kind in the world.  We cannot just look at ideas from other countries and adopt them but we can learn from them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>They are good ideas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme in the Netherlands is being operated on a trial basis by ten local authorities, including Amsterdam and the Hague.  The aim is to stamp out fraudulent claims which in 2010 cost the Government there approximately &euro;120 million.  The councils are working with a specialist Amsterdam research firm, using the type of computer software previously deployed only in counter-terrorism.  They monitor Internet traffic for key words and cross-reference those words with computerised lists of social welfare recipients.  The giveaway terms are &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; and &ldquo;new car&rdquo; and if the software matches those terms and somebody claiming social welfare, the information is passed to investigators who gather substantive real evidence.</P>
        <P>Money is being wasted because of social welfare fraud, although people do not want to talk about it or argue that it is a minor amount compared with other issues.  It is substantial and steps could be taken to fight it.  The Dutch system would point the authorities in the correct direction and ensure detection resources were used as effectively as possible.  If people ask whether we can afford such a system, I would ask if we can afford not to do it.  I would be interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s thoughts on it.</P>
        <P>The measures in this Bill may be perceived as harsh, and some of them are, but we must take a long-term view and learn from tried and tested examples of how to get people off social welfare.  In general, the majority of those on social welfare would prefer to be working and I am sure the numbers of those who do not want to work and have no intention of doing so is minor.  We should encourage people back to work.  It has been interesting to listen to today&rsquo;s debate and hear that we tend to train people to be employees.  As Senator Healy Eames noted, we should be encouraging entrepreneurs and people to become employers.  In doing so, we can attempt to get people off social welfare by creating more jobs.  I welcome this debate and the steps being taken, which are in the right direction.  We should continue that work.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and compliment the Minister, Deputy Burton, on a very fine job in a difficult time for the country.  Deputy Burton is a reforming Minister and I know she is very determined to reform many aspects of the social welfare system and protect the most vulnerable in our society.  She is managing significant spending in her Department of more than &euro;20 billion per annum.  Not only did this Government inherit a bankrupt country a little over 12 months ago but we also inherited a scenario where the previous two elections were cynically bought using the social welfare budget to attract electoral support.  We all remember the famous &euro;1,000 early childhood payment which had to be discontinued pretty quickly because it was not sustainable.</P>
        <P>To the credit of the Minister, she has protected the basic rates of social welfare and pensions and is determined to target resources where they are most needed.  Like other speakers I very much welcome the attempt to tackle social welfare fraud, which is a major challenge.  There is anecdotal evidence of significant social welfare abuses in some areas, and the efforts to tackle claims by people outside the country though additional social welfare inspectors at ports and airports is to be welcomed.  The Minister&rsquo;s decision to appoint additional inspectors to examine rent supplement abuses is also to be welcomed.  I have reason to believe there are abuses in this area, with some people unfortunately finding themselves in very poor accommodation because they are afraid to highlight problems in case they lose their rent supplement.</P>
        <P>Our scarce resources must be protected for the most vulnerable in our society, as well as the new poor.  There are very many people dependent on social welfare who never claimed for anything before in their lives.  For these people it is their first time to sign on and they are in a difficult position.  They are anxious that social welfare is only a temporary arrangement.  The Government needs to examine the black economy.  Many people on social welfare are also self-employed and put legitimate businesses under severe pressure because they can undercut legitimate operators.  They are claiming social welfare and carrying on a cash business on the side.  The Government must tackle this.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister for Social Protection and the Government make it easier to transition from social welfare to work and from work to social welfare.  There is no incentive for people to take up part-time or seasonal employment.  I met a contractor at a briefing across the road by the Professional Agricultural Contractors Association of Ireland.  He told me he had 20 short-term jobs for a major contract that he could not fill.  People would not take up the jobs because, if they did, they would lose their medical cards and other social welfare benefits.  We must make it easier for people to make the transition to part-time work.  If someone takes up short-term work, it takes far too long to receive benefits.  Given the IT systems in the Department, people should be able to sign off and sign on quickly.</P>
        <P>There has been much debate about one-parent family benefits and the proposal to reduce the age limit to seven years over a period.  I agree with Senator Quinn that we should look at this in a different way so that it is means tested.  The structure of the payment is a disincentive to stable relationships and marriage.  Many children would benefit from more stable relationships if this payment was structured in a way that did not provide a disincentive to people entering long-term, stable relationships.</P>
        <P>The recent report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education highlighted reservations about the Department&rsquo;s proposal.  With some adjustments, it would be a move in the right direction.  Someone in receipt of a disability payment will lose the payment when he or she takes part in a community employment scheme.  People with disabilities should be able to keep a small portion of the payment because of additional costs in travelling to work as a result of the disability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I stress the importance of continuing community employment schemes.  They are doing valuable work in our communities and provide people with an opportunity to play a part in communities.  They are involved in tidy towns, sporting organisations, social services and care of the elderly.  Resources must be provided for these schemes.</P>
        <P>Members of the Lower House referred to the exceptional needs payments.  There are abuses in that area and we must examine it.</P>

	<P>Other speakers referred to a culture of entitlement and dependency.  We need to change that, which will only be done by investing in education and providing opportunities for these people to return to the workplace.  We must invest in proper child care and make it easier to transition from unemployment to work.  Our social welfare system is reasonably generous and is designed to support the most vulnerable but it also has design flaws that are not easily fixed.  Significant amounts of money are going into households yet the children can be described as deprived and neglected.  Factors include poor parenting, bad money management and drink and addiction problems.  These areas must be addressed.  Like Senator Quinn, I raised the issue of part payment through clothing and food vouchers at a recent Oireachtas committee meeting and I was lambasted by Social Justice Ireland.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Fianna F&aacute;il is opposing this Bill for several reasons.  Senator Leyden touched on some of them and Senator Mooney will deal with others.</P>
        <P>I will deal specifically with section 4 and its impact on lone parents.  The section is particularly ill thought out and unjust.  Senator Zappone highlighted the following point in her eloquent contribution.  In the absence of both employment opportunities and adequate child care, this measure will force lone parents onto a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  Senator Zappone gave a good example of the lower earnings disregards and the fact that eligibility for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit depends on the number of days, rather than hours, worked.  A cleaner on low income who decides to work two hours over four days will not receive a payment whereas someone working full-time over two days will receive payment.  This policy has not been thought out and, rather than helping, it will make lone parents more dependent on the State and increase poverty among an already vulnerable group.  Whatever about short-term savings the Government claims it will make, there is a risk it will cost more by making people who are working, bringing in a private income and moving towards an independent lifestyle more dependent on the State in the long term.  I am dubious about the claim about short-term savings because most people will move from one payment to another.</P>
        <P>From an activation point of view, the one-parent family payment has had considerable success.  Most lone parents work outside the home which is good for them and their families.  The system needs reform even though it has worked in some respects.  For that reason, the last Government undertook a major exercise of examining best practice in other countries, taking suggestions from various groups and setting up a better system to examine income thresholds, the disincentive to work that exists for some people and the cohabitation restriction.  We must find a sensible way of doing that, which touches on Senator Mullins&rsquo;s point about helping people to set up new families and new relationships.  The current system penalises people and we must find a sensible way of addressing it.  Rather than treating lone parents the same as everyone else and dumping them onto the dole, we need a more nuanced and sensible approach.</P>
        <P>There are many good suggestions on what can be done.  If the Minister and her colleagues had the decency and common sense to consult groups such as OPEN, Barnados, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland or One Family, she would have found a source of positive and constructive proposals.  I understand that not did not happen before the budget and the change was landed on them.  At national and local level, the groups are far from being in favour of passive income support.  When looking to reform the payments, there was general agreement that 22 years was too old.  A few years ago, someone did not have to work until the child was 22 years of age.  There was concern among all groups that the parents could be too distant from the labour market in the long term.  There was cognisance of the need to deal with cohabitation restrictions and to find better ways to support people in forming stable family relationships.  A recurring concern is the lack of training and education programmes, particularly during school hours, to give people a real opportunity to upskill and find work.  The last Government, having done all of that work and worked with lone parent groups, specifically chose 12 years in recognition of the child care challenges encountered.  Reform was in train; the late S&eacute;amus Brennan had put reform plans in place, but instead of continuing with these, the Government has decided to completely derail them.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Social Protection has stressed the Government&rsquo;s desire to move people from long-term welfare dependency and passive support.  The lone parent payment is the least passive of all.  There are incentives to work which most parents take up.  For those who do not work, it is disingenuous to blame this on passivity when we are all aware that there are obstacles in terms of job flexibility and finding employment that will allow them to work the hours that suit the school day and avail of affordable child care services.  Those on a low income might find it would cost more to have a child cared for after school than they could earn.</P>
        <P>The Minister gave a commitment in the D&aacute;il that the reduction in the age limit to seven years would not proceed unless a child care service was available.  I wish I could believe Ireland will go from where we are in respect of child care provision to the Scandinavian model.  If the Minister can do this, I will be the first person to congratulate her.  I fully support that strategy, but she must understand the reasons people are sceptical about this and how, far from providing them with the certainty they need to know they can move towards an independent lifestyle, making crazy commitments that no one is sure we can meet increases fear and uncertainty for the families that need our support.</P>
        <P>This policy is based on a negative and inaccurate view of lone parents.  It is based on language the Minister has used such as &ldquo;passivity&rdquo; and &ldquo;welfare dependency&rdquo;, and victimisation of a group, the members of which are already working and doing their best to be active.  It is based on an irrational understanding of how the system works because a person is being moved from a payment that incentivises the taking up of work to a payment which offers no such incentive.  It creates a long-term welfare trap that will act against all the positive work that has been done in the last few years in this area.  I, therefore, urge the Minister to stop this now, consult and listen to the advocacy groups to come up with workable proposals and come back in a few months time.  We can all work together on this issue and if the Minister&rsquo;s goal is to give people a leg up, she would find the groups involved have sensible proposals to make.  We should not ignore the good work done and take a leap into the dark that will result in more children being pushed into poverty.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is a pleasure for me to speak after the eloquent and expert spokesperson on social welfare, Senator Marie Maloney.  I will address a couple of the points raised during the debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Social Protection highlighted the importance of the spend on social protection.  Some 40% of all current Government spending, &euro;20 billion, goes on social protection payments.  The other point the Minister has made is that the spend is not only an outflow from the Government but also acts as a driver of growth and a stimulus in the economy.  She should be recognised as a reforming Minister who brings a progressive impetus to the Department of Social Protection.  She does not lose sight of the need for social protection to protect the neediest in society but also for social protection spending to be seen as part of a stimulus.</P>
        <P>I take issue with much of what Senator Averil Power said.  She has misrepresented the reforms the Minister is seeking to introduce.  Other speakers have pointed out that the vast majority of those in receipt of lone-parent allowance are women.  As a feminist, like the Minister, we must ensure the outcomes for those in receipt of the allowance are not discriminatory but effective.  The Minister has put it clearly that the outcomes of the spend on lone-parent allowance remain poor because lone parents and their families are at a disproportionate risk of poverty.  We must address this issue.</P>
        <P>I also take issue with Senator Averil Power&rsquo;s suggestion that lone parents are being denigrated or described as passive recipients.  Far from it; we must all pay enormous tribute to them in facing the difficulties they encounter in raising children without a partner.  Senator Fidelma Healy-Eames has mentioned that her husband sometimes feels like a lone parent with a partner involved in politics, but the reality is lone parents do a great job and need and deserve our support and praise.</P>
        <P>The Minister is looking at how best to reform the payment of lone-parent allowance to achieve better outcomes for loan parents and ensure they are not discriminated against in terms of access to education or employment, the best route out of poverty.  The reforms are in line with changes made elsewhere where we see a better system of supports for lone parents.  In the Netherlands there is a work obligation on lone parents when the youngest child reaches five years of age, while in Scandinavian countries the age limit is even younger, at three or four years of age.  The Minister has recognised that in Ireland it is not feasible to move to a younger age, unless adequate supports are made available.  That commitment is critical.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has given a commitment to progressively reform the system to ensure better outcomes for lone parents and their families and that she will not bring forward the key reform in respect of the reduction in the age limit, unless the necessary supports are provided.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">We all say access to safe, affordable and accessible child care is critical.  The Irish model of child care has been traditionally based on a private, for-profit industry model, but we can change this and there is a commitment at Government level, not just from the Minister for Social Protection but also the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to make that change.</P>
        <P>The Minister has outlined the significant changes made at second and third levels in the past.  To be fair, the early childhood care and education scheme marks an important change.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The transition is critical.  I have met groups such as SPARK and One Family which support in principle the idea behind a progressive change to lone-parent allowance and the idea that the State should not intrude into the relationship between parents or base payments for children on the status of their parents&rsquo; relationships but on whether a child is at risk of poverty and needs the money.  The critical points the groups made and which I support concerned access to preschool and after-school child care services.  They also made the important point that there was a need to ensure adequate transitional supports would be provided.  Other Senators have pointed out that 47% of single parents are working and that lone-parent allowance lets them to continue doing so.  It is critical in the transition to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance single parents who are working and in receipt of lone-parent allowance retain that right.</P>
        <P>There has been a general welcome for the additional measures included in the Bill to tackle fraud and abuse.  There is also a welcome for some of the changes to pension schemes such as introducing a buffer for defined benefit schemes and to ensure greater sustainability of pension schemes.  The sustainability of pension schemes is one of the ticking time bombs of which we are all conscious.  I am very encouraged by the changes to ensure the economy is made more attractive for investment by pension funds.  We would all want to see this happen.  I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his attention.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I acknowledge the helpfulness and professionalism of civil servants in the Department of Social Protection in the lead-up to this debate.  I rise to speak with an extremely heavy heart and a sense of foreboding.  Together with my colleague, Senator Zappone, I will be trying to persuade the Minister and Minister of State that section 4 should be reconsidered and should not be part of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know the motion for earlier signature is tabled for Monday.  As there is no motion to recall the D&aacute;il, I wonder why I rise to make this point.  Is this scrutiny at its best, when we do not have an opportunity to change the legislation?  I regret that there is no intention to change the legislation.</P>
        <P>I want to flag my concerns on the State contributory pension.  I recognise it is only one element in this Bill, but I have received conflicting information about the effect of the increased number of voluntary PRSI contributions voluntary contributors must pay to be entitled to a full contributory State pension.  I will be looking for additional information and clarification so that we can iron this out on Committee Stage.  There needs to be a more proactive approach on the part of the Minister to provide public information about these changes.  There is confusion among older people.  It would be useful to clarify matters during this debate.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on the one-parent family payment.  I have made it clear since the publication of the Bill and the announcement in the Budget Statement that I will oppose section 4.  I recognise the acknowledgement by the Minister that lone parents should not lose the one-parent payment when the youngest child reaches seven years unless a comprehensive system of Scandinavian style child care is in place.  For far too many years our concept of child care provision looked at the status of the parent and was focused on getting mothers into the workplace.  The introduction of the free preschool year changed the focus, because it is about providing care for children regardless of the status of the parent and the financial circumstances of the family.  This means child care is provided equally to all children, which is a good way to start.  The proposal in the Bill will be a return to the old style of child care provision.  I cannot believe we are debating a measure that is so regressive, counter-productive and detrimental to the well-being of children of lone parents.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, noted yesterday&rsquo;s ESRI report.  I will read the first line of Paul Cullen&rsquo;s article in <i>The Irish Times </i>today: &ldquo;Children are bearing the brunt of the recession, with close to a third affected by some form of deprivation, according to a new report.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In the lead-in to this debate, I have been appalled by some of the arguments on lone parents, especially that people choose to be lone parents.  At the end of 2011, 90,000 people were in receipt of the one-parent family payment.  More than 90,000 people, the majority women, did not choose to belong to a family unit group most at risk of poverty in society.  The contention is not only deeply insulting to those who have become lone parents, having left dysfunctional and unhealthy relationships or who have been deserted by their partners or who have been bereaved, it is also dangerous because it feeds into a notion that lone parents are a legitimate or worthy target of welfare cuts.  It incorrectly focuses the debate on the adult, when it is the impact on the estimated 149,000 children of lone parents that is of critical concern.</P>
        <P>Charles Dickens said:</P>
        <P LI="1">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This expresses how I feel this week.  We have had a really excellent week for the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.  The ending of the detention of children in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution will start next Tuesday.  The heads of a Bill have been produced on Children First, and there is legislation on the withholding of information on crimes against children.  We have made great strides and the rhetoric of the past has been overturned.  Despite this, we are looking at an amendment to the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill that has the potential to deny children their most basic needs, including food, clothing and shelter.  One-parent families are the unit group in society that are most at risk of poverty.  Children in such families are poorer than other children.  This is not speculation; it is a fact.  We have been told this repeatedly by the OECD, the CSO, the ESRI and several NGOs working directly with children.</P>
        <P>When I spoke last December opposing the cuts in child benefit, I spoke at length about the cumulative impact of successive cuts in successive budgets on vulnerable families.  I stressed that any hardship felt within a family is most acutely felt by children.  The concerns I raised then were not new, they were the concerns that were repeatedly raised in the context of budgetary measures, not only domestically but also by international observers.  The United Nations independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Ms Magdalena Sep&uacute;lveda, visited Ireland in January 2011 and in the course of her statement said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Children continue to be the group most at risk of poverty in Ireland, with families &mdash; in particular single parent families &mdash; struggling to ensure food, appropriate housing, heating and decent winter clothing.  The substantial cuts in child payments in recent budgets are of particular concern as they can exacerbate the situation of children and lead to an increase in child poverty rates, which are already worryingly high.  This would represent a major step backward for children&rsquo;s rights in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I find it really difficult to reconcile these policy decisions.  Why not remove section 4 and bring it back when we are ready to put in place the supports outlined by the Minister?  We all want better outcomes for lone parents.  Why such haste?</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the detailed contribution on the Bill.  There has been a significant increase in the demands on the social welfare system.  People drawing social welfare do not have a choice because of the changes in the employment market.  In 2010, &euro;20.8 billion was paid out in social welfare when the yield from income tax was slightly over &euro;11 billion.  Last year, the yield from income tax was only &euro;13.317 billion whereas the health budget was &euro;13.4 billion and the social welfare budget was over &euro;20 billion.  The spending on these two Departments was over &euro;33 billion, in contrast to the yield from income tax of less than 40% of that figure.  The Government faces a major challenge to try to maintain services and benefits for those who need them.  It must ensure the element of fraud is tackled.</P>
        <P>People have come to my constituency office in recent weeks to ask questions about decreases in their social welfare payments.  One person who came to me was getting &euro;310 in social welfare payments between himself and his wife.  His wife is now getting a weekly income of &euro;110 for eight hours of work.  As a result, his social welfare payment has been reduced by &euro;140, rather than by &euro;110.  It does not make sense to me that there should be such a disincentive to going out to get work.  We need to look at this issue.</P>
        <P>I was contacted yesterday by someone who has an opportunity to get four months work.  They are afraid that if they take the work they have been offered, they will lose many of the benefits they are currently getting.  The person in question found it hard to get those benefits in the first instance and had to jump quite a number of obstacles to get them.  They are afraid that if they take the four months work over the summer months, they will have to go through the same loops again to get the benefits back.  We need to examine such issues.</P>
        <P>Many people who want to work and know they can get work are afraid they will be penalised for making that effort.  We need to change the system to facilitate them.  I understand that the Minister or one of the officials in the Department suggested that people could use text messages as a means of informing the Department, for example, that they are working this week and do not intend to draw their benefits, but will do so next week.  We need to develop such a system.</P>
        <P>The issues I have mentioned should be examined in order to ensure that the many people who want to work can get back working.  The system is not accommodating such people at the moment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire, an Teachta Burton, as ucht an obair at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh aici d&uacute;inn.  I commend the Minister for her efforts to reduce and tackle social welfare fraud.  I only have a few minutes.  She is already considering giving additional powers to inspectors at airports and ports.  That is also to be commended.  I am aware of social welfare recipients who anxiously wait for the hour when they can collect their due entitlements.  Long may that be considered.  I understand that many other people can afford to wait for three or four weeks before collecting their payments.  I am suspicious of those who can wait for a month before they receive their social welfare payments.  We should examine their means of support.  I was brought up in a one-parent family as the eldest of four children.  The lone parent was my father who worked away from home six days a week.  I was responsible for looking after my siblings every day except Sunday.  I assure the House that there were no lone-parent's payments, or any other parental payments, in those days.  I am not saying that I would like a return to those days.  We have come a long way.  I applaud the Minister again for her efforts in overcoming social welfare fraud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Burton, for her level of financial expertise, which has not been seen in the Department of Social Protection previously.  She is combining the work she did as her party&rsquo;s very effective finance spokesman with her new area of responsibility.  I will not intrude into the timeframe to which we wish to adhere.</P>
        <P>We need to consider the integration of the tax and welfare systems, as proposed by Milton Friedman many years ago when he advocated a negative income tax.  Too much means testing is taking place.  We are producing the poverty traps about which several Senators have spoken.  If we are going to be radical, as we should in a country that had to be bailed out by the IMF not that long ago, we should consider the integration of the tax and welfare systems.  Where it has been proposed, it has typically been resisted by the bureaucracies on the tax and expenditure sides.</P>
        <P>Each of our social welfare systems should reach the target group and that group only.  The payment of universal child benefit to the wealthiest people in the country, who are well outside any target group, has to be put on the agenda.  We should be cautious with the proposal to extend the medical card to the entire population.  What is the point in giving medical cards to millionaires at a time when the country is broke and other priorities need to be addressed?  Low administration costs are needed.  That is another reason to consider the integration of the tax and welfare systems.  We need measures that do not distort the choice between working and not working, or between phoning in sick and not doing do.  Non-demeaning benefits are essential because we should be trying to help people rather than turn them away.</P>
        <P>We have to question what we have done to make child care so expensive in a country that has an unemployment rate of 14.5%.  Did we gold-plate the child care industry during the Celtic tiger era?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>If there are women in the community who would like to mind other people&rsquo;s children in their homes and have the ability to do so, why does child care cost so much in Ireland?  I agree with the many Senators who have spoken about child care as an obstacle.</P>
        <P>We need a balance in job creation.  We hear a great deal about new high-end jobs.  That kind of job creation will not make any difference to the 14.5% of people who are unemployed.  We have given grant aid to companies that have subsequently found it necessary to import workers from outside this jurisdiction.  When the grant-awarding agencies speak about the creation of high-end jobs, I am reminded that the rate of unemployment among graduates is 5%.  The rate in the community in general is 14.5%.  Could we try to achieve a better balance between attracting jobs and looking after the interests of those who most badly need jobs?</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about defined benefit pension schemes.  In the 1950s, it was estimated that people worked for 53 years and retired for 11 years.  At a time when we are heading towards a participation rate of 70% in third level education, and given that approximately a third of those born this year are expected to reach their 100th birthday, more contributions into pension funds are required.  I am in favour of later retirements as well.  We have to look at the conduct of some of the defined benefit schemes.  The McCarthy report on the privatisation of State companies found that those companies had net liabilities of &euro;3.4 billion in 2009 and &euro;4.2 billion in 2008.  There have been far too many schemes of early retirement and added years, etc.  Some of the trustees of pension funds have to be questioned.  The previous Government had to take approximately a dozen of those pension schemes into public ownership because the trustees had been dispensing far too much largesse on early retirement schemes.  The whole idea underpinning such schemes, which were fashionable not that long ago, seems bizarre at a time when people are living for longer.  We have to prepare for that.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Burton, has made a good start.  I know she has annoyed some of my colleagues on the opposite side.  As part of the package they seek, there has to be some onus on those who leave the family unit to make a contribution afterwards.  The burden should not always fall on the taxpayer.  Do we have the numbers in this regard?  How good are we at securing attachments to the earnings of those &mdash; typically men &mdash; who depart the family home and renege on their responsibilities to their spouses and children?  They have to be part of the solution as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>N&iacute; chuirfidh m&eacute; aon mhoill ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  Ceapaim go bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht seo &aacute; bhr&uacute; tr&iacute;d i bhfad r&oacute;-thapaidh.  N&iacute;l ciall n&oacute; r&eacute;as&uacute;n leis an bealach ina bhfuil an sceideal le haghaidh an Bhille t&aacute;bhachtach seo &aacute; eagr&uacute;.  I note that the timing for the amendments to this Bill is absolutely ridiculous.  It is a disgraceful way to put through an important piece of legislation that will have a massive impact on people across the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Burton, mentioned a couple of the Government&rsquo;s aims, one of which is &ldquo;empowering and enabling people to participate in work&rdquo;.  She also said we &ldquo;have to ensure the neediest in society are protected&rdquo;.  I find it astounding that the Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party are targeting lone parents for such savage cuts.  This is disgraceful and I call on all Members not to support those sections of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Many in this Chamber are parents and I remind them that all parents are just &ldquo;one step away from being a lone parent&rdquo;, something everyone should take into consideration.  I did not come up with this phrase; it came from a lone parent in one of the organisations that lobbied against the changes proposed in the Bill.  I have great respect for Senator Healy Eames, but I found her contribution quite patronising towards lone parents when she spoke about the dependency mentality and suggested that lone parents need mentoring.  I know quite a lot of lone parents.  They work very hard for themselves and their children.  They are very industrious, clever and try their best to improve through education.  They make their money stretch as far as possible and would be fantastic at running most businesses.  They would probably do a great job as Ministers for Finance because they are so clever and frugal with the money they have.  To say they are in need of mentoring is incredibly patronising.</P>
        <P>The Senator drew a comparison between the situation of lone parents and her own.  She said that at times her husband appears like a lone parent at home.  However, there is a substantial difference.  He may be at home carrying out the parenting responsibilities, which is laudable, but there are two incomes going into that family, with a fairly handsome income coming from her job in the Seanad.  The major difference between her situation and that of lone parents is that lone parents have only one income and are very much dependent on the payments they get.  It is appalling that the Government would choose to target them in this Bill and I call on all Members not to support section 4.  We must take the elephant in the room &mdash; unemployment &mdash; into consideration.  We hear about how much is being spent by the Department of Social Protection.  I agree there is a huge amount being spent, but the main reason for that is we are spending so much on people who are unemployed.  This is because the Government has not made a major impact on unemployment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the changed tune of the Labour Party.  Less than two years ago, the Fianna F&aacute;&iacute;l Government dropped the cut-off age for lone-parent payments to 14 years and along with Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party objected to this move on the grounds that the necessary supports and services were not in place.  That has not changed.  I also note that at its recent conference, the Labour Party was called on to refrain from imposing any further cuts on benefits for lone-parent families that would create further barriers to accessing work and education opportunities.  Therefore, I cannot understand how Labour Party Members can come into the Chamber and support section 4 of this Bill.  They must oppose it.  I am not trying to play party politics on this; I am quite serious.  It is essential we rethink this.</P>
        <P>As Senator Power mentioned, there was very little consultation with the lone parent advocacy groups.  Frances Byrne, director of OPEN said:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is a huge fear among lone parents that the changes being proposed to stop the One Parent Family Payment when children reach the age of seven will make it increasingly difficult for parents to meet the costs of raising a family alone.  The majority of lone parents are already in work or want to work but the ongoing lack of supports such as reliable and affordable childcare and afterschool care present impossible challenges, as the government cannot address this by 2015.  Removing the One Parent Family Payment and moving parents to Job Seekers Allowance without addressing the absence of appropriate supports will inevitably push more families into poverty and welfare dependency.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Not only is this unfair to those lone parents, but it will also force many of them already working, paying taxes and contributing to the Government&rsquo;s coffers back onto social welfare payments full time.  It makes no sense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also have to put this into context with the other budgetary cuts that affect lone parents.  There has been a reduction in the income disregard, a reduction in the entitlement age, CE schemes are effectively closed to lone parents, university contributions were increased and grants were cut, back to school clothing and footwear allowance have been reduced by &euro;50, school transport contributions have increased, the household charge applies to lone parents who own homes, the fuel allowance has been reduced by six weeks, child care subvention rates to community cr&egrave;ches have been cut by 5%, the JobBridge programme is not open to lone parents, and single parents must now pay &euro;25 a week towards child care when participating in F&Aacute;S and similar courses, etc.  These all impact on lone parents and we cannot look at this move in isolation.  The Minister spoke about pathways to employment, but section 4 is a pathway to unemployment.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in intends to raise other measures in the Bill on Committee Stage.  The change with regard to calculating jobseeker&rsquo;s payments by moving from a six to a five-day week does not make sense and the examples given so far in this debate show that.  We should move to a situation where the number of hours per week somebody works should be taken into consideration.  We will also have some points to make with regard to the pensions scenario.</P>
        <P>I call on all Senators not to vote in favour of section 4 of this Bill.  It is unfair, inequitable and wrong.  It is not fair that the Government and the parties involved are focusing on lone parents with this punitive treatment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this social welfare legislation.  Such legislation appears annually and we sometimes have two social welfare Bills per annum and they give rise to interesting debates.  However, we debate social welfare and proposed changes in the aftermath of a budget or of the publication of a Bill and at that stage it is probably too late for any significant changes.  I hope the Minister will take on board the suggestion that each year, well in advance of the budget &mdash; perhaps in September or October &mdash; we should organise debates on social welfare where the anomalies can be addressed and where various interest groups can have their concerns dealt with here in the House rather than at various committee meetings.  A Department responsible for the spending of almost &euro;21 billion must engage as fully as possible not just with the stakeholders, but with the broader public on how that money can be best spent.  The social welfare budget is approximately 40% of the entire Government budget.  The major part of that spend is necessary, but we must consider how it can be better spent, how the schemes can be amended and what changes can be introduced.  That debate must be ongoing rather than taking place only once or twice per annum when we have these kinds of set piece occasions when the decisions are already made.  I hope the Minister will try to encourage greater and deeper debate on social welfare policy and spending throughout the year so that in advance of the budget the various political parties and lobby groups can get their proposals on the table.</P>
        <P>The &euro;20 billion plus being spent is necessary, but we must focus on how we can spend as much of that money as possible in supporting work and encouraging people to get back to work.  I and many colleagues have often made the point that all Departments, no matter which, must try to ensure their budget moneys are used to create employment.  Much of the money in the Department of Social Protection can be used to trigger, support and create employment.  Schemes such as back to education schemes and the family income supplement play a role in both the education and job creation areas and we should focus on those.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was not here for most of the debate this morning as I had other meetings, but I heard and watched some of the debate on the monitor.  Much of the discussion has focused on section 4 and the proposals relating to lone parents.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response on that.  I am sure, having watched some of the D&aacute;il debate, the Minister will remind us of what applies in other jurisdictions.  We do not stand alone isolated from the world.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">We must look at best practice and see how other countries are using similar schemes to support people from an income perspective.  Even more importantly, we must examine how they support people to ensure that their future is not just one of social welfare and social income but hopefully entails their return to the jobs market and to a more independent type of living.  My understanding is that most of our near neighbours have measures in place in respect of lone-parent payments that are much closer to what the Minister is proposing to do than what we currently have in place.  Her proposed changes would put us in the norm from a European perspective.  I concede, of course, that child care provision is much greater in most other countries, and we must move in that direction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister must get credit for her willingness to reflect on the Bill at the time of its publication and for then seeing that further amendment was required.  She has said that she will demand of the Government that additional supports be put in place for child care in the next budget.  I look forward to the progress on that.  When it is made, the changes the Minister hopes to introduce will be reasonable.  We must try to live in the land of fiscal and political reality.   I would wish dearly that the available funding was higher but the money is not there.  We have yet to design a money-growing tree and I do not think it will happen this year.  We have to make the most of what we have and use it as best we can.  Unemployment support and pension support is very necessary but if the focus of this debate is to be on the lone parent sections &mdash; it is a topic worthy of debate &mdash; we have to try to see beyond what we have been doing in the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
        <P>From a minimal financial perspective, we have been genuinely supportive of lone parents.  However, if our only aspiration for lone parents is to provide them with a sufficient living income and hope that they will remain politically silent, that is not good enough.  We have to aim higher, and part of that is to ensure that the majority of lone parents are given an opportunity by way of child care and alternative schemes to get back to work and to see a future beyond welfare in the workplace.  That debate is only beginning and it must be substantial.  We will come back to this on Committee Stage.  I look forward to what my colleagues have to say.  It is interesting and that is why I would like to have this debate in October or November in advance of the crisis, rather than as part of post-crisis talks.</P>
        <P>I support this Bill.  I support what the Minister is doing.  She is a thinking Minister who is willing to be flexible and who is trying to spend our limited resources in a constructive and proactive fashion.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Why is the Seanad always able to sit on a Friday when we are shafting people and when we are trying to attack the most vulnerable people in society?  Why can we not sit 24 hours a day, seven days a week to pass debt relief legislation for vulnerable people?  We cannot do so as the proposed legislation keeps getting postponed, yet the door is always open if we are to make cuts, no matter what Government is in power.  The doors will be open seven days a week if we are going to hurt people but if we make any improvements to people&rsquo;s lives, the Civil Service, the troika and the advisers on &euro;150,000 per year all tell us it cannot be done.  It can always be done on a Friday if it affects the poor and the vulnerable and the people who are least able to represent themselves in society.</P>
        <P>We have been told time after time that we are getting Scandinavian child care.  Perhaps that is where the Minister is this morning.  Is she in&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

	<P>Where is this in the troika agreement?  It is nowhere to be seen.  This is a deliberate policy choice of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party and it is coming into effect next Thursday.  Somebody who becomes a single parent after next Thursday is subject to the provisions of this Bill and will have not Scandinavian child care available.  Let us stop talking about Scandinavian child care and the undertakings that the Minister has given because they do not apply to anybody who becomes a single parent from next week.  The Minister is talking about a crisis next December.  There will be a crisis next week for many people in vulnerable positions.</P>
        <P>The change for people on mortgage interest supplement would have some merit if we were forcing the banks to do some of the heavy lifting but we are not forcing the banks to act.  We are sending vulnerable people to negotiate with them and then go back to a social welfare office to see if they have done enough to quality for mortgage interest supplement.  Again we are targeting the most vulnerable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The point is that they are forced to negotiate with the banks by themselves with no strong arm, no help and no legislation backing them up, with bank managers asking why they have Sky Sports instead of Sky Movies and why they are getting Kellogg&rsquo;s corn flakes instead of Aldi corn flakes.  These are the questions being asked in banks.</P>

	<P>Where is the Keane report?  We had a report in October 2010 and the Keane report last year.  We were assured all this was happening but it is now being ignored and are sending these people back to the banks following which they then have to satisfy a social welfare inspector that they negotiated some deal with the banks.</P>
        <P>These two provisions deserve a much more serious debate than that allowed in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  There is so much more to the Bill.  Private pensions are being dealt with but there is no time to talk about that issue.  It is a time-bomb for the future and it should be the subject of separate legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to the return of the Minister and to a good debate on Committee Stage but if the Government parties were in opposition they would be utterly opposed to this.  They must be opposed to it in their heart of hearts.  Nobody is forcing them to be in favour of it.  The Minister and her Cabinet colleagues are forcing their hand but it is about time they stood up and asked why we are so quick to hurt the poor and the most vulnerable in society.  Why do we not open the doors on a Sunday night to pass legislation on mortgage relief for people in debt?  I would be here for that but apparently it cannot be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to reiterate all that has been said on section 4, especially the comments made by Senator van Turnhout, particularly given her own professional background.  We should withdrawn section 4 until such time as the Minister&rsquo;s commitments come into force.  Otherwise, this is going to affect lone parents from next week.  That is putting it at its most simple.  When the next monitoring report of the troika comes out in a few months all of the indicators and commentary will be about the low-hanging fruit &mdash; that awful term &mdash; in terms of the taxes and reductions that the Government has imposed in order to bridge the deficit.  We are now entering into a much more serious period.  Therefore, it seems that the much vaunted commitment of the Minister to introduce adequate child care provisions in advance is not going to happen because the Government will be faced with a much more difficult situation after July than it has faced up to now.  Why then is the Minister of State pulling the wool over people&rsquo;s eyes by suggesting that these measures can be alleviated by bringing in proper child care?  I do not believe that is going to happen.</P>
        <P>Margaret Dromey, the CEO of Treoir, the national federation of services for unmarried parents and their children, has stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the absence of vital support services such as child care, training, flexible working hours being in place, this legislation will have a disastrous effect on many one parent families. It just won&rsquo;t work. The supports must be in place before the age limit is reduced to 7.</P>
        <P FLI="0">They are saying it, not us.  If the people at the coalface are saying it they should be listened to, even if the Minister does not want to listen to the political opposition.</P>
        <P>I also want to mention the proposals in section 7 with regard to cuts and disqualifications from payments under the community employment scheme.  Following a furore in the early part of this year about reductions and restrictions on CE services, the Minister promised that she would institute a review, which was to be finished by the end of March.  It is now nearly May and we still have not seen the review.  Could the Minister of State tell us when the review will be done?  In the meantime, will he ensure the uncertainty with regard to CE schemes across the country, but particularly in rural Ireland, is removed?  Even within the context of the massive reduction in the CE budget, could he at least provide some certainty?  That budget has been reduced from &euro;360 million to &euro;315 million this year.  In order to keep the schemes going as they are currently structured, money will have to be found elsewhere in the Department&rsquo;s budget.  This is a serious question about CE schemes that the Minister must answer.  This affects every Member of the House on all sides, from the Minister of State downwards.  The Minister of State will know that in rural Ireland, including in his own constituency &mdash; mine is Sligo-North Leitrim &mdash; the CE schemes are a vital component of the social fabric.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will be working hard to ensure the CE schemes are maintained in their present infrastructure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time equally with Senator Cullinane.  Since I am rather given to volubility, I ask the Acting Chairman to remind me when I am halfway through my allotted time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>First, there is a series of misnomers.  We talk about social welfare, but I do not see much welfare around this country.  Welfare means well-being, but there is a dearth of a sense of well-being among people.  The Minister for Social Protection has not protected people.  She has fought a battle &mdash; I give her that &mdash; and she gave an undertaking, but the undertaking has been overtaken by the passage of this Bill.  It makes nonsense of it, and that is the reason I will be voting against section 4.  I do not care if the vote takes place on Sunday night; I will come back from Laois, where I am talking about the closing of a hospital, specifically to vote on this Bill, as I came back from Tibet in order to vote in the abortion referendum.</P>
        <P>While I am at it, I must say it is a disgrace that there was no Order of Business today.  We should always have an Order of Business.  I wanted the opportunity to put on record the fact that it is outrageous that the Vatican attempted to silence Fr. Brian D&rsquo;Arcy.  It was also outrageous to silence Fr. Se&aacute;n Fagan.  That is another misnomer &mdash; Christianity.  Where is that gone?  He is a man who held out his hand to unfortunate women who had abortions and felt they were going to hell.  I want to take this opportunity, illegal though it may be, to utterly condemn that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the important thing is that it is put on the record.  It does not matter who says it.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance disregard is based on days worked and not worked, which is wrong, as there is a critical shortage of job opportunities.</P>
        <P>I am dealing with somebody who has just come back from America, where he was living as an illegal alien.  He has three children of his own with his partner, and has adopted his partner&rsquo;s child from a previous relationship.  The grilling he has been put through by social welfare officials is unbelievable.  They want proof that he was an illegal immigrant, and they want him to go to the American Embassy to obtain this.  The American Embassy will not do this.  He has given them his birth certificate, his airline receipts, his marriage certificate &mdash; the whole works.  He has given them every detail but there is an obstruction.  I hope and believe that all Members from every party, including both groups of Independents, are on the Department&rsquo;s tail, because deliberate obstruction of the payment of social welfare benefits is rampant throughout the country.  People are being held in queues and are not receiving the benefits they have applied for.  This man in particular is living on the charity of his brother, which is outrageous.</P>
        <P>I do not want to criticise people directly, but there was a man on the radio this morning who has eight children and wants a bigger house because he wants more children.  I do not agree with the idea that having children is some kind of human right.  When I did my leaving certificate there were 3 billion people on the planet; now there are 7 billion, and there will be 9 billion before I am in my box.  It is a sensitive issue.  There was a tragic case in which a young boy was seriously injured in an accident when his mother was driving the car.  She did not have insurance or a driving licence, and she caused the accident, but the boy was awarded &euro;11.5 million.  That is paid by the taxpayer.  The child must be looked after properly, and the hospitals must be paid, but I wonder.  Maybe this money is absolutely necessary to keep this child in a proper condition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A number of Senators have mentioned lone parents.  This category has certainly been targeted in the budget.  Let us consider some of the changes that have affected those in receipt of one-parent family payment: a reduction in the income disregard from &euro;146.50 to &euro;130, a reduction in the cut-off age of the youngest child to seven years, and the stopping of CE scheme payments.  They are also affected by changes such as the new household charge.  Lone parents need that money so they can look after their children.  It is disingenuous of the Minister to say she will examine the area of child care and at the same time provide in this Bill for a reduction in the age limit for one-parent family payment to seven.  If the Minister was so minded, she could have removed that provision.  Let us remember that the Labour Party opposed the move by Fianna F&aacute;il to reduce the eligibility limit from age 18 to age 14.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It was to be phased.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party opposed that at the time but now it is to reduce the age limit to seven years.  It is wrong.</P>
        <P>I refer the House to a number of submissions made by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  It is particularly concerned about a proposed new section of the Bill, section 8(12), which deals with mortgage interest supplement, and is seeking for this amendment to be removed.  It is also concerned about the section that deals with entitlements for social welfare recipients with regard to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  It has a concern about the effect of cuts in entitlements on people&rsquo;s ability to return to work.</P>
        <P>There is some mention of pensions in the Bill.  One of the things the Government should consider is what happened at Waterford Crystal, where hundreds of workers were left without any pension entitlements whatsoever because this and previous Governments failed to implement an EU directive that forces pension companies to take out a bond to protect workers so that if their pension schemes go belly-up, which many have done, or if a company closes and therefore does not have new workers paying into the scheme, workers are not left high and dry without any pension.  The aim of the directive was to ensure pension companies would take out insurance so that workers were guaranteed at least 60% of their pensions.  Why is the Government not implementing that directive?  Why do the former workers of Waterford Crystal need to take the Government to the Commercial Court to force it to do the right thing?  Something like this may happen again.  When it happened in Waterford Crystal, many workers were left high and dry.  It is high time the Government implemented the directive to safeguard the pension entitlements of working people so that what happened to the Waterford Crystal workers, which was disgraceful, does not happen to others.  The implementation of the directive is in the Government&rsquo;s hands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators who have contributed to this debate, especially those Senators who have given their support to many of the measures contained in it.  I have listened carefully since I came here two hours ago.  We are dealing with a huge budget of &euro;20 billion, but in challenging times it is hard to accommodate all needs.  I have listened carefully to what was said by those who spoke on the provisions contained in the Bill and other social protection issues.  I appreciate the depth of feeling and sincerity of those who have criticised the measures being proposed.  However, these measures are driven by budget 2012 and the need to reduce overall social welfare expenditure.  They are also driven by the need to make the social welfare system better by encouraging people to move closer to the world of work and away from long-term social welfare dependency.</P>
        <P>I will now respond to some of the points raised in the debate.  It is acknowledged that lone parents and their children experience higher rates of consistent poverty than the general population.  The rates of consistent poverty experienced by lone parents have remained at high levels, despite more than &euro;1 billion being spent annually on the one-parent family payment and other supports.  This also indicates that the long-term income support provided by the one-parent family payment without any requirement for the lone parent to engage in employment, education or training was not effective in addressing the poverty and social exclusion experienced by some of these families.</P>
        <P>Social welfare is a hand up, not a hand-out.  A key objective of the Government is the activation of people of working age in receipt of income support, including lone parents.  This is reflected in the development of the national employment and entitlement service with a move from passive income support to active engagement with social welfare customers of working age.  This involves the identification of customer needs and the provision of co-ordinated support to support them into education, training and employment.</P>
        <P>Reform of the one-parent family payment and the activation policy in relation to lone parents of working age pose challenges.  These challenges will require a whole of government response with regard to the provision of appropriate education, training and employment supports, as well as the provision of child care supports that all job-seeking parents will require, especially after-school care.</P>
        <P>When the youngest child of a lone parent reaches the age of seven years, if the parent is still in need of income support, he or she can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance which is paid at the same basic rate as the one-parent family payment and receive the activation support attached to that payment.  Lone parents will then be profiled and have their individual needs assessed.  This will facilitate the agreement of a progression plan with these customers, the development of their case management to assist them either to improve on existing skills or learn new ones and their gradual move towards entry into the labour force.  Before leaving the one-parent family payment a lone parent may also apply for the back to education allowance, back to work experience allowance or, if they are in employment for more than 19 hours a week, family income supplement.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s policy on lone parents is not out of step with the welfare approach of other countries.  The changes to the one-parent family payment bring Ireland&rsquo;s support for lone parents more into line with international provisions, where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.  In the United Kingdom lone parents are obliged to seek work when their youngest child reaches the age of seven years.  This applies in Northern Ireland where it is supported by Sinn F&eacute;in members of the Executive, although Sinn F&eacute;in Members of the Oireachtas lecture us on the matter.  In the United Kingdom there is a work obligation where the youngest child reaches the age of seven years and lone parents whose youngest child is aged 12 years or under have the right to restrict the hours they are available to work when claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  They are not expected to work outside the child&rsquo;s normal school hours.  If they are in employment, lone parents must be working 16 hours or more a week in order to claim a child care tax credit.  The maximum help available varies.  It is, for example, &pound;140 a week for one child in registered child care.  That is the situation in Northern Ireland which Sinn F&eacute;in supports and where it is part of the Executive.  It has one policy here and another in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fact that in Northern Ireland Sinn F&eacute;in supports this measure in the Executive.  In the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand there is a work obligation when the youngest child reaches the age of five years.  In Finland there is a work obligation when the youngest child reaches the age of four years.  In Germany, Italy, Sweden and Norway there is a work obligation when the youngest child reaches the age of three years.  It is recognised that different levels of non-income support, for example, child care, are available in these countries, but it is important to highlight this information and I am glad Senator DavidCullinane is present to hear it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is straight talking.</P>
        <P>I would like to clarify some elements of the voluntary contribution provisions.  The total number of participants is 3,000, while the number of new applicants during 2011 was 1,720.  Some 62% of voluntary contributors are male, while 38% are female.  The voluntary contribution schemes applies both to former self-employed and former employed persons &mdash; 25% are former employed contributors, while 75% are former self-employed contributors.  It is estimated that 100 cases annually will be affected by the change to be introduced in 2013, with a further 100 cases affected annually from 2014 onwards.  The changes in the requirements to become a voluntary contributor do not affect existing voluntary contributors who are availing of the scheme.  The people who avail of this option to become voluntary contributors include retired employees not in receipt of social welfare credits, persons working abroad no longer subject to Irish social insurance and self-employed contributors who have ceased self-employment or do not have a PRSI liability because they fail to meet the income threshold of &euro;5,000 to pay class S PRSI contributions.  There is a flat rate contribution for such voluntary contributors of &euro;253 per annum.  The principal purpose of the change to the scheme is to align with the change in the contributory State pension scheme which, from April, requires a minimum of 520 paid PRSI contributions for qualification purposes.  These changes will not affect those currently in receipt of contributory State pension.</P>
        <P>Senators referred to the need to control social welfare fraud which undermines public confidence in the entire system, as well as being unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments, businesses run on a legitimate basis and taxpayers.  The Government is very conscious of the need to protect public money and determined to ensure abuse of the system is prevented and dealt with effectively when detected.  A number of important fraud control measures are being provided for in the Bill.  While social welfare inspectors have a range of existing powers of inquiry, it does not include a specific power of inquiry at ports and airports.  New measures will allow them to make inquiries at ports and airports where they believe or are aware an offence has been or is being committed by individuals, that is, where they have a reasonable suspicion or evidence that an individual is entering the jurisdiction solely for the purpose of continuing to claim social welfare payments to which he or she is not entitled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the rent supplement scheme, there will be new measures to strengthen the powers of social welfare inspectors to make inquiries of landlords for rent supplement purposes.  While there are existing powers that allow for the general investigation of rent supplement claimants, they do not include a specific power of inquiry of a landlord of a premises where a rent supplement is being paid to ensure the supplement is being correctly paid.  This provision introduces new powers for social welfare inspectors and community welfare officers to make inquiries of landlords where a rent supplement is being paid.  There are almost 95,000 rent supplement recipients, with a provisional expenditure outturn of &euro;503 million in 2011.  The estimate for 2012 is &euro;437 million.    In the case of new claims for social welfare payments, the existing legislation is being amended to make it a condition that a claimant&rsquo;s identity be appropriately authenticated.  This provision allows for a photograph and electronic signature to be taken, retained and reproduced.  In the case of an application for and the allocation of a personal public service number and public services card, provision is being made to ensure a person&rsquo;s identity will be appropriately authenticated.  This provision also allows for a photograph and electronic signature to be taken, retained and reproduced.  As well as combating identity fraud, the public services card will, in time, replace the cards currently in use such as the social services card and the free travel card with a highly secure card.</P>
        <P>As regards jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, the proposed measure will not impact on a person whose sole income comes from social welfare; the headline rate of &euro;188 a week for a single person is unaffected if the person does not have additional income from employment for days worked.  It will only apply to those who have earned additional income from working some days during the week.  The effect of the measure will be to reduce the contribution from jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in the weekly amount of total income, welfare and wages combined, and work towards a reduction in reliance on the welfare system among those who avail of the mix of welfare and earned income.  It is proposed to base jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit on a five-day as opposed to a six-day week, as is currently the case.  This effectively means that all casual and part-time workers will have the same method of calculation of the payment as currently applies to short-time workers.  If the employer of a person who has normally worked full-time reduces the number of days worked on a permanent basis, the person concerned may receive jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the days he or she does not work.  For each day a person is unemployed, one sixth of the normal rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is currently payable.  For example, if a person works part time for two days, he or she can claim four sixths of the normal jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment.  As a result of the change provided for in the Bill, from July, for each day a person is unemployed, one fifth of the normal rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit will be payable.  For example, where a person works part time for two days, he or she will be able to claim three fifths of the normal jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment.  An estimated 18,000 in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit will be affected in a full year.  It is important to note that recipients of the benefit may opt for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance which is subject to a means test.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short-term income support for eligible persons who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments on a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayment only; the capital element of the repayment is not taken into account in calculating the amount of supplement payable.  Approximately 18,200 are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 360% since 2007.  Expenditure of &euro;50.8 million has been provided for in the year ending 31 December 2012.  Budget 2012 provides for the curtailment of access to mortgage interest supplement for the first 12 months where a person is involved in the mortgage arrears resolution process, as set out in the code of conduct in dealing with mortgage arrears applied to mortgage lenders.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 5, to delete lines 18 and 19 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) <i>Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7</i> (other than <i>subsection (1)), 8, 9</i> and <i>13</i> (other than <i>subsections (2)</i> and <i>(3)</i>) shall be deemed to have come into operation on 5 December 2011.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(3) <i>Subsection (1)</i> of <i>section 7</i> shall be deemed to have come into operation on 5 December 2011 in so far only as it relates to pay.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(4) <i>Subsections (2)</i> and <i>(3)</i> of <i>section 13</i> and <i>section 22</i> shall come into operation on the day immediately following the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 1 currently provides that, with the exception of the provisions relating to offences or the instigation of legal proceedings, the Bill will be deemed to have come into effect on 5 December 2011.  During the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, this provision, which gives retrospective cover from 5 December 2011, has been the source of discussion and a level of criticism.  I have, therefore, reconsidered the position in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and have come up with an amendment, the effect of which will be to limit the application of the retrospective cover, as it impacts on the basic working and employment conditions applied by the directive, to the element of pay only.  In the context of the other non-pay elements covered by the basic working and employment conditions set down in the directive &mdash; for example, working time rest breaks, access to collective facilities, access to job vacancies, etc. &mdash; I am advised that, in practice, enforcement of these on a retrospective basis would be almost impossible as they cannot be undone after the event.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 1 should go some way towards meeting the concerns previously expressed in respect of this provision.  Subsection (2) of the amendment applies the general provisions of the Bill on a retrospective basis, while subsection (4) provides that the offence provisions will not come into effect until the day following the passage of the legislation.  All of the other provisions will come into effect upon passage of the Bill into law.  I hope this measure, which balances the need for the Government to meet its obligations under the directive, will meet, to a greater extent than previously, the concerns expressed about this provision.  Acceptance of the amendment will ensure that agency workers will be entitled to equal pay from the transposition date of the directive and will have this entitlement backdated to 5 December 2011.  They will not, however, be able to claim entitlements from that date in respect of breaks, working time, collective facilities, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome both the Minister and the amendment.  A number of Senators expressed concern about the matter to which it relates on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  The changes proposed in the amendment in respect of pay and retrospection mean that many of those concerns have been allayed.  I appreciate that the Minister and his officials listened to what Senators had to say on this matter and that they managed to draw up something that is going to improve the Bill and make it acceptable.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 2, 19, 20 and 23 are related and may be discussed together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;&ldquo;Act of 1971&rdquo; means the Employment Agency Act 1971;&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 23 are technical in nature.  It is practice, in drafting legislation, that where there is a reference to another enactment on more than one occasion, a definition of that enactment is included in the interpretation schedule and the enactment is thereafter referred to by its shorter title.  This is the effect of amendments Nos. 2 and 23.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 19 replaces the current text of section 13(1) of the Bill.  It specifically provides for the prohibition &mdash; contained in the directive &mdash; on an employment agency charging a fee to an agency worker following the completion of his or her assignment with a hirer after which he of she is offered direct employment with the hirer.  Amendment No. 20 clarifies that the new provision inserted by amendment No. 19 is in addition to, not in substitution for, the separate and distinct prohibition contained in section 7(2) of the Employment Agency Act 1971.  The latter provides that it is unlawful for an employment agency to charge an individual a fee &mdash; commonly referred to as a &ldquo;placement fee&rdquo; &mdash; for facilitating the introduction of that individual to a third party who will hire him or her on a temporary assignment.  Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 clarify that fees cannot be charged at the beginning or the end of a placement where a person is being recruited on a permanent basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is essentially technical in nature and it will ensure that the legislation aligns properly with the EU directive.  Article 3.1(f) of the directive lists overtime as a constituent element that goes to make up basic working and employment conditions.  Although overtime is listed as a component element in the definition of pay provided in the Bill, it is not included in the definition of basic working and employment conditions.  In order for the legislation to be correctly aligned with the directive, overtime should also be included under that definition and that is the intention behind the amendment.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, to delete lines 8 and 9.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The matters to which these amendments relate were the subject of considerable debate on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  The amendments relate to section 7 of the Bill, as passed by the D&aacute;il.  The formulation adopted in section 7 allows reference to two distinct situations, that is, instances where there is a comparable employee against whom the agency worker can be compared and to instances where there is not such a comparable employee.  In the first instance, section 3 set out the criteria to be fulfilled and the type of considerations that could be taken into account in measuring the level of comparability between an agency worker and a comparable employee. In the latter context, where there is no comparable employee the Bill sets out that the entitlements for the agency worker would be those which would apply if a comparable worker were to be employed.  This construct was considered to accurately reflect the requirements of the directive.  It was also an attempt to provide greater clarity and guidance beyond that contained in the directive.</P>
        <P>During the debates on the legislation in both Houses, concerns were raised with regard to the inclusion of the notion relating to the comparable employee, particularly in light of the number of difficulties to which this was giving rise in practice.  In view of Members&rsquo; concerns, I have ensured that the relevant issues were reconsidered with a view to providing greater legal certainty and clarity in the Bill.  As a result, it is proposed to remove from the Bill the notion of using the comparable employee construction and, alternatively, essentially to defer to the wording contained in the directive.  This should meet the concerns which Senators raised on Second Stage and which were the subject of amendments tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I am satisfied that the revised outline of section 7 will still ensure that agency workers will be properly protected in the context of their entitlements under the directive.  It will also allow the Government to remain in compliance with the directive.  The proposed changes will require some revision of the existing provisions of the Bill.  This is the intended combined effect of amendments Nos. 4, 5, 8 and 18.  The respective intentions behind amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are to remove the definition of comparable employee from section 2 and to delete section 3 in its entirety.  In the event that both of these amendments are accepted, the aspects of the Bill to which I refer will be redundant.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 8 proposes to delete the existing section 7(1) and to replace it with a new formula for setting out the core entitlements of agency workers.  Essentially, the new section 7(1) will provide that agency workers will be entitled to the same basic working and employment conditions as those to which they would be entitled if employed directly to do the same or similar work.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 18 arises as a consequence of the removal of the reference to &ldquo;comparable employee&rdquo; in section 11, which deals with access to employment for agency workers.  The amendment simply removes the reference but does not otherwise change the requirements under the section.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senators who tabled amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 9 to 11, inclusive.  On the basis of what I have outlined, however, it will be clear to them that these amendments refer to an earlier version of what was contained in the Bill.  The amendments are, therefore, no longer relevant. On this basis, I ask the Senators to withdraw them. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 21 seem to remove the reference to &ldquo;comparable employees&rdquo;, as the Minister stated.  They provide that entitlements would exist only by reference to the work employees are undertaking.  Could the Minister clarify exactly the logic of this?  I probably support his intention but I want to be crystal clear about it.</P>
        <P>Let me refer again to the Swedish derogation, which we oppose.  It pertains to the exemption of full-time agency workers from the legislation.  We have a number of amendments that have been ruled out of order on this issue.  Will the Minister rethink this matter because it potentially creates a loophole?  If full-time agency workers are excluded from the protections under the Bill, there is a danger that some unscrupulous employers will exploit the circumstances that exist and hire full-time agency workers.  Thus, we will end up having to return to the very problem we are trying to address regarding part-time agency workers.</P>
        <P>I accept that only a tiny percentage of agency workers are deemed to be full-time.  We fear there is potential for abuse by some unscrupulous employers.  I accept that the vast majority are not unscrupulous but we know some seek to take advantage of loopholes where they see fit.  Could the Minister revert to me on this?  We have genuine concerns.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept the Cathaoirleach has ruled the amendments out of order.  It is beyond me why amendment No. 13 was ruled out of order because we removed any references to the public sector.  I fail to understand how it could constitute a draw on the State.  Perhaps clarification can be given in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased with the Minister&rsquo;s amendments.  The word &ldquo;comparator&rdquo;, mentioned on Second and Committee Stages, was not one I had heard before.  We were concerned about its use and I am pleased it has been removed.</P>
        <P>Concern was expressed by us over the fact that the directive we are supposed to be following was changed considerably.  We have now returned to a position in which we are much closer to the original directive.  On that basis, our current position reflects more accurately the intention of the directive.  I thank the Minister for his changes.  The Bill will now be far more valuable and will achieve what we were hoping it would achieve, namely, fairness for temporary or part-time workers.  On that basis, I have no problem withdrawing the amendments to which my name is attached.  I refer to amendments Nos. 6, 10 and 11.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane asked why we are doing what we are doing.  As I stated, the original drafter considering the directive sought to use the comparator as a way of providing an interpretation of how the measures should be applied in practice.  When the Bill was published in the form making reference to a comparator employee &mdash; I refer to an employee in a relevant company doing the same sort of work as another &mdash; there was a difficulty as to the difference between a person taken on today and one taken on five years ago, for example.  The question arose as to whether there could be a fair comparison.  The Bill sought to make the comparison fair by introducing concepts such as training, length of service, etc.  As we engaged with Senators, Deputies and employers, however, we noted the interpretation seemed to be resulting in more confusion than clarity.  Specific employers were worried that the provision was totally vague and did not give guidance either to the employer or temporary agency worker on comparisons between employees recruited today and those recruited five years ago.  Therefore, we have reverted to the text stating an agency worker shall, for the duration of his assignment with a hirer, be entitled to the same basic working and employment conditions as those to which he would have been entitled had he been employed by the hirer under contract at the same time.  The new formulation is essentially simpler although any case would still have to be adjudicated upon by the rights commissioner.  Evidence would have to be presented and, in the case of a challenge, the going rate on the day of recruitment would have to be established.</P>
        <P>Having spoken to people, I understand the difficulties that arise making comparisons.  In some cases, it could be straightforward in that the case could pertain to somebody who was employed last week.  When recruitment was a long time ago and the conditions in the labour market were different, problems arose, thus creating uncertainty.  We reflected on the debate in this House and correspondence from some Senators spelling out their concerns in greater detail.  We have reflected on these concerns.  Given that there are some anti-avoidance measures, which I will deal with later, the current formulation is more in accord with the rights in the Bill, and it makes it easier for employers and workers to know where they stand in practice.  That was the thinking.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane raised the Swedish derogation.  This issue was debated in both Houses.  Concern was expressed that there is a potential loophole.  The practice to which the Deputy refers is not a practice in Ireland at present.  The Swedish derogation, as it is called, occurs where the agency, rather than the hirer, employs the worker.  The worker would be employed permanently by the agency, which would enter into a commitment not only to pay the worker during the period of the assignment but also when it did not have work for him.  Our judgment is that this is a good option for some.  Some might like a flexible arrangement like this.  We should not rule this out or allow the opportunity for such a derogation to pass.  If we did not include the derogation in the Bill, it would not ever be possible for such an arrangement to come into play.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With a view to providing anti-avoidance mechanisms, in order that the measure would not be used to abuse the system, we have stipulated that the employee must be informed in writing that, by entering into an arrangement such as that described, he is giving up rights he might otherwise have as a temporary agency worker.  People would sign up to the agreement knowingly.  I refer to a permanent contract of employment.  If an employer abuses what is framed as a permanent contract of employment, a worker will have recourse to the rights commissioner to argue the contract is not such but an effort to have a temporary placement attracting pay at a lower rate than would otherwise apply.  There are protections built into the Bill that deal with the concerns Senator Cullinane and others have raised.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Quinn for his support for my amendments.  Several Senators, including those who have tabled amendments, have identified the area in question as a problem area.  We need to respond to issues where they are raised with us in a constructive way.  I thank my officials and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office who helped us develop a measure more fit for purpose.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendment No. 12, in the names of Senators Cullinane, &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Reilly, seeks to delete the derogation provision from section 7(2) which provides that the equal treatment in respect of pay only will not apply to an agency worker provided certain conditions are met.  This would bring an additional group of agency workers within the scope of equal treatment.  Accordingly, this would have the effect of imposing additional costs on a public sector hirer of agency workers.  Amendment No. 12 is ruled out of order, therefore, because it would involve a potential charge on Revenue.  Amendment No. 13 is also ruled out of order for the same reason.</P>

	<P>We are not having a discussion on it.  I have made my decision on it.  Amendment No. 13 is ruled out of order because it would have the effect of excluding agency workers assigned to work for public sector hirers from the scope of the derogation.

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 14 is a saving provision that clarifies the arrangements that exist separately from this legislation and which provide for better terms for agency workers than those provided under section 7 and stand on their own merits.

However, for the reason that amendment No. 16 would provide a different set of rules for agency workers working in the public and private sectors, I cannot accept it.</P>

	<P>This amendment provides for the introduction of certain anti-avoidance measures.  As such, it was not considered on Committee Stage.  It proposes the inclusion of a new section and must, for this reason, be recommitted to the House on this Stage.</P>
        <P>This amendment is particularly important given the proposed revision of section 7 that deals with conferring on agency workers the entitlement to basic working and employment conditions.  Section 7 follows closely the wording of Article 5 of the directive.  As a consequence, this requires that measures are adopted at national level to ensure proper protection for agency workers in line with the anti-avoidance provisions of Article 5.5 of the directive.  In particular, there is a requirement to prevent the use of successive assignments of agency workers designed to circumvent and override the entitlements conferred on them.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 15 responds to this by proposing the insertion of a new section 8.  The intention is to ensure agency workers on assignment with the same hirer in a series of assignments in which they are doing the same or similar kind of work are not reverted to the starting point on each occasion they commence a further assignment with that employer.  Rather, the provision in section 8(1) provides that the series of assignments will be treated as a single assignment which means agency workers will properly accumulate service and other entitlements under employment law.  Accordingly, the first assignment in a relevant series of assignments is treated as the objective starting point for determining the commencement of the assignment.</P>
        <P>Section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) provides a safeguard to ensure the time in between assignments when the agency worker is not working with the hirer is not taken into account for the purposes of determining entitlements.  This would be minimum notice and so on.  Section 8(2) defines what constitutes a series of relevant assignments which is that the hirer is the same person or a person connected with the hirer, as defined in section 8(3), the agency worker is the same person on the relevant assignment and works in whole or in part at the same place of work, that work is directed and supervised from the same place, and the work done is the same or of similar nature and undertaken under the same or similar conditions, with any differences being of a minor significance.</P>
        <P>Additionally, section 8(2) provides where there is a break between assignments which is greater than a three month period, this breaks the sequence of the series of assignments, and further assignments after that point would commence from the start.  The three month period in between assignments is borrowed from the existing legislation in the employment rights area, section 2(2) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This was a particular concern of the unions.  The Minister and his officials have listened to their concerns.  Neither do I believe it poses any threat to employers.  I can understand in the case of a person who works for a year, is gone for a month, returns to work for another year and is gone again for another month, that on his or her next return for the third assignment, the person is deemed to have had two years service and is not treated as starting on a day one basis.  It makes sense and does not threaten potential employment opportunities while removing the concern the unions had.  I certainly support this amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">As someone who has used agency workers in my time as an employer, I always found they were in limbo.  It has become more focused over recent years when we have found many family members and friends have taken up agency work.  There is a generation coming into the workforce which seems more comfortable in this type of employment because it allows them to specialise and move abroad.  It is important they are treated as permanent employees.  The Minister has addressed them and this is a progressive move for employees, especially now in the labour market when people do not expect to be in permanent employment as they used to be and which allows them gain experience in different fields.  The Protection of Employees  (Temporary Agency Work) Bill is important to the future growth of the economy as well.  I fully support the Minister&rsquo;s work on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Mullins, Harte and Quinn for their support on this.  Senator Harte probably hit the right note.  Especially in this time where there is uncertainty, inevitably, there will be temporary hiring, work building up and people not knowing whether it will be sustainable.  We need the flexibility for agency working as a form of employment, but equally we need to ensure those taken on in that capacity are treated fairly.  This is trying to strike the balance between having the flexibility but also having the fairness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Harte is probably right that, increasingly with the nature of the speed of technological change, people will go through different types of employment through their working lives and there will inevitably be different models developed.  As we develop that necessary flexibility, we need to also ensure there is a balance in terms of treating people fairly and allowing them, for example, to plan for mortgages or whatever.  We need to establish a fair basis for that.  That is what the directive seeks to do.</P>

	<P>This proposed amendment is purely technical and relates to an amendment to section 8 that deals with collective agreements.  The reason for this amendment is that section 8(1) allows for a body or bodies representative of employees to agree a collective agreement.  The language of section 8(4)(<i>c</i>) refers only to body in the singular, that is, it describes the body that negotiated the agreement.  This amendment ensures this section is aligned with section 8(1) by also covering the plural version.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Minister.  Today has been an interesting day.  In my experience over 19 years, and I spoke to Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien about this earlier today, it is seldom we find a Minister willing to take amendments to a Bill that has passed through the D&aacute;il and has come to the Seanad.  On this occasion, the Minister has listened carefully, has taken a number of amendments into account and has certainly taken on board the concerns of a number of Members, especially Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, who is an employer of agency workers and who had some concerns which she expressed clearly.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his officials have listened carefully.  This enhances the reputation of this House because it shows it has performed something suitable.  We have examined the Bill, which is quite technical and quite difficult to understand, and taken action, with Senators expressing their concerns and the Minister listening.  It is a good day for this House, for democracy and for the Oireachtas.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s interest in this and also the response to the concerns expressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what Senator Quinn stated.  I am standing in today for Senator Mary White, but it is refreshing that, since the Bill was before the House on Second Stage, the Minister and his staff in the Department have brought forward a series of amendments that makes it more appropriate under the circumstances.  Too often, Ministers and Departments are unwilling to accept any amendments or changes.  The legislation may not be perfect or utopian, but it is a good start to comply with the European directive and the Minister should be complimented on it.  I presume if, in time, this legislation is found not to be working properly and to be deficient in certain ways, the Minister will revisit it to make it workable.  It is a new initiative in this area and the progress that has been made under this Bill must be welcomed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for all the obvious work and for acknowledging our amendments and fears.  I support what Senator Quinn stated.  As an employer, I found the Bill difficult and technically very different.  I am thinking if that is how it is for me in here, what will it be like for other employers, employees and agency workers who will have to grapple with it?  With all of his work, the Minister has achieved a balance of fairness and flexibility, inasmuch as he possibly could, between the agency worker, the permanent worker, who is an important person we have not mentioned this morning, and the employer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his co-operation and obvious personal interest in this Bill.  Senator Quinn, who has much more experience in the Seanad and in business than I will ever have, articulated it well.  As a parent, both of a permanent employee and someone who is working part time, I can see the merits of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I was elected to the Seanad 12 months ago yesterday.  Today was good work for the Seanad.  I see the benefit of the Seanad more today than over the past 12 months, and even previously when I was not a Senator.  It shows the Seanad has an effective and practical role in a Bill such as this which is important for employees and the citizens of the country.  What has happened in the Seanad may not even make the news this week, but Senators will appreciate the work done by the Minister and his officials and by all the Members of the Seanad who engaged to make it a worthwhile Bill and one for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senators who stated it is a good day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann and for democracy.  The Minister is to be complimented on taking on board the many concerns about the Bill expressed some weeks ago.  As Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien stated, it strikes a correct balance.  It ensures fairness for agency workers while removing some uncertainties for some employers as well.</P>
        <P>We want to ensure at all times we make it easy for employers to employ additional workers and remove any obstacles and difficulties.  I am confident the Bill, as amended, will ensure some jobs that may have been lost to this country will be retained and we will see additional jobs created as a result.</P>
        <P>It was a good day&rsquo;s work here.  I thank the Minister and all the Senators who put in a great deal of work to ensure the Bill is now in a state that best serves the country and the economy, and is friendly to job creation.</P>

        <P>I also acknowledge the Senators&rsquo; recognition that much work was put in by my officials, who are here, and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in getting a formulation that was robust, in line with the directive and struck the right balance.  A great deal of work went into it in the period.  As the House will be aware, it has been some time since we discussed this last and that time has not been wasted.  I acknowledge publicly the work my officials have done.</P>

        <P>We propose this amendment because we feel the phrase &ldquo;miscellaneous provisions&rdquo; gives more of an indication as to the range of measures in the Bill which we feel, in particular with regard to lone parents, is very punitive and badly thought out.  The debate on Second Stage suggests there does not appear to be support from any sector for some of the provisions in the Bill.  We will go into more detail on this as we go through Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The speed at which the Bill is being rushed through the Seanad is a slight to this House.  Little time was given for amendments to be submitted, for proper consultation with affected groups and for consideration of the implications of some of the new amendments being made.

	<P>I apologise, as I was delayed by traffic and roadworks in the Phoenix Park on my way back to the House.

	<P>I hope I did not inconvenience the Seanad too much.  The campus is a great achievement and a great reflection on all of the political parties that have been involved in the development.  This multicampus approach will be the forerunner for many such schools.  It comprises children of approximately 60 nationalities.</P>
        <P>One reason for the delay was the blessings and thoughts from no fewer than five religious bodies plus the Humanist Association of Ireland.  Due to the plurality and inclusivity of the event and the fact that three buildings needed to be opened, it took longer than anticipated.  Indeed, it was one of the longest opening ceremonies, but it is a great credit to the community, children and teachers.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I am informed by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that the Bill&rsquo;s current name is sufficient to relate to the various amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the Pensions Act 1990 that are to be included in this Bill.  The Senators&rsquo; Committee Stage amendments will also be covered.  In these circumstances, there is no need to include a reference to miscellaneous provisions in the Bill&rsquo;s name.  The provisions to which Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred were announced in the budget and are not new by any means.</P>

	<P>Even though the measures were announced in the budget, there has been a great deal of toing and froing as well as much press spin on, for example, the provision of child care for lone parents, which was not announced on budget day.  The D&aacute;il made many amendments to the Bill.  To say these provisions were announced on budget day and that we knew what was coming is not adequate.  We should have been given more time to take yesterday&rsquo;s D&aacute;il amendments on board.  The Bills Office has told us that it was under pressure last night to try to have the Bill ready for 9.15 a.m.  However, I am willing to accede to the Minister&rsquo;s decision, given her explanation for not wanting to accept my amendment.

      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) <i>Section 4 </i>shall not come into force until a date to be set by the Minister for Social Protection, that date not being sooner than 3 years from the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister back to the House and thank her for her attendance.  On Second Stage, I acknowledged and affirmed her vision of reform of the social welfare and child care systems.  Several times, the Minister has stated in the House and elsewhere that much of the rationale for the inclusion in section 4, which we are seeking to amend, was that investment in the one-parent family payment to date has not been effective in terms of the reduction in the number of people in poverty or at risk of adult or child poverty.  I am with the Minister in that regard and I am with my colleagues as regards introducing reforms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has also indicated that the reforms in this Bill are coupled with reforms, including the earnings disregard in relation to the one family parent payment, in the Social Welfare Bill 2011 enacted prior to Christmas last.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>My colleagues and I tabled an amendment to section 11 of the Social Welfare Act 2011 but were informed that the amendment was ruled out of order as it involves a charge on the Exchequer.  As such, we will not be able to move that amendment.  The Seanad debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 was guillotined and, as such, we did not reach section 11, which is one of the reasons we tabled our amendment.  Also, our arguments in regard to the change being introduced in terms of section 4, coupled with what has been done in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011, is what drives the Minister&rsquo;s effort in terms of reforming the one parent family payment against her own vision.  It is why we are especially keen to move the amendment to section 11.  The changes in terms of the reduction in the earning disregard provided us with legislation in advance.  However, I am not sure that was an appropriate use of forward dated legislation.  The Minister incorporated transitional provisions in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 in the form of forward dated legislation.  This type of legislation is usually used to protect people.  However, in this case it does not appear to be a protection.  We are arguing it was not a protection as the legislation provided for a reduction of the earnings disregard for the one parent family payment, bringing it more in line with the rules associated with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I conducted a simple exercise comparing a couple on the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance with a person on a one parent family payment, where both households take up part time work for &euro;160 per week.  In my example both families have a three year old child.  In 2016 the one parent household will have only &euro;18 more in income than will the two parent household, which &euro;18 is all that will be available for child care even if the person has two children.  As regards the change already introduced, it does not appear that there exists an equality between a one parent and two parent household with regard to social welfare support.  One family has two parents available to seek work and care for the children, which can be shared, while the other does not have that support in terms of child care.  With the higher earnings disregard for one parent families there was that equality or equity.  We believe there was a reversal of that equity in the Bill enacted prior to Christmas.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in my earlier remarks, the one parent family payment, with a higher earnings disregard than the jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, provided a recognition of the greater practical financial burden &mdash; in the main the cost of child care &mdash; faced by one parent families trying to access employment and raise children.  The social welfare code reasonably presumes that in a two parent household where one person is working part time the caring of the child can be shared, thereby avoiding the additional costs of child care.  As acknowledged by the Minister, it is an imperfect system because it fails to address the need for a proper system of child care for all families.</P>
        <P>The social welfare system was up until that point effectively compensating for policy failure or, as the NESC report on the developmental welfare state called it, the &ldquo;services deficit&rdquo;.  Equally, it might be argued that this system traps one parent families in part time work.  I accept that is what the Minister is trying to change.  However, such claims miss the obvious point, namely, that the trap is a reality of basic household finances.  A single parent cannot work full time if he-she cannot pay for child care.  The same applies in respect of two parent households where both parents are seeking full time work.  It cannot be done unless child care is affordable and of good quality.  Until we have proper child care services, the earnings disregard related to the one parent family payment should not be reduced any further than the &euro;130 payable in 2012.  However, our amendment on this matter has been ruled out of order.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection provided us with a statement of the savings related to the earlier reform of reducing the earnings disregard.  In 2012, &euro;14.2 million will be saved, in 2013 it will be &euro;32 million, in 2014 it will be &euro;50 million and in 2015 it will be &euro;63 million, which amounts to a saving of &euro;159 million over the next couple of years as a result of that change in the legislation.  Is this amount part of the investment to which the Minister referred in her speeches, which is not being used in an effective manner to move people beyond the risk of poverty, and that needs to be leveraged differently?  I might be inclined to agree that perhaps we need to leverage that investment differently.  Are these savings to be used to develop the system of child care of which the Minister speaks?  If not, then the change in terms of the earnings disregard, coupled with &mdash; I am coming now to the reason we tabled the amendment to section 4 &mdash; the changes in regard to section 4 in terms of the lowering of the relevant age, will, we believe, increase the risk of poverty for lone parents and their children.</P>
        <P>The Minister will note that we have not tabled an amendment that suggests section 4 be deleted or that we oppose that section.  We decided instead to recommend the insertion of a clause that would provide the Minister with a three year period to put in place, through a staged process, a system of affordable, high quality, out of school child care for all children in Ireland.  This is our way of trying to acknowledge the strategic vision which the Minister has outlined and which we affirm.  The type of child care service promised by the Minister in her Second Stage D&aacute;il speech is what was confirmed by the T&aacute;naiste in his response to queries from the Opposition during Leaders&rsquo; Questions the following day.  The T&aacute;naiste, in response to a query from Deputy Martin, stated that the Deputy knew well that it is normal practise that when legislation is brought before the House and enacted there are provisions for the commencement of various sections of that legislation.  Why then does the Minister continue to resist inserting into this Bill a provision for the commencement of section 4 on the basis of her commitment to a significantly better system of child care that currently exists?  The T&aacute;naiste continued stating that the measures related to the lowering of the age of the youngest child will go &ldquo;hand-in-hand&rdquo; &mdash; that is the metaphor &mdash; with changes in the delivery and provision of child care and that it will be possible to implement these changes over time.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste also stated that the legislation then before the D&aacute;il and before us today is being enacted in the context of reforming the manner in which child care is being delivered.  Why can we not have this cemented in law?  We suggest a three year time period.  It is up to the Minister if she wishes to change that timescale to two or four years.  We believe three years would be an adequate time to begin in a significant manner a State subsidised child care and after school care system and that this should be cemented in law.  Also, there should be consistent regulation across all providers throughout the country and a significant investment in the development of after school care in Ireland which has not to date been available.  I know the Minister is aware of that and that is her vision.  This is the big change which the Minister is pushing and we are with her on it.  However, we believe it should be provided for in law.  The Minister is speaking about a comprehensive system that is first and foremost based around the developmental needs of children.  Investing in out-of-school child care is also critical to enabling lone parents to combine employment with care of their school going children.</P>
        <P>The Minister has just returned to the Seanad from the opening of a new multidenominational school campus.  The development of after-school services should include schools.  That is the reason we are moving this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate.  A number of Senators have mentioned lone parents on Second Stage and the need for proper child care.  In the D&aacute;il the Minister mentioned that there was a need for the Government to move on the issue of providing child care, and this would be linked to changes in the thresholds, particularly in reducing the age limit from 14 years to seven years.  Many people, including me, welcomed those comments.  We want the Government to move beyond fine words and ensure there are sufficient provisions within the Bill if it is to get support from those of us who were disgusted by the way lone parents were singled out in this budget and treated with reductions in their income.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not see why the Minister would refuse to provide for a commencement time period in the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 make sense and if the Government is serious about the issue and believes it will be able to provide quality, affordable child care that lone parents need, there is no reason it cannot accept them.  As subvention rates to community cr&egrave;ches have been cut by 5%, we are seeing cuts to child care services and funding, while the Minister is saying we will improve child care services.</P>
        <P>We know affordable child care and after-school provision is lacking in this country and must be enhanced.  We all support that process but we want to hear the Government&rsquo;s plans on the issue.  The Minister asked Senators and Deputies to take a leap of faith and accept the bona fides of the Government in that it would bring forward child care proposals and provide child care that all parents, including lone parents, need.  She indicated the Government would enhance child care provision and I hope she will reduce the cost of child care.  Our figures show that Ireland has one of the highest levels of child care cost in Europe and it is important that we have not only world class child care facilities but that they are affordable for the people who need them.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Minister accepts these amendments.  We are opposed to section 4 in its entirety because of the way lone parents were singled out.  It is important to remind ourselves of the kind of cuts put in place for lone parents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not dealing with section 4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making the point in case the Minister argues that we are making amendments to section 1 but we are opposed to section 4.  I am setting out our context.  We have listened to the Minister&rsquo;s comments in the D&aacute;il and it seems she will go ahead with her plans to reduce the qualifying criteria to the youngest child being seven years old.  The Minister could accept amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  We should remind ourselves of the cuts which have an effect on lone parents.  They include a reduction in income disregard from &euro;146.50 to &euro;130, with plans to lower the level to &euro;60 by 2016.  The Minister acknowledges child care cost and a lack of provision in the area.  All we are getting is fine words but we have not seen deeds or action.  We want the Minister to spell out clearly the plans of Government to enhance child care.  Will she hold off on reducing the thresholds for entitlements so the child care provisions can be put in place?</P>
        <P>There will also be cuts to community employment schemes and entitlements for lone parents.  Lone parents want to take part in schemes and better themselves in order to provide a better life for their families but we see more cuts to affect those efforts.  On Second Stage Senator Healy Eames spoke about a dependency culture but there are very few lone parents who see themselves as dependent on the State and wanting to be in that kind of cycle.  We have 460,000 people out of work and the opportunities are not there currently for many lone parents.  They need income and child care support.  When those people go back to employment, re-train or participate in community employment schemes, they need income support to pay for child care.  There is no other income support so where would these people get the money they require?  The Minister should put herself in the shoes of a lone parent who is on a CE scheme.  With the existing benefits, how in God&rsquo;s name would they be able to pay for child care?  I do not see how it will work.</P>
        <P>All of the other provisions in the budget, including changes to the back to school, clothing and footwear allowances, the household charge and other elements in the social welfare Bill will have an impact on lone parents.  There are many lone parent advocacy groups who have lobbied the Minister and all of us to ensure that we try to correct bad decisions made by this Government.  I was one of those who commended the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, when he put his hand up with respect to DEIS schools and said he made a mistake.  He indicated that he should not have targeted the most disadvantaged people, communities and schools.  He reviewed the issue, went back to the drawing board and admitted his mistake.  The Minister here today went some of the way when she stated that there should be a link between these measures and child care support.  It seems that these are just words and we need more convincing evidence from the Government that those child care provisions will be put in place.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s best course of action is to accept the amendments so there can be no implementation of a reduction in the age threshold until child care provisions are in place.  They are reasonable amendments and I hope she will accept them.  My colleague, Senator &Oacute; Cloch&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I apologise for my speech impediment.  We all want to stand by the people who are vulnerable and try to make life as comfortable as possible for themselves and their families.  We know lone parents are a vulnerable group which should be protected.  For example, when the Labour Party was in opposition it opposed moves by Fianna F&aacute;il to reduce the age threshold from 18 years to 14 years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  The Labour Party opposed the measure and it must be even more difficult for Fianna F&aacute;il Senators to sit here and have to listen to the Minister justify reducing the age threshold to seven years.  She opposed the policy which the previous Government introduced.  I hope the Minister will accept the bona fides of the arguments being put forward not just by Opposition parties but by the Independent Senators who are concerned about the impact this will have on lone parents.  Nobody wants to see vulnerable people targeted or affected by budget changes when we believe it will have a negative impact on their quality of life.  We are trying to make sure that before the provisions are introduced, which we oppose, the Minister should do what she said she would and provide the child care services needed.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the nature of the political system that Senator Cullinane makes points about the parties in Government, who were previously in opposition and who opposed much of what was proposed in the context of this amendment.  I do not want to bring up the quotes but they make for interesting and somewhat scary reading.  I refer to the barbs and missiles launched at the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister.  The Fianna F&aacute;il proposals were to reduce the age from 22 years to 14 on a phased basis but not to seven years of age.  The then Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, emphasised the need to provide effective support services and child care provision before the proposed modernisation of the one parent family payment.</P>
        <P>All of us applauded the Minister for the position she took in the D&aacute;il and perhaps she can amplify her statements in light of the debate that followed.  She can correct me if I am wrong but I understand she will not introduce this until there is sufficient child care provision structures to ensure it minimises the adverse impact on lone parents.  Notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s position, which we admire, it is informed by her background and the forensic approach of her accountancy perspective of what is possible.  It is also informed by her professional background working among the poor and the disadvantaged in that most Third World continent, Africa.  I have never doubted the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides in this regard.  She is in the right job and she is the right person for the job.  We acknowledge the difficulties she faces in trying to reduce a budget that takes up 40% of Government expenditure on an annual basis.  I am sure the Minister does not wish to be remembered as the one who dismantled the structures to help the disadvantaged.  The reason I am looking at this on a macroeconomic basis is that, in light of the Minister&rsquo;s comments, I wonder if she will be able to achieve her ambitions.</P>
        <P>We cannot foretell the future and I am not attempting to gaze into a crystal ball but we can look at the signs.  Brendan Keenan cut to the chase, as he often does when economic matters are discussed, in a readable way in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today.  He talked about the report of the troika and how we are the best boy or girl in the class.  Well done to the Government.  It is now long forgotten that Fianna F&aacute;il, which introduced the austerity measures in the first place, adhered to the memorandum of agreement for the first couple of reports.  As Mr. Keenan pointed out, as did other economic commentators, the troika will be back in town in July for the next assessment, the seventh report.  By that time, the Minister and her colleagues will be engaging in the preliminary discussions on the budget Estimates for 2013 and preliminary discussions on budgetary changes and proposals formulated in the Department.  I have no doubt that the Minister will fight tooth and nail, as she did last year, to hold onto as much of the budget as she can.  However, the term low-hanging fruit has popped up again.  It is a terrible term that effectively means the Government has managed to go after the obvious cuts, although many socially and economically disadvantaged people will not agree.  In July, Departments across the board will be required to trim their budgets once again.  In other areas, the effect can be lessened but in the Minister&rsquo;s Department everything affects those who are socially and economically disadvantaged in our society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Wearing another hat, I operate in the child care area as chairman of the County Leitrim child care committee.  In recent years, particularly since 2008, I have seen the recurring reduction in the budgets of statutory committees.  That, in turn, filters into the provision of services in the county.  How will the Minister battle against the prevailing economic wind blowing against the Government?  There will be another severe impact on departmental budgets.  How will the Minister balance the introduction of this measure for new claimants once the law is passed and provide the enhanced child care provision to which she referred?  The Minister set the ball rolling and it would be instructive to get an inkling of her thinking after listening to the debate since she first made the point on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I will not rehearse the arguments put forward.  I understand the difficulty facing the Minister and I know why she is doing what she is doing.  It is a continuation of the Fianna F&aacute;il proposals, although more extreme in the reduction to seven years of age, but the question is whether the Minister has a plan B to square the circle.  How will she retain her existing budget, which she will not be able to do?  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, will also be unsuccessful in trying to retain her budget.  In each year up to now, there have been ongoing reductions.  It is not that the reductions are negative but we all hear about the impact on the ground.</P>
        <P>During the week, we met a lobby group from the youth network.  The budget for that comes from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The youth service in Sligo, Leitrim and North Mayo provides 70 or 80 outlets including a youth cafe in my home town of Drumshanbo.  It is a wonderful advantage for young people who previously would gather in a corner or go into pubs to play billiards, with the attendant temptations in that environment.  It is symptomatic of a small town where young people do not know what to do.  The budget for the youth cafe is &euro;81,000 and will be reduced to &euro;71,000.  As a result, the full-time worker in the youth cafe, called the Base Cafe, must take a reduction in pay.  One part-time worker has already been lost and the same is happening across the region.  That is happening not in the Minister&rsquo;s Department but in the Department of Justice and Equality.</P>
        <P>The Minister will have an extraordinarily difficult time.  The argument put forward from the Opposition side of the House and the Independent Senators is to withdraw the section.  Alternatively, the Minister should accept the amendment as we have worded it.  That would give her two options.  Proposed subsection (5) allows for the provision to come into operation on a day or days decided by the Minister, which would give her some latitude.  If that does not work, it would then not come into force until a date sooner than three years from the enactment of the Act.</P>
        <P>The argument has been well rehearsed but the core point in the amendment is that while we believe the Minister, we do not think she will be able to achieve her objectives and that she will not be able to put in place the enhanced child care service provision that has been called for simply because there will not be enough money.  The Minister must ask if she will hold back from implementing this, and in so doing relieve the distress among a portion of our population that is severely disadvantaged, or press ahead anyway on the basis the Minister needs the money and has no choice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support amendment No. 2. I acknowledge the country faces serious financial difficulties and I have voted in this House for the household charge and the septic tank charge with a heavy heart. This issue, however, for me is far too much. I realise difficult decisions must be taken and cuts must be made but whom the cuts affect is ultimately a political decision. In Ireland we believe we value children and childhood but the evidence does not suggest this. In my earlier statement, I acknowledged the great strides this Government is making in the interest of children&rsquo;s rights, welfare and protection. If we truly want to make Ireland one of the best countries in the world to be a child, we must apply holistic and joined up thinking, we must child-proof our legislation and our policy decisions. </P><P Just="Left">As a starting position I oppose section 4. When we come to section I will elaborate on why I feel so strongly about this. Amendment No. 2 to section 1 offers a good compromise. While I would not be entirely happy with it I acknowledge that it is fair. </P>
        <P>Looking at our provision of child care in Ireland, in the past we had a model where we provided child care based on the status of the parent.  It was purely a measure to get women back into the workplace.  We provided child care because we needed mothers to work.  That was the basis of the system and it was rare that the child was mentioned.  With the introduction of the free preschool year, we quickly moved the focus to quality child care provision.  My fear is that this measure will remove the focus from the child once more.</P>
        <P>I am chairman of Early Childhood Ireland, which represents 80% of the preschool, day care, parent and toddler and after school services in Ireland.  I know a bit about the provision of child care in Ireland.  Today, ECI has called for an additional &euro;5 million just to deal with the baby boom.  We have an increasing number of children who will be going into the free school year.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has set as her political priority the provision of a second year of preschool education.  That will go out the window under this.</P>
        <P>A capital fund of &euro;6 million was put in place last month for capital grants in the child care sector.  It has received applications for funding amounting to more than &euro;60 million, an indication of the need for building improvements in the sector.  That is just for those children who are in the system now; it is not about the additional children.</P>
        <P>This amendment is about buying time but that is what we must do.  Where will the child care provision come from?  I would love if there was a system here based on the Scandinavian model but it took the Scandinavians over ten years to get there.  They had to put in place many other measures; it did not happen overnight and we are only asking for a few years.  This amendment would allow time for the necessary supports to be put in place, as committed to by the Minister.</P>
        <P>I do not question the Minister&rsquo;s vision but there is a difference between legislation and commitment.  We are talking about putting this into legislation today and while I take the Minister on her word, I am a realist.  There can be Cabinet reshuffles and other factors can emerge.  We can be told that we did our best but it did not happen.  That has a direct impact on children so I question why there is such haste.  Why not accept the compromise that has been put forward?  For me it supports everything the Minister has said.  It offers the necessary time so I ask the Minister to agree to Senator Zapone&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Zapone on the comprehensive contribution she made on her amendment.  I also agree with the remarks of Senator Mooney.  None of us on a personal level takes the Minister&rsquo;s word for granted.</P>
        <P>I would half-heartedly agree with the compromise of a three year delay.  When the previous Government, of which I was a member, reduced the age for eligible children from 22, particularly for those in third level, there was a huge furore and rightly so.  I was very uncomfortable with that change.  Now we are looking at reducing the cut-off point from 14 years to seven years.</P>
        <P>The problem arises from the Minister&rsquo;s remarks in the D&aacute;il.  She said she would not agree to implement this change unless there were guarantees from her Cabinet colleagues to provide adequate child care.  How does that sit with the fact the Bill makes these changes effective from 3 May?  What happens?  The Minister does not agree but were her remarks in the D&aacute;il made with the approval of her Cabinet colleagues?  I take the Minister at her word but that is not the way Government or Cabinet works.  From reading the Bill, section 4 applies and will be implemented on 3 May 2012.  The Minister&rsquo;s word and personal view, while I accept them, do not stand up.  The Minister cannot introduce legislation like this and then say that as the Minister for Social Protection she will not allow this to happen unless there is adequate child care.</P>
        <P>What is adequate, sustainable and affordable child care, particularly for lone parents?  I asked before, when the previous Social Welfare and Pensions Bill was introduced at Christmas, if the Government would give a cast iron commitment to the free preschool year in the term of this Government and I am asking that question once more.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs says she wants to expand the scheme to two years.  That would be great but how are we to know this will happen?  If we vote for this and the Minister does not accept these amendments, it will introduce into law the changes the Minister says she is opposed to.  That is a crazy situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like voting for the fiscal treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Beidh l&aacute; eile on that but that situation is untenable for the Minister.  The census figures published two weeks ago show there are more than 100,000 lone parent families.  In the Fingal area there are more than 10,500 lone parent families.  This is a substantial cut.  When the previous Government put in place the reduction for adults aged between 17 and 22 who were in third level education, there was huge criticism from the Labour Party and personally I had grave difficulty with it.  Now, the Minister is saying she will not implement it but I cannot marry the fact that the Minister says that but we are passing legislation that states the measure will be implemented as and from 3 May.  What is the position?  What is the Minister&rsquo;s basis for saying there must be provision of adequate, sustainable and affordable child care for lone parents in particular?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister set a time, for example by mid June, to bring forward the proposals from Government?  As I read the Bill, the problem is that the new rules will apply to a person who becomes a lone parent after 3 May 2012.  Will there be a second tier of lone parent families?  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s personal concern about the proposed changes but the measure does not stand up.  Following the enactment of this Bill, will the Minister confirm that these changes will apply to a person who becomes a lone parent after 3 May 2012?  As I asked before Christmas, will the Minister give Members of this House a guarantee the free preschool year will continue unchanged for the course of this Government?  Will the Minister state whether she supports the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald?  Are there plans in place to expand the free preschool year?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I contend that at the very least the Minister must accept this amendment.  I would half-heartedly accept it.  I understand and respect that our colleagues are trying to allow time for the Minister to consider this.  When will the Minister report to the House on what is adequate, sustainable and affordable child care?  Will she confirm that these changes will not apply to a person who becomes a lone parent family after 3 May 2012?  Will she give us a cast-iron guarantee that the free preschool year, as it currently stands, will not be changed during the term of this Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was completely unaware that my good friend, Senator Cullinane, had a cracked tooth.  I am glad that it is only the tooth that was cracked.  I would never refer to a Member&rsquo;s disability, as everybody knows, despite a tweet that was made, illegally, from this House.  I would not do such a thing.  I understand exactly the situation the Senator is in because I have attended this House after spending six hours on the dental table, getting a bone graft.  I know we all feel a duty to be present in the House.  If the inference was taken that I was mocking, I was being helpful, because I thought the Senator had a momentary lapse of memory and I enjoyed being able to supply the name.</P>
        <P>To get to the meat of the matter, it is important that we get on with the discussion.  I hope to be able to vote before I leave as I have an engagement that cannot be broken.  The intention of this amendment is to seek to give effect to the Minister&rsquo;s own words.  It would seem to be very difficult for the Minister to oppose it.  She may give a guarantee to the House that she will produce an amendment that will have the same effect in a more clear way, if she finds there is a lack of clarity.  I do not think anybody would object to that.  This amendment incorporates the words the Minister used in a speech and I congratulated her on the corridor for such courage.  Two days ago, the Minister made no mention of this in her speech.  That is a little bit worrying.  I understand the Minister may be under pressure but the danger is that if commitments are given and not lived up they begin to be perceived as a political stunt.  The Minister is not a person who I would have accused of pulling a political stunt.  If she looks at the impact of this measure, it means that people on one parent family payments will have to go on the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  It is paid only for days not worked.  For those in receipt of a lone parent family payment, who may have part-time work, they will be hit again.  They are hit again, and again.  I do not believe we who are privileged are aware of the impact on low income families of the multiple cuts and the extra charges that have been imposed which disproportionately effect the lowest paid, whom we should protect.</P>
        <P>I remember speaking in the House when the previous Government made the extraordinary decision to abolish Combat Poverty and then to attack the Equality Authority, the Human Rights Commission and so on, because I knew exactly that they were muzzling the disadvantaged.  It is for Members to speak out on behalf of the disadvantaged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will leave it at that because I hope to be here if a vote is called in order to vote with my colleagues.  I agree with all the arguments that have been made.  Amendment No 1 tabled by the Independent Senators, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, is the weakest and therefore the most acceptable to the Minister.  I support every amendment and if I get the opportunity I will vote for each and every one.  If the debate drags on until Monday, without getting to section 4, I will certainly commit myself to voting against section 4.</P>

	<P>I have spoken to the Minister outside the House on numerous occasions.  She is the person who said that she would not to this.  I ask the Minister to give a firm commitment that if by some chance she is reshuffled, that her successor keeps the commitment the Minister has given us.  This commitment is on the record.  I cannot see how the Minister could renege on the commitment in 2014.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This morning I heard the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, say the troika had agreed that we could use 50% of the money from the sale of State assets for the job stimulus package.  What better package than this?  I ask the Minister to ensure that money from the sale of State assets is ringfenced and put aside for the provision of proper affordable child care.  The Minister for Social Protection together with her colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, should get their spake in for a good lump of that money for the provision of child care.  Jobs will be created and parents will be able to avail of proper child care for their children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let me repeat what I said this morning when the Minister was not here.  I am a rural Senator.  I live in the country, not in a town and I know how hard it is for a person from a rural area, working in a town, to get her schoolgoing child from school to child care.  She is working in the town and has to return to the school and place her child in child care before returning to work.  That is very hard when there are two parents but it is next to impossible for a lone parent to juggle work and rear a family.  I will vote with this but I will hold the Minister to account to honour her commitment not to lower the age to seven years until the child care provision is in place.  We need a proper debate in this House on child care facilities.  That is another day&rsquo;s work &mdash; &ldquo;l&aacute; eile&rdquo;, as another speaker said.  We will call on the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to come to this House to debate the matter and outline the progress she is making with the provision of affordable, safe and accessible child care for people.</P>

	<P Just="Left">N&iacute; bheidh m&eacute; cos&uacute;il leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; Cullinane n&oacute; Norris. N&iacute;l s&eacute; i gceist agam fiacail a chur ann. We had a great occasion sa Cheathr&uacute; Rua last week when we opened a new child care facility, comprising a cr&egrave;che and a na&iacute;onra. We are delighted to have this wonderful facility, which had been 15 years in the making. Members of various committees and lobby groups approached various Ministers over the years to look for different pots of money. People in the local area saved money and organised all kinds of collections. That goes to the nub of the issue here. When I spent three years as the chair of the Galway city and county child care committee, I visited most of the child care facilities in County Galway. I never came across a child care facility that opened within three years of the facility being sought. I do not think any of those with whom I worked encountered such a case either.  I sat in the Visitors Gallery of the D&aacute;il with representatives of single parents&rsquo; organisations like SPARK and OPEN during the Second Stage debate on this Bill in that House.  I listened to everything that was said.  There was great jubilation when the Minister, Deputy Burton, said she would reconsider this measure and made it clear that child care services would have to be put in place before it could be implemented.  When I spoke to those involved in the campaign again a couple of days later, it struck me that they were very deflated.  There was a sense among them that they had been subjected to public relations spin on the night of the big debate in the D&aacute;il.  I am not accusing the Minister of anything when I say that.  An effort was made to take the heat off in the media because this had become such a big issue.  That is one of this reasons this has to be reconsidered.</P>
        <P>Lone parents have been contacting me again this morning to ask me to convey the message that they want to work.  They do not want to sit on their backsides.  They do not want to be at home.  They do not want to be cut off from their educational possibilities.  They want to be out there.  They want to work.  Child care is essential.  It seems that section 4, which we oppose, is to be pushed through this House as it was in the D&aacute;il.  We have tabled amendments to the section as a safety option.  We want to ensure that the services advocated by the Minister are put in place.  I do not want to rehearse the points that have been made already.</P>
        <P>I would like to remind the Minister of comments that were previously made by her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, who is eminently knowledgeable on this area.  When the last Government, which was led by Fianna F&aacute;il, introduced legislation to reduce the relevant age from 18 to 14, she said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The problem is that the Bill is not about activation; it is about cut-backs and the optics of doing something about long-term welfare recipients.  How can one call it activation when in the first instance there are so few jobs of any description available?  That is the big issue; the jobs are not there.</P>
        <P FLI="0">She continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is no provision for extra training or for extra after-school care for the children of lone parents.  There is not even a commitment from the Minister on ring-fencing any money that might be saved for helping welfare claimants into work or training.</P>
        <P FLI="0">She went on:</P>
        <P LI="1">Lowering the qualifying age was meant to go hand-in-hand with better child care and training services, the introduction of a parental allowance to replace the one parent family payment and the ending of the ban on cohabitation.  Where are these reforms? There is no sign of them in this Bill.</P>
        <P FLI="0">She continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">The likelihood is that all that will happen is that an extra 12,000 lone parents will transfer to jobseeker payments over the next six years.  This will inflate the live register figures by another 12,000 as people on one parent family payment are not counted at the current time.  It is hard to know what the point of all that will be.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have to say I agree with every word of that.</P>
        <P>It is important to note, as I did during my Second Stage speech, that the Labour Party passed a motion at its recent conference calling on the party to &ldquo;refrain from imposing any further cuts to benefits for lone parent families that would create further barriers to accessing work and education opportunities&rdquo;.  I remind the House that the lack of child care is a barrier to accessing work and educational opportunities.  I am quite confused, to be honest.  I listened to the debates in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister has said she is opposed to the introduction of this measure in the absence of the availability of proper child care.  Having spoken to members of the Labour Party about this proposal, it seems to me that they oppose it.  Is this a case of Fine Gael cracking the whip of austerity within government?  The Labour Party seems to be opposed to this measure.  I have not heard members of Fine Gael speaking very strongly against it.  We need to know what is the situation.  There does not seem to be strong support for this measure.</P>
        <P>I second amendment No. 3.  I appreciate Senator Moloney&rsquo;s assurance that she is taking the Minister&rsquo;s word for what she says she will do.  I have to say I am hearing echoes of previous debates in this Chamber.  When we debated the septic tanks Bill with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, he told us not to worry because everything would be okay.</P>

We have to base our decisions on what is in the legislation. That is why this amendment should be taken on board. If it is not, we will not be able to support this section of the Bill. </P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I said this morning that I would support the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to reduce the age limit of 14 years to seven years as long as child care places and parental supports are put in place in the exact manner suggested by the Minister.  I remind Senator Cullinane that I like to be accurately quoted, as opposed to selectively quoted.  The Senator quoted selectively during yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the EU treaty, for example.  I ask Senator Cullinane to be accurate and to quote full sentences in the context in which they were said.</P>
        <P>The Minister can see that everybody is supportive of her views, in principle.  There is no argument there.  Clarification is required on the question of whether this is a matter of Government policy.  Has a Cabinet decision been taken on it?  We do not doubt the Minister&rsquo;s sincerity but we are worried that her commitment might not be honoured in the event of a change of Minister, to take the example used by Senator Moloney.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify that.</P>
        <P>There is a good opportunity here.  As Senator Moloney said, we have a network of rural schools throughout the country.  That infrastructure could be used to provide a network of rural after-school places.  Child care facilities popped up in many estates during the building boom, but not all of them are not being used.  I am not saying that is the case everywhere or that it is universal.  Some places are available in such locations.  It would be useful to do an inventory of the places that might be available.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>My big concern is the cost, rather than the infrastructure.  There is sufficient space in the empty buildings that can be made available.  I am aware that substantial costs are associated with child care.  The most difficult preschool year, from a parent&rsquo;s point of view, is the year when one&rsquo;s child is in a preschool or montessori facility but also in child care.  One&rsquo;s child might be in the preschool or montessori facility up to 12 o&rsquo;clock.  One has to leave work to pick the child up at that time &mdash; or get somebody belonging to one to do so &mdash; before bringing him or her to child care.  It is a tough year for parents because they have to pay the full price twice in that year.  I remember that I found it very difficult to move my little mite from one place to the other.  It is important for the Minister to clarify the position from a Government point of view.</P>
        <P>I have set out my main concern.  I would like to know if a discussion has taken place about the cost.  Is there a commitment about how the money will be found for this?  To be fair, the amendment tabled by the Independent Senators offers a three-year window.  Perhaps that could be achieved on a rolling basis.  It might be difficult for all of this to be achieved in one go.  It is possible that some of these places could be provided within a year, or up to a certain amount of time.  When the Minister responds, will she set out the period of time within which she expects all of this to be in place?  Does she envisage that it will be done within five years, for example?</P>
        <P>The Independent Senators have adopted an approach whereby they are trying to make this work.  There is some merit in that.  However, we are living with the reality of trying to balance budgets.  We must, therefore, evaluate what is possible from the Cabinet&rsquo;s point of view and take cognisance of the kind of financial support which might be committed in respect of this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>With all the discussion about commitments, policies, Government decisions and the Minister&rsquo;s integrity, we are forgetting that this is a parliament and that it has a responsibility to pass laws.  All that will matter at the end of our deliberations will be the words that are contained in the Bill when it is enacted.  Nothing else matters and, as a result, any debate on commitments, promises or taking the Minister at her word is, with respect, completely meaningless regarding the date for the coming into force of this legislation.  It was around the beginning of May that the ancient Fianna were obliged to go out and fend for themselves.  The three mottos of Na Fianna were &ldquo;Glaine &aacute;r gcro&iacute;&rdquo;, &ldquo;Neart &aacute;r ng&eacute;ag&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Beart de r&eacute;ir &aacute;r mbriathar&rdquo;.  What we are seeking from the Minister is &ldquo;Beart de r&eacute;ir ar mbriathar&rdquo;, or to paraphrase, action according to her words.  The action we are seeking is not a promise, a policy or a Government decision but rather a change to the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Bill will come into force on 3 May next and it is unusual to see such provision made in legislation.  Certain provisions of the budget come into force at midnight on the day on which it is introduced.  Normally, however, there is a general provision which states that the Minister will enact the relevant legislation on a date of his or her choosing.  The reality is that we do not have &ldquo;Beart de r&eacute;ir &aacute;r mbriathar&rdquo; and there is good reason in this instance to question the Minister&rsquo;s briathar, her word.  Anyone who is in the unfortunate position of becoming a single mother, either next week or the week after, will be subject to different rules from those which apply to everyone else because the lower age limit will apply in respect of her child.  In addition, the Scandinavian model of children care to which the Minister referred will not be in place here.  I am not overly familiar with the Scandinavian model of child care.  I have two children who attend a cr&egrave;che and a play-school, respectively.  I am, therefore, very familiar with the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, which has been a great success and which needs to be expanded.  What preparatory work has been carried out by the Minister&rsquo;s Department or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on this matter?  Was it the case that a statement was made in the D&aacute;il in recent days to relieve the huge pressure that was being exerted?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all have respect for the Minister &mdash; that goes without question.  If, however, those opposite have respect for children and parents, if they actually want to make changes to the law and if they want this Parliament to have a level of self-respect, then their own wishes, which they have clearly articulated, should be expressed in the form of a vote.  In that context, it should be a case of &ldquo;Beart de r&eacute;ir &aacute;r mbriathar&rdquo;.  I encourage those on the Government benches to vote in accordance with what they have stated during this debate.  It is fine to support the Government because one is obliged to do so. However, those opposite have all stated that they disagree with the legislation and that they want it to be changed. Let us change it and do what they have stated should be done. They should vote in favour of the amendments which have been put forward and which were drafted in light of what the Minister, Deputy Burton, stated on Second Stage. Those opposite have an opportunity to put the briathar into beart. I encourage them all to do so. I will be supporting the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment but I accept that the amendments tabled by the Independents and Sinn F&eacute;in make sense. </P>

	<P Just="Left">I echo many of the comments that have been made.  On Second Stage, I made the point that I would support any reform of the one-parent family payment which will make a difference and lead to positive outcomes for lone parents.  As the Minister is aware, the reforms that were put in train by the previous Government have not fully kicked in yet.  There has already been a major change whereby the age limit relating to the youngest child &mdash; whereby the parent is obliged to go out and seek work &mdash; has been reduced from 22 to 14.  In light of the current economic environment and the lack of job opportunities in general, there will be a cohort of lone parents who will be seeking work and who will require a great deal of support.  These people will need access to activation measures and will need to work with social welfare officers, the staff of SOLAS and others in order that they will have proper individual plans which will ensure that they will obtain meaningful employment rather than just being pushed into low-paid jobs.  There is a job to be done in the next couple of years in the context of coming to terms with what is an already significant reform of the one-parent family system.  I am concerned that this will not be done properly if all of those whose children are over seven years of age are forced out to seek employment.</P>
        <P>I welcome the comment the Minister made in the D&aacute;il last week in respect of child care.  I agree with my colleagues that there is nothing wrong with the amendments that have been tabled and that they merely give effect to the Minister&rsquo;s words.  This has been noted by people on both sides of the House.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the position and to make a statement that will allow individual lone parents and the organisations which represent them to rest assured that the Government actually has a plan.  Concerns have been expressed to me to the effect that, for example, the Pathways to Work initiative does not refer to child care.  It is amazing that a significant change such as that before the House was announced in the budget in the absence of consultation and without any reference &mdash; until now &mdash; to child care.</P>
        <P>If the Minister can introduce a much better child care system during the next two to three years, I will support her 110%.  Regardless of how matters currently stand in the context of our priorities, we must consider areas such as that under discussion.  As we make choices between different Departments and as we are obliged to manage with scarce resources, it will be necessary, in respect of education and other areas, to divert money towards younger people in order to give them the best chance in life.  I would fully support that.  However, it is difficult to have faith that what I have described will be done if an amendment which merely seeks to give effect to what the Minister intends to do and to include in the legislation the reassurance she has provided is going to be rejected.  If the amendment is rejected, it will be fair for people to ask why this is the case, particularly if the Government has genuine confidence in its own announcements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Minister was not present earlier, I stated that ultimately we want to move people away from passive dependency on welfare and into work.  The reality is that the one-parent family payment, as currently structured, is the least passive of all of the welfare payments.  As a result of the income disregards and other incentives, most lone parents actually work.  Statistics indicate that between 50% to 60% work and a further 20% are in education.  I appreciate that the system could be improved but it does, as it stands, have benefits.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone referred to the fact that we are not being given the opportunity &mdash; we were also denied it in the debate on the previous social welfare legislation &mdash; to discuss the income disregards, which really are key.  Those disregards are extremely important for children whose parents are being pushed onto the dole and for lone parents who are going to be affected by the changes being introduced in respect of them.  The disregards were put in place to ensure that people could retain their social welfare payments while also moving into the workplace.  This allowed them to mix welfare and employment and not be welfare dependent.  At present, someone can earn &euro;146 per week and still retain his or her welfare payment.  It is astonishing that the Government is intent on reducing this threshold to &euro;60 over a five-year period.  This is an incredibly regressive step.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are concentrating on the fact that seven is too young but, as Senator Zappone stated, we are not being given the opportunity to discuss the income disregards.  I am of the view that this matter must be considered in the round.  It must also be examined in the context of whether the Government has an activation plan for the parents to whom I refer which will allow them to obtain meaningful employment and which will not merely mean that they will be transferred from one social welfare payment to another.  I refer here to their being dumped on the dole and not provided with any real support.  If such a transfer is envisaged, it will lead to an already vulnerable and large group of parents and children and making their situation worse.</P>
        <P>I do not doubt the personal commitment the Minister gave in the D&aacute;il.  Like other Senators, however, I am concerned that if she does not hold the same position in the Government when we come to discuss this matter next year, then the point will be moot because the House will have passed legislation in the absence of any guarantee in respect of the people who are going to be affected.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senators for their contributions.  When I first came to this House in my role as Minister, a number of Senators were slightly disbelieving and wary regarding the commitment to reverse the decision on the minimum wage but I reversed it in the first legislation I introduced.  The important aspect of that was to help people on very low pay.  We have to take account of the context of where the country is at.  We are in economic difficulties and the country was signed by Fianna F&aacute;il into a deal with the IMF in late 2010.  We have to work our way out of the other side of that deal.  We are spending more than &euro;1 billion on payments to lone parents and the critical question is whether that billion expenditure is giving us the kind of outcomes we want for the parents and, more particularly, the children.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the ESRI published a fairly weighty document, one of a series, the latest study on poverty in Ireland, and it indicated what most people here know and have reflected in their contributions that the children who are most at risk of poverty are those in households where the adults are not at work.  In regard to children at risk of poverty, the most important and critical issue is the education level of the mother.  That is not my finding but of the three researchers, Watson, Maitre and Whelan, who undertook this large and generally well regarded comprehensive survey and report, published yesterday.  We must ask ourselves why they bring forward this evidence over and over again and what we can do in the context that this country correctly spends a great deal of money in regard to welfare.  Can we get better leverage of the money we spend to give people better outcomes?  It comes down to that.  That is what we all have to ask ourselves.</P>
        <P>I appreciate all the genuine comments made by Senators about their desire to support lone parents.  I believe that view is shared across members of all political parties and none.  I was the person in the 1990s who brought in a right for lone parents in the teeth of considerable opposition and cynicism at the time.  Older people here may remember that in the early 1990s if a person was in receipt of a lone parent&rsquo;s allowance, that person could not study or work.  It was simply not permitted.  One of the changes I introduced to try to impact on reducing poverty in Ireland was to allow young women in particular, who had a baby early on in their lives, to return to school or college and continue their education.  That change in Ireland, no more than the changes that Frank Cluskey brought in 40 years ago, was hugely helpful in giving people opportunities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have come to the stage where we have to ask ourselves what is it we need to do to use the money we are spending in a better way to get better outcomes.  The savings involved in the amendment we are discussing are minimal.  As has been said, investment in preschool and after school care will be many multiples of those savings.  I want to reiterate for Senators the timespan involved because some people think that some of what is proposed will happen next week.  For people who have been  lone parenting prior to April 2011, the operative dates for the proposed changes that will apply are as follows: the age limit will still be under 18 years in 2012, under 17 years in 2013, under 16 years in 2014 and under seven years in 2015 and 2016.  For parents who have since come into lone parenting, the age limit for the youngest child will be under 14 year in 2011 and 2012, under 12 years in 2013, under ten years in 2014 and under seven years in 2015 and 2016.  We are talking about quite a long period of transformation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>For those who become lone parents for the first time next week, the vast majority of whom would for obvious reasons be having a baby, they would become lone parents or requalify by virtue of having a child&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>What of deaths and separations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>No, not necessarily everybody and I will come to that.  The vast majority of people would come into that age group provision by virtue of having a child.  It is under 12 years for 2012, under 10 years for 2013 and under seven years for 2014.  I believe on the part of some of the groups, although certainly not on the part of OPEN or Barnardos, there may have been a misapprehension that all of this will happen instantly and that is why in regard to child care provision, I believe this country can do this.</P>
        <P>The number potentially involved will be 170 people in 2012 and that number will rise to approximately 700 in 2013 and by a couple of thousand in 2014.  The numbers affected will rise substantially in 2014 and 2015 because children, or parents, will begin to hit the ages that apply.  There is time and space to do this.</P>
        <P>One of first things the Government did on taking office was to appoint a Minister specifically for children, which was quite a radical action and decision.  It means there is a specific Government Department that has the job of examining this issue and working on the provision of pre and after school care.  In the 1960s this country went successfully for the expansion of secondary education.  In the 1970s, it went for the expansion of technical education and the development of the institutes of technology on the then advice of the OECD, while in the 1990s the country went for the expansion of university and college education.  The first ever early start programme in schools began in 1995 and 1996 in an effort to have structured primary preschools.  The country and its administrations have a substantial history of education expansions and initiatives.  Also, a decision was made to convert the &euro;1,000 early years payment to a preschool payment and I publicly supported that at the time.  I do not know whether everybody in the Labour Party did so but I strongly supported it.  As we  reflect on what happened during the Celtic tiger years, as a country we probably put too much money into direct cash payments without any condition of parents having to do something in regard to them, whereas other countries put more emphasis on services in particular.  It is doubtful how much extra cash someone with a special needs child requires to buy them some of the items their child needs, but what they do need are services as well as income support.  There was a rush to do that here, especially in the Celtic tiger years, and it is something on which we must reflect to determine if there are better ways of spending the same amount of money while achieving better outcomes, although I know that kind of reform is difficult to bring about.</P>
        <P>The other factor for which I am the Minister responsible is the change in terms of supporting people to get back into education, training and work.  In that respect, all the employment support services formally in the remit of F&Aacute;S are now in the remit of the Department of Social Protection.  The budget for that is nearly &euro;1 billion.  We hear figures of &euro;1 billion or a round billion figure to do with the Department of Social Protection, but the total budget is almost &euro;1 billion, and that includes the back to education initiative.  There is a great deal of money in the system and if we can use our ingenuity I believe it is possible to make a significant breakthrough in the time span about which we are talking.</P>
        <P>We have established Pathways to Work in my Department and one of the critical aspects of it is that a case management approach is to be taken.  Clearly, it will be important that lone parents who come out of an exclusive loan parents type structure get the services of Pathways to Work through a case manager in terms of one on one counselling, advice and so on.  We have seen how that type of approach can work well in countries, particularly in France, Finland and Austria, in that it respects the dignity of the person while encouraging the person to get engaged.  Everyone is concerned that some children are especially affected by poverty or are at risk of poverty.  If we want to do something about that, is it simply an issue of more money or an issue of trying to introduce a series of reforms and change of approach that will help people become more financially independent?</P>
        <P>In that respect, I asked my staff to get the statistics on a range of countries.  Germany, Italy, Sweden and Norway have different systems but ones that are well recognised as caring about children.  The work obligation in those countries is when the youngest child reaches the age of three, and their systems would not be regarded in any way as neglectful of their children.  In Finland it is when the youngest child reaches the age of four.  In the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand, and many Irish people have been in Australia and New Zealand, the work obligation is when the youngest child reaches the age of five.  In Canada it is when the youngest child reaches the age of six.  Senator Zappone probably knows more about the detail of that but I have friends in Canada parenting children on their own and I have been quite impressed by their system.  It is a tough system but it is also progressive in that it helps people get back to education because there seems to be a strong expectation that people should be encouraged to use their talents.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but they have a series of steps and obligations which are supportive, encouraging and expecting of people, which is a good mix.</P>
        <P>I say to my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in that the work obligation in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom is seven years of age.  When I was researching this issue I checked whether there was any indication in the North that Sinn F&eacute;in had expressed a problem with the age of seven being the work obligation age and I was unable to find it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Let me explain my reasoning.  The other problem I have, and I have discussed it with various Members of this House at different stages, is the dreadful history here in terms of what happened to the children of women parenting on their own.  The late Frank Cluskey, the former Labour Party leader and Minister, changed that forever when he brought in allowances for mothers who were unmarried, separated or deserted.  That was in the early 1970s.  Time has passed, however, and we are now supporting the children of lone parents, and lone parents themselves, but in terms of the terminology used, can we not get back to describing them as parents and children without stereotyping both the parents and the children?</P>
        <P>One of the reasons many of the countries I mentioned have a work obligation when the child is at a younger age is because there is intense support when the child is very young and they do not carry the type of stereotyping seen elsewhere.  Teachers do not say that many of the children in their classes are the children of lone parents as if somehow or other they might be lesser children.  Do we need to have that categorisation, which is only in social welfare, for a very long period of the child&rsquo;s life?  It is nothing to do with what happens for the rest of the parent&rsquo;s life or the child&rsquo;s life.  It is just a social welfare categorisation.  I do not know why we cannot all be described as parents and children.  I do not like the separation in terms of the way we describe them.  It would be better if we could bring that categorisation to an end earlier in the child&rsquo;s life.  I see some Members shaking their heads.  Many married parents who are either not working or on low incomes are also contributors.  Their children require support.  The argument I am making to the Senators is that we should see these people as children and parents.  I hope the day comes when the Department of Social Protection will not be terribly interested in the complexities of people&rsquo;s private relationships as a critical issue in regard to social welfare, but that day is some way off.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone referred to the disregard.  The disregard for one person in a couple who goes out to work is &euro;60.  After the reduction, the disregard in regard to a lone parent is &euro;130.  I believe we would all say that some elements of the systems in the countries I mentioned are worth examining because their systems are quite good.  In terms of the reason they have opted for an earlier age on the work obligation, I believe it is because there is a great deal of support for someone on their own with a baby.  It is tough going for anyone with a baby, even if they have a good deal of support, but on their own, as was said by a Senator, it is very tough.  We must examine this area again, recognise the achievements Ireland has made in changing many areas and decide there is another set of achievements we can now work towards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mentioned that I had come from my constituency this morning.  My constituency is probably the most diverse in the country.  Approximately 25% of the population, and this would be the same in Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s constituency, would not have been born in Ireland.  However, the most recent statistics indicate the average duration of a one-parent family payment is 6.1 years.  While I believe Senator Mooney mentioned a figure of 92,000 lone parents, that number only pertains to those lone parents who received a social welfare income support.  Tens of thousands of other lone parents do not look at all for support from social welfare payments because they are working or have other direct forms of support.  One reason for there being tens of thousands of such parents is that in general, those lone parents remained closely connected to education, training and employment and therefore either did not need the support of a one-parent family payment at all or only needed it for a short time.  The average duration of the one-parent family payment is three years for those claimants aged 25 or younger.  This is because those younger people tend to stay closer to education and training and thus to work, whereas older lone parents, whose children tend to be older and are ageing, tend to have the longest period in receipt of the payment.  Again, if one considers the research published yesterday, this is because people do not go back to education and ultimately do not return to work.  At present, 82% of one-parent families are Irish and approximately 18% of payments are made to non-Irish people, that is, people who came into this country.</P>
        <P>While I greatly respect the comments of all Members, I personally am convinced that lone parents must be given much better opportunities in respect of education and training.  In addition, the issue of the diversity of people&rsquo;s lifestyles and the diversity of people&rsquo;s relationships must be considered.  The younger years must be emphasised, as is the case in all the other aforementioned countries, and one must then ensure people really have an incentive to return to education and training and thus into employment and to financial independence.  I repeat all the research indicates that being in families that are financially independent is of tremendous benefit to children and is a good predictor of such children&rsquo;s ability ultimately to become financially independent.  I agree with the points made by Senator Healy Eames.  While I may use the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo;, I absolutely include self-employment in this regard.  When speaking to women in business, for instance, the number of women who are parenting on their own but who are making great strides in setting up their own businesses is quite striking.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  According to the order I have to hand, I will call Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Byrne, Zappone and van Turnhout.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to respond because the Minister has raised some important points.  I agree with her on the question she raised about the relationship between parent and child because one point made by single parents concerns the need for them to act as role models.  When growing up, it is important for children to see their parents being actively engaged in employment, getting education, bettering themselves and so on.  However, lone parents have stated that on foot of the measures the Minister proposes to put in place in this legislation, they will no longer be able to go out to work when the child reaches seven years of age and some will be obliged to give up their part-time jobs.  When the children concerned perceive that their parents are no longer able to go to work, what kind of mentality will this create in their minds?  It is important to the parent that he or she is able to go out to work and it is important to the children to see such parents being actively engaged and being in a position to be able to go out to work.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister stated there are minimal savings to be made in this scheme.  She spoke of how previous Ministers have had a greater vision, which they brought to the people and put in place and how that has worked.  In this context, I do not believe people can perceive such a bigger vision behind this measure, even though the Minister is attempting to present it as such to Members.  People are not buying into it and do not perceive the measure as being part of a greater vision.  Therefore, I seek clarification as to the research on which this decision was based.  I note no consultation process took place with those groups that had been consulted in previous years, such as Open, Barnardos and so on.  Who was consulted?  Did the civil servants produce a report for the Minister in which it was stated she was required to make X amount in savings and which then provided her with a number of options?  The amendment specifically refers to putting back this decision for a number of years and Members should consider what must be done if the savings are only minimal.  Given the type of debate Members are having today, I consider this to be an ill-judged decision and different options should be considered.  Were other options presented to the Minister by her civil servants?  Alternatively, was this decision made by the Cabinet and, if so, was the Minister under pressure from her colleagues in Fine Gael because apparently, the Labour Party is not in favour of this measure?  It is important to ask what is the rationale for the decision.  The Minister has stated it pertains to getting lone parents back into employment.  It is not about saving money because the Minister has indicated the savings will be minimal and she should set out precisely what are the envisaged savings.  On the other side of this issue, the lone parents&rsquo; advocacy groups have stated lone parents will lose their jobs because of this measure.  They have stated those lone parents who are in part-time positions at present will be obliged to give them up because they were not able to afford the differential cost for the child care.  As this means there will be a loss of revenue, has such lost revenue been taken into account in respect of this model?  I do not believe great savings will be made from this measure but it is causing a great amount of upheaval among lone parents.  One must consider what are the other options and whether there is a better way to save the money the Minister intends to save.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>While I will not go back over the points I already have raised, I asked the Minister a couple of specific questions.  I specifically asked whether she would give a commitment to Members today that there will be no changes to the free preschool year during the term of the present Government.  In her response to Members, the Minister mentioned how many other jurisdictions withdraw lone parent payments much earlier in the life of a child.  While that is fine, the Minister mentioned this point on the basis of those child care supports that already are in place.  I refer to her statement in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last week that she would not implement these changes to lone parent payments until she perceived that adequate, sustainable child care facilities were in place, particularly for lone parents.  While she put it up to her Cabinet colleagues in this regard, those words now ring desperately hollow on the basis of her response in this Chamber.  If this Bill is passed on Monday, it will bring into effect these changes from 3 May, regardless of whether she likes it or not.  Put simply, the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il last week that she would not implement this measure and put it up to her Government colleagues to bring forward sustainable, viable and affordable child care.  However, she has confirmed in her response today that 170 families, which I acknowledge to be a small number, will be affected by these changes next year and that this number will increase further.  New lone parents also will be affected by these changes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Not until the child is seven.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>However, in the instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It will take effect from two to three years hence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, in the instance of legal separations, divorces, bereavement and so on, this measure also will affect people.  Consequently, I cannot reconcile the Minister&rsquo;s comments that she does not wish to proceed with these changes unless child care alternatives are in place with the fact this legislation will be passed next Monday and will take effect from 3 May.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, now holds a senior Cabinet position, rightly so.  The previous Government did have what is known as a super junior Minister for children at the Cabinet table who had his own budget and introduced the final stages of the free preschool year.  When is the Government proposing to report back on child care alternatives?  The Minister said she will not implement this without the provision of additional child care.  What date has she set in her mind as to when the Government will propose these additional places?</P>
        <P>We have effectively confirmed here today that these changes happen from 3 May.  What the Minister said in the D&aacute;il when she introduced the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened intently to the Minister&rsquo;s responses.  I know what changes were made.  It was brought down to 14 years of age from 22 of years and put out further to 2016.  There was no proposal to bring it down to seven years of age in the time proposed by the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  It was stated clearly that the move of the one-parent family payment from age 22 in full-time education to 14 years of age would be on a phased basis to 2016.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposals are different.  Clearly she does not like them.  I understand that because I do not like them and any right and fair-minded individual would not like to be bringing forward these changes.  How can she tell me she is not going to implement these changes without adequate child care in place?  When the Minister was under pressure in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Social Protection has made section 4 conditional on the provision of affordable and sustainable child care.  She effectively said she believes the age is too young.  How is that going to happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a timetable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister proposed a timetable even though she claimed age seven is too young.  All the changes the Minister proposed in the D&aacute;il last week will be implemented with effect from 3 May.  There is no get-out clause for the Minister.  There is no timetable set down to provide affordable and sustainable child care which the Minister has asked her Cabinet colleagues to do.  She mentioned other jurisdictions which removed the payments at a much younger age but have different child care provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question I asked at the start is probably the easiest to answer.  Will the Minister give a commitment today that there will be no change to the free preschool year in the Government&rsquo;s term?  If the Minister is bringing forward these changes, it is crucially important the Government gives a commitment, at the very least, that the system that is in place for the free preschool year stays.  For all the bluster last week in the D&aacute;il by the Minister claiming she did not like introducing section 4 as it is a terrible measure, which it is, there is no get-out caveat and it is not conditional on any provision of additional child care.  She put it up to her Cabinet colleagues to say she would not implement these changes.  However, she in fact has effectively introduced them.  What was said last week was wholly incorrect.  Section 4 comes into operation on 3 May 2012 with no other plans to make life easier for lone parents.  Last week the Minister, who was under ferocious pressure, tried to wash her hands of some of the most unpalatable and significant changes that have been made to lone-parent allowances for as long as I can remember.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister in what was an excellent exposition of general policy in this area has not addressed or given her view on the amendment.  I know that is a matter for the Cathaoirleach.  Our amendment sets out what the Minister set out in the D&aacute;il last week.  It offers the chance to copperfasten for those children and parents exactly what was said by the Minister last week in the D&aacute;il.  Is she serious about it or is it just a get-out clause due to political pressure?  Is this just going to be a fight with Fine Gael and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, with the children and parents used as pawns in this political game?  The Minister said something in the D&aacute;il.  We are now saying it should be enacted.  If she does put it into the legislation, she will find much of this debate will be over and done with.  I urge the Minister to support amendment No. 4 and put into legislation what she said she would do last week.  Alternatively, will the Minister tell us why this amendment cannot be accepted in the legislation?  That has not been explained at all so far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>Echoing what Senator Byrne has just said, I do not believe the Minister has adequately addressed the amendment <i>per se</i> or explained why she will not put into law what she promised in the D&aacute;il.  In her responses so far, is the Minister claiming this will not affect many lone parents for the next several years and, therefore, it does not need to be put in the legislation?  We would like if she addressed why she is not accepting this amendment which is giving a certain time, is a compromise and acknowledges her vision, commitment and great ambition in this area.</P>
        <P>In her response and in the D&aacute;il last week, the Minister referred to the importance of education and training, as well as providing work opportunities for lone parents.  She quoted the ESRI research on children at risk of poverty which states the most critical issue is the education level of the mother.  In her last response, she stated younger lone parents tend to stay closer to education than older parents.  From my experience with An Cos&aacute;n, an organisation that runs young women&rsquo;s education programmes for lone parents for several years, it appears there is a contradiction in policy or the Minister&rsquo;s ambition.  An Cos&aacute;n&rsquo;s programme was for two years and targeted young lone parents in the 18 to 23 year age group who were usually early school leavers.  Over the eight years it was developed and delivered, it demonstrated a range of positive measurable outcomes.  It also supported international research that highlighted there are better outcomes for all by having earlier and more active interventions with one-parent families.  The programme cost &euro;75,000 with &euro;40,000 on the actual course and &euro;35,000 for the early years education and care for the children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the past year, however, with the Department&rsquo;s Stepping Up programme being implemented, An Cos&aacute;n was informed its programme could no longer run and that it is now Government policy to support older lone parents whose children are of school going age and are better placed to access education and training programmes.  Effectively, we ended this programme for young lone parents and initiated one for older lone parents.  That is the exact experience of a community education organisation that integrates education and training for lone parents with early years education and care for their children.  This is a roadblock to some of the Minister&rsquo;s commitments and vision that she outlined here this afternoon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>There are better ways of spending the same money and getting better outcomes.</P>
        <P>Many countries have been cited.  A country I know well, the Netherlands, has policies designed for all children.  My sister-in-law, who has an 11 year old and an eight year old, has wrap-around services and flexible working arrangements.  A Dutch person will say he or she works 80% time or 40% time.  We do not have that.  I can go through all those countries and give examples, but our time here is precious today.  We need to compare like with like.  We should be debating this and I will happily debate it, but today is about the proposals before us.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated we can do it on child care.  There is no doubt we can, but it takes time and we must do it right.  That is why we tabled this amendment.  It is to give us some, although not enough, time.  I outlined, both on Second Stage and previously in this debate, some of the challenges that will be faced.  I will not repeat them.</P>
        <P>It seems from this debate as though the 90,000 recipients of the one-parent support payment are sitting at home.  Some 80% of them are in either employment or education.  It is not that they are merely sitting at home waiting for the payment cheque.  It is not that they are all of a sudden going to move.  There is something creeping into the debate and I would fear that.  They are trying to find alternatives but, between child care arrangements and running between X and Y, there is no flexibility in the job market.  There is not necessarily even flexibility in the training for these parents.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister specifically to address the amendment we have moved.  Lone parent organisations were sitting around the table with the Department, ready to discuss reform and, effectively, the rug was pulled out from under them.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated the measure in the Bill affects a limited number, but the numbers will increase.  As far as I am concerned, it still affects parents and children.  Whether it is limited or extended, the effect will gradually snowball.  It affects people.  It is a serious matter and I want the Minister to address the amendment that we have moved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Regardless of whether we like it, the debate has strayed into section 4 on this matter.  Senator Mooney&rsquo;s amendment states: &ldquo;a statutory scheme of free comprehensive childcare available to all children shall be put in place&rdquo;.  We never mentioned free child care; we stated affordable child care.  Child care must be available for all.  When child care is put in place, everyone, including those working and on good incomes, can avail of it.  Why is Senator Mooney&rsquo;s amendment looking for free child care for everyone?  That is what got us into this mess &mdash; giving out free services all over the place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about child care in general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on our third hour on this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>After-school child care facilities is probably mostly what we are referring to here, not preschool, because at preschool the children are under seven.  There is no obligation for the parent to work during the preschool year.  It is after-school child care facilities for which I would be fighting much harder because that is when the parents have an obligation to work.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I should wait until section 4.  These matters are spilling over into each other.  There is an elephant in the room that no one has mentioned, which is the fact that it takes two make a baby and there is a second parent.  We should be going after those to help support their children.  One may argue as much as one likes, but I have dealt day in, day out with young girls who must go through the courts looking for maintenance.  Their partners are in arrears and threatened with jail, and they still cannot get the money out of them.  We should be looking at going after the other partner for help and support.  I suppose I am straying into section 4 and I will hold back my comments on that.</P>
        <P>That is my comment on the amendment by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Unfortunately, it is probably worded wrongly by them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>For some of the lone parents who might be affected in the next two years and who will be, I am sure the Senators will appreciate, small in number, because most of those who become lone parents do so by virtue of having a baby and, therefore, one would be talking about seven years, the conditions of the scheme for claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s payment include that a person must be available for full-time work or availing of an approved training or educational opportunity.  I stress that the jobseeker&rsquo;s guidelines provide for a person&rsquo;s family circumstances to be taken into account specifically.  For example, it may be unreasonable for a person with certain family responsibilities to seek work that involves a considerable amount of time travelling to and from work.  Accordingly, it is considered that the jobseeker&rsquo;s scheme guidelines are flexible enough to meet the requirements of parents.  However, I will keep this under review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senators will probably be aware, we have facilitators as a service in social welfare offices specifically assisting persons, both men and women, on specific requirements they may have to help to get them activated into a course or whatever.  Under the Pathways to Work programme, that kind of provision will expand a great deal because as well as taking in the F&Aacute;S staff, we have also taken in the local employment services.  Like the facilitators attached to local social welfare offices, the local employment service staff specialise in one-to-one assistance to help persons specifically overcome a difficulty, special qualification or other requirement to access employment.  I stress that this change I am proposing is taking place on a graduated basis in the context of the Pathways to Work programme being rolled out as well.  I appreciate it is a considerable change.  Its purpose is to create more opportunity and options for more people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To refer again to the IMF programme and the deal Fianna F&aacute;il struck with the fund, the core criticism of the IMF of the social welfare system was its passivity, that persons could go into the social welfare system and be left there for a long period of time.  Therefore, there has been a requirement from the troika.  The troika, especially the IMF, has discussed this in positive terms.  Looked at another way, were one an economist one would say this is a large resource of people in a country for whom we should be providing work opportunities.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I promise not to stray into the referendum, but let me say this.  In the treaty there is a description of structural deficits.  One thinks of structural deficits in terms of money, but structural deficits are probably better thought of in terms of the capacity of an economy to grow economic activity.  For instance, one changes one&rsquo;s structural deficit by strengthening one&rsquo;s structure.  One removes barriers to persons doing business or getting back to work and one invests in innovation and education.  That is how one shrinks one&rsquo;s structural deficit.  In fairness, the troika is keen not only on lone parents but also on everybody of working age ultimately becoming, to use the term I dislike, &ldquo;activated&rdquo;.  I suppose it is friendly advice and counselling we are getting from the friends Fianna F&aacute;il brought into the country.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  These two areas are very important &mdash; social welfare payments for the present and pensions for the future.  The issue of pensions is not being debated sufficiently.  I appeal to the Minister that in the future separate legislation be published by the Department of Social Protection dealing with social welfare payments and pensions.  It is not good enough when we have shortened debates that a particular issue gets all of the interest groups excited, rightly so, while other issues are forgotten and there are many such issues on the social welfare side.  The issue of pensions deserves examination and study in its own right.  Therefore, it would be worth introducing separate legislation in the future dealing with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support that viewpoint and ask the Minister to provide some clarification.  In my Second Stage contribution I mentioned that I would also support the introduction of a separate Bill dealing with pensions, although I know this Bill deals with certain elements, including defined pensions and so on.  Earlier when the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, was in the House, I mentioned an EU directive to which successive Irish governments had failed to sign up.  It is essentially to provide insurance for those with private pensions.  In Britain there was the Maxwell <i>v.</i> Robbins case and the British Government was brought to court.  Ironically, at the time the Irish Government supported the British Government&rsquo;s position.  The British Government lost that court case and had to put in place the terms of the directive, the purpose of which was to ensure all pension companies took out insurance to protect pension contributions in order that at least 60% of what a person had contributed to a pension scheme would be covered.</P>
        <P>Pension funds sometimes collapse because of falls in the stock market and, to a lesser extent, the bond market.  A case in point is that of Waterford Crystal.  Many likened these private pension funds to Ponzi schemes.  Some former workers who were the first in and had others behind them to keep the pension fund pot topped up had their pensions guaranteed and were being paid in full.  However, when the company finally closed, many workers were left without a pension, despite having paid into a pension scheme for 20 or 30 years.  The company made a contribution on behalf of these workers, yet they were left without a pension.  I am sure the Minister would have sympathised with them at the time and would still do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that the UNITE trade union is taking an action against the Government in the commercial court.  It simply wants the Government to implement the terms of the directive.  For me, it makes perfect sense that we do not end up with workers being left without pensions having made contributions.  I do not believe people would mind making a slightly higher contribution if it meant having a safeguard in place in the event that the pension fund went belly up such that they would receive, for example, at least 60% of their pension entitlement rather than being left high and dry as happened to many Waterford Crystal workers.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware of the European directive?  Is she aware of the court case being taken by the UNITE trade union?  Is she aware of any plans by the Government to implement the terms of the directive to ensure we safeguard private pensions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I understood the Bill was to contain a larger pensions section to deal with the deprioritising of annuitants or pensions in payment.  That would have dealt with the issue raised by Senator David Cullinane about people in receipt of pensions and in a scheme that was underfunded.  Workers contributing to a scheme are the last ones to know, as is the case with retained benefit annuitants who have left their money in the scheme but who are no longer working for the company and not yet retired.  I understand the Department did considerable work to deal with that complex issue and I am sure there are people on both sides of this argument.  Does the Minister propose to introduce further pension legislation in the short term to deal with the issue which I understood was originally to have been dealt with in this Bill?  The Government will need to review this area.  It will be considerably more complex because there are very serious issues involved for people who are retired and might be 75 or 80 years old and unable to earn further income.  Deprioritising would result in significant decreases in their private pension payments.</P>
        <P>The Government is considering introducing legislation providing for the winding down of underfunded defined benefit pension schemes, many of them commercial semi-State body schemes in companies such as Aer Lingus, many of whose workers live in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency and mine.  I understood the Minister would introduce measures to cover private defined benefit schemes in the private and commercial semi-State sectors as part of the Bill.  It is fine if this is not the case but I ask the Minister to tell me when it will be done.  I proposed an amendment, which was ruled out of order for being a tax matter, which would have allowed early access to tax-free cash for funded schemes.  My party intends to bring forward legislation in this regard.  As Senators Byrne and Cullinane have stated, pensions form a huge part of the Minister&rsquo;s portfolio and it is the ticking timebomb with which we are all trying to deal.  Will the Minister bring forward separate pensions legislation in this session or this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The matters raised by Senator Cullinane are very important but as they are before the courts at present it is not appropriate for me to comment on them.</P>
        <P>With regard to the pension matters dealt with here, as I stated in my opening comments on Second Stage the previous Government suspended the funding standard in 2008.  With regard to defined benefit schemes, consistent and serial expressions of hope have been expressed that the market will turn around.  Unfortunately for the hundreds of thousands of people contributing to these very important schemes the turmoil in the markets has meant this has not happened.  I have spent much time examining the difficulties with defined benefit schemes because they are so important.  As the Senators pointed out, there are three categories of interested parties, namely, those who have retired and are beneficiaries of the schemes; those who are deferred members because they have moved to a different employment and their entitlement will not arise until they come to pension age; and current contributory members.  As was outlined, people are fearful of their ultimate entitlement.  As I stated, most of the schemes are now closed to new entrants therefore their profiles are inevitably ageing.  The Bill deals with a series of amendments which I felt were important to introduce.  With regard to the issue Senator O&rsquo;Brien raised, the matter is being examined in great detail by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office because it involves serious issues with regard to various property rights.</P>
        <P>There was an option to postpone all of these changes until everything was ready but to me it seemed too long a timeframe.  Therefore, I decided at least to address these particular changes which would give more certainty to trustees.  The Department has done much work with the NTMA, as has the pensions regulator, to provide for the development of an annuity product suitable to the Irish situation.  At present the annuity products are generally German bonds and their cost is very high while, because of the situation with regard to interest rates, their return is very low.  The NTMA has been involved in detailed discussions to prepare a product.  I understand a number of providers may be interested.  Again, much depends on settlement in the markets to a reasonable level of stability.  It is a bit like the treaty; it is all about stability as opposed to turmoil.</P>
        <P>With regard to people accessing their pension funds I will not give the Senator a detailed answer now except to say significant tax issues arise because many pension funds involve significant tax considerations on entry, including tax breaks, and a condition of many products involves tax issues on exit.  This has been more of an issue for the Department of Finance and is seen as such because of the related tax issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 3 relates to a significant increase in the contribution period allowed, from 260 to 520 contribution weeks, to qualify for the contributory State pension, particularly for voluntary contributions.  In the national pensions framework 2010 we proposed to replace the average contribution period, but the fundamental problem here is that the contributory requirements have been doubled in a very short period of time.  If my reading of this is correct it will be introduced in April 2013, which means there will be no time for people to make up a deficit because between now and then the maximum number of contributions that can be made is 52.  Anyone far short of the mark will lose out on what they thought they would receive.  In the main we are speaking about people who are 66 years of age or will soon reach their 66th birthday.</P>
        <P>These changes in eligibility conditions are very wide off the mark and are being introduced seven years earlier than was proposed previously.  In the national pensions framework 2010 it had been decided a new regime would come into place in 2020 because, according to the introduction of that document, the introduction of total contributions approach at this stage would see a reduction in the levels at which pensions are paid immediately.  This is why it was not done in the pensions framework 2010.  The previous Government decided a new regime would be put in place, but not until 2020 to allow those making voluntary contributions time to increase the level of those contributions.  As the Minister knows, many of these people worked at home to rear families and had breaks in their employment.  This will also make it difficult for people who 20 years ago may have worked as a student and then left the workforce before returning after finishing their education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a very significant change and I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s rationale for it.  From my reading of it, the Minister is, although not necessarily going against the Pensions Framework 2010, expediting the changes envisaged therein seven years earlier.  How many people will be affected by this change in the short term?  Section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) provides that in the case of a person who becomes a voluntary contributor paid contributions prior to 6 April 2013 shall be 520 rather than 260, which is a significant change in terms of eligibility.  I would like to know what savings the Minister expects to achieve as a result of this measure and why there is such a hurry to make this change.  I believe this change is being made under the radar and that people will not realise the significance of it until they apply for their expected entitlements.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that this section relates to contribution requirements, which are being brought into line with those in respect of the old age pension, namely, a person must have paid 520 paid contributions before becoming a voluntary contributor.  Most people have 50 years within which to make social contributions.  The requirement now is that ten of the contributions made during those 50 years would be paid contributions, following which the person may make voluntary contributions.  Very few people actually make voluntary contributions because if sick they would be on disability and entitled to a credit contribution and if they become unemployed would also be entitled to a credit contribution.</P>
        <P>A case brought to my attention was that of a woman who ran a bed and breakfast for a number of years who, when she retired owing to old age, despite having paid her self employed contributions, had not reached the yearly average and could not in order to obtain credits sign on for unemployment benefit as her husband was working opted to make voluntary contributions.  We now have home-makers&rsquo; and carers&rsquo; credits.  Few people will be availing of the voluntary contribution provision.  As I understand it, the requirement is that during the period when a person must make contributions at least ten of those contributions must be paid contributions.  This has nothing to do with yearly averages and so on rather it relates to paid contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding of this section is similar to that of Senator Moloney.  The section provides for the phased introduction from April 2013 to April 2015 of an increase in the number of contributions which a person must make prior to becoming a voluntary contributor.  However, I have difficulty with the logic of this provision.  The problem is that we are on the one hand making it more difficult for people to claim and on the other are requiring people to work for longer periods in order to make a claim.  The problem for many workers is that the thresholds are increasing and it is difficult for them to find employment.  This means some people will not have sufficient credits and will lose out.  Perhaps the Minister will explain the logic and reasoning behind why now, of all times, when people are through no fault of their own losing their jobs and finding it difficult to get employment, we are asking them to increase their contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>This provision provides that people who within one, two or three years will be retiring and do not have the 520 contributions required, will be able to top up their contributions.  Am I correct that only contributions made up to when the person reached 65 years will be reckonable and that a person will retire at age 65 years but will not be entitled to the pension until 66 years of age? </P>
        <P>I am seeking clarity on whether contributions made up to when the person reaches 65 rather than 66 years will be reckonable and whether a person within, say, 18 months of retirement, who has not averaged out 100% in respect of the contributory pension, will be able to make up that shortfall.  I am speaking about a person who has worked all his or her life but is, owing to this change, short on contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>A person who has worked all his or her life would have enough contributions.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s view on the unusual case of two women, twins, who on reaching 65 years qualified for the transition pension prior to getting the contributory pension, one of whom fell ill and was late making her application and is now being pushed into the another category in respect of which she does not have the required number of contributions, which is most unfair.  This matter has been the subject of correspondence with the Department for the past four months.  Surely, an allowance can be made for a later application due to illness.  The twin sister of the woman concerned has qualified for her pension.  It is outrageous that the two sisters, regardless of the late application, are being treated differently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They must have different histories.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>No, they do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The voluntary contribution, VC, scheme is open to people under 66 years of age who are no longer compulsorily insured, namely, they have ceased to be an employed or self employed contributor and do not have an entitlement to credited contributions.  As stated by Senator Moloney, there is widespread entitlement nowadays to different types of credited contributions but people do not always apply for them.  Perhaps there is an issue in that regard in respect of the twin sisters to whom Senator Healy Eames refers.  However, I do not know the circumstances of the case and cannot comment on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue that arises is in respect of the late application.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Application to become a voluntary contributor must be made within one year of the last paid or credited contribution, which is possibly where the woman concerned had the problem.  Historically, the entry requirements in terms of minimum number of paid contributions for the VC scheme has always matched the paid contributions requirement for State pension contributory.  The purpose of the VC scheme is to protect the pension entitlements of those who have already satisfied this first condition for State pension contributory by maintaining or in some cases improving the yearly average number of contributions.  The voluntary contributions are, therefore, reckonable towards the State pension contributory.</P>
        <P>The scheme is aimed at ensuring that individuals who leave the workforce prior to pension age and have already established a future entitlement to the contributory State pension upon reaching retirement age can maintain their social insurance record by paying voluntary contributions in the intervening period.  Legislation enacted in 1997 provided for an increase in the minimum number of paid contributions required for the State pension contribution to 520 in respect of applicants who reach pension age on or after 6 April 2012.  This dates back a long time.  Accordingly, an increase in the minimum number of paid contributions for access to the voluntary contribution is required.  Failure to increase the entry requirement for the VC scheme would mean that individuals who fell short of the 520 paid contribution conditions for SPC purposes could make up any shortfall by the payment of voluntary contributions.  This would undermine the rationale behind the changes to the SPC requirements and limit the effectiveness of the increase in the number of SPC paid contributions by impacting negatively on the cost savings arising from the change.  Furthermore, it would be anomalous that the option to pay voluntary contributions could not be availed of by those in receipt of credits because of an underlying social welfare entitlement.</P>
        <P>The increased contributions will be phased in in the period from April 2013 to April 2015 as follows: up to April 2013, there will be 260 contributions.  From April 2013 this will change to 364 contributions; in April 2014 to 468 contributions, and in April 2015 and beyond to 520 contributions.  The necessary phasing in provision is being provided for.  There are 3,200 voluntary contributors, of whom 75% or 2,400 are former self-employed individuals, with the balance of 800 being made up by those living overseas or former modified rate contributors.  Based on the profile of those who have applied to access the scheme in the past three years, it is estimated that the increase in 2013 to 364 contributions will potentially affect 100 people, that the increase in 2014 to 468 contributions will affect a similar number, and that the increase in 2015 to 520 contributions will have little or no impact on any number of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, if somebody is in his or her 65th year and discovers that the commencement date of employment does not allow the full number of contributions to be made, he or she will fall short and not be entitled to receive 100% of the contributory pension but 85% or 90% of it.  I hope we are talking about the same issue.  In the context of contributions made since the commencement of work, is the proposed extension to kick in from April, or is it something separate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that is a separate issue.</P>

        <P Just="Left">We did not cover one point during the previous discussion. All the points we made previously about section 1 are still valid.  We have not yet bought into the Minister&rsquo;s arguments.  Even if we take on board the arguments the Minister made and if the legislation is introduced, it will create an unfair situation for newcomers.  All other things being equal, where two lone parents with eight-year-old children are living next door to each other, the parent under the old regime will retain entitlements while the other parent, who becomes a lone parent through bereavement or a separation from a partner, will have very different circumstances.  The Government is following the austerity plan introduced by the previous Government under the troika.  People are finding it much harder to cope because of the extra costs such as household charges and water charges.  People&rsquo;s disposable incomes are much lower and reports from credit unions suggest people have less than &euro;100 for expenses.  My fear is that we will be in austerity for the next few years while this programme is rolled out.  This will mean cutbacks in the Government&rsquo;s budget and people will have to tighten their belts further.  New entrant lone parents will be in an even tighter situation but they will not receive the same support as their next-door neighbours.  There is an in-built inequality for newcomers, which is unfair.</P>
        <P>According to the Minister&rsquo;s clarification this morning, these measures will not save the State much money.  It is unfair that we have people in this situation and it is time to return to the drawing board.  It is time to scrap this measure.  Time should be taken to find savings in a different way.  The Minister said this is her grand idea.  Other Ministers in previous decades had grand ideas about reforming education and social welfare but no one else buys into this as a big idea that will be a radical reform and a new approach to activating employment for lone parents.  Sinn F&eacute;in is tabling this amendment because the measure is wrong and I hope the Minister takes on board our amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment.  Fianna F&aacute;il has withdrawn one amendment under this section.  My colleague, Senator Mooney, will resubmit an amendment on Report Stage.  I will not cover the ground we have discussed.  The Minister gave a commitment in the D&aacute;il that she would not implement the cut from 14 years of age to seven unless there were guarantees to provide adequate child care.  On 18 April, the Minister said, &ldquo;I entirely agree that seven is too young for anyone to seriously contemplate any of these things without there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place&rdquo;.  What the Minister said in the D&aacute;il rings hollow and has no basis in law or in fact.  This section comes into operation on 3 May 2012.  The Minister mentioned that savings are minimal but it amounts to &euro;112 million over three years.  With these changes, there will be a saving of &euro;20 million in 2012.  One in four families with children are one parent families.</P>
        <P>I agree with one aspect of the Minister&rsquo;s comments earlier in respect of how we define one parent families and the use of that phrase but &ldquo;one parent family&rdquo; is the phrase and categorisation we use.  Such categorisation is not acceptable in society and people do not treat children differently on the basis of whether they have one parent or two parents or on the basis of the make-up of their families.  It should not make a difference.  The payment from the State is crucial for children in families with one parent and who are struggling.  The cut is very significant.  As I mentioned in the debate on section 1 and as Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, we will create two tiers of children of lone parents on the basis of this policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister will not accept a compromise outlined in the amendment tabled by Senators Zappone and van Turnhout.  The amendment allowed for a three-year run-in but the Minister&rsquo;s measure is effective immediately.  The measure will have an immediate impact on 180 families.  Why are they different from the thousands of one parent families?  It is a ludicrous situation and I ask the Minister to give a commitment that there will be no change to the free preschool year in the term of this Government.  I have not received an answer to that point.  It is the only element of universal child care where the payment goes directly to the benefit of children.  We are being asked to pass legislation with a significant cut to one parent families.  The real effect is on children and these changes will force people onto jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  People working part-time have their incomes supplemented by the lone parent allowance.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is available to people.  What happens to someone who is working ten or 12 hours a week and in receipt of the lone parents payment?  If the child is now six, the payment will be removed in two years&rsquo; time.  In that case, will the parent give up part-time work and receive jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance?</P>
        <P>We are creating another tier of children in this country through the changes in section 4.  I cannot understand how the Minister can stand over what she said in the D&aacute;il.  It makes no sense.  The Minister says that she will not implement the changes.  Should I support section 4 on the basis of what she said, to the effect that it does not give effect to the changes in law now?  On 18 April, the Minister said, &ldquo;I entirely agree that seven is too young for anyone to seriously contemplate any of these things without there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place&rdquo;.  If we pass section 4, it gives effect to significant cuts in lone parent family payments with effect from 3 May.  Perhaps I am missing something.  How does the Minister marry what she said last week with the retention of section 4?  If the Minister responsible for this area did not want to implement the changes, she could have excluded the section.  She should put it up to her Government colleagues around the Cabinet table and say she will not include the section until she sees what will happen with regard to safe, accessible and affordable child care.  What is the point in retaining section 4?  Why did the Minister oppose the previous amendment, which would have allowed a three-year run-in?</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il will table an amendment on Report Stage.  It was seen as controversial for a senior Minister in Government to say that section 4 did not seem fair.  It seemed as if she was putting it up to her Government colleagues to provide the child care measures she wanted and that she would not implement the section if they did not do so.  If, by the end of the year, there is no new initiative to provide what the Minister says is safe, affordable and accessible child care, will she bring forward an amendment to remove section 4 of the Bill?  How will she deal with that issue?  This is crucially important because she sent a message from the D&aacute;il to the public that she was opposed to making this cut.  I am looking for clarification in the Seanad.  Will the Minister give me a commitment that there will be no change to the free preschool year provision during the term of office of the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  As I said earlier, if the compromise proposal had been accepted, I would have been willing to support the section.  I am disappointed we did not receive an answer to our compromise proposal; therefore, I support the amendment on three bases &mdash; the issue of child poverty; the employment proposals before us; and the lack of provision for child care and after school care.</P>
        <P>At the end of January 90,000 lone parents were in receipt of the one-parent family payment in respect of 149,000 children on whom I tried to focus in my Second Stage contribution because very often children are forgotten in this discussion.  One-parent families are the unit group in Irish society most at risk of poverty.  Children in one-parent families are poorer than other children.  This is not speculation; it is a fact, as we have been told repeatedly by the OECD, the CSO, the ESRI which the Minister quoted, Barnardos and the Children&rsquo;s Right Alliance, while other NGOs have also come out in support.</P>
        <P>When I spoke on the budget in December, I spoke at length about the cumulative impact of successive budget cuts on vulnerable families.  I stressed the hardship felt within a family was most acutely felt by the children and the concerns I raised then were not new.  They had been repeatedly raised in the context of budgetary measures, not only domestically but also by international observers.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage I quoted Magdalena Sep&uacute;lveda, the United Nations independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty, who had voiced these very concerns when she came to Ireland in January 2011.  She said children continued to be the group most at risk of poverty in Ireland, with families, in particular single parent families, struggling to provide food, appropriate housing, heating and decent winter clothing, and that the substantial cuts in child payments in recent budgets were of particular concern as they could exacerbate the situation of children and lead to an increase in child poverty rates, which were already worryingly high, and that this would represent a major step backwards for children&rsquo;s rights in Ireland.  She went on to list all of the measures included in budget 2011 and said their cumulative effect could have devastating consequences on children&rsquo;s standard of living and their capacity to escape from poverty.  We know this, yet the Government continues this regressive course of action.</P>
        <P>Another argument made today to justify the amendment concerned the need to break long-term welfare dependency and to get lone parents back into employment.  If none of the 90,000 lone parents in question is working, my first question is where are the 90,000 jobs for them to take up?  However, it is not necessary to ask this question because 80% of them are either working or in education or training.</P>
        <P>The age of seven years is too young.  The affordability and accessibility of child care services for lone parents is already a huge issue under the existing payment provisions.  When the baseline age limit of seven years is reached in 2014, what will the lone parents who are working and those who will be expected to take up employment do with their seven year old child?  On average, the primary school calendar extends to 183 days.  Seven, eight and nine year olds are in first, second and third class, respectively, and finish school at 2.30 p.m.  Most schools ask parents to drop off their child between 8.30 a.m. and 9 a.m.  There are not enough after school child care or affordable child care services available to cater for this need.  Lone parents must work around their children&rsquo;s schedules and work part time, say, four or five mornings a week.  More of them will end up unemployed in these circumstances as jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are not payable to those who work in this manner.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Minister has acknowledged that lone parents should not lose the one-parent family payment when their youngest child reaches the age of seven years unless there is a comprehensive system of Scandinavian-style child care in place.  I have made several arguments why we can do this but not in the timescale she proposes.  I have grave concerns about the viability of such comprehensive and affordable child care and after school services being delivered in the next three years.  A fully State subsidised child care and after school care system would need to be cemented in law and subject to consistent standards and regulations across all providers.  Investment in training and the professional development of those involved in the sector is key to the development of such a system.</P>
        <P>In the early childhood care and education sector salaries for what is being provided amount to &euro;320 million, with a further &euro;105 million being spent in the wider economy.  The sector employs 22,000 qualified professionals.  These are the numbers required to provide what is in place today.  As nobody has said what we have is perfect, we need to expand it, which would be some feat.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the capital grant provided for the child care sector; there was the awarding of a fund of &euro;6 million, for which requests worth more than &euro;60 million were received.  That is indicative of the need for more infrastructure and building improvements in the sector to meet current, not future needs.  There has been no significant investment in the development of after school care facilities and there continues to be a lack of information on the range of services provided across the country.  The development of a comprehensive system of child care and after school care must be based, first and foremost, on a child&rsquo;s developmental needs.</P>
        <P>The development of after school services will also need to involve schools.  In general, the take-up of such schemes in schools was low, even when funding was available.  Barnardos has voiced concerns that the Croke Park deal could provide a barrier to the establishment of comprehensive after school services by 2014 when the one-parent family payment scheme changes will take effect.</P>
        <P>Given these complexities and the current economic climate, it could take as many as ten years for the child care supports needed to be provided.  It is on that basis that I cannot support section 4 which should be withdrawn and reconsidered.  The Minister should reintroduce it when she has the wide range of measures required in place.  Most of us buy into and share her vision.  Reform involves doing things together and joined-up thinking.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider section 4.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In case Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh is confused, the only people who will be affected by this change in 2012 are those who are new to the lone parent structures.  Children over 12 years of age will be affected.  In 2013 children over ten years of age will be affected, and in 2014 children over seven years of age will be affected.</P>
        <P>In regard to persons who were lone parents in April last year, they will only be affected when they have a child of 17 years or older in 2013, a child of 16 years in 2014 and a child of seven years in 2015 and 2016.  For those who became lone parents from last April, the provision applies to a child over 14 years in 2012, over 12 years in 2013, over ten years in 2014 and over sevens in 2015 and 2016.  Long lead-in times have been explicitly provided for in the Bill.</P>
        <P>As I said, we are doing this alongside the National Employment and Entitlements Service which was launched some months ago and is being developed this year.  We are talking about a relatively small number of people who may end up in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in the interim period.  In that context, they will receive a personalised service in which their family circumstances will be taken into account.  The difficulty we have as a country &mdash; it may be difficult for people to accept this &mdash; is that we are spending over &euro;1 billion on lone parents.  Senator van Turnhout just reminded us that somebody from the UN said that the problem for Ireland is that despite that significant spend, the outcome is that the people still most at risk are the children of lone parents.  There are tens of thousands of lone parents who parent on their own who do not receive the one-parent family payment.  There are 92,000 parents on the one-parent family payment, but there are tens of thousands who are not, because they are in full-time employment, self-employed or business proprietors.  The children facing the greatest risk of ending up poor are the children whose mothers have low educational attainment and do not have the capacity to work or find employment.  What we must ask ourselves is whether there is a way of utilising the funds we have that would produce better outcomes for those children.  That is my objective.</P>
        <P>As I have said previously, Irish society has made significant expansions at different times and I do not see why we cannot set that as a goal and do it.  In my time in politics I have listened endlessly to people talking about child care and about expanding it.  I have seen wonderful initiatives and innovations and I am a particular admirer of the work Senator Zappone has done.  However, we need to think more ambitiously.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien is concerned that implies making demands, but politics is about deciding to make staged steps forward and expansions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened to the contributions made by the Sinn F&eacute;in Members.  Will they explain to me why there has not been a peep from them?  I know enough about child care in the North to know how good, bad or indifferent it is in various ways.  Sinn F&eacute;in should acknowledge that our unemployment, child benefit and almost all social welfare payments are significantly better than those north of the Border.  Our support and housing supplements are also significantly higher than north of the Border.  I have not heard a peep from Sinn F&eacute;in on these issues.  I have enough contact with the North to have a fairly detailed knowledge of the situation there.  Sinn F&eacute;in has no problems with far lower levels of social welfare in the North, where it is in government.  I know Sinn F&eacute;in will say the reason it does not raise this is that it does not control tax policy there and, therefore, cannot raise taxes in order to make higher social welfare payments.  If the age of seven is an acceptable cut-off point in the North for Sinn F&eacute;in, why does it see our moving in an ambitious way to achieve what would be an all-Ireland target as inappropriate?</P>
        <P>I do not know why the age of seven was chosen in the North or in the United Kingdom, but I can guess why because I know why it was chosen in other countries.  It has to do with the age at which there is good provision available for both preschool and after school care and when the child is well settled in the education system.  In the Scandinavian countries that is quite early.  In Italy and in France there are maternal schools for children of an early age because of the kind of developments made by people like Maria Montessori almost 100 years ago.  We know a little about traditions in different countries.</P>
        <P>We do not have a very strong preschool tradition in Ireland.  We had many radical women around the turn of the last century.  We had people like Louie Bennett who developed facilities for children, particularly here in the city.  That would have been the start of the equivalent movement in Ireland.  What I am asking, particularly Sinn F&eacute;in, is why it is okay to pay amounts so much lower in the North?  I am aware that some provisions are better there, but some are not as good as those here.  Why should we not look at getting better value for the large amount we are spending.  I said previously that there is not a very large saving in this.  The estimated saving this will yield is &euro;0.3 million in 2012, &euro;2 million in 2013, &euro;5.8 million in 2014 and &euro;11.9 million in 2015.  What will happen is that with the development of appropriate after-school services, money will be spent in a different way, as happened with the early childhood care.</P>
        <P>The ESRI report published yesterday, Understanding Childhood Deprivation in Ireland, is quite a tome of statistics based on the SILC 2009 data and study of 1,800 households with children.  The report found that children have a higher poverty risk than adults and those children are more likely to be in low income and jobless households, that poverty is especially detrimental for children, due to its long term effects that persist into adulthood and that an adequate income is the basic requirement to alleviate poverty.  It found that child and family income supports play a critical role in protecting children.  Furthermore, the mother&rsquo;s education, employment, especially of the mother, and family stability are important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These findings are a repetition of and consistent with everything I have read on this issue in the past 20 years.  Senator Zappone spoke earlier of the value of quality education and initiatives that would hold younger parents.  I was involved years ago in what was considered a radical move and has proved to be since.  This involved changing the social welfare rules.  When I was a Minister of State and Michael Woods was the senior Minister, we were involved in changing the rules so as to enable lone parents to stay in education.  In those days &mdash; the early 1990s &mdash; if lone parents wanted to get the allowance, they had to stay home and do nothing.  Now, we are just trying to change and to look at the countries we admire for their provision and care for children and considering making similar reforms.</P>
        <P>The requirement to develop child care, particularly after-school care, is demanding.  We have primary schools all around the country.  Many primary schools are in urban centres with significant community facilities attached to them, such as the one I was involved in opening today.  Surely, it is not beyond our capacity as a society to decide we will develop after school care facilities.  It is no longer simply a question of buildings.  In many cases it is a question of access to buildings.  Given the timeframe provided for in the Bill and given the changes happening with regard to Pathways to Work, I am confident we will be able to expand and develop in a way I hope will be hugely positive for lone parents who end up being confined to lone parent&rsquo;s allowance or to some small additional income rather than being full participants in terms of their capacity to become financially independent.</P>
