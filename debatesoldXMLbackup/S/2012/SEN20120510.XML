	<P>I have received notice from Senator David Cullinane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to discuss proposed increases in harbour charges at Dunmore East, County Waterford, and the impact it will have on the fishing industry and the tourism sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Martin Conway of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to facilitate the establishment of an archiving museum in the Department&rsquo;s vacant workhouse in Corofin, County Clare.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>I welcome the announcement today from Aviva that an additional 200 jobs are to be created in Galway and that fewer jobs will be cut than the numbers announced before Christmas.  In early autumn Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien was aware that there were some issues in Aviva.  He raised that issue many times and called on the Department, as I did, to engage directly with Aviva and all major employers in Ireland to ascertain if there were any issues that could be worked through to ensure we limited any potential need to scale down the numbers of jobs.  If that was done we can see the benefits now.  There was not a need for the scare-mongering that took place about some 950 jobs and the fear generated in families throughout the country about the loss of those jobs.  Notwithstanding that there will be job cuts, I welcome that those cuts will be minimised and the creation of additional jobs in Galway.  I ask the Deputy Leader that the Government would engage with all major employers on an annual basis through IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and that all possible actions are taken to ensure that at least the current employment levels are not only maintained but expanded upon.</P>
        <P>I ask for a debate as early as possible with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, on the issue of mental health funding.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has line responsibility in this area but I am concerned about the amount of the health budget being allocated to her.  In the mid-1980s, spending on mental health constituted 13% of the overall budget and it has consistently dropped since then to just 4.5%.  This week a number of the nursing organisations will hold their annual conferences, and psychiatric nurses are calling for an increase in this spend.  A total of 9% of the total health care workforce is in the mental health area but 20%, or 1,500, people in that workforce were lost through the moratorium.</P>
        <P>The silent crisis facing this country is suicide, which is touching many families in every corner of Ireland.  We must be prepared to highlight that crisis which effectively is wiping out the equivalent of the population of a small village on an annual basis.  If it was happening in Syria we would be sending in the United Nations.  If it was happening in Northern Ireland we would be calling for the UN to come here and take action against us.  Last year less than &euro;9 million was allocated for the prevention of suicide.  That is a piecemeal approach to what is a silent crisis and one about which we cannot do enough in the context of raising awareness of it.  We agree to the Order of Business but I ask that mental health funding be debated here, with the senior Minister present, within the next few weeks.  I reserve the right to call votes on that issue if it is not raised by the Deputy Leader.</P>
        <P>I commend the young people of Davis College, Summerhill, Mallow, on winning the Young Social Innovators award yesterday, which was presented by the President.  These projects deal with homelessness, mental health, poverty and so on but I particularly liked their winning project which was on raising awareness of missing people, and their campaign for a national day for missing people.  I ask the Deputy Leader to encourage those of us in this House to support that campaign because many people are cynical about that in the sense that when one is gone, one is gone.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I raise the issue of the chariot racing, which is an unusual description, that took place on the main Mallow-Cork road recently and ask the Deputy Leader to bring it to the attention of the appropriate Minister.  Chariot racing is a glorified name for it.  What occurred was far from what went on in the glorious days of the Roman Empire.  That was a popular sport, as portrayed in films like &ldquo;Gladiator&rdquo;.  I was concerned to hear somebody from Pavee Point make the case this morning that better facilities should be made available to Travellers for the sport that we know in west Cork as sulky racing.  For those Members who do not know what happened, last Saturday morning between 11 a.m. and 12 o&rsquo;clock, on one of the busiest roads in the country, the main Mallow to Cork road, which is also the main Limerick to Cork road, some people from the Traveller community, and this is admitted by Pavee Point, drove their horses and sulky cars or chariots, as someone called them &mdash; I would not call them chariots &mdash; up that main road against traffic causing mayhem.  Garda&iacute; were involved.  I am not sure whether there was drink or drugs involved in this incident but to do that in the middle of the day is crazy, and there is no excuse for somebody from Pavee Point saying that better facilities should be provided.  We have a sulky racing track in west Cork which is under-used.  Lack of facilities is no excuse in this regard.  What was done was madness and I want to condemn it in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>Many people in the constituency I represent have those sulky cars and there are byroads, culs-de-sac and lanes on which they can exercise their horses.  Cork County Council regularly closes roads to facilitate that type of racing to ensure there is no danger to the public.  It was a lame duck excuse from the Pavee Point representative that better facilities should be provided for the Traveller community because this is a minority sport.  It is a minority sport but it is not exclusive to the Traveller community, and what happened in Mallow should be condemned outright.  I do not accept that there is a lack of facilities in the Cork County Council area for such activities.  What happened was madness.  I am amazed by it.  It was like something one would see in the excerpts we get from Australia or America of unusual events that happen on motorways.  What happened must be condemned at the highest level and I hope it will never happen again.  It is beyond belief that someone was not killed or injured in that incident.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the InterTradeIreland seedcorn competition which is run every year by InterTradeIreland, the all-island organisation that supports innovative companies to come forward, particularly young people coming out of universities or companies that have an international look to their business.  They look for competitors across the provinces who initially participate in regional finals and then in the all-Ireland finals.  They have been excellent at attracting interesting and exciting projects in recent years.  They work closely with young companies and give them great support.</P>
        <P>On foot of the session we had here some months ago when we came together to discuss ideas, and we spoke about having such a session again, I ask the Deputy Leader if we could organise another such session and invite somebody from InterTradeIreland to attend because it has experience in talking to young entrepreneurs in particular across a wide range of areas, particularly in the areas of medical devices, food and so on.  It would be useful if they came into the House to add to our discussions.  It is worth acknowledging the work they do in encouraging us to encourage people with small companies we may have come across to participate because there is &euro;280,000 available from the seedcorn package they offer.  It is given out in tranches to the various winners, some of whom I have met.  I commend that to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the statement from President Obama that he supports gay marriage.  It is a significant move that the most powerful political leader in the world has endorsed that.  It is pleasing to note we have at least one leader who has a prophetic vision and is prepared to take a risk.  I was a little worried about President Obama but he has restored my faith.  I hope my faith will also be restored by the synod of the Anglican communion which will meet shortly.  It includes very conservative elements, as do the other churches, who seem to be making a move in their usual, behind-the-scenes manner.  I encourage the brave group which is changing attitudes in the church.  At least we, in the Anglican church, are having a debate, which is great.  While this may not be a problem of homophobia, there is certainly a widespread practice of ignoring issues.  I was ashamed to find when I raised the issue of 12 teenage boys who were castrated in a Catholic home in the Netherlands in the 1950s that no one other than Senator Cummins followed up on the issue.  We would have heard a great deal about it if it had involved female genital mutilation.  Why are we still despised in this manner?</P>
        <P>I would like to be positive and state it was wonderful to hear a Deputy discuss the fiscal treaty with Pat Kenny.  I use the term &ldquo;pig in the poke treaty&rdquo; to describe it because we are buying a pig in a poke.  If it keeps changing, it will probably turn out to be Joyce&rsquo;s old sow which eats her own farrow.  We simply do not know what we are voting on.  When I made a similar comment in the House some months ago it was not picked up by any journalist.  Things are picked up only when said in the other House.  Perhaps Deputies are listening to us.  Would it not be refreshing if the D&aacute;il were listening to the Seanad?  In that case, we could at least speak to the D&aacute;il.  This recalls the saying about the famous Lodges who spoke only to the Cabots who spoke only to God.  If Senators speak to the D&aacute;il, it will speak to the media for us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to reopen the nonsensical decision whereby it is purported to forbid the sharing of time on Second Stage.  From where did this decision come?  It landed on my desk without explanation.  As the Government parties know perfectly well, it is totally undemocratic.  The first thing the Government side did after making this rule was to break it, using the excuse that two Ministers were in attendance.  That scenario is not covered in any of the documentation I saw.  The Government used a fudge to get its own way.  I insist that this matter be reopened.  Let us have real democracy and allow Members to share time.  The House should rule its own business and inform the decisions of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Spokespersons have additional time and may not share it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The facility of sharing time has always been available to Senators.  It is a tradition of the House that should be retained.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach has been a Member of the House for almost as long as I have been here and he knows well Senators have traditionally shared time during Second Stage debates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not necessarily the case.</P>

	<P>Yes, we have always done so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is almost unprecedented for a Kerryman to be on O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin in May &mdash; we usually visit in September &mdash; but I had reason to be on the main thoroughfare of the capital last evening.  What I witnessed last night, between drunks, winos, people strung out on drugs and beggars, was shocking.  We are trying to sell a tourism product.  I met a couple from Australia who compared O&rsquo;Connell Street to the streets of another European city they had visited recently where the lady had a gold chain whipped from around her neck.  I was fearful walking up the street with a colleague at 9 p.m. last night.  There is a Garda station on O&rsquo;Connell Street and I saw garda&iacute; in the vicinity who did nothing to address the problem.  One could not travel 20 m. without meeting someone begging for money or strung out and lying on the footpath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a campaign to clean up the main street of our capital.  What I witnessed last night was shocking.  We need to clean up O&rsquo;Connell Street if we are to sell Dublin as a tourism product.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Next year, we will mark the centenary of the 1913 lockout.  In recent months and years, we have had a number of high profile cases of workers engaging in sit-ins to demand their just entitlements.  They included employees of Waterford Crystal and TalkTalk in my constituency, and Game and Vita Cortex elsewhere.  While some of these cases have been resolved, many of them have left a sour taste in the mouths of those who support worker and employment rights.  A small number of former employees of H. W. Wilson, which was taken over by the multinational company EBSCO Publishing, are seeking to have their rights vindicated.  The company is refusing to implement a Labour Court recommendation.  Similar circumstances pertain in CRH which is refusing to comply with a Labour Court recommendation and withholding the wages to which workers are entitled.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As we approach the centenary of the 1913 lockout, it is important that we do not commence 2013 without strengthening workers&rsquo; rights.  There is little point in any of us crying crocodile tears for workers who are suffering or being forced to engage in sit-ins and protests to secure their just entitlements.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to legislate to protect workers and enhance their rights and entitlements.  In addition to the high profile cases of which all of us are aware, there have been many cases outside the media spotlight involving workers in small businesses who are having their rights trampled on by unscrupulous employers.  While most employers are fair, legislation is needed to deal with the large number of them who are not fair.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on employment rights, including the right to collective bargaining and trade union recognition and, more important, the need to strengthen and enhance the rights of working people as we approach the anniversary of the Dublin lockout.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the third round of grant applications under the disabled access and energy upgrade scheme for local authority swimming pools.  Under the scheme, which is overseen by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Dundalk Town Council was allocated grants of &euro;192,000 and &euro;207,000 in 2011 and 2012, respectively, giving a total of &euro;400,000.  These moneys must be spent this year and will greatly enhance the magnificent facilities available to the many disabled people who use the town&rsquo;s swimming pool daily.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for arriving late for the Adjournment debate last night through my own fault.  I am grateful for every opportunity to raise a matter on the Adjournment debate which is one of the most important opportunities available to Senators to elicit information from Departments.  On that basis, I was disappointed to note that the Department of Education and Skills issued a factually incorrect reply when I raised schooling in Ashbourne during the Adjournment debate last week.  While I am not accusing the Minister of misleading the House, I am accusing his Department of not knowing what it is doing in respect of education in the commuter belt.  Given the various crises we have experienced in education in recent years, one would expect the Department to have learned a few lessons and know how to do things.  I was informed in the House last week that there would be seven junior infant classes in Ashbourne in September.  It came as news to the Minister when I informed him that there should be at least eight junior infant classes in the town in September.  This discrepancy caused considerable confusion on the ground in Ashbourne and as a result of the Seanad debate, the issue was covered on local radio.  On the programme in question, Deputy Regina Doherty of the Fine Gael Party agreed with my analysis of the position and expressed disappointment with the reply provided to me in the House.  When the local radio station sought a response from the Department, it became obvious that officials had listened to the discussion and were aware of the information I had provided because the Department&rsquo;s press statement differed from the information it provided in the Chamber last week.  I hope this does not mean officials treat the Seanad differently from the media.</P>
        <P>I hope it means that they listen to what I said in the Seanad last week and change their tack.  It is part of a continuous attack on the commuter belt by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  They do not know what they are doing in respect of education, and in County Meath they have just merged the two Garda districts in the commuter belt, namely, the Ashbourne district and the Laytown district, which cover half the county, and left three other districts in the other part of the county.</P>
        <P>We must have a debate on the commuter belt where the population is still increasing all the time but the resources are not being allocated in line with that.  The Labour Party got a lot of votes in the commuter belt this time, but it has let the people down in those areas through education, health and now the Garda district arrangements in County Meath.  We need a full debate on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cullinane raised the interesting and admittedly important topic of workers&rsquo; rights.  It would be very useful to have a broad spectrum debate on that subject, if the Leader can arrange it.  We can never get away from the fact that the most important right for every worker is the right to have a job.  Our entire political and economic debate must be about getting people back to work and keeping people at work.  When we look at the strong economies of Europe, especially Germany, where the unemployment rate is low, wages are strong and pensions are very secure, we have to concede that they have a certain flexibility in the labour market that does not exist in many other EU countries.  The debate must not be simplistic.  It must look at the fact that some countries are better at job creation than countries such as Ireland.  We must have an in-depth discussion on that, because our political purpose in this House must be to assist people back to work.</P>
        <P>I also agree with the call from Senator Sheahan that we discuss what he reported last night from O&rsquo;Connell Street.  We can find that in virtually every town across the country.  Senator Noone has raised on several occasions the need to tackle the issue of &ldquo;chugging&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>Charity hugging, or chugging.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That issue needs to be reflected upon.  The fact that many of the people begging on our streets receive social welfare benefits needs to be examined.  The fact that people are drinking and are drunk on the streets needs to be examined.  The answers to Senator Sheahan&rsquo;s worries are difficult, and perhaps not politically popular.  However, the problem can be solved if we are willing to solve it.  It is not rocket science.  The answer is in front of us and it is for us to do it.  I ask the Leader to respond to Senator Sheahan by having a debate so that not just our tourists but the ordinary citizens of the country can walk on the streets of our towns, cities and villages day and night feeling safe.  The concept of law and order has gone a bit out of fashion with some of the chattering classes, but it is important that we have law and order on our streets and that the citizens can walk in our towns and villages at ease and at peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Several steps are being taken by the Government that seem to be working in the direction of job creation, something to which Senators O&rsquo;Keeffe and Bradford have referred.  Another step was yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of Springboard&rsquo;s plan for this year.  Springboard is a scheme whereby the State allocates a considerable sum of money to develop people who already have qualifications, but not those needed at the moment.  For example, people in the construction industry may have a degree in engineering or in architecture, but now they find that what they need is skills in pharmacy, food or whatever.  The allocation has allowed a substantial number of people to go on to higher education to make them suitable for that.</P>
        <P>This morning I met a man who has just come over for the jobs fair this weekend in the RDS.  He is from Canada and he is looking to employ 200 people in the construction business, but he wants very specific skills, because people are only allowed into Canada with those specific skills.   He is not looking for anybody who can work in construction; they must have particular talents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has recognised tourism once again by extending the lower 9% VAT rate for tourism for another year.  That is good news and is a recognition that this creates jobs.  However, it is 7% in Germany and 5.5% in France.  When France brought the VAT rate down for hotels and restaurants in 2009, it actually increased jobs by around 10%.  We can do something.  We have to get across to those making the decisions that sometimes a lower percentage VAT rate can actually increase the amount of money that we take in.  That is not fully understood by many people who have never had the experience of business.  We must keep saying that.  When Mr. McCreevy enacted legislation to reduce the gambling tax from 20% to 10%, there were howls that this was outrageous and that he was looking after his friends in Kildare in the horsey business.  He came back the following year and said that he took in more money at 10% than he did at 20%, and decided to reduce it to 5%.  He then took in more money at 5% than at 10%.  It is a real reminder that by reducing the tax rate, we can actually create jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like Senator Brennan, I wish to acknowledge the grant allocations made and the &euro;350,000 made available to the swimming pool in Lahinch, which will ensure its survival.  Along with Senator Coghlan, I congratulate the pupils from Mallow on their achievement with the Forget Me Not project.  The Deputy Leader will remember that they made a powerful presentation to the Oireachtas justice committee.  We can think of them, what they have achieved and how they conduct themselves, and then compare it with what happened on O&rsquo;Connell Street yesterday according to Senator Sheahan.  I urge the Senator to walk O&rsquo;Connell Street on a Saturday night, because what he saw last night compared to what he would see then.  As a society, we need to have a debate on the drinking culture of young people and on how they behave themselves on the main street of our capital city and most towns across the country.  What one sees on Friday and Saturday night is absolutely appalling.  What one sees the night the junior certificate results come out is absolutely appalling.</P>
        <P>We may need to take drastic action, like banning the sale of alcohol to people under 21 years of age.  Aside from the damage it does to our image and to our tourism product, the chronic abuse of alcohol is doing serious damage to our young people.  It all feeds into the mental health problem, and I support Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s call for a debate on mental health and suicide.  He is absolutely correct.  If it was in Northern Ireland or Syria, we would be calling on the UN to intervene.  We need to have a serious conversation with ourselves about the future of our young people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader of the House to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House as soon as possible to discuss the internment without trial of 4,700 political prisoners in Palestine by the Israeli Government.  It is called administrative detention.  There are currently 1,600 political prisoners on hunger strike and two of them have gone over 70 days.  This is a dangerous situation.  These prisoners are basically being interned without trial.  It is similar to Northern Ireland and these places are like concentration camps.  Thanks to the Internet, somebody is able to recognise their plight in this House.  Their demands are quite minimal in respect of visiting rights, education rights and so on.  They are detained in nine centres throughout Israel.  This is not adding to the peace process in the region which is making no progress owing to the refusal of the Israeli Government to enter into meaningful negotiations and the growth of illegal settlements on Palestinian land.  I call on the Deputy Leader to arrange an early debate on this issue to appeal to the Government of Israel to concede minimal rights to these political prisoners who are being detained without trial, as was the case in Northern Ireland and we know what happened there.  Unless there is a settlement, this situation will create further problems and even lead to deaths in the region.</P>

	<P>I welcome the announcement yesterday that the rate of VAT on tourism products will remain at 9%.  I have received feedback from the Restaurants Association of Ireland and employers in the industry throughout the city of Dublin that this announcement gives them certainty in planning prices and menus for the next year.  It is to be welcomed and is helping employment in the industry.</P>
        <P>I support the comments of previous speakers on society in general and the drink culture.  While Senator Tom Sheahan was shocked to see the carry-on on O&rsquo;Connell Street, with people taking drugs, the problem is not confined to such persons.  Ordinary respectable people &mdash; I cannot think of a better word &mdash; are drinking to excess on a Saturday night and behaving in a totally unbelievable manner on the streets, with individuals being sick and doing things I do not want to discuss on the Order of Business.  In Dublin 4 and the surrounding area we see girls dressed in very scant clothing and boys in tracksuits and jeans.  They are drinking and their parents do not know they are going out dressed like this.  It is a huge societal problem, to which Senator Paul Bradford alluded, and it is not confined to young people, beggars and people taking drugs on the streets.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I am.  I suggest we have a debate on our attitude in general to drinking and matters such as how young people dress.  The need to clean up the city is not confined to O&rsquo;Connell Street.  I suggest we have a debate similar to the one we had on older people.  We would not need to have a Minister present, but we should invite representatives of interested bodies, including Dublin City Council and the Garda, and have a discussion on how the Seanad could create an initiative to clean up the city.</P>

	<P>I join Senators Paul Coghlan and Martin Conway in congratulating the students from Davis College in Mallow who were the overall winners of the Young Social Innovators competition, the finals of which were held yesterday in Citywest which were attended by thousands of young people from all over the country.  The Davis College students&rsquo; project was on missing persons.  They have called for a national missing persons day when friends and the families of missing persons can remember their loved ones who have gone missing.  It is interesting to note that more than 4,000 people go missing in Ireland every year.  I commend the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which this morning will launch a report on missing persons.  I look forward to its recommendations being considered.  I support the students from Mallow in their call for a national day of commemoration and propose to the Deputy Leader that an all-party motion in support of the students&rsquo; call go from the Seanad to the Minister.  Colleagues in the D&aacute;il might do the same.</P>
        <P>I also commend the Cavan Youthreach students who reached the final of the Young Social Innovators competition with their project on the dangers of alcohol, a topic that has also been raised this morning.  On Tuesday last I was honoured to attend the presentation in the Mansion House of the ECO-UNESCO Young Environmentalist Awards by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The event was attended by hundreds of young people from all over the country.  Again, a Cavan Youthreach project was highly commended.  It was called Trash for Trees and involved the sale of old clothes for recycling and using the money to plant trees.  Excellent work is being done by young people throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the sentiments of Senator Tom Sheahan, not on his right to walk down O&rsquo;Connell Street in September but on what he sees on it.  I raised this matter in the Seanad on a previous occasion.  It is embarrassing to be Irish and view what is happening on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  For every beggar, wino and druggie there is one tourist.  The ratio seems to be 1:1.  In walking down the street a person will be approached four or five times for money.  It is like walking through a pack of zombies.  It really is that serious.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister to insist on Dublin City Council introducing by-laws to cover situations such as this.  It is a bad sign for our capital city.  One could go to many other capital cities, but one would not find what one finds on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  To a degree, therefore, I agree with Senator Tom Sheahan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what was said by my colleague, Senator Marc MacSharry, on the issue of mental health.  In the current economic climate when everyone&rsquo;s focus is on the economy, the EU treaty or household and septic tank charges, we may forget the real issues affecting many people such as mental health.  Last week in my constituency a young man took his own life.  It was a very sad occasion and I know his family well.  Mental illness affects very many people, young and not so young, who are under pressure which is not exclusively financial, but the financial climate is adding to it.  A cut of 3.7% to this year&rsquo;s mental health budget by the Government was a step in the wrong direction.  It targeted the most vulnerable in society.  Disabled people who are living alone and depending on a personal assistant are having their service cut and the HSE is hounding them to cut their personal assistants&rsquo; hours substantially.  Although the cut was only 3.7%, its effect on the ground is much worse.  The Minister for Health needs to come to the House to discuss this issue and the cross-party report on mental health among young people in schools.  If the Government implemented the recommendations made in the report, it would be a major step in the right direction.  The report recommends that teachers and pupils be given advice, support and assistance on mental health issues.  There is already a template in County Meath.  People are often afraid to speak or to open up about mental illness.  Before the recession ends, hundreds will die as a result of mental illness.  What is the Government going to do about this?  It will be too late after the recession ends.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a common theme running through many of today&rsquo;s contributions.  In the midst of our concerns about our economic situation we are at risk of ignoring the social, mental and emotional fall-out, especially among young people.  I was shocked and amazed by what the chief executive officer of TV3 said recently.  He said the programme &ldquo;Tallafornia&rdquo; reflected real life in our society more closely than Seanad debates.  Let that not be said because this House is concerned about social issues, judging by what has been said this morning.  It is important we would have a debate on parenting because the family is the core unit.  So much starts with the parents.  It is not an easy job being a parent.  It is time we had such a debate, including all the issues around alcohol and lifestyle habits.  I wish to say to the CEO of TV3 that we are concerned about where our country is going economically.  That is why we are having debates of this nature in the House.</P>
        <P>I have been examining the &ldquo;No&rdquo; posters on the stability treaty.  I am impressed with one word that is used that is accurate, namely, austerity.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; it is certain that we will get austerity, and more of it, because it will bring uncertainty and affect confidence, not just among investors but among the people living in this country.  We know already we have a very flat economy.  Could one imagine what it would be like for the next 18 to 20 months if we had to wait to see whether we had a credit line in this country?  Let us think of the effect a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would have in the interim period.  It is time we looked at the stability treaty in terms of a confidence measure and a growth promoter.  I am pleased we are to have a debate on this issue later today in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU next year.  It will be an opportunity for this country to give leadership across Europe.  I look forward to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader consider having a debate on house insurance and the insurance industry?  It has come to my attention in the past year to 18 months that the insurance industry operates on a rebuilding obligation cost when it comes to the renewal of one&rsquo;s annual insurance.  Currently, that is worked out at &euro;1.20 per square foot.  The problem arises in that the insurance companies, in association with the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, value rebuilding costs on just four areas of the country.  Where I live in County Leitrim, we are part of the Shannon tax incentive scheme which has led to an enormous number of ghost estates and overbuilding, yet anyone living in the area who seeks an insurance policy renewal is told the rebuilding costs are based on the cost of rebuilding a house in Galway.  That takes no account of the downturn in the construction industry or the fact there is an oversupply of houses in the area.  From talking to brokers in the region, they say the rebuilding costs are between &euro;0.90 and &euro;1.00 per square foot, yet the insurance companies insist on operating a cartel.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>What happens is that not only are consumers being penalised by paying a higher premium than is absolutely necessary but also if they put in a claim, the insurance company will then insist that they seek the lowest possible competitive tender, which is way below the rebuilding cost and what they initially charge the consumer.  In other words, we are in rip-off territory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Insurance companies must be called to account in this regard.  Can one imagine that in this country the insurance industry is operating on the basis of just four areas?  It does not matter about the variations in rebuilding costs throughout the country as a result of the downturn in the past four years.  It is vital from a consumer point of view that the Deputy Leader would facilitate a debate on the insurance industry and the Minister would come to the House.  Perhaps she could bring to the attention of the Minister what I believe to be a silent rip-off.  Brokers are operating in unison on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the problem of begging, I bring to the attention of the House that new legislation passed in February 2011, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2011.  More than 500 people have been arrested under the legislation since the Bill was enacted.  The information was published in a report to the Dublin Regional Authority in the past month.  I highlight the matter lest people think nothing has been done.  There was a provision in the legislation dating from the 1800s which was found to be unconstitutional in 2007.  No law existed between 2007 and 2011 when the new legislation was enacted.  I bring it to the attention of the House that steps are being taken.  However, it is obvious that not enough has been done.  Perhaps we must examine the new legislation because under its terms it is not a criminal offence to beg unless it is accompanied by aggression or involves the intimidation of people standing at a bank machine, for example.  The legislation is very new and was only published in February 2011.  Perhaps we could ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to re-examine it.  There might be constitutional reasons the legislation cannot be made any stronger.</P>
        <P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to comment on the statements made in the House today?  We have heard much about culture in this country but a report has found that it is the culture of Roma gypsies to beg.  Buses leaving the country have been raided and people have been found with thousands of euro.  It was found that people bought runners for one person who was begging on Grafton Street without shoes.  The comment was made that he had more pairs of runners than one would find in a top runner shop.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to examine the matter.</P>
        <P>On missing persons, a journalist is missing in India for the past month.  I encourage all Members to tweet about it or mention it on Facebook.  Oireachtas Members should do something positive for missing people.  I agree that people should be congratulated by Members.  However, a young journalist, Jonathan Spollen, is missing in India for the past month and his family, which is from Ranelagh, has made an appeal.  I call on all Members to tweet his name and put it on Facebook.  Another 16 year old young man, whose name I have forgotten, went missing in Dublin on Friday as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been listening all morning to incidents that have taken place on O&rsquo;Connell Street but I wish to speak about another incident that took place.  I wish to highlight what happened on the Mallow to Cork road last Saturday where a sulky race was taking place.  Those involved had the audacity to put it up on YouTube.  The race was so dangerous that hundreds of lives were put in danger.  They were racing down on the wrong side of the road and all the traffic coming against them had to swerve.  It was being recorded from a van going down the wrong side of the road with a child in it.  The Garda was there and what took place was a pure defiance of its presence.  In fairness, a spokesman from Pavee Point has criticised the incident and described it as a reckless endangerment of lives.  This is part of Traveller culture and it can take place but it must be done in a safe environment.  I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House for a debate on the issue.  We will examine whether it is safe to have such a practice on our national roads.  Perhaps it could be accommodated by a road closure.  When a running or cycling road race or rally event takes place, the roads are closed for the day.  If Travellers want to proceed with such events, they should make a legal application to the Garda to have a road closed in order for the event to take place.  What is happening at the moment it is a danger to lives.  I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to inform Members whether something could be done under road traffic legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to follow up on the VAT reduction in the tourism industry.  One of the proposals at European level in 2009 related to the construction industry.  In this country the number of people working in the construction industry has decreased from 270,000 to 106,000.  One of the proposals at European level in 2009 was about the introduction of a 5% VAT rate for construction projects under a certain cost, for example, work under a total value of &euro;15,000.  The current problem is that a significant number of people involved in small building jobs are forced into the black market where they do not collect VAT.  The Government must examine the issue.  Many people want small jobs done on their houses.  Getting quotes from people who accept cash is causing two problems.  The first is that it is pushing out those who are in the market who are trying to make a living by playing completely by the rules and within the law.  The second is that people who are in receipt of unemployment benefit are, unfortunately, now taking cash in lieu of going back into the workforce legitimately.  This is an issue that deserves serious consideration by the Government.  The talk now is of a growth package for Europe as a whole, a prospect that was first raised back in 2009.  In the context of Ireland&rsquo;s assumption of the Presidency of the European Union in January 2013, we should work towards the introduction of a stimulus for the construction industry, not only in this country but right across Europe.  It is a small but important step which would have wide-ranging benefits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the deal that will be signed today in Europe to ensure a reduction from July of this year in mobile telephone roaming charges in respect of both voice calls and data usage.  Data services will be capped at 70%, with staged reductions to follow until 2014.  It is particularly to be welcomed that customers will have the option, from 2014, of purchasing their domestic and roaming services separately from different operators.</P>
        <P>I wholeheartedly support the calls by Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Martin Conway for a debate on mental health and suicide.  I attended two of the briefing sessions at the County Meath school to which they referred at which school management outlined their excellent and successful mental health policy.  I also take this opportunity to congratulate the cross-party mental health group and the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on the recent report on mental health in Ireland.  The reality is mental illness remains a terrible stigma in this country.  While more people are now willing to talk about it, and we have had several debates on the issue in this House, we must actively seek action.  Debates and reports are useful, but it is time now to take action to improve the situation.  Concern is constantly expressed about the rate of suicide, especially among young people.  I ask everyone to be vigilant as we approach the junior and leaving certificate examinations, which are a highly stressful time in the lives of young people.  The first step, which does not cost money, is to talk to people with mental health issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a very positive note, I welcome the additional jobs for Galway announced by Aviva Ireland this morning.  I also congratulate the Government on the decision to retain the reduced rate of VAT for tourist related activity until the end of 2013.  This is an innovative and positive initiative which should have a significant impact on job creation.</P>
        <P>I support my colleague, Senator Catherine Noone, in her call for a debate on attitudes to alcohol consumption in this country and on the damage it is doing to young people in particular and to society in general.  That debate must include a consideration of the availability of alcohol and the dangers arising from below-cost selling.  Rural pubs are struggling to survive and cannot compete on price with the outlets selling alcohol below cost.  I understand one major multinational retailer is using the VAT system to manipulate prices by availing of large refunds on alcohol and subsequently subsidising its sale.  We now have a ludicrous situation where pubs and other small businesses are purchasing alcohol from these large retail outlets because their prices are cheaper than those at the wholesaler.  As Senator Marc MacSharry and others observed, there is a very close link between alcohol abuse and suicide.  We are all concerned that the very significant investment the State is making in mental health is being properly targeted.  A debate on these issues would allow us to examine the relationship between alcohol misuse, drug abuse and suicide and how the State&rsquo;s scarce resources can be most effectively targeted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In keeping with the Leader&rsquo;s practice, I will respond only to those colleagues who are present in the Chamber.  Senator Marc MacSharry referred to the Aviva Ireland jobs announcement this morning.  We all welcome the reduction in the number of redundancies and the additional jobs for Galway, as also referred to by Senator Michael Mullins.  I absolutely agree with Senator MacSharry on the need for the Government to engage on an ongoing basis, through its agencies, with large employers.  We would all commend the great work being done by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in this regard.  We see the results of that in the numbers of job creation announcements in recent months, particularly through foreign direct investment, including from companies like SAP, PayPal, Apple and so on.</P>
        <P>The Senator also called for a debate on mental health, to be attended by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  We all welcome the achievement of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in ensuring ring-fenced funding for mental health services.  She attended debates in this House in the first and second week after Christmas on the issue.  I am happy to facilitate another debate and will speak to the Leader in that regard.  However, we might leave it for a little time given we have had one relatively recently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I called for a debate specifically on the financing aspect.  In fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has been fantastic.  However, her budget is neither large enough nor sufficiently targeted.  That is why I called for a debate with the Minister, Deputy James Reilly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to facilitate such a debate, particularly if it can be focused as the Senator is suggesting.  I will raise it with the Leader.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Coghlan commended the students of Davis College in Mallow on all the work they have done in publicising their Forget Me Not campaign in respect of missing persons.  A presentation was made by the students at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on 28 March.  Just this morning the committee launched a report on missing persons and what the State response should be.  I will ask the Leader for a debate on that report, which should include an invitation to the Davis College students to attend in the Gallery.  They were present this morning in the audio-visual room for the launch of our report.  They have done tremendous work in putting forward sensible and practical ideas in regard to tracing missing persons, including a proposal for a national day for missing persons.  The committee has adopted their recommendation in this regard and put it forward to the Minister for Justice and Equality for consideration.  I hope to see it adopted in early course.</P>
        <P>Senators Denis O&rsquo;Donovan and Marie Moloney referred to the issue of chariot racing in Mallow.  I agree that any danger for road users arising from this activity must be condemned.  I am not sure how we can progress that through the House, perhaps through an Adjournment debate which would allow the Minister for Justice and Equality to give his view.  It is quite a specific issue in terms of legislative responses.  As such, there is a question as to how best we can address it.</P>
        <P>We would all join Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe in welcoming the launch of InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s seedcorn competition.  It would be useful to organise a briefing session on that.</P>
        <P>Senator David Cullinane referred to next year&rsquo;s centenary of the 1913 lockout.  It would be timely to mark that event in the context of a debate on the protection of employment rights.  However, I concur with Senator Paul Bradford that the most important right for workers is the right to a job.  The Government is seeking, in all of its policies, to focus on strategies for job creation and growth in the economy.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Terry Brennan in welcoming the announcement of funding allocations from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Senator Paul Bradford joined others in calling for a debate on attitudes to alcohol in our society.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn could not remain in the Chamber for this response because, as he informed me, he will be attending this morning&rsquo;s debate in the D&aacute;il.  He is very much to be commended on his Construction Contracts Bill, which was introduced in this House as a Private Members&rsquo; Bill and is now on Second Stage in the Lower House.  I concur with the Senator&rsquo;s comments regarding the benefits for job creation arising from the Springboard programme.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry Leyden called for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to attend the House for a debate on the Palestinian political prisoners being held in Israel.  I entirely concur with his comments regarding the very dangerous situation that has arisen in terms of prisoners going on hunger strike and will be pleased to facilitate such a debate.  The Senator might consult his colleague, Senator Paschal Mooney, who sought a debate on a similar issue yesterday.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill supported the call for a debate on mental health and suicide.  We can arrange to hold such a debate, but we might frame it somewhat differently in order to focus on the funding issue.  In that context, Senator Diarmuid Wilson suggested we might table an all-party motion on mental health funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I completely agree with that suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>An all-party motion would be extremely useful.  Perhaps Senator Diarmuid Wilson might draft an appropriate wording for circulation among the leaders of the various groups.  He also commended the students at Davis College, a matter with which I have dealt.</P>
        <P>Senator Paschal Mooney called for a debate on house insurance.  This is a most interesting topic and it would be good for the House to engage in a debate on it, particularly as it relates to consumer rights and insurance pricing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator C&aacute;it Keane referred to begging in the context of anti-social behaviour on O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin and elsewhere.  As the Senator stated, legislation designed to target aggressive begging was introduced last year.  It is quite early to evaluate the effect of that legislation.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be in the House for two and a half hours later today and perhaps the Senator might broach the matter with him at that point.  I agree with her on the highly publicised case of a missing person, Jonathan Spollen.</P>
        <P>Senator Marie Moloney referred to an illegal sulky race which took place on the road between Mallow and Cork.  Again, this matter might be raised with the Minister for Justice and Equality later in the day.  I agree with the Senator on the dangers to which that race gave rise for motorists and other road users.</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke welcomed the retention of the reduced VAT rate for tourism.  This is a development we all very much welcome.  The Senator also referred to the need for a stimulus for the construction industry.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary Moran welcomed the deal that had been reached in Europe on roaming charges for mobile phones.  I am sure we all welcome the deal, particularly as many of us have been the victim of extremely high roaming charges.  The Senator also supported the call for a debate on mental health funding.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael Mullins called for a debate on the drink culture and alcohol pricing.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, has been doing a great deal of work on that matter.  She also came before the House for a debate on it in the recent past.  However, we can certainly arrange another such debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, DeputyCreighton, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House as part of the programme of events to mark Europe week.  I am also glad to update the House on our approach to the EU Presidency, now less than eight months away.  As it happens, Ireland will celebrate the 40th anniversary of its accession to the EEC as it takes over the Presidency.  I feel this anniversary provides us with an opportunity to reflect on our membership and how our country has grown and developed over the past four decades.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The direct and tangible benefits of membership are well known, perhaps some now even take them for granted, but many here will recall how the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, helped transform Irish agriculture and rural life.  Ireland has benefited enormously from access to the Single Market which has fuelled our export sector and helped make Ireland an important centre for international investment.  Our national infrastructure has been transformed through cohesion funding.  Membership has benefited individual citizens in a range of ways, whether through improved legal and social protection or, for example, through opening up educational or employment opportunities across the EU.  The peace process in Northern Ireland has received and continues to receive significant EU support.</P>
        <P>As well as a time to reflect on the benefits we have derived from the EU, the Presidency offers the opportunity to demonstrate our commitment as an active and constructive member state and to assess what role Ireland can play in the future development of Europe.  This Government continues to work to rebuild our economy and to build economic growth and prosperity.  Stability and economic growth go hand in hand.  We will only succeed in our objective of economic recovery if we work from a solid platform of stability in Ireland and in Europe.  Fighting the ongoing financial crisis will remain a priority for Ireland during its term of the Presidency.  Ireland will work to ensure the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s new economic governance rules and procedures that will lay the ground for greater economic and fiscal stability.</P>
        <P>While we need to restore stability to Europe&rsquo;s markets and economies, the time has come to focus to a much stronger extent on the challenge of getting the EU&rsquo;s economy growing again, as well as creating the conditions for sustainable employment and growth.  We look forward to working at European level closely with partners for a stronger and more co-ordinated approach to reducing unemployment.  Reflecting the national priority that we attached to this issue in Ireland, Ministers are working across Government to identify measures in every European policy sector aimed at creating the conditions necessary for long-term sustainable economic growth and job creation.</P>
        <P>In its Presidency, Ireland will work to ensure key decisions are taken on the EU budget for 2014 to 2020.  Decisions on this budget will have implications for the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, which are clearly of critical national importance.  There are other measures vital for our future economic development including funding for Horizon 2020, the EU&rsquo;s framework programme for research and innovation.  In keeping with our plans to place jobs and growth at the centre of our Presidency programme, we are focusing on areas including the Single Market Act, the digital agenda, programmes that support research, development and innovation, and ways of reducing bureaucracy so that small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, can focus more on developing their business and creating jobs.  We will need to ensure we remain impartial and fair in handling the EU&rsquo;s agenda but many of these priorities in fact mirror our national objectives.</P>
        <P>Ireland will seek to promote the external trade agenda during the Presidency.  The decision to hold an informal meeting of trade Ministers in Ireland during the Presidency, which is intended to focus on EU-US trade and to organise related business-focused events, signals the priority that we give to this.  Several large conferences and events focussing on research and innovation are being planned for Dublin during the Presidency by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  These issues will also figure prominently on the agendas for ministerial meetings in areas such as health and energy.</P>
        <P>We are working to promote responsible social policies across the EU.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, will invite her colleagues from across the EU to a conference in Dublin in 2013 aimed at addressing issues including co-ordinated ways of fighting poverty and promoting social inclusion.  In Ireland we attach great importance to the value of education and during the Presidency we will seek to build ways of extending greater access to education and training to all Europeans and to strengthening standards to boost the EU&rsquo;s global economic competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The reform of the CAP and CFP will be of major importance in 2013, and Ireland will seek to use its Presidency to support and promote innovation in agriculture, environmental sustainability and food security.  It will seek to support and foster a more responsible and sustainable future for the EU economy by placing an emphasis on measures aimed at boosting the green economy, an emerging area in which the EU can become a world leader.  Energy efficiency has been identified as a priority area during the Presidency with a focus on how new technologies can be employed to make more efficient use of the EU&rsquo;s energy resources.  We will work to support policy that will take a responsible approach to protecting Europe&rsquo;s environment for future generations.</P>
        <P>These are just some of the main emerging priorities of our Presidency programme.  Between now and the end of the year, the Government will work closely with our European partners, the EU institutions and civil society as we continue to develop and define our agenda.  The emerging priorities of the Irish Presidency programme reflect national concerns but we believe that they also reflect the concerns of millions of people across the EU.  The Presidency is an investment in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and an investment in a better future for Europe.</P>
        <P>Ireland developed a reputation during its six previous Presidencies for handling the business of the European Union in a fair, impartial and effective manner.  It is no mean achievement for a small member state and it is our ambition to do the same in 2013.  We see it as an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to rebuild our international reputation.  At the same time, given the circumstances in which we find ourselves, we will seek to run a cost-effective Presidency by reducing the number of venues for meetings and taking a close look at expenditure in every other area of planning.  Based on current estimates, the Presidency is likely to be well under the budget for Ireland&rsquo;s last Presidency in 2004.  We are also planning for beyond the Presidency.  A successful Presidency can strengthen our relations with our partners and help to promote our national interests at EU level.  The Government has also established a working group representing the main State agencies and other key stakeholders to consider the central messages we want to convey about Ireland during the Presidency and to identify the opportunities that it will offer to promote Irish goods and services.</P>
        <P>The Presidency has always posed challenges for a smaller member state like Ireland.  Running the Union&rsquo;s busy and complex agenda for six months is a challenging task.  Ireland has demonstrated its abilities in the past and I am confident that we will do so again in 2013.</P>

	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Creighton, who is responsible for European affairs.  Having been a Minister of State responsible for trade and marketing during the 1990 Presidency I realise how important and significant the Presidency is for this country and it is a single honour for us to host it.  We have been most efficient and effective in all of our Presidencies and I have no doubt that this one will be as successful.  As spokesperson for European affairs in the Seanad, I wish the Minister of State well and offer her my full co-operation and assistance for when the delegations come to Ireland.  It is important that the Opposition is involved as much as possible.  The Government and the main Opposition party here have adopted a united approach to the role of Europe, its significance and extend a welcome to our European colleagues that will come to Dublin for meetings of the Council during the Presidency period.  As she said, next year will be the 40th anniversary of our accession to the European Union and it is significant that we mark the occasion.  It is a significant event and the deal was signed by the late Jack Lynch, a former Taoiseach and the late Paddy Hillery, a former Minister for External Affairs, now known as foreign affairs, and President.  We must bear it in mind during the Presidency.</P>
        <P>Croatia will also join the family of members in January 2013 or during the period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Just after.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be during the year of our Presidency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We will work with them because, as far as I can recall, members of the Croatian Government will attend meetings.</P>
        <P>During the Minister of State&rsquo;s period as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs she effectively and successfully chaired a sub-committee on the Lisbon treaty.  On that occasion she spoke about the role of the Oireachtas and did a very good job of it.  Like myself she must be disappointed that the Seanad has not been significantly involved with European legislation.  In the Seanad she gave a commitment, in conjunction with the Leader of the House, that she would consider it.  I hope that we would devote one day a month to discuss legislation of general interest to Members, as opposed to particular sectoral interests.  I hope that she will examine it again in her role as Minister with responsibility for European affairs and during the period of the Presidency.</P>
        <P>Earlier the Minister of State outlined some of the issues and events that will take place during the Presidency.  I note the meeting of the trade ministers of Ireland that will focus on trade between the European Union and the US.  We hosted such a meeting in Dromoland Castle but I do not think she will have the same opportunity to host meetings at such venues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not be going to Dromoland Castle.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We do not need Dromoland Castle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State is originally from County Mayo and the Taoiseach hails from there, I hope that the EU leaders are given the opportunity to visit the west of Ireland during the Presidency.  It would be an important visit, irrespective of the extra cost involved.  They could visit some key locations in Mayo, Galway or the region.  I hope that such a visit will be arranged and my party would support it.  I would also support a showcase of the west to the leaders of the other 27 countries.</P>
        <P>I note the comments made on jobs, enterprise and scientific developments.  I know that Commissioner M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn would be supportive as far as her availability is concerned.</P>
        <P>The Presidency of the Council is an influential position and Ireland, under previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, made a real impact.  The forthcoming Presidency is strategically important as Ireland will be the most experienced member state to hold such a position while overseeing the 18-month work programme shared between Cyprus, Ireland and Lithuania.  The key issues to be tackled during our Presidency will be the European growth agenda, the European budget, the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the European crisis.  It is vital for Europe&rsquo;s future to make significant progress in these areas.</P>
        <P>It would be a feather in the cap of the Government and the State if the fiscal treaty is passed successfully on 31 May.  We would be one of the first 12 signatories to ratify the agreement.  There is some misunderstanding of Germany&rsquo;s postponement of its ratification process, the situation in France with its new President and the position in Greece.  The treaty still stands.  The agreement still stands and the first 12 signatories will kick it into place.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the 17 members of the eurozone will retain their position.  We will approach the Presidency with a strong hand having been one of the early signatories of the treaty and because it will be in place.  Irish people have a particular role to play in this regard.  They should not be side-tracked by issues in the other 26 members of the European Union and how they react to the fiscal treaty.  It is about how we react to the treaty.  It is about the people of Ireland having a real democratic say.  They should consider the issues before them and not be swayed by propaganda emanating from Germany&rsquo;s slight postponement of the date it brings the legislation to its Parliament and the position in Greece and France.  As far as Ireland is concerned, France&rsquo;s position is positive.  It is in our best interests that we are a signatory of the fiscal treaty.</P>
        <P>We have had enormously successful Irish Presidencies.  The reunification of Germany took place during our Presidency in the 1990s and it was a massive event in Dublin.  As far as the fiscal treaty is concerned, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side is all ifs, buts and maybes.  It is &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; we will get money from the International Monetary Fund and &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; we will get money from another source but we are guaranteed money from the stability fund.  If we reject the opportunity of tapping into &euro;700 billion why would the IMF decide to support Ireland?  We would have to go back to the IMF with our cap in our hands if we needed additional support and were not back in the bond markets.  I cannot understand the logic behind such a stance.  I understand that we will have another opportunity to debate the issue next week.  I have had little opportunity to appear on radio or television or use any other media and must use the Seanad to convey my point of view.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, to the House.  I compliment her on the wonderful work she is doing and the image of our country she is projecting.  She is doing a wonderful job to help to restore this country&rsquo;s reputation in Europe and internationally.  I agree with Senator Leyden that as we campaign in advance of this vital referendum, we need to be conscious of the importance of this country&rsquo;s membership of the EU for our ongoing economic recovery.  At no stage during Ireland&rsquo;s 40 years as a member state has it been more important for us to play a central role in the action in Europe.  Those campaigning for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote need to take that on board.</P>
        <P>This will be the seventh time Ireland has held the Presidency of the EU and the first time since 2004.  It will be a challenging and exciting opportunity for Ireland.  Over the years, this country has built a reputation for having an effective Presidency.  I do not doubt we will do an excellent job again on this occasion, despite the limited resources mentioned by the Minister of State.  It is a more challenging task on this occasion because the EU now has 27 member states.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must feel like someone who is getting ready to receive an important visitor in a few months.  A great deal of groundwork has to be done and many plans have to be put in place.  We will have a huge opportunity to showcase Ireland and to convey to Europe important messages about our own economic recovery and our future potential.  We should use the huge media interest in Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU to our best advantage, for example, by promoting tourism, the Irish agrifood industry, our successful multinational sector, our educational facilities and many other successful aspects of our economy.  We want to transmit the message that Ireland is truly open for business.  We must let the world know that.</P>
        <P>Our Presidency of the EU will allow us to set the agenda for the first half of 2013.  We all want to focus on the issues of greatest concern to the Irish people and the people of Europe as a whole.  I do not doubt the ongoing financial crisis in Europe, the stability of the euro and the need to ease our debt burden will be on the agenda, and a great deal of time will be devoted to them.  Job creation and economic growth in Ireland and across Europe have to be priorities for us.  It is unacceptable that approximately 440,000 people are unemployed.  We must continue to improve our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>During the recent French presidential election, there was a great deal of discussion on the importance of growth for European economic recovery.  This has been promoted by our Government in the past year.  I hope all member states will work closely to develop growth initiatives during our Presidency, which will have a key role in driving the EU&rsquo;s ambitious employment, innovation, education, social inclusion, climate change and energy objectives, which have to be achieved by 2020.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned our vital national interest in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy.  We hope significant progress will be made in those respects during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU.  The agrifood area is of great importance to our economic recovery.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, who has been in this House on two occasions recently, is doing a wonderful job to promote innovation in agriculture.  The agrifood sector has the potential to be a real driver of growth for the future.  The Minister has spoken about Ireland&rsquo;s plans to produce enough food to feed between 50 million and 60 million people by 2020.</P>
        <P>We must keep the interests of small and medium sized enterprises on the agenda during our Presidency of the EU.  We have to find ways of making it easier for such businesses to access research, development and innovation programmes.</P>
        <P>We need to prioritise the provision of help for the poorest people in the world.  The Seanad debated the review of the White Paper on Irish Aid yesterday.  As a nation, we have always been proud of the help we have given to the most vulnerable people in society.  We should pursue this area with vigour.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State and the Government well during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU.  I know they will do the country proud.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am looking forward to Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union.  It will be an important moment for Ireland in light of where we are at globally and particularly at European level.  It needs to be emphasised that the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, is doing a great job.  She is putting a really positive face on where we are at.  She is leading.</P>
        <P>It is lovely to see young people in the Gallery.  Next year, Ireland will have been a member state of the EU for 40 years.  When we hold the Presidency next year, we will have a chance to lead Europe on key issues.  The Taoiseach and our Ministers will have key opportunities to prioritise what is important for Ireland, for the whole of Europe, which has a population of 500 million, and, in particular, for the euro area.  We are all relying on growth in the euro area.  It is critical for us all.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The countries with which Ireland will share the Presidency of the EU are less experienced in this respect.  We will follow the Cypriot Presidency.  We will share the Presidency with Lithuania before handing over to Greece.  It is widely known, given how long Ireland has been in the Union, that those countries have far less experience than Ireland of the Presidency of the EU.  It is accepted that our Civil Service has the expertise and backup to provide for a really good Presidency.  This is being spoken about in Europe.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister of State to consider a number of requests.  I am aware that bringing the jobs and growth strategy into operation will be one of our key priorities.  We can see the effect this message had on last weekend&rsquo;s election in France.  It remains to be seen how effective Mr. Hollande will be.  It is a very important message.</P>
        <P>I suggest to the Minister of State that Ireland should seriously consider taking a leading role in a major event on youth unemployment, for example, by inviting our European counterparts to a conference on the subject.  The current level of youth unemployment is scary.  Approximately 30% of our young people are unemployed.  The equivalent rate in Spain is approaching 50%.  It is a perilous situation.  We all know what happened in the past when youth unemployment was not addressed.</P>
        <P>We could build on the major high level forum on youth unemployment that was organised by the OECD in 2010.  We should draw on the expertise of countries like Denmark, Norway, New Zealand and Canada, which are doing well in terms of youth unemployment.  We need to examine what they are doing differently.  Our work in this regard would meet the EU social inclusion, job creation and growth promotion objectives.</P>
        <P>The digital single market is another one of the key objectives of the Presidency and of Commissioner Kroes.  When I attended the COSAC meeting in Copenhagen two weeks ago, I was impressed by Commissioner Kroes&rsquo;s presentation.  She pointed out that by 2015, the EU will lack 700,000 information technology professionals.  This is the growth area and this is what young people need to hear.  Careers in IT should be considered because demand for IT professionals has already outstripped supply.  This proves there is no recession on the Internet.</P>
        <P>Another priority for our Presidency will be the Common Agricultural Policy.  The negotiations are likely to be completed here.</P>
        <P>Ireland should take the opportunity to host some of the meetings outside the capital with a view to engaging other areas of the country in the workings of Europe and to showcase them, not least because it will be the 40th anniversary of the Union and because we need to show our citizens the real and democratic gain associated with being a member of the Union.  It is worth considering.</P>
        <P>We must consider the responsibility of the ECB during this Presidency.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is working very hard on this and considering our banking debt.  A constructive orderly write-down of banking debt will release domestic economies in terms of mortgage debt.</P>
        <P>It is important that we use our leadership to talk to Germany in a very mature away and encourage Ms Angela Merkel to get the Germans to spend a little more.  We know they have kept their wages low very deliberately, which the rest of us did not do.  It may be time for them to live a little and spend a little more.  The German economy, the German population, makes up one third of the euro area.  We want the stability treaty to be passed.  We need it for certainty, credit and growth.  We need genuine growth and Germany has a crucial role to play in this regard.  Let us not be afraid on this account.  Ireland has a great opportunity to showcase itself and to show it is mature and can offer leadership, not just for its own sake but for the entire euro area.  I wish the Minister of State well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  As I have done privately, I offer my support to her.  As Senator Healy Eames stated, Ireland has a fantastic opportunity to use the Presidency &mdash; I use the phrase carefully &mdash; to improve its damaged reputation.  There is a fractured Europe.  It is not structurally fractured but the relationships are fractured.  We are cranky, for good reason.  We have a reputation for mollifying and trying to make peace.  We should use the first six months of 2013 as an opportunity for the Republic to be peacemaker among all member states.  We are great at what we call public diplomacy.  I am proud to say I am a great fan of the Union, irrespective of its flaws.  I accept there are many views on the future of Europe but we are all on the one side in terms of making it much more productive, cohesive and inclusive.</P>
        <P>Most high-level meetings happen in Brussels.  The Minister of State mentioned in her speech that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, will have a certain conference here.  What informal high-level meetings will be held in Ireland?  I support Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s view that meetings should be held beyond the Pale.  Tomorrow, the Government is to announce the launch of the Gathering, an important phenomenon.  Irish arts and cultural festivals are the best in the world.  It is important to use culture, tourism, our good nature and sense of conviviality to try to impress on our European colleagues the importance of enhancing the unity and cohesiveness of the Union.</P>
        <P>The Minister may have a little more to say on the crucial trade Ministers&rsquo; meeting, focusing particularly on EU-US trade.  Ireland could be at the centre of the discourse.  I hope the current US President will still be in power next year.  It may be interesting for us to enhance our reputation even more.  Our reputation is in need of enhancement.  We should not feel we have achieved this and the Minister should not either.  It is a matter of using our leverage to encourage our neighbours and the other member states.</P>
        <P>I was involved with the 2004 Presidency and with the day of enlargement.  Ireland serves as a focal point for all member states.  I would love to hear the Minister of State say more about using our cultural and tourism links to leverage our public diplomacy muscle in order to enhance our reputation.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
        <P>The chance to hold the Presidency of the EU offers Ireland a wonderful opportunity at this most trying of economic times.  I was very interested to hear much of what the Minister of State said recently, especially the comment that holding the Presidency offers a chance to demonstrate that Ireland is a constructive and committed member of the Union and that, more important, membership has been and remains a very positive experience for Ireland.  In the background noise of the current economic crisis, some commentators have depicted membership of the European Union as part of the problem, but this fails to recognise the benefits that have accrued and continue to accrue from being a member of the Union.</P>
        <P>It is been pointed out that Iceland, which is outside the eurozone, has pursued a different path than Ireland and consequently emerged in a better position.  Some commentators have attributed this result to Iceland being in a position to use its monetary position as a policy tool, which Ireland, as a member of the common currency area, cannot do.  This fails to recognise the scale of the problem facing Iceland, including the destruction of wealth and savings and the massive reduction in the standard of living for ordinary Icelanders.  A policy instrument pursued by Iceland, which we do not hear much about, is the imposition of capital controls.  This has prevented a great flight of capital from Iceland.  It is easy to say that we would be in a better position if we were not a member of the European Union.  However, this argument, which we have heard time and again, ignores the complexity of the economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>We do not have control over monetary policy.  One can only imagine what would happen to Ireland if we used capital controls as a policy in an economy where foreign direct investment accounts for over half of wealth creation and a similar percentage of employment.  The imposition of capital controls would ensure we closed ourselves off to future investment and undermined any existing investment, on which we are so highly dependent.</P>
        <P>One of the main attractions for financial direct investors is the relatively low rate of corporation tax, in addition to the educated and flexible workforce and access to European markets.  We have been more than successful in attracting foreign direct investment relative to other countries and we continue to punch above our weight.  In the past few months, we have heard the announcement of over 2,000 jobs as a direct result of this policy.  Membership of the European Union is vital for our recovery and access to funding, and for the networking afforded to us among our European partners.</P>
        <P>It has been stated that in accepting membership of the European Union we have handed over some sovereignty, but I do not accept that argument.  The concept of sovereignty is ever-changing and ever-evolving.  This is good because we have moved a long way from the narrow nationalism we witnessed in this country, the Balkans and other parts of Europe historically.  The European Union has played a huge role in ensuring member states can resolve their differences by way of dialogue.  Everyone will agree that this must be good.  Sovereignty means much more than the ability to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Membership places us at the very heart of decision-making in Europe.  Ireland represents but 1% of the European Union&rsquo;s population, yet its voice can be heard.  By holding the Presidency we can set the agenda across a range of policy areas and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on this.  The international media will focus its attention on Ireland during the Presidency and it gives us a wonderful opportunity to speak directly to the world without having our views mediated through a biased international commentariat.</P>
        <P>We should not just look to Europe for what we can get out of it.  We have made a major contribution to Europe as a player on the world diplomatic and political stage.  Most progressive thinking on equality and reform has its origins in Europe and has found its way into our legislation, often in opposition to conservative forces in Ireland, through European legislation and we should be thankful for that.  Setting the political priorities for the agenda is vital.  On the last seven occasions we have held the Presidency, all Governments of all shades have done the country proud.</P>
        <P>I am glad we are members of the European project.  In difficult economic times, there is a populist temptation to retrench our positions and fall back on the simple but dangerous introverted Nationalist ideology.  This must be resisted because therein lies the road back to the dark days we were too used to in this country.  It is good the Presidency is coming round to us at this time.  With it comes the opportunity to reassert our commitment to be part of the European project, which has transformed our country and the Continent for the better.  The Labour Party originally opposed entry into the European Economic Community 40 years ago but it subsequently fully embraced the project.  We are internationalist in outlook and look forward to the Presidency where we can reassert our commitment to the EU.  It is an exciting prospect for the country, the Government and the Minister of State, who we are sure will do Ireland proud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>The opportunity offered by our holding the Presidency should not be overlooked.  This country was dependent solely on British markets for almost all of our trade until 40 years ago.  Since 1973, the European market of 500 million people has been open to us and has also allowed us access to other markets globally.  Anyone who suggests being in the EU is a backward step is living  in the 1920s, if not 100 years ago.  Every town in Donegal has benefited from EU membership, from farming to tourism to infrastructure to equality legislation that would never have been introduced by any Irish Government.  We have been good Europeans and benefited from our membership, but Europe has benefited from our membership.  It is a two-way street.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Gilroy made a good point about Iceland.  When Iceland collapsed, there were restrictions but those who put it forward as an example forget that Iceland&rsquo;s border is the Atlantic Ocean, while our border is between Lifford and Strabane and I do not want Donegal to have to depend on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government in Strabane or Derry or Belfast if the economy collapses here.  We had 800 years of dependency on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government so if we end up in an Iceland-type situation, the people of Lifford will have to go to Strabane to get their benefits and housing and I do not want the day to come that the people of the Republic of Ireland are saying &ldquo;Please, can we have some more?&rdquo; to the British Treasury.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been standing on its own two feet for 40 years and is a proud member of the EU.  I hope the Minister of State will ask some of the important Ministers who visit Ireland to come to Donegal, Galway or Mayo to see what is going on there and to let the people know Europe is concerned about rural counties.  If there were an opportunity for a plenary meeting or a subcommittee meeting of European leaders or officials in Donegal for a day or a weekend, as well as being a tourism opportunity for the county, it would let the local people know Europe is concerned and would show Ireland will play its part in the European project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  We are living in times of great change, North and South and across Europe.  We have seen recently how the tide has changed in Europe against the forces of austerity.  That is to be welcomed and it is to be hoped this time next year the austerity treaty will be a distant memory of an attempt to constitutionalise a failed economic model.</P>
        <P>We are sure that when Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union begins next year, this State will continue to be a member of the eurozone and the European Union, the same as any other state, with the same influence we have now.  That is the factual context in which we live and to pretend otherwise is a distraction.</P>
        <P>It is likely the Irish Presidency will coincide with the final negotiations of the multi-annual financial programme.  This is a lucky coincidence of which the State must take full advantage.  Our farmers, fishermen, youth groups and community organisations will be keeping an eye on these developments.  These are uncertain times for the State and a well funded and responsive Common Agricultural Policy in coming years will be of great importance.</P>
        <P>I also hope the Irish Presidency will be able to sign off on a PEACE IV programme.  The Six Counties and the Border regions are still recovering from the effects of the conflict caused by the division of our country and a continuation of the PEACE III programme focused on grassroots work is very important to society and the economy.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the peace process.  I call on her to ensure this occasion is as close as possible to our first all-Ireland Presidency.  There should be maximum co-operation with our counterparts in the Assembly.  The benefits of an all-Ireland, joined-up approach are obvious to all of us who work with farmers, fishermen and community groups, especially along the Border.  All-Ireland policy co-operation and coherence makes sense and must form the bedrock of our Presidency.</P>
        <P>Following the remarks of Senator Healy Eames, and with an eye to the co-ordinated approach at European level to reduce unemployment, I ask the Minister of State whether concrete action on President Barroso&rsquo;s plans to tackle youth unemployment will be championed by our Presidency.  The tackling of youth unemployment at EU level mirrors the starkness of the issue here, as a State with one of the highest levels of youths who are not in education, employment or training.  Will we try to advance concrete plans to address this under the Presidency?  How will we engage during the Presidency with President Barroso&rsquo;s action team on youth unemployment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking time out of her busy schedule to be with us today.  Figures show 70% of people involved in research and development from outside the European Union go to the United States to work.  Can we take a positive approach during our Presidency to dealing with that issue by making Europe a more attractive location for research, especially in the health field?  There is a need for more co-ordination across member states on health care.</P>
        <P>When I was an MEP back in 2009, I raised the issue of the decrease in the number of people working in the construction industry, from 270,000 to 106,000.  In 2009 there was a proposal for a 5% VAT rate across Europe for small jobs in the construction industry with a value of less than &euro;15,000.  There was to be a co-ordinated approach across Europe to get people back into work and to eliminate the grey economy in this sector.  The European Globalisation Fund, which is an innovative training fund, was introduced a few years ago.  We need to do something in these two areas during our Presidency in 2013.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I congratulate her on all the great work she has done in her portfolio.  This is a busy time for her and I appreciate her taking the time to come to the House.  Next year will be significant as we take over the EU Presidency and it is great to know it will be under her capable guidance.  What will be our agenda and priorities and what do we hope to achieve?  I hope Ireland will have a strong input into EU job creation policy, particularly in regard to youth employment.  I ask that a special task force be set up to ensure this issue remains to the fore of our EU agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I, obviously, welcome the Minister of State.  My question relates to the physical arrangements for the summits and other meetings.  She indicated in her contribution that perhaps because of our economic difficulty the majority of meetings will be held in our capital.  I appreciate that the holding of the Presidency must be economically efficient but it must also be effective.  To be so, one of the Government&rsquo;s aspirations must be to use the Presidency to re-engage the citizens of Europe and, in particular, the citizens of Ireland with the institutions and the politics of the Union.  I appreciate we cannot have meetings, seminars and European dialogue at every crossroads but we must try to maximise engagement between Irish citizens and officialdom.  That must be one of the aspirations of the Presidency.</P>
        <P>The former United States President, George H. W. Bush, referred to building a kinder, gentler America.  We should use this Presidency to rebuild a kinder, gentler Europe with which the citizens feel more comfortable and at ease.  We must take the Presidency to the people in so far as we can.  I appreciate the need for economic effectiveness and efficiency but it is important that people, from Castletownbere to Donegal and Galway Bay to Rosslare, are all touched in some way by the Presidency and the meetings and politics of the Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is most enjoyable to watch joyous flirtation in the Chamber.  Most of us are usually dull and argumentative but I congratulate the Minister of State and Senator Bradford.  I welcome her to the House.  Senator Bradford referred to showcasing Ireland.  My recollection of the previous occasion on which Ireland held the Presidency was fleets of buses and high powered cars travelling from one location to another.  I would like that not to happen next year and I hope the representatives of other member states will get to meet ordinary people.  I acknowledge the Minister of State is working hard on that.  That is important, not alone because of where we find ourselves economically but also to transform the perception the EU is distant from us when it is part of what we are.</P>
        <P>The performance of our agricultural industry is phenomenal and we are experiencing growth.  What will be done during the Presidency to enhance growth?</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke referred to the European Globalisation Fund.  My most recent experience of dealing with those administering the fund relates to the closure of TalkTalk in Waterford.  I was in touch with a few of the workers earlier this week.  The bureaucracy blocking them from accessing funds for educational opportunities is nauseating and I hope the Minister of State can rid us of that.  It is deplorable that money available under the fund for former Dell workers was returned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Colm Burke made a good point about research and development.  We have an ambitious target but, unfortunately, the target under Europe 2020 is the same as for the previous ten-year strategy, the Lisbon strategy.  It was not achieved because member states dragged their heels and were lazy.  It is clear that if member states fulfil their obligations to achieve a target of 3% of GDP for investment in research and development, there would be greater opportunities for global companies and many private sources of investment in the Union.  Potentially we could contribute 2% of the Union&rsquo;s GDP simply by meeting existing commitments.  I do not want to be fatalistic about this.  Just because it did not happen in the past does not mean it cannot happen now.  The difference now as opposed to ten years ago is there is an impetus for growth and there is huge pressure from citizens on governments to deliver growth.  That applies in every member state.  The European Commission is taking steps to ensure member states fulfil their obligations through a variety of monitoring mechanisms which will be assessed by the European Council in June.  We are on our way to meeting the targets and that will help to address the shortfall we are experiencing in research and development at European level.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Senator&rsquo;s proposal for a 5% VAT rate on construction jobs is interesting.  I had not heard about this proposal previously.  It is not contemplated under the new EU budget framework.  The two options under the multi-annual financial framework 2014-2020 relate to VAT and the financial transactions tax, FTT.  It is clear the focus has shifted to the FTT, although some governments have changed or are developing their position on that.  I do not know a whole lot about it but I am interested in any concrete proposals the Senator may have which we could bring to the table.  The Government is serious about bringing forward concrete proposals to stimulate growth and job creation in the Union.  The treaty is not about growing money on trees, as I have said repeatedly over recent days and weeks.  The fantasy options we are presented with by certain political parties and individuals will not wash.  We have to be innovative and creative but we also have to be realistic.  We can do a huge amount.  This is an example of a concrete proposal about which I am interested in hearing more.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senator Higgins for her intervention. I outlined in my introductory remarks the general priorities of the Presidency, which I can summarise.  We want to restore macroeconomic stability to the eurozone and the European Union as whole by implementing the new governance rules and procedures and that will still be on the table during our Presidency.  It is a hugely important element of the fiscal treaty.  All participating member states will have ratified the treaty by the end of the year and it will be up to us to take it forward.  That will be very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The promotion of growth and employment creation is the key to everything and our main objective for the Presidency.  My interdepartmental working group focuses on the policy side.  We are looking at ways by which we can leverage our potential during the first half of 2013 and put the growth agenda at the heart of every Department.  This will be relevant, even in areas we may not have considered previously, including health where there is considerable potential for engaging in research and development, as one Senator noted.  We are trying to be creative and it is a work in progress.  It is eight months until the beginning of our programme.</P>
        <P>As Senator Terry Leyden noted, we have great experience of running a Presidency.  Other countries are almost hyperactive in debating and agreeing their programmes one year in advance, but that is not the way the world works.  The European agenda is a moving one.  We will take our priorities and advance them during the Presidency.  However, we must also be mindful of the issues that will arise and which we will have to address.  We must strike a balance.  It is too soon to set in stone our key themes and priorities sector by sector.  However, the House can rest assured that growth and job creation will be at their heart.</P>
        <P>The big ticket item for us, one which will most likely be on the agenda in 2013, is the multi-annual financial framework, the budget for the European Union from 2014 to 2020.  Sometimes I become frustrated when I hear people discussing the lack of a stimulus at European level in the context of the fiscal treaty debate.  The budget will be in excess of &euro;1 trillion.  Some &euro;1,025 billion will be pumped into the farming sector, Cohesion funding, road building, the provision of broadband and Internet facilities, and so on.  Every sector benefits more or less from the budget.  It is vital for this country because 85% of our receipts are under the CAP.  CAP funding is an element of the budget.  The overall project will be a huge task and the discussions may still be on the agenda for conclusion during the first part of our Presidency.  If that is the case, or even if they have been concluded before our Presidency by the Cypriots, we will have to follow through on all of the sectoral legislative agendas which we will be obliged to negotiate and bring through the European Parliament.  I have already been warned that I will be camping in the European Parliament for most of the Presidency because it will be my job to steer through all of these dossiers.  It will be a testament to the capability and competence of the Government if we are in a position to bring them to fruition and ensure we deliver the Common Fisheries Policy, the Common Agricultural Policy and a Cohesion Fund policy with which we can live and is acceptable to all member states.  This will be a considerable challenge which is the third key element of our agenda and directly linked with the jobs and growth agenda.  It is not divisible in any way.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Bradford asked a question about the physical arrangements.  The Government has taken a decision to host 11 informal ministerial meetings in Dublin during the Presidency, fewer than we have had in the past.  There will be approximately 167 meetings in total.  It is a logistical nightmare to try to plan everything.  During our Presidency in 2004 approximately 65 venues were used throughout the country and the cost was astronomical.  I cannot begin to outline the cost implications of bringing interpreters, officials, translation booths, equipment and everything required to various locations throughout the country.  This is in addition to the security risks of bringing in Ministers.  There is a very significant security requirement to be met.  Few venues in the country fit the bill.  Dublin Castle is the best venue.  It ticks all of the boxes from the point of view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of security.  It has interpretation booths and everything else laid on.  It is straightforward and cost-effective.  Cost effectiveness must be our priority.  I agree with the point made by Senator Denis Landy.  The way to sell the European Union to our citizens is not to bring convoys of black Mercedes limousines to Ashford Castle or Dromoland Castle or any other salubrious venue.  We should be clear about this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>When I attend a ministerial meeting, I want to arrive, do my business and get out of there as quickly as possible, as we all have busy agendas.  Ministers do not come to sample the local cuisine, fishing and so on.  That is not the way the world works.  The bang for our buck in terms of the investment required to bring Ministers to other parts of the country and what we get out of it is negligible.  We should be wise, therefore, in how we go about showcasing Ireland during the Presidency.  My firm view and conviction is that holding informal ministerial meetings is not the way to do this.  However, there are 450 other meetings, some of which will take place outside the capital.  For example, there will be meetings on innovation, research and science and regional fora on some of the sectoral issues.  These will take place outside Dublin.</P>
        <P>There is another more exciting approach and I thank Senator Fiach Mac Conghail for his advice and guidance on this plan.  The cultural programme is how we will showcase the Presidency outside Dublin.  This is more real and tangible.  We are keen to get communities involved in the Presidency from grassroots level up in a hands-on way.  We are working with various stakeholders, including the Arts Council and Culture Ireland.  The Minister responsible, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, and I are co-chairing a working group on the topic.  We are bringing together stakeholders and examining every opportunity.  The issue of festivals and other events was raised by one Senator.  We are in the process of planning in this regard.  Every event known to mankind which will take place on the island in the first six months of the year will have a European flavour and be used as an opportunity to showcase European culture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to get back to basics.  There has been reference to a disconnect with the European Union, a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; outlook and a sense of the Union being somehow removed and not a part of our daily lives.  What brings it all down to earth and back to basics is our shared culture.  As Europeans, we have shared values.  We need to understand more about each other.  We should learn to appreciate that what binds us together is what we believe in and what we stand for, and that we appreciate each other&rsquo;s cultures.  We should get back to learning more about our culture, language, dance, music, etc.  That is how we can connect Irish citizens with the European Union.  We have exciting proposals in this regard, including twinning projects, festivals and various other events.  There is an exciting proposal from Cork city on my desk.  It involves the private sector, Cork Chamber of Commerce and Cork City Council.  I have spoken to other local authorities and called on them to come forward with proposals.  That is a better way.  Having black Mercedes limousines, outriders and flashing lights is not the image we wish to project and it would be in no one&rsquo;s interests.  A more real way of doing this would be to bring in citizens from other member states through twining projects and invite them to attend festivals.  We can also piggyback on the Gathering festival which will be a very significant event in 2013.  I am in discussions with the relevant Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in this regard.  Senators should not take the view that because we are holding 11 informal ministerial meetings in Dublin Castle, events will not be happening elsewhere in the country.  It will be the most real and live Presidency we have ever seen on a regional basis throughout the country.  It will be far more relevant for ordinary citizens and I hope they will see it this way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Naturally, we will be using our embassy network throughout the European Union and beyond to showcase Ireland.  Recently, I was in Singapore and Brunei attending a foreign Ministers' meeting of Asian and European countries.  I  held several bilateral meetings with various countries, including Malaysia and the Philippines.  These are growing economies and we are trying to attract investment to Ireland.  I plied the usual line to the effect that we have a favourable tax rate, speak English and are in the eurozone, and it was all interesting to them.  However, as soon as I pointed out that we would take over the Presidency of the European Union next year, they became even more interested.  Our embassies, not only in the European Union but elsewhere throughout the globe, will be showcasing the fact that we are in a position of leadership at European level during the six month period.  Others are interested in this; they like it and see it as positive.  It is something we can leverage to our advantage during the course of the Presidency.</P>
        <P>How can we use agriculture?  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, is playing a blinder in the work he has been doing in promoting agri-foods throughout Europe and the globe.  The CAP negotiations will be the key issue for us during the Presidency.  It is tricky one because when we are in the chair, we try to reach consensus while putting forward our position, but no one can do this better than the Irish and already we are doing the groundwork.  The General Affairs Council engages in horizontal negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework.  We agree the broad parameters and headline figures and send them for agreement at the European summit by the Heads of Government, but the sectoral negotiations on the detail are carried out by the relevant sectoral Ministers.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will be leading for us and I am confident he will do so well.  We will also use the semi-State agencies.  I have chaired a number of meetings with semi-State agencies about availing of opportunities to promote Ireland.  Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia and all other stakeholders will be working hard in the build up to and during our Presidency to showcase Irish food, tourism and so on.  That work is well under way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take the point about the globalisation fund.  It is frustrating.  One of the key objectives in the new budget outline published by the Commission is simplification.  It is a word we are hearing repeatedly and now we have to deliver on it because bureaucracy is killing the European Union on so many levels, including the small and medium enterprises side, and from the point of view of drawing down funding, whether it be for the arts, from the globalisation fund or anything else.  We must get to grips with this issue, on which every member state agrees.  We must reduce bureaucracy.  The issue will be at the core of our negotiating policy on the budget and also during our Presidency.</P>

They will be flown in Dublin Castle, but it is important that they are flown in Parliament also.</P>

The financial transactions tax levy would raise &euro;500 million a year, a substantial amount of money, although there are pluses and minuses in that regard.  Has a definitive position been taken on that issue yet?  Will it be discussed during the Presidency, or will it be resolved in advance of it?  </P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that we should showcase good practice models.

	<P>I remind the Minister of State that in a previous Irish Presidency some of the best showcases of Ireland took place in the heart of the national park at Muckross House, which is available.  I mention this to the Minister of State because I have no doubt she will bear it in mind.  She has said they are anxious that the leaders will see the country.  I make this proposal to her because there is not a better place than our premier national park.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Terry Leyden made a number of points in his original intervention, but his proposal that the flags be flown in public places nationwide is excellent and one I will pursue.  I agree with him as it affects these Houses also.  It was a great source of pride this week to see the flags flying here and we must remind ourselves of the key role we played in the enlargement of the European Union with the accession of ten member states in 2004.  It was an emotional time that signified for me the reunification of Europe and so on.  Ireland can be extremely proud of the role it played at the time.</P>
        <P>On the question of holding a major event to mark 40 years, I agree entirely.  We are considering holding a public conference to explore Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union and how we want to shape its future.  We need to do some soul searching about that because I am getting tired of the tit-for-tat debates.  We do not debate European issues in a meaningful way.  We only debate them when we hold a referendum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is hostile, partisan, aggressive and unfortunate.  If we can engage the people during our Presidency, we will be doing them, the country and the European Union a great service.  I take the Senator&rsquo;s point and will consider what else we might be able to do, but we are working on a proposal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding schools, I launched the Blue Star pilot programme this year and it is hugely successful.  I am pleased to say one of the big Europe Day events held yesterday in St. Laurence&rsquo;s School in Greystones featured on the RTE children&rsquo;s news programme yesterday evening.  It was a fantastic event for anybody who wanted to be uplifted.  I am sometimes accused of being too pro-European Union in certain quarters.  I am unashamedly pro-European Union because the EU has been fantastic for this country, the Continent and the world in the role it has played in shaping global policy and in terms of innovations, the social progress made and so on.  It was wonderful yesterday to see children from different parts of Europe coming together with Irish children who were dressed up and carrying the flags of the different countries.  It was a fantastic occasion and I was proud to be part of it.  The Blue Star programme is a pilot programme and we want to crank it up next year, although I will need funding from somewhere.  The skies may open up and deliver it, but we&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Private sector support should be available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Possibly.  I am examining some possibilities in that regard, but we must expand the programme next year.  There was an enormous demand this year.  Everybody wanted to participate, but we had limited resources.  The programme is vital in terms of our strategy for communicating during the Presidency.</P>
        <P>To reply to Senator Fidelma Healy Eames&rsquo;s question on the financial transactions tax, we have a position, but it is fair to say it is nuanced.  We agree unquestionably with having a financial transactions tax, if it was to be introduced on the global stage.  If the G20 was to say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; it would be fantastic.  We are examining with a cautious eye proposals at European level.  I do not want to get into too much technical detail, but the original Commission proposal would have led to double taxation.  It was a flawed proposal.  The Commission is coming back with what could be called a watered down proposal, to which we will give serious consideration.  I can be categorical on one aspect.  We will not accept a financial transactions tax that will apply only to eurozone countries because our financial services sector is interconnected with the City of London and the United Kingdom and we would destroy our financial services sector in Dublin and elsewhere if we were to accept a financial transactions tax that would not apply in the United Kingdom.  That is non-negotiable; it is a red line issue for us.  At EU level, we are more open to discussion of it, but we will view any proposal made with a sceptical eye.</P>
        <P>On the holding of a high level event on youth unemployment, an event is planned for February 2013.  This will come under the auspices of the Ministers for Education and Skills and Social Protection as it is within the remit of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council.  I am not certain if the event will fulfil precisely the role the Senator is advocating, but I will discuss the matter.  Certainly, an event is envisaged.</P>

        <P>I have proposed to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, Deputy Dominic Hannigan, that I provide the joint committee with a full and comprehensive briefing on the Presidency in June.  I had hoped to do so much sooner, but it has not been practical to do so, as everyone is busy and tied up with the referendum.  The committee, for instance, has been holding hearings in advance of the referendum.  The briefing I have proposed will be my first after the referendum.  The Seanad could also have an input in this regard.  It should not only be a case of me appearing before the House to tell Senators what is happening.  I want to receive feedback and constructive suggestions, of which we have had a number today.  Perhaps we might have even greater engagement on the Presidency and the opportunities it offers.  We need more concrete suggestions and positive inputs from Members of both Houses and the Seanad is ideally placed to fulfil this role.  In tandem with the meeting with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, the Seanad may wish to arrange a discussion to take place after the referendum, perhaps in June.  I would be pleased to participate in such a discussion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, to the House.  Before we begin, I remind Senators that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment, who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  Each amendment on Report Stage must be seconded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;9.&mdash;(1) This Act shall not apply:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) to the evaluation of educational course materials, course designs, evaluation structures and materials that have been analysed and adjudicated upon by an external examiner appointed by the academic council and the governing body of a previously established university, the National University of Ireland, an educational institution established as a university under section 9 of the Act of 1997 and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) to the evaluation of research outputs or research processes that have been subjected to any form of academic peer review that was deemed to be valid and acceptable by the academic council and the governing body of a previously established university, the National University of Ireland, an educational institution established as a university under section 9 of the Act of 1997 and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) to student evaluations of staff that have managerial or human resource implications;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) to any additional pedagogical, didactic or research activities that have been subjected to external examination or academic peer review that have been enumerated by the academic council and the governing body of a previously established university, the National University of Ireland, an educational institution established as a university under section 9 of the Act of 1997 and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) The Authority created under this Act shall not in any way hamper, inhibit or run contract to the principles of academic freedom and tenure as outlined in the Act of 1997.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It gives me pleasure to move this amendment in my name.  I have been very concerned about this legislation in the two previous discussions we had in the House.  The non-controversial part of the Bill is in the amalgamation of HETAC and FETAC.  The controversial part, as far as my constituents are concerned, is the intention of the Minister to pressurise the universities into abolishing their own quality body and procedures, following ministerial and departmental pressures, when this Bill becomes law.  This raises serious questions.</P>
        <P>Section 14 of the Universities Act 1997 states a university, in performing its functions, shall:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) have the right and responsibility to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of its internal and external affairs, and</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) be entitled to regulate its affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and traditions and the traditional principles of academic freedom[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">The discharge of these duties by the universities is through a system of external examiners, typically from abroad.  They see the vital examination questions first.  They read all the first class honours scripts, they read the failed scripts, they read all the marginal scripts, and they take a random sample.  That provides Irish universities with the international standing and reputation of the home university of the international external examiner.  That is extremely valuable because universities are international institutions.  Attempts by Marlborough Street to bring them under some kind of quango&rsquo;s thumb are seriously opposed within the sector.</P>
        <P>Statements at earlier stages that there has been consultation about this are incorrect.  I have been a member of the governing body of a university for the past two and a half years and it has never been discussed.  In the case of charter universities, the charter cannot be altered without the consent of the people to whom the charter was awarded.  These discussions have not taken place.  There seems to be a momentum in the Department to do this, regardless of the wishes of the universities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I submit to the Minister of State that the external examiner system is working.  I tried to take research out of this Bill the last day, and that was refused by the Minister of State.  The idea that a quango can evaluate research, when it is conducted and published in international journals, is bizarre to say the least.</P>
        <P>The third aspect in the current system of quality control consists of the quality reviews.  Unlike the Department, the Comptroller and Auditor General, when he reviewed Irish universities in 2010, reported the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the peer review, considering their size, Finland, Ireland and Sweden were the countries with most universities pointed out by their peers as being excellent. Ireland was ranked first out of the 28 countries for which the recruiter review measure was calculated.  Recruiters regard the universities in Ireland and in the UK as providing highly employable graduates.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I do not know honestly what problem this quango is supposed to be addressing.  I see it interfering in the way we run universities, and interfering with international status.  We have to compete with Harvard, Yale, Oxford and Cambridge, and this interference in our autonomy by a quango of eight people, all appointed by the Minister, does not sit well with that.</P>
        <P>For those who want to go on to do graduate work, Irish universities, my own in particular, have qualifications <i>ad eundem gradum</i> &mdash; at the same step &mdash; as Oxford and Cambridge.  We have also sent people to Harvard, Yale and Princeton.  It works.  There is no need for this interference in how universities run their affairs.</P>
        <P>I think the Department is way out of touch. This system has worked for nearly 400 years.  The Webb and McDowell history of TCD shows that examination system was introduced there in 1637.  Their book states that: &ldquo;Dublin, in fact, possesses the questionable distinction of being the cradle of the public examination system.&rdquo;  We had the examination system before Oxford and Cambridge.  It is validated by external examiners internationally.  The research is validated internationally by the editors of international journals.  The graduates are highly employable as confirmed to us by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on September 2010.  I have repeatedly asked that we do not interfere with the autonomy of Irish universities.</P>
        <P>These are charter corporations.  A charter is a binding agreement between the king who granted the charter and the successors.  It is binding on both in perpetuity.  It cannot be altered because a Minister or a quango feels that they do not like what is happening in universities.  I would like to draw attention to the Supreme Court case in the US in 1819, where the government of New Hampshire attempted to interfere in the affairs of Dartmouth College, which was a charter corporation:</P>
        <P LI="1">The opinion of the Court, after mature deliberation, is that there is a contract, the obligation of which cannot be impaired, without violating the constitution of the United States.  This opinion appears . . . to be equally supported by reason, and by former decisions of this court [. . .]</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It has been shown, that the charter is a contract on the part of the government, that the property with which the charity is endowed, shall be for ever vested in a certain number of persons, and their successors, to subserve the particular purposes designated by the founder, and to be managed in a particular way [. . .]</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Nothing seems better settled, at the common law, than the doctrine, that the crown cannot force upon a private corporation a new charter[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This unnecessary and unjustified interference in the internal affairs of Irish universities, when we are trying to compete internationally, raises the appalling spectre that we are now going forward as a country that cannot tolerate even one autonomous university, no matter how highly it performs internationally or how well it serves its students.  We have students from the United States and on Erasmus schemes.  They regard the availability of and contact with Irish academic staff as superior to their home places.</P>
        <P>We have been convicted in our absence and this legislation has been brought in.  There should have been proper consultation, at least with the Chancellor of the National University of Ireland, the former Senator Maurice Manning.  One cannot set aside the examination system simply because it is disliked.  Universities seem to be innocent bystanders of the wasteful amalgamation of HETAC and FETAC.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill will paint an appalling picture of Ireland by trying to turn universities into a branch of the civil service.  They cannot survive that.  We must have divergence of opinion and view, choice and different ways of doing things.  When our system is acceptable on an international stage and we are trying to reach out to foreign investment, why choose to nobble Irish universities in this way?  That is why I have proposed this amendment.</P>
        <P>If there are already quality assurance schemes in established universities like Trinity College Dublin, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the National University of Ireland and they are working satisfactorily to all concerned, why set up a quango of eight ministerial appointments to intervene in something of which I had hoped this country would be proud?  I strongly ask the House to consider the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendment.  Having worked on the fringe and, in recent years, directly in the academic medical and academic scientific sectors for the past 19 years, I have a certain perspective on this matter.  It is that we have not supported the sector well and that any deficiencies that exist within the sector cry out for reform of the way we organise, fund and support them. They do not cry out for increased bureaucratisation, which the proposed legislation will do.  It will bring an additional bureaucratic oversight into organisations that are struggling badly for their resources.</P>
        <P>The historically strong record of our universities and the unparalleled record our medical, science and other graduates have when they go abroad and rapidly develop fine international reputations that reflect well on our organisations are not reflected in the objective metrics of the international league tables.  One must ask why that is.  Are we getting an inferior product matriculating in?  Clearly, we are not.  Do people come out at the other side with degrees that are not internationally recognised?  This is absolutely not the case.  With Irish qualifications, one can have a huge level of respect and recognition and a high chance of advancement.  The metrics used by league tables reflect resourcing in the institutions, principally factors such as staff to student and staff to faculty ratios, which are dismal in Ireland.  They are way off the bottom of the scale.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I can give an example from an area where I speak most authoritatively.  My colleagues here are bored by my repetition of this point.  In our small republic, we have six medical schools.  I am not saying that is bad, good or wrong, but if we are to have six medical schools, they need to be appropriately resourced.  These six medical schools churn out a calibre of graduate that has no problem walking into North America, Australia or the European Union with an Irish qualification and being recognised and getting good employment.  The total number of consultant level full-time faculty across those six institutions is 60, which is ten per school.  We have checked it.  Harvard Medical School has 1,500.  That is a salient fact.  When we reflect on the fact that all the Irish universities have dropped out of the higher rankings and out of the top 100 in the university pecking order, we must ask the hard question about resourcing and the freedom to get things done.</P>
        <P>Which problem are we fixing by introducing this extra bureaucracy?  The answer is none.  We are going to create more problems.  People who are already doing, by international standards, two, three, four or ten people&rsquo;s jobs will now be answering to an additional bureaucracy.  The track record of bureaucracies in this country is that they tend to be comprised of inexpert people and rapidly become self-interested.  I do not mean self-interested in any corrupt sense, but that the body itself develops a corporatist mentality to which its members assume primary loyalty.  This will not be good for the rugged academic independence we should be fostering in our universities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When one looks at the service delivery or non-academic part of the medical system, one sees a system that has the lowest number of doctors, specialists and general practitioners, the longest waiting lists, and so on, but the response of the bureaucracy that runs our health system &mdash; the permanent government of the Civil Service and the various health quangos &mdash; is always that what we need is another bureaucracy.  As a result we get HIQA, the special delivery unit or various other multi-alphabetised, acronymic organisations.  If we are short of paediatric surgeons, if we have one third the number Scotland has, and God knows Scotland is not great by international standards, if we have fewer in the Republic than they have in the North and if our children are waiting a year or two years for operations, there is a certain element of joining the dots about what needs to happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The same thing applies in the non-medical and non-scientific academic structures.  We need a critical appraisal of the resourcing and funding mechanisms we have put in place.  There may be an argument for reassessing, at some stage in the future, the way we grant degree and diploma recognition, although it is not obvious to me that there is.  One of the few things that seem to be working in the Irish academic structure at present is that people come out with diplomas, degrees, doctorates, masters, baccalaureates and so on that have high degrees of international recognition.  What is the problem that is being fixed?  What resources are going to be redirected into this that could be directed into the core deficiencies of the academic system?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I strongly support Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendment.  I know there are now smart people in Government looking at educational issues and I hope they will see this in a non-partisan fashion and reflect on the wisdom of proceeding with this aspect of what I believe will be a degree of over-regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is very welcome to the Seanad for this debate.  I add my voice to those of both the previous speakers.  The evidence is that Trinity College has existed for, I think, 420 years and is managed very well.  The other universities have been there for well over 100 years.  Not only have they succeeded for that length of time but, as Senator Crown has said, they have enjoyed international recognition.  That did not happen by accident.</P>
        <P>I know the argument will be made that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  The Government will say it is making a large contribution to the upkeep of the universities and, therefore, should have a say in what they do.  The fact the universities have existed so long and so successfully and with such international recognition means tampering with them, and particularly adding an extra layer of bureaucracy, will mean the money aspect will, in the long term, take precedence over academic achievement.  Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendment is worthy of consideration and I urge the Minister of State to consider it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I assume that the purpose of Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendment is to address his concern that this Bill will somehow allow or require the authority to interfere in the academic life of universities in terms of how they organise their programmes of education and research and how they quality assure those programmes.  The authority&rsquo;s role on quality assurance in previously established universities and providers in general will simply be to act as an external quality assurance agency to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of a university&rsquo;s own internal quality assurance procedures.  There is no intention on the part of the Minister or the State in the legislation to somehow allow anything further than that or for the qualifications and quality assurance authority of Ireland, QQAI, to go into areas in which it has no expertise to assess the quality or otherwise of tuition, research or any other aspect of university life, other than to periodically assess the universities' own internal quality assurance procedures which universities themselves find valuable within educational provision as a whole.</P>
        <P>This mirrors the review provisions currently set out in section 35 of the Universities Act 1997 with the authority replacing the governing authority of the university as the review body.  In 2002 the seven university governing authorities, including the board of Trinity College, established the Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB, because they rightly acknowledged the importance of ongoing quality assurance assessment of the work they do in each of their institutions.  They passed the review function under the 1997 Act to the IUQB in recognition of the importance of the external review of quality assurance.  Since 2009 the IUQB has evaluated six of the seven universities under the Universities Act, most recently Trinity College in March of this year.  The authority will continue the role of the IUQB in that regard.  No change is suggested in the relationship between the IUQB and the universities in terms of how the review process is carried out and on the level of detail it goes into in the internal functioning and daily life of the university.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 28 requires universities to prepare quality assurance procedures.  The Bill also provides that any quality assurance procedures already in place under the 1997 Act are carried forward to meet that requirement.  These procedures include long-standing university-organised or internal quality assurance procedures such as the external examiner system which is an internal quality assurance procedure, as the university itself selects those examiners.  The involvement of external subject matter experts is a central and important feature of a university&rsquo;s internal quality assurance procedures.  It is fully acknowledged that the community of scholarship does not end at the walls of the institution and it is only experts in the discipline concerned that can really judge the academic value of assessment work in research.  The authority&rsquo;s institutional level review role does not in any way seek to replace that function.  However, the authority, in reviewing the effectiveness of a university&rsquo;s overall quality assurance procedures, would examine whether external examination and peer review are being universally applied and that systems are in place to ensure that reports and recommendations arising are properly considered and acted upon.  In doing so the authority will use its expert international review panels sourced from outside the authority&rsquo;s own staff.  Similarly, student involvement in quality assurance processes is of critical importance.  The student view cannot be sidelined or ignored by institutions.  However, academic staff have a right to fair treatment and any human resource implications that might arise from quality assurance processes will be handled under existing and well-established procedures.  Academic tenure and terms and conditions of employment are not affected in any way by the Bill and there is no need to place an exclusion in the Bill in this area.  It is important to note that any new quality assurance procedures established by a previously established university in accordance with the Bill will not require the agreement of the authority, unlike for other relevant providers.  Instead, previously established universities will be required to consult with the authority and this reflects the traditional autonomy of universities.  With regard to subsection (2) of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, nothing in the Bill limits in any way the academic freedom or tenure established in the 1997 Act, as that Act remains intact, save for the deletion of section 35, which is largely recreated in Part 3 of the current Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett spoke previously about reaching out to international investors and students to encourage them to invest in and study in this country.  In recent months I have visited a number of Asian countries where we have a strong and fruitful relationship with many third level providers in that region.  One of the reasons the relationship has been so fruitful and strong is that it is recognised in those countries that we do have very high standards of quality assurance in place.  High quality degrees and qualifications which are recognised internationally as being of the very highest standard come about for many different reasons.  One of the reasons they are respected internationally is because we have stringent quality assurance procedures in place across all of our educational provision.  I do not see any rationale for somehow excluding universities from that process.  Therefore, I cannot support the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon.  I should have welcomed him to the House in my introductory remarks.  I believe the universities should be excluded, which is why I tabled the amendment.  They are competing at the highest possible international standard.  This is a vote of no confidence in them by the Government.  We are competing in research and in teaching with people of the highest standards worldwide.  The Minister of State confirmed the intention to abolish the IUQB, which was set up by the universities, and to replace it with another body.  That is an undermining of the authority and of the autonomy of the universities.  I will press the amendment because it is a dark day for Irish universities when they are treated in this way by the Department of Education and Skills, in particular in terms of the route that it now forces the colleges to go in legal terms.  If one changes the charter of a university, one must do so by a Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  That was done previously and it was extremely expensive to the House and to those moving the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not see the necessity for interference to the degree that is being proposed.  We are giving the quality.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed that, as have international employers.  Likewise, universities in other countries have confirmed that, yet the Department wants to abolish an independent body and replace it with its quango.  I propose that my amendment should be accepted.  I am not satisfied that the Department of Education and Skills realises the importance of an autonomous university system and its value to this country.  It has served the country in a splendid way, as Senator Quinn observed, for well on 400 years.</P>
        <P>The problems facing this country were not caused by the universities but by bureaucracy and by failures in the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and other Departments.  The universities are being punished for a collapse they did not cause.  In fact, they have remained the shining lights in the Irish firmament and have kept going despite all of the difficulties this country is facing.  Bureaucrats will always seek to extend their powers into other areas, but this is one area where that should not be allowed to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I assure the Senator that I would not support any legislation which would seek to impose added bureaucracy in an area where it is not required.  I do not concede that this particular Bill is adding to the bureaucratic load facing third level institutions.  In 2003 the institutions collectively acknowledged the importance of having a robust and effective quality assurance process in place across all of the colleges and, to that end, came together to form the Irish Universities Quality Board.  The proposed qualifications and quality assurance authority of Ireland will simply continue that role.  I do not know how often I must repeat that the authority does not, at any time in the future, intend to intervene in the life of any university other than at the very upper echelons in order to ensure its own quality assurance processes are as robust and effective as they should be.  No more and no less than that is envisaged.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On Committee Stage, Senator Barrett proposed an amendment to section 9(1)(<i>b</i>), which currently states that the authority shall &ldquo;formulate national policy on quality assurance and enhancement in education and training&rdquo;.  The effect of that amendment would have been to replace the authority&rsquo;s responsibility for the formulation of policy with a responsibility to guide policy.  I indicated we would give further consideration to this matter with a view to bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage.  In that context, amendment No. 2 will replace the authority&rsquo;s responsibility to formulate policy with a responsibility instead to advise the Minister in respect of policy.  I hope this addresses Senator Barrett&rsquo;s concerns.</P>

	<P>On Committee Stage, Senator Barrett expressed some concern regarding the provisions relating to the appointment of members of the appeals panel.  In particular, he stated that the requirement that members of the appeals panel should have &ldquo;a special interest or expertise in, or knowledge of, the functions of the Authority&rdquo; was too narrow.  The Senator suggested that members should also have knowledge of educational matters more generally.  The purpose of amendment No. 4 is to address Senator Barrett&rsquo;s concerns by inserting the phrase &ldquo;education and training&rdquo; into the relevant subsection, thereby ensuring members may also have a special interest or expertise in, or knowledge of, education and training more generally.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) at least two people who are representatives of learners.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State.  I spoke on this matter on Second Stage and I will not repeat what I said at that point.  The purpose of the Bill is to improve the student experience and to ensure the education students across the entire sector are receiving is top class.  The authority is to have eight members and we are of the view that two of them should be students.  This is particularly the case because the newly constituted authority will have responsibility for an extremely diverse sector which will encompass everything from further education right up to fourth level postgraduate education.  We are of the view that students from across the sector should be represented on the authority.</P>
        <P>I was a student representative for two years and I am aware that it can be extremely lonely when there is only one student voice present.  It is important to ensure there is very effective, rather than token, student representation on the authority.  That is why we suggest two student representatives should be appointed.  I hope the Minister of State can accept the amendment.  As there will be eight members of the authority, appointing the two individuals to whom I refer would mean students would form one quarter of the overall membership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment, which is good and sound in nature.  This is a very important new departure for the Department in the context of the establishment of the qualifications and quality assurance authority.  There are thousands of students throughout the country, and Ireland will only prosper through having people who are well qualified and who are ready to undertake the challenges on offer within the private and public sectors.  In that context, the needs of students must be recognised.  I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposal to the effect that there will be one student representative on the board of the new authority.  However, I am of the opinion there should be two such representatives in order that a broader viewpoint might be put forward on behalf of students.  In view of the fact we have both universities and institutes of technology, appointing two representatives might ensure the scope of student opinion on the authority would be more diverse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill provides for an eight-person board, which will include an international representative and also a representative of learners.  It has been decided to move away from the stakeholder nomination model which applies to the National Institute of Quality Assurance, NIQA, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, and the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, as it would be difficult to maintain the board at an effective size without leaving some fundamental gaps in representation.  I am committed to strong learner involvement at all levels of the quality assurance process.  In formulating the new entity, SOLAS, Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Oideachais Leanunaigh agus Scileanna, we are exploring many different mechanisms for ensuring there will be significant learner involvement across that organisation as well.</P>
        <P>Student involvement is critical to the successful operation of quality assurance processes within institutions and the authority.  The Bill specifically provides that institutional quality assurance procedures should include evaluation by learners of the education and training provided to them.  Having a learner representative on the board of the authority is important and ensures the student perspective is provided at that level.  However, this is only part of how learners will engage with the authority once it is constituted.  Students will be involved in the committees and the many panels established by the authority.  The authority will adopt a strong consultative approach and will engage formally and informally with a wide range of stakeholders, including learners.  This will be the most appropriate and effective means by which learners can ensure their interests are promoted, particularly given the broad range of sectors covered by the authority&rsquo;s functions.  One student representative on an eight person board is sufficient to give that learner perspective at that level.  Accordingly, I cannot support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We will be pressing the amendment.  Given the whole function of the authority will be about the student experience and ensuring it is top class, I do not believe having two learner representatives on a board of eight is unreasonable.  It was different when there were separate agencies covering different sectors.  Now that only one agency will examine the whole and diverse experience from short courses in the further education colleges right up to doctorate level, it is not reasonable to ask one student to represent the whole student experience on this board.  Two representatives out of eight would enhance the whole work of the authority and be of benefit to the board, making its work more effective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The board has eight members, comprising one international expert on quality assurance, the chair, whom one would expect to take a neutral position, and the chief executive officer.  This leaves five other representatives.  For two of these to be learner representatives would disproportionately skew representation on the board.  It is also important to note that once a person or individual is nominated or appointed to the board, rather than representing the sectoral interest from which they have emanated, they will actually work in the best interests of the board and education provision.  I do not see combative situations arising at board meetings.  Instead, it will be a more holistic approach.  To have one person representing the views of the student body is more than adequate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to present to the House this very important legislation.  I commence by highlighting the purpose of the legislation, the primary aim of which is to close an existing loophole in the law.  Under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, it is an offence to withhold information in respect of a serious criminal offence.  However, that provision of the 1998 Act specifically excludes sexual offences.  I am therefore bringing forward this Bill to ensure there is an obligation on persons who have knowledge of all serious offences, including sexual offences against children or vulnerable adults, to inform the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The Members in this House would be well aware of the content of published reports, such as the Ryan, Murphy and, more recently, Cloyne reports.  These provide a litany of quite shocking revelations concerning the sexual abuse of children and failure to respond to that abuse.  Members will also be aware of the further revelations over the past ten days concerning Fr. Brendan Smyth.  It is clear from these revelations and the various published reports that if those who had knowledge in the past of sexual offences committed against children had informed the Garda, many children who subsequently became the victims of abuse may have been protected from clerical sexual predators.  There is a compelling argument, therefore, for closing the current loophole in the law.</P>
        <P>As Members are also aware, the full scale of the abuse of children which has taken place in the past is still not fully known and new information is continuing to emerge.  The problem is not confined to offences against children, with a number of equally serious cases of vulnerable adults in institutional care being subject to serious sexual and physical abuse.  In drafting the Bill I must be very mindful of the fact that the balance of evidence suggests the majority of abuse of children or vulnerable adults takes place in a person&rsquo;s own home.  It is therefore important to reaffirm that we are not just concerned about issues of sexual abuse by persons in authority, be they in the Catholic Church or any other religious group or institutional settings.  It is important to state the Bill will apply to all persons, organisations and sectors of society.</P>
        <P>It is very important we produce legislation that affords protection from abuse to children or vulnerable persons in any scenario or location.  That is what the Bill is about.  Members of this House have been very supportive of this Bill when contributing to the consideration of the draft scheme of the legislation at the hearings by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Bill before us today has been drafted to include provisions to take account of the issues raised by the joint committee during the course of these hearings.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of this Bill it will be an offence to fail to disclose to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, without reasonable excuse, information concerning certain serious criminal offences where such offences are committed against a child or vulnerable adult.  These serious offences are listed in the Schedules to the Bill and all carry a penalty of imprisonment lasting five years or more.  They include most sexual offences and offences such as assault causing harm or serious harm, cruelty to a child, abduction of a child, manslaughter and murder.  The Bill also establishes some limited defences for persons charged under the Bill for persons such as a parent, guardian or medical professional acting in the interests of the health and well-being of the child or vulnerable person.</P>
        <P>I will outline to the House the key provisions contained in the Bill.  Section 1 is a standard interpretation section defining the terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 creates the offence of withholding information on serious offences against children.  I draw the attention of the House to a number of key provisions in this section.  It is only an offence to withhold information where the person knows or believes an offence has been committed and the person has information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of the offender.  This means a person is not under any obligation to inform the Garda of any vague rumours, innuendo or suspicions, and a person would only commit an offence if he or she has substantive information regarding an offence and fails, without reasonable excuse, to disclose that information to garda&iacute;.  This reflects similar offences contained in other Acts, such as the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and the Criminal Justice Act 2011 dealing with white collar crime.</P>
        <P>Section 2(2) provides that the legislation will only apply to information that a person receives or becomes aware of after the Bill becomes law.  Following consultation with the Attorney General, it was decided it would not be feasible to make it an offence to withhold information where the information had been received before the Bill was enacted.  There are potential legal concerns in making the Bill retrospective, particularly with regard to confidential information received prior to the law coming into force.  There are also practical issues and I am mindful of the fact that most abuse happens within families.  In many cases, the facts of the abuse would be known by siblings or other family members who are not the perpetrators.  Making the law retrospective and applicable to information received by a family member or a person who provided support to a victim many years ago would in many instances be unjust, potentially criminalising individuals who had in good faith decided it inappropriate to report an offence to the Garda at the time they became aware of it and who would not be able to show that their decision meets the revised standards required by the Bill.</P>
        <P>The new law will, therefore, apply to non-disclosure of information received after the Bill is passed, although it may relate to something that happened before its enactment.  This ensures that in respect of future actions, behaviours and responsibilities, there will be certainty and clarity in the law.</P>
        <P>Section 2 also provides that the victim cannot be guilty of an offence if he or she chooses not to disclose the offence against him or her.  This exclusion was welcomed during the consideration of the Bill by the joint committee. Subsection (3) confirms that the victim of an offence covered by the Bill cannot be guilty of the offence of withholding information where he or she does not report the offence to the Garda.</P>
        <P>Section 2(4) provides that the Bill is without prejudice to any right or privilege recognised in law.  In that regard, this provision is simply to allow the courts to use their normal discretion in considering issues of privilege.  There has been much media comment suggesting the Bill has an effect on the &ldquo;seal of confession&rdquo; or sacerdotal privilege.  As is the position with regard to the 1998 Act, there are no defences in this legislation which would specially apply to information received in the confessional box, nor is there a specific provision relating to the confessional.  It will continue to be a matter for a court before which a person is prosecuted to determine whether there is a particular privilege or whether it applies in the circumstances of a particular case.</P>
        <P>It must also be borne in mind that existing provisions under the criminal law for the protection of children continue to apply.  They include section 176 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which makes it an offence for a person with authority or control over a child or an abuser to intentionally or recklessly endanger a child by causing or permitting him or her to be placed or left in a situation which creates a substantial risk to him or her of being a victim of serious harm or sexual abuse.  It is also an offence to fail to take reasonable steps to protect a child from such a risk while knowing that he or she is in such a situation.</P>
        <P>It is worth stating the issue of sacerdotal privilege has never arisen with regard to the offences prescribed by the 2006 Act, nor in relation to the offences in the Bill currently covered by the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  It should be borne in mind that the issue of confession does not arise in the many cases of criminal offences identified in the Ryan, Murphy or Cloyne reports which all relate to complaints of abuse made to the church authorities by the victims or family members or members of the public.  Nor, as far we know, is it an issue with regard to the reprehensible activities of the late Fr. Brendan Smyth and many of the other priests who have during the past two decades been convicted and sentenced in the State for child abuse.  I am sure this House will be more informed in its discussions on this aspect of the Bill than certain sections of the media which in the context of the Bill have obsessed on the issue and largely ignored the substance of its provisions and the crucial role it will play not only in investigations into child abuse but also in child protection.</P>
        <P>Section 3 creates the offence of withholding information on certain offences against vulnerable adults.  It has the same structure and provisions as apply in section 2 in regard to withholding information on offences against children.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides for a range of defences for persons acting in the interests of the health and welfare of the victim.  It is important to note that nothing in the Bill will impede a victim, or any other person, at any time in going to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to report an offence. The defences in the Bill relate solely to circumstances where the victim chooses not to do this, or does not have the capacity to do so. They are also necessary to take account of the fact that many children or vulnerable persons who are victims of sexual abuse are at a very young age and often too traumatised by what has happened to them to be able to make an immediate report to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I have mentioned, sections 2(3) and 3 provide that the victim of an offence covered by the Bill cannot be guilty of the offence of withholding information where he or she does not report the offence to the Garda.  It follows from this provision that a person who does not report an offence, at the request of the victim, also has a legitimate defence.  This is set out in section 4(1).</P>
        <P Just="Left">In submissions to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality reference was made to the difficulty which arose when the victim did not have the capacity either to report the offence or to make a decision as to whether he or she wanted another person to report it on his or her behalf.  As I have pointed out, many victims of abuse do not have the capacity to report offences against them owing to their age or other vulnerability.  Such victims should be able to rely on another person to act on their behalf.  The Bill provides that where the victim does not have the capacity to form a view as to whether the commission of the offence should be disclosed to the Garda and the offender is not a family member, the parent or guardian can make known, on behalf of the victim, that he or she does not want the offence to be reported to the Garda.  An important safeguard in this circumstance is that the parent or guardian concerned must have reasonable grounds for acting on behalf of the child or vulnerable adult and must show that in so doing, he or she is acting in the best interest of the child.  He or she must also show that he or she had regard to the wishes of the child.  These provisions are set out in subsections (2) to (7) of section 4.</P>
        <P>Members will note that there is a presumption in section 4(2)that a child under 14 years of age does not have the capacity to decide whether he or she should report an offence.  They might wonder why this age has been chosen.  It is important to state a child of any age can, if he or she wishes, choose to report an offence.  Nothing in the Bill prevents this happening.  The reference to the age of 14 years in the Bill is to allow the parent or guardian to act on behalf of the child, where he or she is below that age limit.  The age of under 14 years has been chosen because a child of 14 years or over is legally considered to be competent to give evidence on oath or affirmation under the provisions of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992.  Having considered the options, the Government agreed that under 14 years is the most appropriate age.  The law would be inconsistent if it allowed a person of 14 years or over to give evidence under oath but did not recognise such persons as having the capacity to determine whether information on an offence against them should be disclosed.</P>
        <P>The Bill must give separate consideration to what provisions are appropriate if the victim does not have the capacity to report the offence and the offender is a family member.  In these circumstances it is considered that it is not appropriate for the parent or guardian to act on behalf of the child because of the potential conflict of loyalties within the family.  The Bill, therefore, provides in section 4(8) that in these circumstances a designated health care professional providing services for the child or vulnerable person in respect of the harm or injury caused by the offence may make it known that, in his or her view, the information on that offence should not be disclosed, provided he or she can show that he or she is acting for the purpose of protecting the health and welfare of the child or vulnerable adult. In making these provisions I am trying to ensure the Bill will not discourage a victim from seeking appropriate treatment at a time when he or she is too traumatised by what has happened to go through the additional trauma of making a report to the Garda.  It is, therefore, necessary that in cases where the victim is very severely traumatised a medical professional who is treating him or her can decide that it is not in the interests of his or her health and welfare to report the offence at that time.  It is important to note that the medical professional will still be under an obligation to notify the HSE of the abuse of a child under the Children First guidelines which are to be placed on a statutory footing by the Children First Bill.  The draft scheme of that Bill has been published by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and is under consideration by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  This separate obligation to notify the HSE contained in the Children First Bill is important to ensure that even where an offence is not reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under this Bill, the victim must receive the appropriate supports, treatment, monitoring and protection.  I anticipate that the number of cases in which it will be appropriate for a medical professional to decide on behalf of the victim that a report should not be made to the Garda in these circumstances will be limited in number.  In cases in which the victim is very severely affected by the offence, this provision will be vital in order to provide the most appropriate protection for his or her health and wellbeing and not put him or her under unnecessary pressure.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides in section 4(10) for persons providing counselling services to have similar defences to those available to a medical professional treating the victims.  In submissions to the Oireachtas joint committee a number of organisations which provide counselling and support services for victims of sexual abuse made the point that they often had to work with victims over an extended period of time before the victim could reach a decision whether to report an offence to the Garda.  I am anxious that in such circumstances the victims are not discouraged from accessing supports which they need because of concerns that in seeking them it will be a requirement to immediately report the crime to the Garda for the purposes of a criminal investigation or subsequent prosecution.</P>
        <P>As with all of the defences in the Bill, the priority is to protect the health and welfare of the victim.</P>
        <P>Section 5 sets out the penalties for persons guilty of an offence under the Bill.  It provides for penalties which vary from a class A fine and up to 12 months in prison to a sentence of up to ten years in prison, depending on the seriousness of the offence against a child or vulnerable adult in regard to whom information has been withheld.  The ten year penalty would apply in the most serious cases such as the withholding of information concerning the murder of a child.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides for the amendment of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 to ensure there is not any overlap or any duplication between the provisions of that Act and this Bill.  Section 7 is a standard provision allowing the Minister to make orders prescribing any matters which require such a provision.  Section 8 is a standard provision providing for expenses and section 9 is the Short Title and commencement provision.</P>
        <P>Schedule 1 sets out in detail the offences against children which must be reported to the Garda.  Schedule 2 sets out in detail the offences against vulnerable persons which must be reported to the Garda.  The offences are listed individually to provide complete clarity regarding the type of offences that constitute serious offences which must be reported under law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members will be aware this Bill is one element of a suite of legislation to protect children and vulnerable persons to which the Government is committed.  The Bill has been drafted to complement the operation of the upcoming Children First Bill and the national vetting bureau Bill.  It might be helpful to the House if I elaborate further on how the Bill is to harmonise with the proposed Children First Bill, the scheme of which is under consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The Government is bringing these two separate and distinct measures in recognition of the very separate and distinct roles of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE with regard to the protection of children and vulnerable persons.  Only the Garda can investigate a criminal offence against a child or vulnerable person.  Only the HSE can provide the necessary supports and monitoring of children at risk.</P>
        <P>This Bill addresses the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It requires that any person who has evidence that a person has committed a serious offence against a child or vulnerable person must provide the Garda with that information so that the Garda can investigate that alleged crime.</P>
        <P>The Children First Bill will address the role of the HSE.  It requires that relevant persons in a position to assess children at risk of abuse must provide the HSE with the information necessary to monitor and provide supports to a child who may have been abused.  Any criminal investigation will be conducted in a parallel investigation by the Garda.</P>
        <P>This Bill clearly states that it is in addition to and not in substitution for any other reporting requirements.  This recognises that the requirement to report information to the Garda and the requirement to report information to the HSE are separate and distinct measures which are necessary to protect children and vulnerable persons.  I am also pleased to inform the House that I will publish shortly the Bill to place the vetting of persons working with children and vulnerable adults on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>I thank the Members of this House who have already provided support for this Bill when contributing to the hearings by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I am sure the debate in this House on this Bill will be very informed and constructive.  I welcome the opportunity to commence the debate on the Bill in this House before it goes to the other House and I look forward to hearing what Senators have to say.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the Bill.  I compliment the Minister on introducing the legislation in the Seanad on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris made a point about Members sharing time but he is on the wrong track.  The matter was raised within the CPP as a housekeeping issue and it was not a Government edict or mandate.  I concur with my colleague, Senator Bacik, that the matter can be reviewed, if necessary.  My view is that a senior spokesperson with a particular portfolio or brief should not share time because it does reflect well on the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I broadly agree with the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the Bill.  The legislation went before the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and interesting submissions were received from a number of groups.  It is a worthwhile exercise and is a departure by the Government that Bills come before the Houses for vetting by the related committee.  That is a good thing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I do not wish to go into the full details of the Bill and wish to avoid repeating what the Minister has said, I have instead a number of queries for him.  I have raised the following issue a number of times in the House, not alone in this Seanad but also in previous ones.  When is it proposed to hold the promised referendum on the rights of children?  It is a central plank of this plethora of Bills governing the rights of children and the protection of children and vulnerable people.  In the previous Seanad the then Leader of the Opposition and now Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, along with others, was very animated on many occasions about the delay in holding the referendum.  I examined the Bill as a former chairman of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution many years ago and I am deeply concerned that it has taken a lot longer to hold a referendum than was ever envisaged by not just the last Government but also the preceding one.  I urge the Minister for Justice and Equality when he attends Cabinet meetings to endeavour, as far as possible, to bring the referendum forward.  I have made the point on numerous occasions that if a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights takes place, their rights will be upgraded as opposed to being protected within the family.  The referendum should stand alone and not be confused with other referenda, which would create problems in the minds of the public.</P>
        <P>I read the Ryan report and most of the Cloyne report and the abuse was appalling.  The Murphy report was another report on abuse.  There is a perception, probably a wrong one, that all the abuse of children, especially the sexual abuse, was primarily related to religious orders and priests.  As the Minister will be aware, statistics show that fewer than one in ten of abuse cases were perpetrated clerics.  Yesterday or the day before, I read that a former cleric was jailed for the persistent violation of a vulnerable person.  That is welcome news.</P>
        <P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the interesting proposal by Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady that a cross-Border investigation be conducted into the Brendan Smyth affair?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>If there was a cleric who epitomised the villainy, thuggery and serious nature of continuous child abuse, it was Fr. Brendan Smyth.  I was in this House when that saga caused the collapse of the then Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party Government and it is now, to put it mildly, affecting the position of the Catholic Primate of All Ireland, Cardinal Brady.  I saw some merit in the Cardinal&rsquo;s point that an investigation would give context to the despicable scenario of clerical child abuse that has been ongoing for several decades.  However, it flies in the face of our religious beliefs such as &ldquo;suffer little children who come unto me&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that there are certain exceptions and defences.  I read in a number of newspapers &mdash; the Minister referred to it as an obsession &mdash; about the protection of what a priest would be told in a confessional.  Under existing legislation, the angle is covered, irrespective of what is included in the new legislation.  The protection, moral or legal, of a priest who is told about a matter in a confessional is sacrosanct, but this legislation opens up the issue.</P>
        <P>I read with interest that in the course of the joint committee&rsquo;s public hearings it was stressed the legislation should not have unintended consequences for victims, which would be ultimately self-defeating in reporting abuse.  As the Minister probably read this, I would like him to elaborate on the measures he has taken in the Bill to address this concern.  There is no doubt about the importance of this legislation; it is part of a jigsaw of several Bills.</P>
        <P>It is hard to believe in 2012 that we are legislating to protect vulnerable adults and young people.  It is a sad reflection on our society.  I note that the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children recently launched the findings of a survey of child protection.  It found that 87% considered there was not enough information available on child protection and welfare issues.  This is staggering.  Of those surveyed, 57% said they would be nervous or unsure about reporting, or would not report a suspected case of child abuse or neglect.  That is worrying.  It was considered by 83% that children&rsquo;s rights were not protected to the same extent as adults&rsquo; rights.  A balance must be struck.  When the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution was addressing the need for a children&rsquo;s rights referendum, the importance of striking the right balance was emphasised.  We do not want situation where a bright, belligerent teenager would invoke the Constitution to make life hell for his or her parents.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill.  While I cannot envisage it, I would not rule out tabling amendments on Committee or Report Stages, but we wholeheartedly welcome this legislation.  I hope it will be an extra weapon in the legislative armoury available to protect vulnerable persons, particularly children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation and thank the Minister for his balanced and nuanced presentation.  Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan has noted how surprising it is that in 2012 we still have to deal with such tragic circumstances.  It is a sad reflection on Irish society that a significant minority of adults and, even more tragically, a significant minority of children have suffered or continue to suffer abuse.  That is the reality with which we must deal politically.  At the other end of the age spectrum, many vulnerable elderly persons face difficulties, in their home environments or in care settings.  It is appropriate that these circumstances be part of our response to this issue.</P>
        <P>Second Stage offers us the opportunity to make some general comments, but this will be an interesting debate when we reach Committee Stage.  I am glad the Bill has been introduced in the Seanad because it is a challenge to us to face the difficult questions and table constructive amendments on which I am sure the Minister will engage with us.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to close a loophole.  We are not suddenly starting from scratch; the legislation has to be taken in conjunction with that which will be brought forward by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs which we all hope will significantly improve the lot of children and vulnerable adults.  The Bill will not, of course, entirely solve the problem of the sexual abuse of children, a cancer in society.  Strong new laws are needed in this regard, but the law on its own will not change society.  We must think and act beyond the law.</P>
        <P>The hearings at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality were interesting.  I compliment the Minister on the concept of bringing legislation to the committee, holding hearings and teasing out issues arising from submissions.  On this occasion there were a number of written presentations and four oral presentations by the Rape Crisis Centre, One In Four, CARI and an individual.  What was most interesting about the submissions and dialogue with the groups represented, particularly the three advocacy groups, was that none of them claimed to have all the answers.  I thought that was a healthy approach; they had doubts even about what we were trying to do today.  They highlighted the need for defence clauses such as those the Minister is introducing.  I had expected them to demand certain measures, claiming they would solve the problem.  It was reassuring, however, to see they had as many doubts as we had.  Our engagement was very positive and the fruits are visible in the legislation, particularly in the possible defence clauses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was also helpful in broadening the debate that each and every one of the presenters on the day in question reminded Members, as did Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan and the Minister, of the inconvenient and uncomfortable truth that in the vast majority of cases the abuse of children occurs in the family or is perpetrated by a neighbour in the community.  That is shocking.  The headlines portray a different story &mdash; a problem for the church, the swimming club or the GAA club &mdash; however, in the majority of cases the abuse does not happen behind the alter, in the swimming pool or at the sports field but much closer to home.  This is a problem that requires a number of responses, as well as substantial investigation, including psychological investigation.</P>
        <P>Our colleague, Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, made an interesting observation at the hearings in recalling a television advertisement on abuse which, as I recall it, was carried on South African television.  He inquired whether we should run a campaign challenging people to contemplate the possibility of abuse taking place in the home.  We have had graphic advertising of the effects of car crashes, smoking and alcohol abuse.  Cases of abuse are happening all over the country but remain hidden, yet people know it is happening.  We must challenge the public mindset to wonder about some of these cases of abuse.  While graphic advertising would be uncomfortable and inconvenient, it might be necessary.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the defence clauses that will apply in certain circumstances to family members and the medical and counselling professions.  From an initial reading of the legislation, it appeared that if one was aware of abuse, the decision was simple &mdash; one had to report it.  I understand the reason these opt-out clauses are necessary, but we must go into the matter in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister has been very balanced on the question of sacerdotal privilege, the seal of the confessional box.  He pointed out that in the criminal offences identified in the Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports on clerical sex abuse, none had arisen from tales told in the confessional box.  The Bill does not provide for an opt-out clause for information heard in the confessional box.  We will also have an opportunity on Committee Stage to address the issue of protection of religious freedom under the Constitution and how this might have an impact on the Bill, but the Minister&rsquo;s comments should be reassuring to those who might have had concerns on religious grounds.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provisions dealing with vulnerable adults.  In addition to the shocking cases of child abuse, we have had shocking revelations of the abuse of the elderly in a few nursing homes.  I trust the provisions of the Bill will prove helpful and complement the legislation on whistleblowing.</P>
        <P>The offences listed in the Schedules to the Bill differ.  In Schedule 1 covering offences against children, one set of offences is listed, whereas in schedule 2 there is a shorter list of offences against vulnerable adults.  Will the Minister outline the reasons for this discrepancy?</P>
        <P>I look forward to constructive engagement on Committee Stage.  Concerns have been expressed by people of all shades of opinion about aspects of the Bill, most of which we can satisfy.  Others might think the Bill is a panacea that will solve problems and make them go away, but, sadly, that is not the case.  The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012, in addition to the proposed Children First legislation and Children First guidelines, will not solve all of the difficulties, but it will prove helpful.  We must get to the bottom of the weird and warped thinking which causes many of them.  This will require a major campaign of education and examination.  I thank the Minister for being present to discuss this important Bill and look forward to the Committee Stage debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and commend him for initiating the Bill in the Seanad.  The seriousness of the subject matter cannot be overstated and I assure him of my full support.</P>
        <P>When I look at Schedule 1 offences against children, including murder, rape, incest, child trafficking and child pornography, the gravest offences against the bodily integrity and well-being of a child, I find it incredible that we need legislation to ensure they are reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, we do need the legislation, as we know following the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports that there was the systematic abuse and exploitation of tens of thousands of vulnerable children in State and church-run institutions.  We also know it from the current discourse on the calls for Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady&rsquo;s resignation.  This is not only about clerical and institutional abuse, as the Minister referred to children knowing the perpetrators and Rape Crisis Network Ireland has clearly shown that 80% of childhood sexual abuse victims are abused by someone known to them, including immediate family members, relatives and family friends.  Some 12% are abused by a person in authority, that is, a teacher, a coach or a priest; 3% by strangers and 5% by others.  In effect, 92% of perpetrators are known to the family or trusted by the child.  That is the reality.  We need only look at the Roscommon child abuse case in 2009 and the chronic and spectacular failure of social services to intervene decisively over a 15 year period, even in the face of overwhelming evidence of serious abuse and neglect.  We know there has been a serious failing on the part of ordinary Irish citizens to speak about the abuse and mistreatment of children, where it is known to have occurred.  The Amnesty International report, In Plain Sight, in responding to the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports, provides an excellent insight into this collective social failing which was well summarised by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, when she launched the report last September.  She said:</P>
        <P LI="1">At every turn, Irish people kept their mouths shut out of deference to state, system, Church and community.  When they should have been unified in fury and outrage they were instead silenced, afraid even to whisper a criticism against the powerful.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While we cannot focus only on the past, we cannot ignore its relevance in contemporary Ireland.</P>
        <P>The executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, Colm O&rsquo;Gorman, has said &ldquo;the past only becomes history once we have addressed it, learnt from it and made the changes necessary to ensure that we do not repeat mistakes and wrongdoing&rdquo;.  As a children&rsquo;s rights activist, I am heartened by the dedication and commitment of the Minister and his Government colleagues to ensuring a dedicated and effective system of child protection is put in place in Ireland.  There needs to be a move away from the rhetoric of the past towards making the changes necessary to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes that were made when wrong-doing took place previously.</P>
        <P>The Departments of Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs are at the coalface of the process of introducing the suite of legislative reform that is necessary to strengthen child protection and protect vulnerable people.  I welcome the two-pronged approach being taken to ensure the full reporting of offences committed against children, or suspicions of such, will be required under this Bill and the Children First Bill.  It is vital we debate both Bills constructively to ensure they are as robust as possible.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise some points of concern with this in mind.  As I do not have the privilege of being a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I did not have an opportunity to elaborate on my concerns at that forum.  I would like to mention the excellent and useful Bills digest that was provided to us by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service yesterday.</P>
        <P>This Bill and the Children First Bill will introduce separate mandatory reporting schemes.  As the Minister usefully outlined, there are significant differences between the two schemes.  The differences relate to the people who are bound to report offences, the severity of the offences to be reported, the degree of certainty required to activate the obligation and the authorities to whom the people must report offences.  My concern relates to the interplay between the two reporting schemes.  It is important to ensure people have confidence and certainty about the statutory obligations that are being introduced, as well as about the moral obligations they will have in a scenario that falls outside the remit of either enactment.  It must be made very clear to people who fall outside the remit of the Children First national guidance, that is, any member of the public, that any concern they might have about abuse taking place can and should be reported.  We need to make that absolutely clear.</P>
        <P>The Minister has explained the difference between reporting to the Garda and reporting to the HSE.  One of the difficulties with that &mdash; it could lead to a lack of clarity &mdash; is that the HSE does not provide a 24-hour service seven days a week.  Members of organisations have been told that if the HSE is not available, they should report a concern about a child to the Garda.  I accept these mixed messages are not of the Minister&rsquo;s making.  I am concerned to ensure we are clear about this.  First, there is a concern that abuse or Schedule 1 offences will go unreported if people misunderstand the need to know or believe an offence has been committed in order to report it, as distinct from invoking a statutory obligation to report it.  There needs to be an understanding of what is meant by know or believe.  Second, if people undertake to probe or investigate their concerns, to gain the higher threshold of certainty set out in this Bill, they might inadvertently do damage to the child or vulnerable person in question.  I wish to make it clear that I do not disagree with the degree of certainty required in the Bill, but I am concerned the spectrum of offences covered by the clarity provision is very wide and the positive obligation put on individuals to report offences is a significant one.  Relevant offences could conceivably range from a person witnessing a section 3 assault on a child or vulnerable person to a person having knowledge of child trafficking or rape.</P>
        <P>I understand the purpose and intent of the Bill and the specific scenarios and circumstances it ultimately aims to remedy.  In fact, the Bill is applicable to a much broader spectrum of situations.  If we are to protect fully the victims of abuse and the rights of individuals who may find themselves subject to prosecutions under the provisions of this legislation, we must consider and address all its potential applications and ensure it is tailored adequately.  I do not doubt we will be able to probe this complex Bill on Committee Stage.  It is loaded with caveats and exceptions for very good reasons.  I am concerned it is not sufficiently understandable and accessible to the public at which is targeted.  When this Bill progresses through the various Stages, it will be essential to send a clear message to everyone that it will not be permissible to withhold information on offences against children or vulnerable people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I reiterate our gratitude to the Minister for bringing the heads of this Bill to the joint committee before initiating it in the Seanad.  I understand similar work is being done on the national vetting bureau Bill.  We look forward to dealing with that.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is taking a similar approach as she works on the Children First Bill, the heads of which will be considered by a joint committee.  These measures, coupled with the referendum that is promised later this year to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution, represent a watershed in the value that is given to childhood in Ireland.  For far too long, we have examined these issues in an historical context.  The Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Fitzgerald, have clearly demonstrated the Government&rsquo;s clear commitment to moving away from the rhetoric of the past and towards using the full rigours of the law to realise children&rsquo;s rights now and in the future.  I thank them for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012.  Like others who have spoken, I am especially pleased it has been introduced in the Seanad.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Shatter, for initiating the legislative process in this House.  It is appropriate in light of the tradition of thoughtful debate in the Seanad which is perhaps less adversarial than the Lower House.  We have heard contributions from people who have real expertise in this area.  I listened with particular interest to Senator van Turnhout, who has worked in this area and has extensive knowledge of it.  I thank the Minister for facilitating the committee hearings on the heads of the Bill.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I felt privileged to be able to engage in that part of the process and to hear directly from some of the groups working on the front line of child protection.</P>
        <P>We have had a good programme of initiating legislation in the Seanad in this session.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, initiated the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 in this House.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, initiated the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 in here.  Last night, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, accepted a Bill from Senator Crown that will ban smoking in cars when children are present.  I am delighted such good practice is being continued with this legislation, which I welcome.  As the Minister, Deputy Shatter, said, this Bill is part of a series of legislative measures aimed at strengthening this country&rsquo;s child protection laws.  It aims to close the legal gap that exists in terms of failure to report offences.  The need for this Bill is all too clear.  Other speakers have referred to the Ryan report, the Murphy report, the Cloyne report and the recent new revelations about Brendan Smyth.  We are already only too well aware of the horrendous litany of abuse he carried out.</P>
        <P>I should declare an interest as somebody who has, in a legal practice, represented survivors of abuse in the courts and before the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  I have had direct experience of the testimonies of some survivors of abuse.</P>
        <P>I am glad to hear the report on this Bill which was produced by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has fed into Government policy and helped shape the Bill before the House.  The oral hearings also gave us a real insight into the practical issues faced by those who work in child protection.  The Minister has said the vetting bureau Bill will be introduced shortly.  During the hearings on that Bill, the committee was impressed to hear about the extensive vetting procedures already in operation, for example, in sporting organisations.  We could learn from those sectors that are almost ahead of the curve in terms of the legislation.  I am conscious a different committee &mdash; the Joint Committee on Health and Children &mdash; is dealing with the Children First Bill.</P>
        <P>I would like to reflect on the substance of this legislation.  I have written in the past about the difficulties that were caused when the old common law offence of misprision of felony was abolished.  The crime of failure to report sex offences was excluded when a partial replacement for that offence was provided for in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  I recall the debate that took place when that legislative change was being made.  Counsellors and social workers were very concerned about the unintended consequences that mandatory reporting laws might have.  At the time, I thought the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was an odd home for a new offence that did not relate solely to offences against the State.  The Minister referred to section 176 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which served to fill the gap somewhat.  It is clear a gap continues to exist, however.  We hope it will be covered by this Bill.</P>
        <P>I accept what the Minister said about the need to ensure the Bill is not retrospective.  It may well cover acts of abuse that occurred in the past, but it will only cover any failure to disclose from the time the legislation comes into force.  We are aware a culture of silence existed in the past.  The report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality mentions that this culture enabled abusers to continue to abuse for a long time.  Other speakers have referred to the revelations about Brendan Smyth and the personal role of the Primate of All Ireland in that regard.  It is difficult to understand how people can fail to take personal and moral accountability or responsibility for the heinous consequences that flow from failure to report disclosures of abuse.  It is particularly sad to learn from the brave survivors who have come forward that they disclosed at the time to prevent other children from being abused.  The failure to report these disclosures upwards through the hierarchy resulted in the abuses continuing for many years.  I cannot understand how someone who was complicit in this matter can fail to take responsibility for such complicity.</P>
        <P>On the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan referred to the key theme to emerge in the course of the joint committee hearings when members stressed the need to ensure legislation would not have unintended consequences or be self-defeating in respect of the reporting of abuse.  We also highlighted, as the Senator pointed out, the high levels of intra-familial abuse.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout referred to this issue and the study carried out by the Rape Crisis Network.  It is worth noting that intra-familial abuse refers not only to abuse by family members but also to abuse by those trusted by families.  In the case of Fr. Brendan Smyth, as well as children, he frequently groomed their parents to trust him to the extent that they would leave their children with him.  Trusted family friends and carers of children who are not family members are covered by the concept of intra-familial abuse.</P>
        <P>One of the issues highlighted in the joint committee&rsquo;s hearings was the concept of reasonable excuse and what constituted a defence for those who failed to report.  This is perhaps the most complex issue that arises.  I was struck during Senator Jillian van Turnhout&rsquo;s contribution that the text of section 4, which I read with great care, was not very accessible.  I do not know how it can be made more accessible.  The Minister explained the section very well and the explanatory memorandum also makes it clearer.  However, its complexities require a careful reading of the section if one is to understand fully the defences that apply in different circumstances.  Clearly, there is a need for different scenarios to be covered in different ways.  For example, subsections (10) to (15), inclusive, cover the issue of disclosures made by counsellors, social workers, doctors and others in their professional capacity.  I am pleased to note that rape crisis centres may be covered under subsection (13).</P>
        <P>Two questions came to mind as I read section 4 following the joint committee hearings.  First, where disclosure of abuse is made to a family member or other person and he or she makes a report to the Health Service Executive, should this be included, if not as a defence, as a factor to be taken into account?  The Minister helpfully set out the link between the legislation and the Children First guidelines, which I am pleased to note will be placed on a statutory footing.  Should the link be made explicit within the terms of section 4?  This question was discussed during the joint committee&rsquo;s hearing and we did not arrive at a settled view on the matter &mdash; I am not clear about it.  As the Minister noted, it is stated in the Bill that the reporting obligation to the HSE is separate from other reporting obligations.  I wonder if a more explicit link should be made between the different reporting obligations.</P>
        <P>The second issue that arose was that of ongoing risk.  If the person to whom abuse is disclosed is aware that the abuser or alleged abuser may still be actively abusing and that other children or vulnerable persons may be at risk, should this knowledge not override any stated wishes of the victim or, if the victim lacks capacity, the parent or guardian?  I am thinking again of the Fr. Brendan Smyth case.  If there is an ongoing risk and it is clearly apparent to the person to whom disclosure is made, does this knowledge override the wishes of the victim?  This issue arose in the joint committee&rsquo;s hearings and it observed in its report that this theme had emerged.  Page 9, for example, reads: &ldquo;It was also submitted that, where there is an on-going risk to that child/vulnerable adult or others, the victim&rsquo;s wishes should not amount to &lsquo;reasonable excuse&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>On capacity, an issue addressed in section 4, I am glad the Minister provided a comprehensive explanation for choosing the age of 14 years.  This issue raises a more general question about the need to codify the law on sexual offences, specifically sexual offences against children.  Difficulties and anomalies arise in our laws on sexual offences against children in respect of the age of consent.  Legislation provides for different ages in respect of a child&rsquo;s capacity to consent to sexual intercourse.  While this is a separate issue, I wonder whether a link should be made.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a considered debate on Committee Stage on some of the more complex issues involved, particularly the section 4 set of defences which will be key to the working of the legislation in practice.  None of the points I have made detracts in any way from the strong welcome my colleagues and I give to the Bill.  The legislation is of major importance and a progressive step forward in trying to tackle the dreadful culture of silence around child sexual abuse that has been prevalent in this country for much too long.</P>

	<P>My colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, wished to contribute to the debate and probably would have done so in a manner with which I would not have agreed.  It is a disgrace that his contribution will be missing from the debate because I have not been allowed to share time with him.</P>
        <P>To move on and be positive, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, on the Bill, in particular his clear and cogent speech.  While he and I do not agree on all aspects of life, in this matter I find myself in general agreement with him.  He did a good job in clearly explaining the subject matter of this complex legislation.  It was extremely unfortunate that somebody purporting to represent a group of priests stated he would not take this from any Government Minister but especially the Minister.  As I stated privately to him, if that remark was intended as a reference to his religious background, it was absolutely disgraceful and should be publicly withdrawn.</P>
        <P>We have many reports on child abuse, including the Cloyne, Ryan and Murphy reports.  I have spoken on every one of them in a detailed and forensic manner and in the most judicious way I possibly could.  This has not, however, prevented everything I have said being taken out of context.  I sympathise very much with the Minister&rsquo;s comments on media reports because I remember speaking on the 1998 Bill and again in 2006.  During a recent election what I said in those debates was taken out of context.  Practically every single Member who spoke at the time agreed with what I had said because my contribution was principled and clear.  We are in a sophisticated area when we deal with this type of issue.  Nobody is in favour of child abuse, unless there is something wrong with him or her.  There is no point in me making that clear again because certain sections of the media find it is not profitable to express that point of view or reflect my saying it.</P>
        <P>The case of Cardinal Brady has been raised.  To a certain extent, what I would call the Brady syndrome is addressed in the Bill.  Having seen the face of the cardinal on television, I could not help but feel a certain compassion for him because he is caught between his position and that of Rome.  I believe he would love to resign, but I do not believe he will be allowed to do so.  Nevertheless, my compassion was seriously tempered by the television programme I saw in which an extraordinarily courageous middle aged man gave details of what had taken place when he was a child.  When he reported sexual abuse by one of the first child abusers, Fr. Brendan Smyth, the response was to swear him to secrecy.  That is a perversion of justice and a criminal offence.  The matter is that serious.  He was separated from his parents, introduced to a room in which there were adult males dressed in a strange uniform present and asked about intimate parts of his body, whether seed had emerged from him, if he had enjoyed what had happened to him and, if not, why not and if he had engaged in the same activity with other boys or adult men.  This constitutes child abuse in its own right.  However, I continued to feel compassion because, according to my ethics and beliefs, one must feel compassion as all sinners are capable of redemption.  I found that to be the most profoundly disturbing element.</P>
        <P>There has been a development in the debate.  I remember the earlier debates in the House on mandatory reporting.  Some of the professional organisations were concerned because they considered they might be placed in an invidious position of violating confidence because sometimes the victims who went to them said they last thing they wanted was to be reported.  That presents a difficulty.  Sometimes, however, during therapy and professional mediation this attitude changes.  The Minister has addressed this issue admirably in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I turn to the question of vulnerable adults.  I remember, for example, cases in which blind and elderly persons were also the victims of sexual assault in various institutions.  There is also the question of capacity.  Let me adapt <i>David Copperfield </i>by Charles Dickens<i>, </i>in which the lawyer, a Mr. Jackals, or somebody else says, &ldquo;Let us suppose...&rdquo;  Let us suppose there is somebody who is just on the margins, with a very mild mental dysfunction, but who is an adult and sexually active and repeatedly engages in sexual activity with another adult.  One can imagine such a hypothetical case, but I am not imagining it because I have encountered such a case.  It is a very delicate and dangerous issue and it is dangerous for anybody, even in political life, to speak about such a case.  The Minister is right to provide for limited defences for persons charged under the Bill, for persons such as a parent, guardian or medical profession acting in the interests of protecting the health and well being of a child or vulnerable person.  When the Minister was reading his script, I marked it for &ldquo;further explanation&rdquo;.  He then, very convincingly, gave it.  I remember a period during which the Garda would not interfere; it would state it was a family matter, as if incest was tolerable inside a family and the sexual abuse of children was a matter that could legitimately be conducted.  I remember fighting against this in the House and believe we were in a minority on issues such as, for example, the Stay Safe programme.  It was I who introduced the<i> guardian ad litem</i> clause in order to protect children.  I am glad the Minister has said victims cannot be guilty of an offence if they choose not to report.  That is both wise and humane.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of the seal of the confessional in respect of which a difficulty appears to have arisen.  The Minister has dealt with it conclusively.  He has stated: &ldquo;It will continue to be a matter for a court before which a person is prosecuted to determine whether there is a particular privilege and whether it applies in the circumstances of a particular case.&rdquo;  There has been no such case.  Much of the hysteria has been drummed up by certain sectarian interests.  Let us deal with the real world, in speaking about which I was slightly amused by one issue, the discrepancy to which Senator Ivana Bacik referred in the explanatory memorandum.  Under its interpretation, &ldquo;child&rdquo; means a person under 18 years of age.  In my part of Dublin I would not care to call anybody aged 17 years and three quarters a child because I know the answer I would get.  There are margins of appreciation because the Minister argues a person aged 14 years must be referred to in certain sections of the Bill because he or she is capable of giving evidence under oath.  There are very complex issues, but, by and large, the Minister has dealt with them admirably.</P>
        <P>Children will be protected more after the Bill has been enacted.  Every Member, from whatever ethical, religious or political background they come, wants the welfare of the vulnerable to be at the forefront.  That is a principle I have pursued all my life, although when I have done so I have often been deliberately and grossly misinterpreted and misrepresented by the media and political interests.  I am glad of the opportunity to express my clear view on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the approach being taken with the Bill, the heads of which were published, following which there was a public consultation period which gave the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality an opportunity to invite submissions and hold hearings.  Although I am not a member of the committee, I have read its report.  The committee provided the organisations working with vulnerable persons an opportunity to express their views and it is clear from the final report that the hearings helped it to benefit from their expertise and gave the Minister an opportunity to feed into the report.  I hope we can look forward to more legislation being initiated in this fashion.</P>
        <P>All of those who presented to the committee have welcomed the Bill which they recognise as important.  Many have said it is overdue.  The sensitive issue of children and their possible engagement with the criminal justice system is a consistent theme throughout the Bill which I am confident provides for balance, particularly on the issue of disclosure as it affects families, parents, guardians, health care professionals and support organisations offering counselling support to victims.</P>
        <P>It was clear in the hearings that the use of the words &ldquo;reasonable defence&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; could be prone to different interpretations.  The Minister has acknowledged this and attempted to make a clear statement on how various issues would be dealt with.  No doubt, they will be teased out further on Committee Stage.  I refer to the word &ldquo;defence&rdquo; used in section 4.  A defence can be used if a person, at the request of a victim, does not report an offence to the Garda or where the victim does not have the capacity to form a view on disclosure.  Where the offender is not a family member, a parent or guardian can, if he or she views it to be in the best interests of the child, state the offence will not be disclosed.  This can considered to be covered by the term  &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo;.  Where the offender is a family member and it might be deemed that it would not be appropriate for a parent or guardian to act, a medical practitioner can decide that the information should not be disclosed to the Garda.  However, the Minister has made the point that there is still an obligation under separate legislation to report the matter to the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Counsellors considered a victim might not avail of support services if a report to the Garda was required to be made.  In all cases the health, well-being and survival of the victim are of the utmost importance.  Rather than focus on the issue of defence or issues to do with having a &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; not to inform the Garda, it is important to remember that the clear intent of the Bill is to protect children and vulnerable adults from the crimes listed in the legislation, including rape, sexual assault, murder and false imprisonment.  The Offences Against the State Act 1998 provides that it is an offence to withhold information on serious crimes.  However, sexual offences were excluded.  Hence this Bill ensures that there is no doubt but that anybody who believes that a serious offence has been committed against children will have to report it to the Garda.  Otherwise they will be subject to imprisonment for up to five years.  The defences are limited, but they are important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The focus of this Bill is on protecting our children.  We are well aware of recent reports of how children in our society were abused and how society failed those children.  I use the word &ldquo;society&rdquo; because it is everybody&rsquo;s responsibility to protect our children.   We failed to act historically and we are failing to act today in many cases.  I hope that this Bill will in some way be an acknowledgement to those victims of abuse and that no longer can individuals in any walk of life turn a blind eye or make a conscious decision not to act to protect children or vulnerable adults.  This Bill is an acknowledgement to victims that the State is acting now.  We know too well that if an abuser is not stopped, he or she will continue to abuse.  The hurt and the scars that individuals have to bear for life will continue.  The purpose of this Bill is to protect victims and future victims.  Institutional abuse has been well documented, but we also know that most of the abuse happens within families and within the circle of trust.  That is what we have to face up to.  I am sure there are many situations where family members would remain silent, especially if the perpetrator is another family member.  It is not good enough and it has to be stopped.  The clear message in this Bill is going towards the 80% of those victims who have been abused by somebody known to their family.  This Bill is a very important statement.  It is for everybody in this country.  There will be no way of protecting individuals or thinking that everything will be alright.  The sexual abuse of any child or vulnerable adult is a crime.  We need to ensure that we put a stop to it and that there is no equivocation as to people&rsquo;s responsibility in this area.</P>
        <P>I am one of eight Members of these Houses who is also a member of the Council of Europe.  At a meeting of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s social, health and family affairs committee two weeks ago, I was asked to submit a report on what Ireland is doing in the area of mandatory reporting.  I was very pleased to be able to report to that committee on this Bill and on the Children First legislation.  Both Bills were brought before this House on the day I submitted my report.  It was an extremely important time for this country, in light of the reports into institutional abuse in particular.  It was a very important opportunity for us to report to the Council of Europe on what we are doing in this area.  The steps we are taking mean that we are leading the way <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the other 47 members of that council.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  I welcome it because as I have said before in the House, I am concerned about the distortion that is taking place on human rights.  In places like the UN and in other international fora, it is no longer about human rights, but adult rights.  This will help balance the situation in favour of children, and I welcome that.  Many people here have spoken about the heinous crime of child abuse and the enormous effects it has on the victims, many of whom have been driven to extreme actions as a consequence.  The majority of crimes in this area unfortunately occur within the family circle, be it family members or friends of family and so on.  Incest has unfortunately been with us for centuries, and society now sees clearly the damage that is done and recognises that we need to have a full armoury available within the legal apparatus to ensure that it is prevented.</P>
        <P>One aspect which has gone out of vogue for discussion is that of paedophilia.  It is a condition that some would see as an illness, although I am not inclined to agree with that.  However, it is generally recognised that paedophiles are very exploitative and manipulative people.  I remember much discussion 25 years ago about rehabilitative measures to correct the process.  There is no focus on that now, although we should try to get some focus on it.  I am not sufficiently expert in that professional field to say whether it is an area in which we could have results.  However, the debate should give some consideration to that line of thinking.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford made a good point that this issue tends to be hidden within society.  There are reasons for that.  There was an element of shame attaching within families.  There was conflict as to whether the child was believed and the protection of other family members who may have been perpetrators.  I have seen instances where families have been divided right down the centre as a consequence of this issue, which is so sad.  Senator Bradford stated that we need some kind of advertising or educational programme to create awareness of the issue.  I found some currency in my thinking for that, but I would offer a caution.  I have had experience of people who were victims in the past and who dealt with it in their own way without any professional assistance, especially in recent decades when we have had many reports and high profile publicity on the issue.  These people have found that much of what happened to them has come back and tormented them.  There is a balance that needs to be struck.  On the other hand, it has to be exposed, given the terrible consequences of paedophilia and the manipulative approach that paedophiles generally take.</P>
        <P>It is not just in the family.  We have seen many high profile cases involving people who deal with children, whether it is in sports clubs or swimming clubs, boy scouts or girl guides or whatever else.  It is important that those who are involved in those organisations also have an awareness to detect where these crimes are being committed.</P>
        <P>Much of the focus is on the Catholic Church nowadays, where some heinous abuse took place, where there was a total lack of awareness of the consequences over the decades, and where the management of these issues was certainly deficient as we look back on it.  I was struck by the Vatican&rsquo;s response to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement on the Cloyne report.  We get so much material and documentation that not everything we get is read.  The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under the leadership of the then Cardinal Ratzinger in 2001, introduced the <i>motu proprio</i> arrangements.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Subsequently, they were clarified and strengthened.  It is fair to say that within the church now, the procedures and the template in place, especially the zero tolerance for priests who offend and who are then dismissed from the priesthood quickly, are to be welcomed.  There was an excessive emphasis on due process, which is part of the legal structure.  However, from the point of view of the church it is important that this is done.  We should recognise that many of the procedures in place are superior to those the State has in place and should be considered.  The problem arises when it comes to administering these procedures.  Human beings such as ourselves are involved and it is down to the application and the commitment of the people who administer them to do so appropriately.</P>
        <P>I will finish with a point on the seal of confession.  I was interested in the comments of the Minister on this matter.  I have strong views on the preservation of the seal of confession.  Earlier this year I was in Vienna.  I entered a church in Petersplatz and picked up a postcard.  It showed a very nice sculpture of St. John of Nepomuk, who was killed by Wenceslaus, King of the Romans.  He was King of Bohemia as well.  He killed him because he was concerned that his wife, the queen, may have been having extramarital activities.  He had the saint in question drowned in the Vltava River in Prague.  The saint is regarded as the first martyr of the seal of confession.  I do not want any Irish martyrs of the seal of confession.</P>
        <P>There are some cases which support the idea that the seal of confession should be preserved within the judicial system.  I understand the Minister takes a different view but it is something on which we should have clarity.  There is too much intrusion by states in the West infringing on the whole area of conscience.  We must balance this with the entitlement of people to hold religious views and to have these views protected by the State.  There is no issue in practical terms because if someone has committed the crime of paedophilia, it is easy for the priest within the confessional to make it known clearly what he must do.  I imagine we will return to the issue on Committee Stage and perhaps tease it out a little more.  However, I have been somewhat reassured by the comments of the Minister in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  My contribution will not be as colourful as that of Senator Walsh.  We seem to be a nation in which the culture of secrecy pertains, mostly when it comes to matters of a sexual nature.  We are all aware of a certain former Taoiseach who was engaged in certain extramarital affairs.  This shows the type of society we were, in which everyone knew but no one was prepared to say anything.  This is one of the things which stands before us when we are debating the withholding of information on offences against children and vulnerable people.  In the past and in recent decades as a nation we have walked away from situations in which it has been common knowledge in certain societies in the country, including small villages, towns and larger cities, that people knew what was going on but they did not act.  Several reports have pointed out that part of the reason was that people did not understand exactly how to act or what to do.  As a nation we must accept we have a culture of privacy whereby we are not really prepared to engage in other people&rsquo;s private lives.  This is something we must address.  I welcome the Bill.  I believe it will make the matter of when people are supposed to engage and what they are supposed to do clearer for us.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the Bill puts an undue burden on ordinary members of society.  The threshold or bar is not high.  One must have actual knowledge and not only a suspicion.  The information must be material in securing the apprehension, prosecution and conviction of a person who commits an offence and there must be no reasonable excuse not to disclose information.  The Minister has stated there is no obligation to inform the Garda with regard to any vague rumours, innuendo or suspicions.</P>
        <P>This brings me to what could be loosely termed a criticism of the Bill.  Concerns have been expressed by the Ombudsman for Children on the matter.  On foot of the Bill she has called for significant resources to be put into certain aspects of our social services and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has been brought to our attention through the Ombudsman for Children that we run the risk of undermining the legislation by not putting in place sufficient resources.  The mandatory reporting of criminal sanctions in New South Wales, Australia, was abandoned after the authorities became overloaded with reports.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s clarification on what is not to be reported.  As Senator Bradford noted, the legislation will require an information campaign.  It will also require significant additional resources to be put into support services.</P>
        <P>Excluding the retrospective element in the legislation is necessary.  I have read several comments by organisations on the matter and I realise there are constitutional issues with regard to whether one can make an offence retrospective.  On balance I believe this is the best way to approach the matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister has made clear in the matter of defences that sacerdotal privilege is a non-issue.  I would prefer if those in the media applied themselves to some of the more serious aspects of the Bill rather than the usual approach of rehashing the issues of clerical abuse and the confessional.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify one concern about the defences.  An exemption is provided for someone who himself has been the victim of abuse.  A significant proportion of the offences which come under the remit of this legislation, especially those concerning children, involve people in a family circumstance whereby they may not be the only member of the family being abused.  It is possible for someone to be a victim and also a witness to the abuse of another individual within the family circumstance.  How will this be treated in the legislation as drafted?</P>
        <P>Some of the concerns about the legislation raised by organisations working in this area reflect the fact the bulk of these offences occur within families.  The view is that the culture of secrecy in families is just as strong as in the cases of clerical sexual abuse.  These organisations have suggested that non-offending family members should not be obliged to report crimes.  In particular, one parent should not be obliged to report an offence committed by the other.  I believe the Minister has covered this in the Bill as drafted.  However, it is important when one is dealing with children that there should be no doubt about the responsibility of a parent to the most vulnerable person, that is to say, the child.  The loyalty of a spouse towards another spouse versus their obligation to their child, in law at least, should not be an issue when it comes to protection.  I am very welcoming of the fact that this is part of a wider basket of Bills which will be brought before us which are not designed to protect children only.  We all fear old age and not being in control of our destiny.  While we have dwelt on the impact of the Bill on children, it will also have an impact on a growing number of people who, for the sake of argument, are suffering from illnesses such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  We must not lose sight of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House and thank him for getting me onto the programme &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; last week.  It is not often a Member of the Seanad makes his or her way onto it.</P>
        <P>Everybody in the House would accept that the State and many institutions within it have failed children for many years.  We are aware of a litany of failures in child protection and a number of high profile reports have shown how many institutions have failed children.  I see the Bill as part of the resolving of some of these issues and making sure the State&rsquo;s responsibility to protect children is rock solid and robust.  For that reason, I broadly support and welcome the Bill.  It is something for which my party called in the past.  It is very important that no individual feels offences committed against minors do not have to be reported.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been long awaited.  I assume, however, that the Minister would agree legislation alone will not be a cure for offences against children.  We are very clear that the Bill must proceed alongside wholesale reform and the adequate resourcing of the social care structures, social workers and the Garda to enable them to do their jobs effectively.  Like anything else, there must be a multifaceted approach.</P>
        <P>A number of people have contacted me about their concerns about the Bill, including about reporting.  It is a matter of balance.  If the Government manages things correctly, it should not be problematic.  We are examining the detail of the Bill and if we have amendments, we will table them as it progresses through the Oireachtas.  We have a minor concern about including provisions relating to the Offences Against the State Act.  Given our position on that Act, our concern does not relate to the intent of the provisions but rather the use of the Act.  The purpose of the Bill is to establish an offence of withholding information when a person has knowledge of a specific offence being committed against a child or a vulnerable person.  A child is defined as a person under 18 years, while a vulnerable person is a person who is suffering from either a mental, intellectual or physical disability that leaves him or her unable to sufficiently guard against abuse.  When enacted, it will be a criminal offence to possess knowledge of a specified offence committed against a child or a young person that would aid in the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for that offence and not to report it as soon as is practicable to the Garda.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes a provision for the inclusion of attempting or conspiring to commit offences.  A number of people have asked whether a child could be convicted for failing to report a crime against him or her.  A child against whom an offence has been committed shall not be guilty of an offence.  A child may not be prosecuted for a failure to report his or her abuse and this defence will continue to apply until he or she reaches adulthood.  The provisions also apply to vulnerable persons.  We support the inclusion of these provisions.</P>
        <P>Another issue of concern which was the subject of many e-mails I received involved the breaking of the confessional seal by clergy and penitent confidentiality and whether there would be a constitutional block.  On balance, the right of children to be protected outweighs clergy-penitent confidentiality.  There is no constitutional block.  Article 44.2.1&deg; of the Constitution is relevant in this regard.  It reads: &ldquo;Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practise of religion are, subject to public order and gravity, guaranteed to every citizen&rdquo;.  Priest-penitent privilege is not absolute in many other jurisdictions.  In some common law jurisdictions clergy are obliged to report crimes, even when evidence is given in confession.  New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas and West Virginia all disallowed the use of clergy-penitent privilege as a ground for failing to report suspected child abuse or neglect in any context.  The Catholic Church is present in all these states and complies with the civil law, or it ignores it and remains complicit in the abuse of children when someone confesses to it.  Common law precedents seem to indicate privilege as it applies to the confessional is not absolute.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill and the Minister who is willing to reform the law to make sure the State lives up to its responsibility to protect children.  However, we have a long way to go and there is lot of healing to be done.  We cannot correct or right a lot of wrongs visited on many children throughout the history of the country.  We all accept this.  Our responsibility now is to make sure we introduce legislation that will sufficiently and robustly protect and defend children against abuse.  Any Bill brought before this or the Lower House will be fully supported by my party.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  The Cloyne, Murphy and Ryan reports have clearly demonstrated the need to strengthen the law on the disclosure of information on offences against children.  We did not need these reports to tell us that, as everybody knows, we need legislation to protect children.  It is not acceptable that there can be or was a cloak of secrecy surrounding the commission of such offences.</P>
        <P>Much of the media attention on child abuse is focused on abuse by clergy, rightly so, but it is important to note that national statistics show 80% of childhood sexual abuse victims are abused by someone known to them, including immediate family members.  Everybody should take note of this.  Some 12% are abused by persons in authority, 3% by strangers and 5% by others.  The clergy were held in high esteem, but they have let people down.  A lot more was expected from people they respected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The introduction of mandatory reporting requirements within a jurisdiction tends to increase the level of community awareness of child abuse, which is good.  In many instances, it also results in substantial increases in the numbers of reports made to child protection departments.  If there are inadequate resources available, services may be overwhelmed.  However, the problem of substantial increases in the numbers of reports is more likely to become an issue under the Children First Bill 2012 which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, will introduce.  With the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, she should be facilitated to ensure a sufficient number of social workers will be in place to ensure that Bill, when passed, will be implemented properly.</P>
        <P>Criminalising the withholding of information on offences is a version of the old offence of misprision of felony.  This offence was effectively abolished in Irish law when the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours was abolished in 1997 in the Criminal Justice Act.  This meant that there was no longer a general duty under Irish law to inform.  From the reports and debates I read dating from 1996, it was expected that some provision providing for mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse would be placed on a statutory footing.  In one of the debates the phrase &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo; was used.  The measure is being introduced 16 years later.  I commend the Minister for introducing it in his first year in office on foot of the reports we have received.  Excuses were made.  Some reports were published some time ago, but others are more recent.</P>
        <P>I have no problem quoting from the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, with which Senator David Cullinane seems to have a problem.  It contains the phrase, &ldquo;for an offence of withholding information in relation to serious offences&rdquo;.  However, it specifically excludes information on sexual offences.  Questions have been asked as to why people have not been prosecuted under the Act.  That is the reason and it is necessary to introduce this Bill.  Serious offences covered by this Act were committed in the past.  People, even within the Senator&rsquo;s party and with regard to the disappeared, might see fit to say it is a serious offence and come forward with information to protect vulnerable people.  It should all be included.  We are talking about vulnerable people under any Act.  It was the Senator himself who mentioned the previous Act.  That is why it is necessary to ensure all vulnerable people are protected.  I also welcome section 3, which relates to vulnerable adults.  That is why I include all vulnerable adults in the country.</P>
        <P>There has been too much emphasis on confession.  All the reports we have read show that all the issues were raised outside the confessional.  The question of confession rarely came up.  It is a secondary issue.</P>
        <P>I refer to an incident mentioned in the Cloyne report.  The Bishop of Cloyne, through his solicitor, declined to supply a particular document.  The Garda report stated the solicitor said the document in question was a church document and therefore confidential.  The solicitor also told the Garda sergeant that the bishop would not make a statement &ldquo;in consideration for the public good and the maintenance of the confidentiality of the church&rdquo;.  That is different from the confidentiality of the confessional.  I am presuming and hoping this law supersedes that because, according to section 15.28 of the Cloyne report, the document was not disclosed.  I hope the Bill covers such a situation.  This is different from the seal of the confessional and has nothing to do with it.  It is about withholding information from a State agency, the Garda in this case, that is mandated to investigate a horrendous crime, such as the rape of children.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister about reporting and the designated person.  The Children First regulations established criteria for the appointment of a designated person in each organisation who will be responsible for approaching the HSE.  Can the Minister clarify this?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Can the Minister also clarify the position of canon law versus State law.  I am aware of the case of the priest who took a human rights case to court and assumed it would be heard under State law.  The judge ruled that because he was a priest, the case should be heard under canon law and dismissed the case.  The Minister, in his speech said the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">Section 2(4) also provides that the Bill is without prejudice to any right or privilege recognised in law.  In that regard, this provision is simply to allow the courts to use their normal discretion in considering issues of privilege.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We all know doctors differ and patients die.  Judges&rsquo; so-called normal discretion must be questioned sometimes.  It must be laid down in law that a judge&rsquo;s powers of discretion are few and far between in cases of child abuse, especially with regard to the confidentiality of documents relating to the abuse of a child or a vulnerable adult.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on bringing forward this important legislation.  It is long overdue.  Unfortunately, the 1998 Act did not go far enough.  Many people would be behind bars if the obligation to report sexual offences had been included in that Act.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister consider the issue of people being informed by a credible source that abuse has taken place in an institution, a family or similar setting?  I am sure other Members have received information in such circumstances and I have been in a similar situation myself.  The Bill would not have required me to act in that case.  Perhaps the Minister could look at that.  Reporting by a third party, who has not himself been abused, to a Member of the Oireachtas or a health professional, for example, that he believes abuse is happening or has happened should be covered by the Bill.  If this legislation had been in place in 1998, many people who had information would have been prosecuted since then.  In the cases I have dealt with, those who came forward with information had often sat on it for many years or even decades.  That is most disturbing.  When asked to make a report in writing, they refused to do so.  As a result, the abuse continued.</P>
        <P>Most abuse takes place in the home.  A study in the United States has shown that in the case of abuse outside the home, the average number of children abused by a single abuser is 154.  In the case of institutional abuse in Ireland, where abusers often have access to children on a 24 hour basis, the number of children abused by a single abuser has been in the thousands, according to the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church.  The abuse continued because the people who knew about it, and who should have acted, did not do so because there was no sanction or consequence for them.  The case involving Cardinal Brady is recent.  If this legislation had been in place since 1998, we know where Cardinal Brady should be now.  Abuse continued only because he failed to act.</P>
        <P>I accept that a report by a third party who has not been involved in abuse but has a credible belief it took place can be described as hearsay.  If I, or anyone else, receives such a report, I am not obliged to act.  If we truly believe the report and if we could stop the abuse by our actions, we should put pressure on the person, citing this Bill, to report it.  Otherwise the abuse will continue.</P>
        <P>On one occasion I received a telephone call from a priest who said he had been asked by his religious order if he had had contact with a public representative in relation to issues within the order.  He told me he had received a letter to that effect from his superiors.  I asked him for a copy of the letter but he replied that was not possible.  I asked if I could see the letter and offered to drive to Cork to look at it.  He refused.  I said, &ldquo;There is no letter, is there?&rdquo;, to which he would not reply.  There was no letter, but he had credible information.  His silence over a long period had no consequence for him.  This Bill was not in place and, therefore, he had no reason to act other than to protect children, which one would think any human being would do.  We know that in an institution, whether a political party, a religious institution or a company, the whistleblower is the one who suffers.  I know the Minister intends to introduce whistleblower legislation.</P>
        <P>If this Bill had been on the Statute Book some years ago, many more children would have been saved.  People who, out of self interest, refuse to act to protect children would take action if it were in their own interest to do so and if they would go to jail themselves.  I am aware that this goes against the law of hearsay.  However, if someone goes to a health professional and if he or she has credible information &mdash; I accept that this extends the chain and causes difficulties &mdash; he or she should be able to offer it to the relevant authorities.  I am aware of a number of cases where such credible information was available but where the individual in a position to offer it was not the injured party, namely, the person being abused.  I would like the net to be stretched as wide as possible in order to ensure that if people who have information and who do not have the guts to act could offer it to someone who is brave enough to make it known and thereby bring the abuse, which may have been ongoing for some time, to an end.  When the legislation is enacted and when people realise the consequences to which it could give rise for them, they will act out of self-interest.  For too long, people have remained silent because they were interested in protecting themselves and the positions they hold.  This happened at a cost to the children involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the issues to which I wished to refer have already been discussed.  As a result, I will not detain the House too long.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to close an existing loophole in the law.  Many of the previous speakers referred to the Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports.  There is no doubt that these contain a litany of shocking revelations in respect of the sexual abuse of children and the failure to respond to such abuse.  As the Minister stated, &ldquo;It is clear from these revelations . . . that if those who had knowledge in the past of sexual offences committed against children had informed the Garda, many children who subsequently became the victims of abuse may have been protected from clerical sexual predators.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Under the Bill, it will be an offence to fail, without reasonable excuse, to disclose information to the Garda.  What will be the nature of such excuses?  In that context, the Minister referred to &ldquo;information concerning certain serious criminal offences where such offences are committed against a child or a vulnerable adult&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Senators van Turnhout and Keane referred to the national statistics.  It is startling to think that 80% of child sexual abuse is committed in people&rsquo;s homes.  I refer here to abuse carried out by family members, friends and neighbours.  That is unbelievable.  Ireland used to be called the island of saints and scholars &mdash; I do not know who bestowed that name upon it &mdash; until we were found out.  The sexual abuse and violence report, which I read in recent days, indicates that one in five people have suffered some form of sexual abuse.  That is an incredible statistic.  The report also indicates that 50% of those who are abused do not tell anyone.  Imagine how troubled some of these individuals might be.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister might be in a position to clarify something for me.  I recently read about a former priest who is 61 years of age, who has been laicised and who sexually abused two young boys of 12 years of age some 31 or 32 years ago.  In recent weeks, this man was sentenced to 18 months in prison.  As far as I am concerned, the sentence should have been ten times as long.  For legal reasons, the former priest in question could not be named.  I can understand why the young boys concerned could not be named.  However, why is it not possible to name and shame predators such as the individual to whom I refer?  I would encourage the 50% of people who have been sexually abused and who have not revealed that fact to anyone to come forward and name those who violated or raped them many years ago.  They should clear their consciences by telling their stories.  I am alarmed that this number of people have not told anyone about what happened to them.  I cannot imagine how these individuals must feel at certain times.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions and for their broad support for what is a very important item of legislation.  I also want to thank them for their comments with regard to the procedure we have adopted.  One of the first occasions on which that procedure was used was in July of last year, when the heads of the Bill were published and then referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in order that Members of both Houses could consider the substance of the legislation in the early drafting stage.  This procedure also afforded individuals and those in the broader community with an interest in the measure an opportunity to make substantive proposals to how it should develop.  Under the procedure to which I refer, members of the joint committee ultimately had the opportunity to report on the legislation.  This has proven to be a very useful and valuable process.  I appreciate the fact that Members of the Seanad have recognised this.  The same process was also used in respect of the heads of the Bill relating to vetting.  Whereas the process to which I refer added to the time it took to publish the final version of the Bill, and also the legislation on vetting, I am of the view that it has led to the production of better legislation, the passage of which through both Houses will probably be somewhat speedier than usual.  This is due to the initial consideration given to the Bill by Members of both Houses and the fact that it was possible to tease out any relevant issues at an earlier stage.</P>
        <P>I will now do my best to address the various issues raised by Senators.  I am conscious that we will engage in a detailed Committee Stage debate.  If, therefore, I neglect to mention anything, I hope Senators will forgive me and will raise any relevant issues again on Committee Stage.  I will respond first to the points made by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, some of which were also raised by the speakers who followed him.  In replying to what he said I may, therefore, also deal with matters to which other Senators referred.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan asked a very important question with regard to when the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights will take place.  I expect it to be held in the autumn.  I engaged in a discussion on matters relating to the referendum earlier today.  Substantial work has been done in connection with that issue.  It is something of a regret for me personally that the referendum did not take place a number of years ago.  I was a member of the joint Oireachtas committee which considered the wording that the previous Government produced.  The committee in question proposed an alternative wording but, unfortunately, no real progress was made in respect of this.  I hope that when the wording to be put to the people in the forthcoming referendum is finalised and agreed by the Government, it will receive the support of those on all sides of the House.  Its primary objective is to ensure we finally expressly recognise in our Constitution the rights of children and the importance of protecting the welfare of children.  Its objective is also to have a balanced provision which recognises and affords an importance to the role of parents in the upbringing and care of children but which also ensures, on the one hand, that the State can intervene appropriately where children are at risk and afford to them the protections they require, and on the other, that the voice of a child is heard when important decisions are being made relating to him or her and where he or she is of an age and of sufficient maturity to have something of importance to contribute to that process.  I am looking forward to the fact we will have a referendum next autumn on this issue.  We first have to get over the referendum we are having now.  I hope we have a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in both referenda when it comes to people voting.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan that it should be a stand-alone referendum.  It is an issue the Government has addressed previously.  It is important it is fully debated, that people understand what is proposed, and that there is no opportunity for what is proposed to be misrepresented or for people to be misled into believing the referendum has some unexpected evil intent because they feel it is sprung on them.  The intention would be that it would be a stand-alone referendum or, if there is anything else to be put to the people by way of an accompanying referendum, that it would be something so benign and simple but necessary as not to give rise to any great concern or controversy.  Certainly as matters stand and as I understand it, the referendum will be a stand-alone one.  Final decisions have yet to be made by Government on the wording and the date when the referendum will take place.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and other speakers said, rightly, that while there may be a perception that a substantial amount of abuse has occurred as a consequence of members of the clergy behaving in a manner that is completely unacceptable and abusing children, it is correct that about 80% of abuse is perpetrated by individuals known to children &mdash; family members, close friends of the family, next door neighbours &mdash; and it is that side of this appalling area of betrayal of children that gets a good deal less coverage in the media than does clerical abuse.  If one follows what happens in our courts, however, a substantial number of individuals, both clerical and non-clerical, have been convicted of child sexual abuse.  There have been some horrendous cases of abuse within families.  The Roscommon case was mentioned.  There have been a great deal many more cases than that one.  That was a particular case that got a substantial amount of publicity.</P>
        <P>In this context and when there is abuse within the home, a speaker raised the issue of the apparent belief that the Bill provides an exemption for one parent from reporting the abusive conduct of the other.  There is no exemption of that nature in the Bill.  If a mother knows her husband is sexually abusing children, has material information that should be given to the Garda and fails to provide it, that will be a criminal offence under this legislation.  We have seen a number of cases go through the criminal courts where it has been clear the father has perpetrated the abuse, the abuse has been known to the mother and she has been complicit.  Indeed, mothers have been convicted of related offences for failing to protect their children in these circumstances.  We have had occasions when mothers have been the abusers.  There is no exemption in that context and it is not intended there would be.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan asked my view on the suggestion coming from Cardinal Brady that there should be some sort of cross-Border inquiry into the Brendan Smyth affair.  That is not a matter that has been addressed by the Government.  I am somewhat puzzled by that call because what is known about that affair and of the failings of the church is known within the church.  We are aware of the church&rsquo;s failure to make available documents of importance to Judge Murphy for what has become known as the Murphy inquiry but in fact was the inquiry into the Dublin diocese.  Judge Murphy also inquired into the diocese of Cloyne.  I myself used the term &ldquo;Murphy report&rdquo; for the Dublin report.  There was certainly a lack of co-operation by the Vatican in failing to produce documentation.  I do not know what purpose would be served at this stage by an inquiry into why members of the church dealt with Brendan Smyth in the way they did, why he was left in communities, why he was moved from one community to another, and why he was moved from one country to a different continent and came back again.  The knowledge of all that is within the church.  I want to be very clear that if in future it is made known to a member of the Catholic Church or anyone else, or if they know, that someone is abusing a child, and if they have material evidence that should be given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they fail to give it, that will be a criminal offence under this legislation.</P>
        <P>What is provided for in the Bill is different from the provisions in the Children First legislation.  That legislation envisages that organisations will have what is referred to as a designated person who will be the central person to whom is given information of alleged abuse within an organisation and who will be the person obliged to make a report, be it to the HSE or to the new child protection service, when it is established.  The abuse that may be reported in those circumstances may not be such as necessarily always to fall under the provisions of this legislation.  It will not of necessity be sexual abuse.  It may be abuse of another nature, such as physical abuse, or it may be simply concern under the child care guidelines that a child is being neglected.  It may not be an abuse issue, rather a concern about child welfare or child neglect, but in the context of organisations I assume it will be primarily an abuse issue.  The designated person will have an obligation to report to the HSE.  The Children First provisions do not provide any exemption to an individual who has material evidence to offer the Garda that a child is being sexually abused from giving that information to the Garda.  The fact there may be a designated person they could tell does not in any way exclude them from the obligation to inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>There are a series of differences of emphasis and approach between the two pieces of legislation.  They are complementary and we are anxious to ensure there is nothing about them that is contradictory.  A great deal of work has been done between the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, and me to address those issues, but this legislation before the House is about ensuring that where an individual has material knowledge of a serious offence having been or being committed against a child or vulnerable adult and such knowledge would assist the Garda in an investigation, that person is under legal obligation to provide that information.  If they fail to do so, they commit a criminal offence.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan asked what is meant by &ldquo;unintended consequences&rdquo; of the legislation with regard to children.  We are trying to provide a balance in this legislation.  I emphasise that no one has a monopoly of wisdom with regard to it.  It is difficult and complex legislation.  We are trying to maintain a balance between ensuring, first, that individuals who have material knowledge of children being abused give it to the Garda in order that it can conduct an investigation and, where there is proper evidence, bring the perpetrator before the courts, and, second, to try to ensure where it is known a person is abusing children that not only are they brought before the courts but also, by the intervention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other children are protected from that individual perpetrating abuse on them or the original victim is protected from further abuse.  One of the lessons we have learned is that abusers have a proclivity to abuse a large number of victims and also to abuse continuously over a number of years one or two identified victims who are unable to extricate themselves from the circumstances in which they find themselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other objective is to ensure the legislation does not act as a barrier to a child victim of abuse or a vulnerable adult getting whatever assistance, be it medical assistance or counselling or support services, he or she requires to come to terms with the enormity of what has occurred to him or her.  We have tried to provide a balance in that regard.  With regard to unintended consequences, when we published the heads of the Bill we were concerned to ensure victims who feel vulnerable would not avoid seeking help because they feel they might not be able to cope with having to explain all that occurred to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to ensure we would not create a barrier to victims seeking help.  I hope we have achieved that balance in the legislation.  It will be very interesting to hear what Members say on Committee Stage.  The issue was discussed by those who made submissions to the joint Oireachtas committee.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford, in his contribution, talked about the importance of the Bill and stated it would not totally solve the problem.  Of course, it will not.  Unfortunately, child abuse has been part of society for hundreds of years.  The Bill is just one of the bricks we are putting in the foundations to provide additional protection for children and to ensure those who perpetrate abuse are properly brought before the courts.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford asked why different offences are listed in the First and Second Schedules to the Bill.  This is easily answered.  Some of the offences detailed in the First Schedule apply only to children while some of those detailed in the second apply only to individuals who suffer from mental incapacity.  There are some offences in each Schedule that are identical because they could be perpetrated against children or other individuals, including vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator van Turnhout for what she said and for her support for the Bill.  If there is one message that arises, it is that we must end the culture of silence and deference.  We must ensure children in the State are protected and that those who have information important to ensuring not only the children&rsquo;s protection but also the bringing to justice of those who perpetrated abuse against them are obliged to furnish that information to the appropriate authorities.</P>
        <P>I have answered some of the queries of Senator van Turnhout on the interplay between the Children First guidelines and the Bill.  We might tease this out a little more on Committee Stage rather than this evening because I am conscious of time.  The Senator made reference to the provision associated with one&rsquo;s knowing or believing abuse has occurred.  We believe that is the best formulation for progress.  If there is a better one, I will be very happy to hear about it.  Knowing or believing means one has material evidence available to one, not that one is acting on hearsay.  Senator van Turnhout asked whether this would result in some individuals conducting private investigations.  I cannot answer that.  If any of us had a serious concern that a child was the victim of abuse but did not have the substantive knowledge required to back up that belief, we might try to find out a little more information about the circumstances of the child in question.  There is nothing to stop anybody with concerns telling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na even if those concerns cannot be substantiated.  We will not criminalise people for not telling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about a rumour; that is the difference.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly asked what happens if someone tells a public representative about child abuse.  What happens is very simple.  There is nothing in law at present, nor will there be, to stop a public representative telling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If, however, I am concerned about something I am told by somebody else but have no first-hand knowledge of the incident in question, it is open to me to tell An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If I do not tell An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, because my information is based on hearsay, I will not be criminalised for failing to pass on the information.  There is no barrier in the legislation to third parties passing on information from others, but we will not bring prosecutions against third parties on the direction of the DPP pursuant to this Bill for not passing on what is essentially hearsay in the context of the recipient.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to reporting to the HSE and asked whether this could constitute a defence or be taken into account.  The Bill does not provide that one&rsquo;s reporting child abuse to the HSE in respect of a serious case where one should have reported to An Garda will, of itself, prevent a prosecution.   If, under the child care guidelines, one reports to the HSE a serious incident of abuse, the HSE, under those guidelines, has an obligation to report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is difficult to envisage someone being prosecuted in those circumstances.  It is, perhaps, an example of one having a reasonable excuse, that is, the excuse of having told the HSE.  A reasonable excuse could be that one did not go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because one told the HSE which, under the child care guidelines, must tell An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the way the child care guidelines may work in conjunction with the legislation.</P>
        <P>There is a need to codify the law on sexual offences.  We are addressing that issue.  I hope to produce legislation in this area towards the end of this year or, if not, in the first part of 2013.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue raised by Senator Walsh and some others about the confessional, the position is quite simple and I am loth to spend too much time on it.  The 1998 Act requires that if one has material information about a broad range of offences, one must report them to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If one fails to do so, it is a criminal offence.  The legislation before us extends these provisions in certain circumstances to sexual offences, particularly sexual offences against children and vulnerable adults.  There is nothing in the 1998 Act about giving some exemption in circumstances where information is relayed through the confessional.  There is no particular reason there should be some express exemption in this legislation.  If there is a privilege in this area, it is for the courts to address.  We have already heard this evening in this context that there are particular provisions in the Constitution which qualify the right to freedom of religion, but I want to be realistic in this area.  In my opening statement, I said that in a large number of appalling cases of barbaric abuse of children, as documented in the Ferns, Murphy, Cloyne and Ryan reports, and with regard to all the matters we heard about this week and last about Brendan Smith, individuals were told openly about children being abused.  There was no suggestion that people were told in the confessional.  Perhaps they were but, if so, they certainly have not told anyone.  There are a large number of instances in which the abuse of children was disclosed to individuals within religious orders or the Roman Catholic Church and they did nothing.  No issue arose as to the confessional.  In the period in question, there was nothing to prevent anybody from going to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>This State, this Republic, cannot recognise a parallel system of law not enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas which extends some global exemption to individuals that defies the civil law and leaves children vulnerable to abuse.</P>
        <P>The balance from the State&rsquo;s perspective must be to protect children and to rigorously apply our criminal law to those who abuse children.  The balance must also be to ensure we do not repeat in the decades to come the horrors of the decades gone where known paedophiles were left free by a number of individuals in authority to perpetrate abuse on children.  When their conduct became known, they were moved somewhere else where they continued to abuse and to target children.</P>
        <P>The issue is not focused on the confessional but child protection.  It is about ensuring those children who have been abused in a family, a home, a club setting, a school, a hospital, an institution or within the remit of some faith organisations are entitled to the State&rsquo;s protection.  It must do what it can through legislation to ensure that information that is crucial is furnished to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by individuals who may have known about such circumstances.</P>

        <P>I thank all Senators who contributed to this debate.  Any issue I have not addressed in my response can be returned to on Committee Stage.  I hope we can take Committee Stage fairly soon and that the legislation can be enacted before the summer vacation.  There is an urgent need to put this legislation in place and ensure our children are protected.  I thank Senators today for focusing on the Bill&rsquo;s importance with regard to child protection, despite some of the reportage of the legislation.  We are trying to ensure we have the best possible legislation in place to protect children, the most effective legislation possible to ensure those who perpetrate child abuse are brought before our courts and that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the legislative foundation it needs so it can be as successful as it can be in that regard.</P>

      <sTitle>Harbour Charges</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to the House.  I wish to raise the matter of the draft fishery harbour centres rates and charges order 2012.  The order will see charges for yachts and commercial vessels berthing in any of the State&rsquo;s main fishing harbours increase by up to 800%.  I understand the harbour in Dunmore East, County Waterford, will have to apply such charges.</P>
        <P>Due to the neglect of previous Governments, many fishing villages across the country have been devastated because of massive changes in the fisheries sector.  Many ancillary services and businesses which depended on the fishing sector have also suffered.  The harbour at Dunmore East is now so shallow due to the build-up of mud and silt that some of the larger fishing vessels can only enter and leave at high tide.  The harbour&rsquo;s Syncrolift, a device for repairing vessels, has so much mud underneath that it can only cater for smaller boats.  Some of the larger vessels are now repaired in other ports and even outside of the State.  This has a knock-on effect for local businesses and employment in Dunmore East.  The harbour badly needs to be dredged which is estimated will cost between &euro;4.5 million to &euro;6 million.  When one considers the harbour turns over millions of euro every year and its benefit to the local community and the region, the cost for dredging is a small amount and would be well invested.</P>
        <P>On top of these concerns, the Department has proposed to increase harbour charges.  The view of many is that this will add to the woes of local businesses.  Dunmore East attracts many tourists, visiting yachts, motorised pleasure craft, as well as having an adventure centre operating from the port.  It also gets several luxury cruise liners which have a positive impact on the south-east region&rsquo;s shops, hotels, restaurants, visitor centres and other tourist attractions when one considers the thousands of tourists such a visit generates.  The Government has put a major focus on tourism as one of the key drivers for economic recovery.  There is a concern these charges could have an impact on these tourism activities.  I am not the only one concerned about these charges.  The chairperson of the Irish Marine Federation, Mr. David O&rsquo;Brien, stated that for every euro spent on a berth in a harbour, &euro;10 is spent by yacht owners in local shops and restaurants.  The same would apply to luxury cruise liners.  Any increase in harbour charges will also apply to commercial and fishing vessels.</P>
        <P>Has a cost-benefit analysis of these increases been carried out?  Does the Minister have any concerns that increasing charges could have a negative impact on local businesses?  Will the Minister allay some of the concerns of local communities which will be affected by these increases in charges?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on this matter on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  From a young age, I had a fixation with harbours but then that was lost for a long time.  Going to a harbour, such as Dunmore East or Killybegs, is an attraction.  This morning on the radio it was stated fish is the most sought after food in Europe.  Our senior Minister has done a great job in Europe in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to deal with and provide some clarity on the draft new rates and charges order for the six fishery harbour centres operated under the aegis of my Department, one of which is at Dunmore East, County Waterford.  It sets out proposed changes to the fee schedule for the use of the facilities at each of the six fishery harbour centres located at Dingle, Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs and Rossaveal.  The draft has been published following an extensive review of the existing rates and charges order for the fishery harbour centres that came into effect in 2003.  The draft order was issued for public consultation on 31 March last and that 21-day period closed on Friday, 20 April.   A total of 85 submissions were made, of which six were from fishermen&rsquo;s representative groups, two were from individual fishermen, 18 were from the tourism and marine leisure sector, 12 were from passenger vessel operators, one was from a local authority, 15 were from marine business interests in the fishery harbours, six were from harbour users groups and islanders, and 25 were from private individuals.  This is a significant response from a wide range of stakeholders in our fishery harbours and I am gratified to see the level of interest and commitment that they represent.</P>
        <P>The responses received are being examined closely by my Department and all submissions will be given full consideration before the new order is finalised.  It is important to stress that a public consultation process is exactly that, a consultation process that provides a valuable opportunity for me and my Department to hear and to consider the concerns of our customers.  I want to assure the House that no decision on the final text of the new rates and charges order will be taken until all of the submissions made by the stakeholders have been considered and evaluated and I expect that process to be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>I will explain the background to the funding mechanism involved in the day-to-day management of the six fishery harbour centres for the information of the House.  The Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968, as amended, sets out the mechanism to be employed in funding the day-to-day operational costs of the six fishery harbour centres.  All income received at each of the six centres is effectively lodged to what is known as the fishery harbour centres fund.  All of the day-to-day running costs of each centre is financed from the fund and it is the only source of income available to fund the day-to-day operational and management of the centres.  The expenditure includes harbour master and staff salaries, electricity, lighting, fuel costs, security, harbour cleaning and maintenance, without which the centres could not function and provide a service to their customers, the harbour users.   It is important to reiterate that all income lodged to the fund is invested back into the centres and is used for no other purpose.</P>
        <P>The rates and charges order is the legal instrument that enables charges to be levied that provide the income necessary for the provision of the various services at the fishery harbours.  There has been no increase in rates and charges since the current charges were set in 2003.  It is important that the proposed new rates and charges are set at a level sufficient to provide adequately for the costs involved.  At the same time I have tried to balance that need to finance the management of the harbours with the needs of the various harbour customers.</P>
        <P>In drafting the new schedule of fees and charges, comparisons were made with charges in place at other fishery harbours in Northern Ireland and the UK and with non-fishery harbours and ports here in Ireland.  The new charges will stand comparison with any of those.   There are 28 scheduled charges in the proposed new rates and charges order and in most cases the charge to the harbour user will be the same or less than before.</P>
        <P>I will take this opportunity to highlight some of the features of the proposed new charges and their likely impact on harbour users.  The general fish landing charges set for all whitefish and fishmeal have not been increased in the draft order above the levels set in 2003.  A new single entry charge has been introduced, at the request of some operators, as an alternative to the annual multiple entry charge structure in place since 2003 for vessels entering the fishery harbour centres.  In order to facilitate those operators an alternative &euro;400 single entry charge option has been provided in the draft order.  The new charge will be available as an alternative, at the discretion of the operator, to the other annual multiple entry charge for fish landings outlined in the draft order.  It is not an additional charge as suggested by some but is an alternative to facilitate operators who may find this a more satisfactory alternative for their particular pattern of harbour usage.</P>
        <P>Charges for Syncrolift use have been the subject of complaints from users.  In the light of those complaints, although the charge for standing in the covered repair bay has been increased from &euro;50 to &euro;100 per day, the charge for prolonged use has been halved, decreased from &euro;400 per day to &euro;200 per day.  In order to ensure that the charge is fair I have introduced an exception to facilitate an inspection by a Government body, for example where a vessel is awaiting inspection by the marine survey office.  Charges for use of the facilities in the centres by yachts and other pleasure craft have been introduced for the first time.  It follows the provision of specialised marina facilities at Dingle and Rossaveal fishery harbour centres in particular, in response to the importance of such developments in the marine tourism area.  The charges for passenger craft using the centres have been carefully calibrated in order to be fair and equitable but also to reflect the importance of the services provided by the ferry operators to the island communities.</P>
        <P>The consultation process seeks to provide a platform to ensure a fair and equitable levying of charges as is possible.  As I have said, my Department is working through all of the submissions made by the public.  My officials are available to meet interested parties to discuss the draft rates and charges order and to provide any necessary clarification.  They will listen to and consider alternative suggestions to the individual charges included in the draft order.  A number of such meetings have been arranged, one of which is a meeting with stakeholders in Dunmore East early next week.  After this series of meetings have been completed and the analysis of the submissions has been finalised, I hope to publish the new rates and charges order at an early date having considered all of the issues raised during the consultation phase.  Copies of my speech are available for Members and there are more in the ante-room.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I understand that the consultation process has just ended and that no decision has been made.  Therefore, I respect the fact that he does not have the decisions and outcomes of the consultation process yet.  He mentioned in his speech that the Minister is seeking to balance the running costs of harbours against the impact that any increase in charges would have on customers.  That is the point I am making.  We must ensure that we do not, while increasing charges to ensure the harbours are run correctly, damage their ability to attract customers, whether they are using yachts or cruiseliners.  It would also have a negative impact on local businesses.  I am comforted by his comments.  We must wait to see the details of the outcome of the consultation process.  I thank the Minister of State for taking the Adjournment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  I tabled this Adjournment matter because the county archivist in Clare has done enormous work in collaborating and putting together a series of archives that have significant historical value that should be open to public.  We also have a situation in north Clare where the only workhouse that dates back to the Famine that still stands and is available is an OPW storage facility in the Corofin area.  That facility is not being used for historical purposes.  Cataloguing has taken place over the past number of years of the archival information.  A well-grounded suggestion has been made that both should be married.  The archives should be stored in the Corofin workhouse and made available to the public, thus ensuring that the archives are readily accessible to people.  It would also act as an interesting tourist attraction in north Clare.  Visitors to that part of the Clare tend to search for information about their relatives.  There is a tracing service in Corofin that has been used by thousands of Americans and people in Australia and other countries seeking to trace their relatives here.  People can contact the service and their family tree will be drawn up for a small fee.  I propose that we give a much greater offering to that type of tourist in that part of Clare by the OPW providing the old workhouse to be used as an archival museum to gather and showcase the archives of County Clare.  I hope that the Minister of State will give me some good news from the Minister responsible for this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has drawn attention to his area.  He is willing to fight for it and he made a lot of sensible suggestions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to his comments on tracing roots, I welcome Mr. Robert Babcock from Boston, a distant cousin, who is in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery.  He has traced his family back to my county and that is why he is present today.  A tracing service is fantastic and I know that we have embarked on a large campaign to encourage many Irish Americans to come back here.   I have read the Minister&rsquo;s reply and if the Senator believes in the project then he should not take &ldquo;No&rdquo; from it.  The two bodies working together is the answer.</P>
        <P>The following is the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  The Office of Public Works runs a depot in Corofin, County Clare, from which it organises the maintenance of national monuments in the Burren area.  The depot is located at the premises of the former Corofin Union Workhouse.  The building was formerly vested in Clare County Council under the State Lands Workhouses Act 1962 and is now vested in the Mid-Western Health Board under the provisions of the Health Act 1970.</P>
        <P>In 1988 the Mid-Western Health Board agreed to lease the property to the OPW and to allow it to be used as a depot.  It is primarily used for the storage of transport equipment.  The OPW has been in communication with the archivist for Clare County Council in connection with her plans to locate an archive in the building and advised that it is willing to relinquish its lease on the former workhouse.  However, alternative suitable accommodation would be required by the OPW and the council has been requested to assist in this regard.</P>
        <P>The OPW is willing to share accommodation with Clare County Council at any of its premises within a reasonable distance from Corofin.  On provision of a suitable alternative premises the former workhouse can be vacated within a short timeframe.  The OPW has examined its existing property portfolio and has been unable to identify a suitable alternative.  My office is open to further discussions with the council to examine all avenues with regard to the Senator&rsquo;s proposal for the protected structure.</P>
