	<P>I have received notice from Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality, in the light of the outcome of the recent High Court case concerning firearms licensing, to engage with the National Association of Regional Game Councils with a view to addressing the flaws in the licensing system.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Finance to indicate the current stage of the flood relief scheme for Skibbereen, County Cork; the current position of the early warning system; and the arrangements, if any, to carry out flood relief works in 2012-13.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Go dtabharfaidh an tAire Oideachais agus Scileanna soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ar an dul chun cinn maidir le scoil phobail nua a th&oacute;g&aacute;il ar an gCloch&aacute;n, i gContae na Gaillimhe agus an f&eacute;idir leis deimhni&uacute; go gcr&iacute;ochn&oacute;far go luath &iacute; tr&iacute;na cur san &aacute;ireamh mar chuid den phlean t&oacute;g&aacute;la c&uacute;ig bliana a bheidh s&eacute; ag foilsi&uacute; go luath.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to reclassify Down&rsquo;s syndrome as a low incidence disability in order that children with the syndrome receive teaching and learning resources appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Deirdre Clune of the following matter:</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, opt-in motions under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 8, Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, and conclude not later than 4.45 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 7, r&aacute;itis maidir le Seachtain na Gaeilge, statements on Seachtain na Gaeilge, to be taken at 4.45 p.m. and conclude not later than 6 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, with the Minister of State to be called on to reply not later than 5.50 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will be aware that it is more than five months since the residents of Priory Hall had to leave their homes.  Those residents have also been waiting five months for a meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Taoiseach.  Unfortunately, as residents of Priory Hall waited outside the Department of the Taoiseach today, their request for a meeting was not granted.  This is not just a local issue; it is a very serious issue.  Dublin City Council is contesting the fact that it must pay rental for these people even though it is clear the council was negligent in building control and enforcement.  Can the Leader say whether the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will meet concerned citizens of the State who have been made homeless but are still paying mortgages on properties that are now worthless?</P>
        <P Just="Left">My second question is also related to building regulations.  How many times has the committee on pyrite met since it was established by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government?  When is its report due to be published?  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions.  More than 72,500 houses on the east coast of Ireland could potentially be affected by pyrite, and the longer the Government lets this committee sit, the greater the number of people who will be statute barred from litigation.  The statute of limitations is six years and there has been no action from the Government on this matter.  Will I have to ask again this time next year when the pyrite committee will report?  Can the Leader say when it will report and, most importantly, how many times the committee has met so far?</P>
        <P>This is a very serious matter for the greater Dublin and east coast area in particular.  Many people have been in contact with me and my colleagues about it.  They cannot afford the legal cost of going to court.  The Leader will also be aware that HomeBond has washed its hands of this; the insurers are avoiding all responsibility.  Of the 72,500 houses that are potentially affected, only 700 have been remediated to date &mdash; most of them in my constituency &mdash; on foot of a court case that was taken.  There should be some urgency on the part of the Government in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the announcements from the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  Some educationists on the other side of the House have already raised their hands to contribute and I am sure they will welcome the construction of certain school buildings which has been announced by the Minister in the last couple of days.  It is the third and fourth announcement in many cases.  While I realise we will have an opportunity to debate this with the Minister, it is interesting to note that the funding announced for the five-year period is &euro;1.5 billion.  That is substantially less than the &euro;1.9 billion announced in the four-year plan for new school buildings.</P>
        <P>It is also ironic that many of the schools mentioned in the list have already been built.  In my constituency Loreto secondary school, Balbriggan, is referred to in the list of projects on site in 2012.  The people on site are the students.  This project was announced in 2009 and the extension is built.  There are many other examples.  I am aware of another school in Tallaght which has already been built.  The Minister has used his good offices to make at least four separate announcements on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I urge my colleagues on the other side of the House to look at the list.  I believe the Minister is due to visit the House in April.  There is a great deal in his grand master plan, and I welcome much of it because any school that requires a building should get it.  However, the Minister should state that it is actually a reduction of &euro;400 million in the capital programme, and a reduction of &euro;600 million if one annualises the amount.  It is a reduction in investment in our schools.  Perhaps the Leader and some of the educationists in the House can tell how many of the schools on the list are already built.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House specifically to discuss the school building programme, in order that we can get to the bottom of this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased Senator O&rsquo;Brien has given me the opportunity to address the schools building programme.  I had not intended to raise it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Senator did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is uncanny that Fianna F&aacute;il still has not learned to see the wood for the trees.  It is &euro;1.5 billion for 200 new schools and 49 major extensions.  It will lead to 15,000 construction jobs, which is not to be scoffed at by the country&rsquo;s builders&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not disputing that.  They want more, as we had planned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Portlaoise is due to get seven new primary schools.  For 30 years, and under the Fianna F&aacute;il regime, children have been taught in prefabs in Portlaoise in which their parents went to school.  It is nothing sort of a scandal that generation upon generation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>That is probably why we need a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the perseverance of people like the parish priest ofPortlaoise, Fr. John Byrne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator being colloquial again?</P>

	<P>He persevered against the odds.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I just want to commend the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  It bewilders me that Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien has joined the ranks of certain elements in the INTO that have managed to complain about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>They are complaining because it is a major cutback.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to inform the House that the Minister announced last week that a separate fund of &euro;35 million would be provided to replace prefabs in small rural schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of these schools have already been built?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an absolute outrage.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.  I would like to ask him to establish how it is possible to have strong local government and strong local services, such as libraries, good secondary roads, street lighting and fire stations, if local authorities are not being funded.  Many Sinn F&eacute;in spokespeople have taken to the airwaves to appeal to people.  It is lovely to hear them say they will not pay the household charge out of sympathy with those who cannot afford to do so.  Such hypocrisy deserves to be exposed.  They are speaking out of both sides of their mouths.  On the one hand, they want strong local government and strong local services while opposing privatisation.  On the other hand, they are telling people not to pay the household charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>We have never told people not to pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is absurd in the extreme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do.  Will the Leader facilitate a discussion &mdash; a genuine and open debate &mdash; with the Minister for Justice and Equality at some stage in the future on the question of inconsistent sentencing in the courts?  I fully acknowledge and respect the separation of powers.  I am not speaking out of any contempt.  In the past two days four people have received six-year sentences &mdash; one for killing a man with a car, one for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This House had a debate on media standards not too long ago.  Although the Leader is to be commended on organising it, the debate was not entirely satisfactory because the speaking time allocated to Senators was quite limited.  I recall that Senator Norris made an impassioned and eloquent speech during the debate.  Others who had prepared comments, thoughts and suggestions to share with the Minister were confined to a minute or so, or were allowed to ask a brief question.  I am not finding any fault with that other than to say that the debate needs to recommence.  It needs to be continued in a way that allows the Minister to hear extended contributions from Senators who have been expressing concerns about media standards for a long time.  The Minister gave a very eloquent speech, responded to some contributions and answered some questions.  We need more, however.  That is particularly obvious in the wake of the latest controversy that is swirling around RTE and in light of comments by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who is the first in a long time to identify with particular clarity a certain bias that exists in our public service broadcaster's coverage on certain issues from time to time.  I think there is a difference in style to be noted between Deputy Varadkar's very frank assessment of a bias in favour of left wing, or what he calls centre left, viewpoints.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Blank"><NameTxt></NameTxt>
	
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Blank"><NameTxt></NameTxt>
	
        <P>I also notice a tendency in the comments of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to let RTE off the hook, so to speak.  I do not think it was satisfactory that Deputy Rabbitte should go to the other extreme and ridicule the notion that one would have heads on plates so to speak.  I do not think the Madame Defarge approach is being advocated by genuine critics of our public service broadcaster.  There is a very legitimate concern that people who are in receipt of taxpayers&rsquo; money are not doing their utmost to guarantee full fairness, impartiality and balance in their coverage of certain current affairs matters.  There is no doubt that the way RTE set up Mr. Gallagher in the context of &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; programme did indeed change the outcome of the election.  I am very surprised to hear people suggesting otherwise, because it is quite clear that the way the matter was handled on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; programme set in train a series of events that operated very much to Mr. Gallagher&rsquo;s disadvantage.  That is making no critique of the eventual winner.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an extremely serious matter.  On top of the Fr. Kevin Reynolds&rsquo; affair&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There were many players at the scene of that little game.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;we now have this.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Does the Leader think it is satisfactory that each time something like this happens, we get a vague announcement from RTE that it is having reviews of its editorial processes?  I do not think we have heard yet what its editorial processes investigation has found after the Fr. Kevin Reynolds affair.  It is important that the processes should be looked at by an outsider.  Why is it in the context of the medical and legal professions, there is continuous professional development?  There is a proper complaints mechanism for people to make a complaint about their experience of these professionals, which has consequences.  When people make a complaint to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the most the person will get from RTE is a neutral acknowledgement of the complaint.  Last night we saw that Pat Kenny himself did not refer to the findings.  It was read out in a neutral monotone, which is not good enough, given the public service money involved.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  In the light of this and other concerns, does the Leader consent to ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resource, Deputy Rabbitte, to come to the Seanad in order that we can have a more searching and informed debate to build on the debate on media standards that has already taken place?  We can then reflect together on what is needed to deal with this very serious problem.</P>

	<P>I support the call from many quarters for an independent inquiry into &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; presidential debate.  RTE is the national broadcaster and as such it is important, as Senator Mullen has stated, that trust is maintained in it.  It has been suggested that we hold an internal inquiry.  There is a saying in Haggardstown: &ldquo;Ask my brother am I a liar.&rdquo;  I am not implying anything, other than to say that this is not the route to take.  We need an independent inquiry.  If there had been an internal inquiry into F&Aacute;S, we would not have got to the bottom of matters.  If there had been an internal inquiry into the Dr. Neary case, we would not have known the answer.  It would be in RTE&rsquo;s own interest, as well as ensuring the protection of the democratic process, that we have an independent inquiry.  I ask the Leader to consider whether he thinks, as I do, that there should be an independent inquiry.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>My question relates to the contributions by Senators D&rsquo;Arcy and Mullen whose views I share. I have consistently supported the concept of public service broadcasting inside and outside the House because I have seen at first hand the team of dedicated and committed journalists who have brought forward great investigative stories.  Senator D&rsquo;Arcy is correct that it is not in RTE&rsquo;s interest to go down the road of an internal inquiry.  Pandora&rsquo;s box has been opened, whether RTE knows it or not.  We are in a different environment where serious questions are being raised about the integrity, objectivity and impartiality of the only public service broadcasting corporation in the island.  RTE has a special place in the hearts of the people.  They may wish to criticise it but they will also stoutly defend it.  One has only to look at the list of TAM rated programmes.  RTE radio and television programmes which people listen to and watch are consistently home produced.  Therefore RTE has an important place.  It is rather like the BBC in that if it is on RTE, it must be true.</P>

	<P>I do not think Mr. Noel Curran needs to be to be reminded of his duties in this regard.  However, I share Senator D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s view because it is one that has reflected a great deal of concern throughout the country about recent events.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Senator John Whelan and I have been charged by the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture to bring forward a submission under impartiality and objectivity on which subjects the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is engaged in a public consultation.  That is an indication of the seriousness with which the committee is taking the issue.  I share the views expressed and it is important that the House expresses that view.  As Senator D&rsquo;Arcy said it is in RTE&rsquo;s best interest and that of the dedicated team of journalists that the matter is open, transparent and accountable rather than being discussed behind closed doors.  I would welcome a debate on the issue.</P>

        <P>I call on the Leader to provide for an open debate on child sexual abuse and domestic violence.  The Garda Inspectorate report released last month made 29 recommendations to align Garda practices with those of best international practice.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Three young men and three young women are put into an atmosphere of continual drinking.  They are encouraged to behave licentiously and compete to bring people home to bed them.  The last episode was obnoxious.  One of the young women had an interest in somebody who was not particularly interested in her.  She managed to bring somebody back to the house and the other guys decided to gang up and take a bet on whether she could be taken from him.  There was simulated sexual activity, leading, apparently, to full sexual activity.  I wonder what values such behaviour inculcates and whether it is appropriate?  I am not entirely familiar on a habitual basis, even in my neck of the woods, with the language used.</P>
        
        <P>While we are discussing standards, I wish to raise the question of how we care for elderly people, a subject we have debated in the House on a number of occasions.  For example, I raised the case of Valentia Community Hospital; a perfectly valid, functioning hospital was being closed down, the closure of which would cost money and lead to the break-up of a community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not closed down.  Will the Senator, please, get the facts right?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>With the then Senator John Paul Phelan on this side of the House, I raised the case of Bethany Home in Carlow.  Today I raise the case of St. Joseph&rsquo;s in Ardee which has been in operation since 1922 and gone to strenuous lengths to meet the appropriate HIQA requirements.  The people of the area provide personalised care for the elderly.  If they are displaced and transferred to the local hospital, it will be at a multiple of the cost.  </P>
        <P>I will end by quoting the fine words of the Minister for Health before or during the general election:</P>
        <P LI="1">Facilities like these are being closed down, being told that they do not meet standards and they may close, having been deliberately run down.  We have seen in the past how they undermine smaller hospitals with a very simple formula &mdash; starve them of resources, make them unsafe, commission a report and then use that report to justify closure.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I would like to see some standards in place.  The then Senator John Paul Phelan played a noble role in assisting the hospital in County Laois when it was threatened in a similar way.  Let the House act in a unified manner to protect standards and look after the young and the elderly.</P>
        <P>I will end by referring, again, to &ldquo;Tallafornia&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>With regard to recent judicial decisions, it is important to realise that in each case there is a right of appeal on matters still pending.  Before a decision was arrived at a number of days were spent in court and a lot of issues were dealt with.  To be fair to the Judiciary, it adopted a balanced approach.  It does not always get it right, but there is an appeals procedure in place.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise an issue regarding the Irish Medical Council.  I have received a number of emails from Irish graduates.  I am talking about persons who graduated with a medical degree in this country, worked here as interns and junior doctors, left the country to work for a period and have returned to discover  it takes up to two and a half months to re-register with the Irish Medical Council.  Such a lengthy waiting period to process applications is absolutely outrageous when there is a shortage of doctors.  One of the people who has contacted me was in New Zealand and within 24 hours of his arrival there he obtained clearance to start practising.  I know criteria must be met before people can return to the Irish medical system, rightly so, but having to wait two and a half months to obtain clearance from the Irish Medical Council is outrageous.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  Action should be taken immediately by the Irish Medical Council to stop this from continuing.  It is a priority issue because there is a shortage of doctors in the medical profession.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>When this side of the House calls for something and receives most of what it has called for, it is important that we welcome this.  I welcome the &euro;1.5 billion made available in the capital programme for the building of new schools.  This is good news for the schools in question and it is also good news for teachers because more of them will be employed.  Some 15,000 jobs will also be created.  However, there are questions that Members on all sides of the House will want the Minister to address.  Last December he said &euro;2 billion would be made available, but that sum has been reduced.  Where did the &euro;500 million go?  Some 27% of Irish language primary schools and 38% of post-primary Irish language schools are still in prefabricated accommodation.  The Leader will know that in his own county of Waterford, Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n in Tramore has been housed in prefabs for 27 years.  It has long lobbied for funding, yet it is not on the list.  Throughout the country there are examples of schools where children are still being taught in prefabs.   Schools without even a board of management have been allocated funding, yet schools such as the one I mentioned in Tramore is not on the list.  While I welcome the money that has been made available &mdash; and it is good news for schools that receive funding &mdash; there are many schools that have lost out.  Those boards of management have questions and have asked us to put them to the Minister for Education and Skills.  On foot of that positive announcement, the Minister should attend the House to answer our concerns.  We can then revert to those boards of management in schools that have lost out.</P>

	<P>The Government has been making good strides towards reducing the amount of alcohol that is being consumed in this country.  That effort will take a long time, however, and I agree with much of what Senator Norris had to say in this regard.  There is a teenage disco near where I live and the children are drinking once they leave their homes to attend it.  I do not even know what word to use to describe how the girls are dressed, but it is very inappropriate.  The boys, meanwhile, are in tracksuits.  I really do not understand where this has all come from or where it will all end.  I find it very depressing.</P>
        <P>This morning, I heard that Paddy Power have begun installing betting screens in pubs, like televisions whose sole purpose is to display racing odds.  It is timely with Cheltenham starting and perhaps it is convenient for some people, but for me this seems like a step too far.  Pubs are offering free finger food and free euro bets.  They are basically creating a link between drink and betting.</P>

	<P>It turns out there are three on site already in County Laois, which means they are practically complete.  We had that in Meath as well.  In north Meath, two major projects dropped off the list and there was one on the list that is already built.  There was one site to go in 2012, which was already announced by the Minister in December 2011.  Therefore, four have already been built or announced, which is welcome news for the Portlaoise area which needs schools.</P>

I have not looked at the problems concerning the four for 2013-14, but there is not one school in County Meath that has not been announced already by the Government or the previous one.  While any investment by the Minister is to be welcomed, it falls far short of the radical investment he planned.  It also falls far short of what we proposed in the four-year plan, which the parties opposite vigorously and ruthlessly opposed last year, both here and in the D&aacute;il.  It is &euro;300 million a year on school projects.  While every penny of that is needed and welcome, we committed more money in committing to &euro;1.9 billion over four years up to 2015.  We allocated &euro;491 million in 2011 and &euro;597 in 2010.</P>

The capital plan has been ruthlessly dragged apart to put in place the most unfair budget in the past five years, as has been confirmed by the ESRI.  Mr. Colm Rapple in the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday</i> stated it was most unfair because the Government targeted the poorest of the poor, cut the capital budget and is now spinning it to claim it is doing something great.  We need the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to clarify the figures he mentioned on the radio yesterday and also to clarify the projects that will proceed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Byrne reminds me of <i>Waiting for Godot</i> in which nothing happens, twice.  That happened under the previous Administration.  Schools were promised right, left and centre, but they never appeared.  Five or six new buildings or extensions in County Donegal have been announced in the past three months.  During the 15 or 20 years when children were in prefabs, nothing happened.  Nothing would have happened but for the change of government.  Let Deputy Martin explain to the children of Donegal why he is apologising.  He did not apologise for the lack of school places in Donegal.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is as follows.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has indicated that the household charge can be paid through post offices.  I ask him to extend that to include payment of the non-principal private residence, NPPR, tax.  Many people, especially from across the Border, come to Donegal and wonder where they can pay this.  Some of them do not do it online and council offices might be closed at weekends.  They come on a Friday and may go home on a Sunday or Monday.  Donegal is a county with many holiday homes and such a facility would be very handy for them.  Unlike the locals, they want to pay it.</P>
        <P>Some local people in Donegal do not want to pay for local services and want those local services to be provided by someone else.  As someone who served on Donegal County Council for 12 years and Letterkenny Town Council for 17 years, I know the value of funding local government.  These people are refusing to pay because they do not want to pay and not because they cannot afford to pay.  There are people who cannot afford to pay, but they are being looked after.  Sinn F&eacute;in should be consistent.  It advocates non-payment, but is quite happy for people to pay it in Derry, Strabane, Fermanagh and Antrim.  Why is Sinn F&eacute;in happy to pay it there?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senators Whelan, Jim D&rsquo;Arcy and Cullinane I welcome the schools building programme.  However, a sour note was expressed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning when a spokesman for the Construction Industry Federation said many people would be unhappy to see Northern Ireland builders build these schools.  I utterly disagree with that remark.  The schools should be built following competitive tendering.  Last week I presented evidence in the House and sent it to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, on certain works in Enniskillen.  We have a problem with competitiveness in architectural services, mechanical and electrical engineering services, and structural engineering services.  However, if we can spend the money in the best way on building, we have more scholar per dollar, as they used to say, which should be the object of the exercise.  We are in a European Union free trade area.  It is more than 50 years since Se&aacute;n Lemass and Terence O&rsquo;Neill tried to promote cross-Border trade.  Ignoring the advice of the Construction Industry Federation, the Leader might suggest that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Education in Northern Ireland, Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd, MLA, should do this as a joint project to get the best value for the young people of Ireland.  This is an area of profitable consultation and co-operation between the Departments with responsibility for education on both sides of the Border.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to inquire what steps is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade taking with regard to an Irish passport holder who is facing a death sentence if an extradition from Dubai to Egypt is carried out.  In a report by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade when this person was granted asylum, it was stated that if she was returned to Egypt, she would be arrested and possibly receive a death sentence for forgery and the abduction of Muslim children &mdash; her own &mdash; from their father and the national territory.

The woman who was arrested on 28 February has not received any consular visit and her legal team which is requesting exorbitant sums of money from the family is stating she will be deported to Egypt and that there is little anyone can do about this.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is doing very little; the woman has not even received a visit from departmental officials who have been telling the family it is not their area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I call on the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the worsening situation in Syria in which more than 8,000 people, many of them women and children, have died in the past year since anti-government protests erupted.  We all see the horrific images on our television screens on a nightly basis.  In a separate development, we read this morning that a human rights group is accusing Syria of laying landmines along the border with Lebanon and Turkey which could result in casualties for years to come.  Everybody in the House would support the call made by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, and the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton, for the international community to speak with one voice on the situation in Syria.  I am sure we would all call on Russia and China to support the humanitarian and political approach being adopted by the Arab League.  It is clear that the Syrian Government has failed in its responsibilities to protect its own citizens, while the rest of the world has a responsibility to protect the innocent and the vulnerable.  We must ask whether the United Nations should consider the possibility of sending a peacekeeping force to Syria.  Perhaps we might also debate if it is time for it to consider having its own peacekeeping force instead of having to rely on countries to provide soldiers for peacekeeping duties in trouble spots throughout the world.  This is a matter of grave importance which we must discuss in the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The integrity of the broadcasting system has been highly valued for many years, but it has been damaged recently by the Fr. Reynolds case and now by the Se&aacute;n Gallagher case.  I support Senators Jim D&rsquo;Arcy, Paschal Mooney and R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen who have all called for an investigation into the matter.  It is not enough to have a debate on it in the House; there must be an open investigation into what is happening to ensure confidence in the national broadcaster of which we have been proud and which has done fabulous work during the years.  We must ensure we help it to continue in the same vein, as it has been damaged and the only way to overcome the damage is by having an external investigation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Sean Barrett talked about competitiveness in the building industry.  I was stunned &mdash; the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators will agree with me &mdash; to hear builders say we must exclude builders from the North of Ireland.  During the years I have found there has been a protectionist as well as a partitionist attitude, forgetting that people in counties Armagh, Down and Antrim are as Irish as anyone else.  If we look at what has happened in Switzerland where a move to increase national holidays was rejected in a referendum because it would make the Swiss less competitive and endanger jobs, it should serve as an example.  If we were given the same opportunity here, would we give the same answer?  Certainly not, judging by the way some display the attitude that we should exclude builders from the North of Ireland from building schools here.</P>

	<P>There are times when institutions which have served the State well, which were born of and espoused integrity during the years, reach a point in their existence when they must stand back and take stock, particularly when there is reputational damage, as has happened in the case of RTE.  I call on the director general and the chairman of the RTE Authority to take two or three steps back and look at the bigger picture, at the future role RTE will play if it can restore its reputation.  They will have no choice but to do this when they take these steps back and see the damage done in the last 12 months.  Having an inquiry would be healthy and must happen in the public interest.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on white collar crime.  In this country, to date, we have seen no bankers go to jail, in spite of bankrupting the State.  It is a shame that no one from Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society has had to walk into Mountjoy Prison and take his or her place in a cell, like those who have committed much less onerous crimes.  We have a responsibility to debate the issue of white collar crime in the Seanad.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There are 365 days of the year on each of which we can find reasons to be proud of our achievements as a nation.  During the years we chose St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day as the focus for that pride.  I was sad the other evening while I was listening to a programme on RTE on which there was a vox-pop.  People were asked what St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day meant to them.  With few exceptions, drink was mentioned by the people interviewed.  We know what we have seen in the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade in Dublin.  There might be the same difficulties throughout the country as well, but we should remember that the abuse of alcohol has fuelled much of the violence in this country, including in people&rsquo;s homes.  It has also been responsible for the terrorising of elderly people.  One can imagine the reaction of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come here to be part of the celebration of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day when they see what can only be described as thuggery taking place.  It is unacceptable.  There should be some way of getting across the message through the media that it is not acceptable.  People want the opportunity to show off their talents and what they are doing in their communities.  After all their hard work, to have that disrupted and misrepresented cannot be acceptable.  This issue is quite minor compared with some of the major issues that have been raised in the House today, but I have listened to people in communities who have been terrorised and it is almost a matter of life or death for them.  I hope this House will ask people to drink in moderation in order that we can keep the pride we have as a people, which we try to demonstrate on St. Patrick's Day.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Mullins that the issue of Syria should be debated in the House.  It is being neglected and we must consider what we can do, if anything, to help the people there.  The laying of mines on the route between Syria and Turkey that is being used by the fleeing refugees is deplorable.  We should condemn it.</P>
        <P>The issue I wish to raise is public procurement.  Members have spoken about the new schools, Irish builders and so forth.  Naturally, the Government must seek best value.  We are anxious to encourage North-South co-operation and so forth but we are also anxious to ensure there are jobs for people in this country as well.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, recently made an announcement on foot of &ldquo;The Business&rdquo; programme, in which George Lee pointed out that a meat factory in Meath had lost a contract through public procurement for the sake of &euro;6,000.  The factory said it would create eight extra jobs but the Government could not take that into consideration when evaluating value for money.  The Minister of State went to Europe about it.  Perhaps he would come to the House to debate public procurement.  The Minister of State has negotiated with Europe and Ireland can now take into account the provision of jobs when evaluating value for money in contracts.  I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, to make a statement on it in the House.</P>

	<P>I confess that I am not from Mayo but my three children are half Mayo.  The reason I mention this is that I am trying to use that influence with two famous Mayo parliamentarians who have proven somewhat elusive on issues on which I have sought clarification.  One of them is the Taoiseach.  Yet again over the weekend there was considerable speculation on the future of one half of our Parliament and about when a referendum would be held on its future.  Now that this Oireachtas is in its second year and with the approach of the first anniversary of this Seanad, it is very important that the Taoiseach comes to the House, both as a courtesy to us and to impart information to the nation, and let us know what plans there are with respect to the proposed referendum to abolish the Seanad.</P>

	<P>It is extraordinarily unsatisfactory, despite my multiple entreaties.  I will not play the stunt of proposing an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Taoiseach to come to the House.  However, at this stage it is essential that he come to the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second Mayo parliamentarian is the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton.  On a number of occasions I have asked for clarification from the Minister of State on a particular issue.  She came to the House previously but due to time constraints, my question was not answered.  I hope I can ask the Leader to convey my questions to the Minister of State.  How is it proposed that a structural deficit will be calculated for the purposes of the proposed fiscal compact?  There is something far short of unanimity among the economics community on the question of how it is calculated.  I would like to know whether it is the Minister of State&rsquo;s speculative or considered opinion, or that of the fiscal quadrumvirate that is running the Government, that the financial catastrophe would have been averted if this pact had been in place in the late 1990s or the early 2000s.  Would it have made any difference?</P>
        <P>I will conclude by mentioning in passing that I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade whether the Government can clarify what interventions it has made in the case of Pastor Nadarkhani in Iran, who is still on death row under sentence of death for the crime of being a Christian.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The coverage of the recent Presidential election left an awful lot to be desired.  Not a single sector of the media emerged with much credit from it.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, for having the courage to raise a significant issue, as Senator Mullen said.  I wish his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, would show the same seriousness in dealing with the complaints that have been made about a particular television programme.  There is no doubt that people of every political persuasion throughout the country, including those who voted for the winner of the Presidential election, are disgusted with the manner in which the programme in question, and a radio programme the following morning, were dealt with.  Questions have to be asked about what was behind the whole thing.  I do not think the seriousness of the matter has been acknowledged to date.  One way or the other, there will be a big debate on it.  I call on the Leader to add his voice to the call for a public inquiry into the two programmes and the presenter who was the common denominator in each case.  All of these people are good at asking questions of us and of business people, those involved in the legal profession and teachers.  They are not as good at confessing their own sins and facing reality.  The treatment of Mr. Gallagher on the programme in question not only cast a cloud over him and over the whole election, but it probably cast a spell over the Presidency itself.</P>

We need the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to come here.  I told the Minister, Deputy Bruton, that a crisis is being caused by the lack of liquidity in the economy.  I do not know how we can create jobs if people are unable to ensure their businesses grow.  They cannot do so if finance is not available.  It is not coming through.  There is no point in having public relations events and jobs action plans of hundreds of pages if funds are not available to help companies to grow.  Companies grow when they have finance.  They create employment when they grow.  We need the Minister for Finance to come to the House as a matter of urgency.

	<P>I call for a debate on media in general, similar to the themes that have been raised by those calling for a debate on the presidential election coverage.  The problem is that we preside over a national media that we praise constantly for its integrity.  The reality is that we do not have reportage.  We do not have newspapers, but &ldquo;viewspapers&rdquo;.  We do not have a national broadcaster that reports the news but we have a national broadcaster which reports a complexion it wishes to place on the facts that are promoted per day.  Frankly, it does not matter who is in government, whether it is a Fine Gael and Labour Party Government, a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, or Sinn F&eacute;in and so on.</P>

In my view that does not amount to free speech, but legalised subversion of the State.  It is fundamentally wrong.  What we need is someone or medium which reports the facts.  We praise the people of Ireland for being among the most educated in the world.  They are prepared and able to make their own decisions based on the facts, if presented, but not as presented by the editorial staff whether in RTE or in other news media.</P>
        <P>I intend to raise the following issue privately with the Leader, but everybody should be aware, that there is a major news agency under the charge of quite a few regional newspapers which has instructed staff not to print any news releases from Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

The matter is before the courts and that is the reason the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, have not met the residents.  It is a dreadful situation and the building standards that pertained at that point in time should be condemned by everybody.

We would all like to see more money being spent on schools, local government, social welfare and many other services but it is not available.  That is the simple fact.  We hope to get the best possible value from the construction of these schools and irrespective of whether the builders will be from Northern Ireland, Senator Barrett is right that we must get the best value for these schools.  It is to be hoped the schools programme will give employment to the 15,000 people to whom it is estimated it will give such.</P>

Many Senators have questioned the integrity of the national broadcaster and stated that to ensure its integrity is maintained, there should be a public inquiry into the matter.

        <P>Senator Burke referred to the Irish Medical Council taking two and a half months to make a decision on doctors.  That is not good enough.  The Senator quoted a case in New Zealand which took only a matter of days.  It is a matter I will raise with the Minister for Health.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>f</i>) whether the procedure related to disease eradication can be accomplished by a non-registered person;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>g</i>) that a procedure that can be performed by a non-registered person with the appropriate skills, training and experience that these procedures be performed by a non-registered person. Procedures that should be performed by a non-registered person are inclusive of but not limited to those enumerated below. The enumerated procedures are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) farriery,</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) equine dentistry,</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) bovine hoof trimming,</P>

        <P LI="3">(vii) physiotherapy,</P>
        <P LI="3" Just="Left">(viii) TB inoculation.&ldquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House.  We had a good debate on this Bill on Second Stage and I have now tabled amendments for Committee Stage.  On the last occasion we debated this legislation, the House was united with the Minister on the need to reform the profession, as they all have to be reformed according to the IMF-EU-ECB agreement.  We have had wide-ranging problems with the sheltered sector professions.</P>
        <P>I supported the Minister on the changes needed.  The context was having a quality assurance regime in place to assist the development of the food industry to the degree everybody in the House supported as a major part of growing the economy.  As the explanatory memorandum states, we had inadvertently precipitated a shortage of qualified veterinarians.  A Competition Authority report indicated that 40% of new vets were from outside the State.  That made me question having a restriction on the numbers studying veterinary medicine which requires up to 550 leaving certificate points and giving a monopoly to one institution.  We need this expansion to facilitate a development goal that is of great importance to everybody.</P>
        <P>The Minister has said he wishes to extend the range of activities traditionally carried out in respect of animals by farmers and other persons with appropriate skills which had been inadvertently reserved for veterinary practitioners or nurses.  I assume some of the restrictive practices engaged in by professions had also been advertently provided for in legislation.  We recognise the importance of competitiveness to the economy, particularly to the export-led sectors.  We were pleased to see indications last week that that policy was starting to work, given that 10,000 more people were at work, albeit having lost almost 300,000 jobs after the collapse of the banking system and bringing in of the IMF.  In that spirit, my amendment seeks to insert subsections based expressly on the Minister&rsquo;s comments on Second Stage about the procedures he wished to remove which, as the explanatory memorandum states, were inadvertently reserved for the veterinary profession.  The items listed in my amendment are taken from the Minister&rsquo;s Second Stage speech during which he said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The procedures in question include farriery, equine dentistry, bovine hoof trimming, micro-chipping of companion animals, scanning of cattle and sheep and physiotherapy ... The legal advice obtained by my Department indicated that in the event of legal disputes arising, there could be doubt about the status of such procedures carried out on animals ... My Department has received advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that this cannot be done in a comprehensive manner without amending the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  Under the amendments I am proposing, my office will be vested with a delegated power to make ministerial regulations, exempting specified procedures from being reserved to registered people.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My amendment is proposed in that spirit.  I do not know whether the Government asterisk should be placed beside some of the items the Minister mentioned.  I invite him to so do should he so wish to do so.</P>
        <P>The final item I included in the list was TB inoculation having spoken to some people involved in the meat business.  Obviously, the Minister is the expert .  However, I understand that for TB eradication the animal receives an injection in the neck and 24 hours later it is checked to see whether it is a reactor.  The people to whom I have spoken believe this should be carried out by a technician.</P>
        <P>I have explained the origins of and motivation for my amendment which are the same as those of the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for tabling the amendment which I regard as sensible and practical and which would be welcomed in farming circles.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I note the contents of the Department&rsquo;s regulatory impact assessment which accompanies the legislation.  Moreover, in his Second Stage speech in this Chamber some weeks ago the Minister mentioned that procedures such as the scanning of cattle and sheep, bovine hoof-trimming, physiotherapy, equine dentistry and microchipping of dogs and pets could be excluded from the necessity of being performed by a registered vet.  The difficulty with using a registered vet is that such services can be expensive, particularly when one takes into account that these procedures are minor in comparison with other more complicated and emergency-type procedures that may be required on farms or in the case of pets or companion animals.  I support Senator Sean Barrett&rsquo;s sensible amendment.</P>
        <P>I understand the approach taken by the Minister under the legislation is that he will regulate following consultation with the industry.  In the amendment Senator Sean Barrett proposes to define this set of procedures within the legislation.  I await with interest the Minister&rsquo;s comments in this regard.  Other procedures he might consider include the dehorning of cattle, as well as the scanning of sheep, physiotherapy and TB inoculations which are listed in Senator Sean Barrett&rsquo;s amendment.  I also seek his views on whether TB testing services could be exempted from needing the assistance of a veterinary practice.  He also could give consideration to exempting other minor routine procedures such as the castration of young cattle.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, many people close to the agricultural field may be aware of old cures.  For example, I have encountered people in the north west with a cure for orf in sheep.  While one might call it a prayer-type cure, it is for the treatment of orf in sheep and I have seen at first-hand on our farm how it actually works.  Moreover, the veterinary treatment for orf in sheep did not work.  I personally have been involved in bringing sheep to someone who has been able to provide a cure and it has actually worked.  One should ensure enough space is given to farmers in this regard in order that no offence will be built in if they&mdash;&mdash;</P>

T&aacute; ciall leis agus leis an chur chuige at&aacute; molta, ach s&iacute;lim go bhfuil ciall leis an leas&uacute; at&aacute; molta ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Barrett agus ba mhaith liom tac&uacute; leis.  In general, as previously stated, I support the Bill.  However, the amendment tabled by Senator Sean Barrett has some merit.  I have mentioned previously the position in Connemara where difficulties are being experienced because of the scarcity of available vets to provide services.  It has been found to be difficult to attract vets to live in rural areas to provide some of the basic services mentioned in the Bill.  This echoes the sentiments expressed by the Minister on Second Stage.  It is important to have clarity on an issue such as this in order that farmers will know precisely where they stand and what they can and cannot do.  Moreover, future Ministers who may not have the same grasp of this issue as the current incumbent may not be as open to retaining some of the practices on the list.  In general, Sinn F&eacute;in supports this practical and commonsense amendment which makes sense.  It is good to note specifically these practices in order that farmers and the veterinary industry would know exactly where they stood.</P>
        
        <P>In addition, while Sinn F&eacute;in takes on board the issues veterinarians might have about others cutting into their area of expertise and so on, it is accepted generally that the measures outlined are standard that farmers would be comfortable carrying out on a daily basis.  Given that in rural areas it can often be difficult, for a number of reasons, to avail of the services of veterinarians, the amendment is eminently practicable and I call on the Minister to take it on board, if possible.</P>

	<P>It is a wooly issue.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Sean Barrett for tabling amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  Amendment No. 1 gives me an opportunity to clarify a number of issues.  However, I cannot accept it and wish to explain why.  In it the Senator is proposing a significantly different approach to that foreseen in the Bill.  The approach I have taken is to set down the principles and policies which a Minister will be obliged to take into account in determining, through ministerial regulations, whether a particular procedure can and should be exempted.  In other words, the Bill is enabling legislation which will allow me to consider whether particular procedures comply with these principles and policies and whether such procedures should be exempted.  The Senator appears to accept this approach, but he then proposes that an indicative list of procedures to be exempted be specified in primary legislation rather than at a later stage in regulations.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 1 is inconsistent with the entire thrust of the Bill because, in effect, the inclusion of a list of exempted procedures would pre-empt the type of detailed consideration as provided for in the Bill of precisely which procedures can and should be exempted.  This is particularly relevant in the context of the comments made by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.  The Bill also provides that prior to making regulations the Minister will consult stakeholders, particularly the Veterinary Council, on whether certain procedures can or should be exempted.  If the Minister considers that a particular procedure could be exempted, further consideration must be given to the limits of the exemption, the skills and competencies that will be required, whether the exempted person must be a member of a professional body, etc.  The proposed amendment would pre-empt this consideration and consultation process which I believe to be an essential element of the regulation-making process.</P>
        <P>More specifically, the proposal by Senator Sean Barrett to insert an additional criterion &mdash; in the form of the new paragraph (<i>f</i>) &mdash; in section 54B of the principal Act is unnecessary because the criterion concerned, that is, the ability to carry out a procedure regardless of whether it is related to disease eradication, is provided for in section 54B(1)(<i>a</i>).  The key considerations in determining whether a procedure should be exempted are whether the person carrying out the procedure possesses the requisite skills and whether the procedure being carried out by the non-registered person is likely to cause significant risk to animal health or welfare or public health.  Whether a procedure relates specifically to disease eradication is irrelevant in the context of defining the governing criteria in primary legislation.</P>
        <P>It is not possible technically to accommodate the approach suggested by Senator Sean Barrett within the legislative model proposed in the Bill.  Also, the said approach would run the risk of undermining the process itself.  However, the essential concerns underlying the Senator&rsquo;s proposal, including having regard to competency issues and concerning all relevant activities, can and will be addressed within the regulation-making process that is already part of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Senator and I are probably trying to achieve the same thing.  He wants there to be full consultation with all stakeholders, be it farming organisations, the Veterinary Council or whomever, in order that an accurate and appropriate list might be put in place.  This would mean that farmers could do work for which they possess the necessary skills without actually risking the health of animals.  I take my responsibility in this matter very seriously.  The Bill relates to setting the parameters for how I will make my decision in this regard.  We could set down a list now on the basis of what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has seen working in sheep flocks in Donegal &mdash; I do not belittle it &mdash; but we cannot make legislation with that type of approach.  This is a serious business concerning animal health, disease control and ensuring there is no interference with human health and food entering the human food chain.  We are trying to get the list right and this legislation is about putting a framework around this.  If we decide we want to change or amend the list, we should be able to do so without having to revert to primary legislation and going through a series of stages to do so.</P>
        <P>For example, de-horning animals is not on the list proposed but we may want to put it on the list.  There may be a tail docking issue that is not on the list with which we may want to deal.  We may want to put certain restrictions around a certain practice.  For example, equine dentistry is a very broad term, and horse owners should be able to carry out some forms themselves.  Other and more detailed surgery should clearly be done by a vet.  Similarly, there is some complex physiotherapy for animals that requires qualified vets or veterinary nurses but others can be done by animal owners.  We can try to cover everything in the list we put together as legislators but we are not experts and we will get it wrong, leading to a need to amend the list through primary legislation.  It would probably have to be amended every year.  I am trying to put in place a structure that will not only require the Minister to consult widely before changing the regulations and list but also to allow him or her change it, as appropriate, based on the advice of stakeholders and so on.</P>
        <P>The approach we are taking is right and we consulted widely before taking it.  For farmers and veterinary practitioners and nurses as well as for general animal health and welfare, it is the right approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The list is inclusive of but not limited to those acts which are enumerated; it is not meant to be an exclusive list.  I thank colleagues for their support and welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response, as always.  Putting in place a process of consultation but not taking on board what Parliament wishes is part of the system which has the country where it is.  Parliament was repeatedly bypassed, we went bankrupt and the IMF had to come in to rescue us.  With 42 new Senators and 77 new Deputies, we want to help the Minister play a part and in doing so, we make suggestions.  It is easier to change a Parliament than it is to change permanent governments, social partners or the senior Civil Service, so it is important that all the people elected to the Oireachtas command some audience with the people who make decisions.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned that we have a Minister who is most committed, interested, qualified and capable, which I appreciate.  That might not always be the case so giving the power to amend the list anonymously and without legislation does not recognise Ireland&rsquo;s current position.  It is a country where so much governance has failed and it has had to be rescued.  My general point about the Government is that it has been too conservative, as governance rather than the Government was the failure.  We need to examine some of the institutions which created our national problems.  We may divert resources into having veterinary professionals provide for these matters at significant expense at a time when we are trying to develop an international food business.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s advice, as well as his credentials, bona fides and interest in this area.  He is one of the first Ministers to come before the House at the Leader&rsquo;s request and has done so to discuss his plans for the food industry which have been strongly welcomed by all Senators.  However, Members of the Oireachtas also have a role in this regard, which is the reason I have enumerated a number of procedures.  Where Members believe something needs be done, we should submit a proposal and give the Minister the benefit of the experience of those elected to the House.  Many of our institutions do not work and must be reformed by elected representatives.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
        <P>The Minister and I are <i>ad idem</i> on so many issues that I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.  It is important, nonetheless, for both Houses to recognise that much needs to be done to correct the dreadful position in which the country finds itself having been rescued by the International Monetary Fund last December 12 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator and I agree on the broader issue of the need to reform how the Oireachtas and governance operate in this country.  I do not need to remind people of some of the mistakes made.  There are two roles for Ministers and the Oireachtas.  We are legislators and it is up to us to establish a legal framework to allow decisions to be made by the Executive or the Government.  The judgment call we must make in this respect is whether it is appropriate to insert in primary legislation a list drawn up by legislators with the technical input of veterinary professionals, farming organisations and so forth, especially given that this list will, undoubtedly, change from year to year, depending on the skill set of farmers and other developments such as new diseases, cures or methods of treating animals, for example, in the areas of dosing and injecting.  One must ask, therefore, whether it would be appropriate for Members of the Oireachtas to be restrictive in inserting a precise list in the legislation or even to provide that while the list may not be exhaustive, the procedures included in the list are fixed.  I am required in any case to introduce a regulation to add to the list.  The whole thrust of the Bill is to put in place a legal framework for the decision making process which allows a Minister, by regulation, to compile a list.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the legislation is supported by all parties &mdash; not a single amendment was tabled to the Bill in the other House &mdash; it has taken six months to reach this point.  Furthermore, it must return to the D&aacute;il for final consideration following this debate.  If a farming organisation informs me that a new procedure is available and veterinarians have agreed that farmers may perform it, implementing the required change in law could take four, five or six months.  This type of unworkable system has resulted in poor governance at times.  While I understand what Senator Sean Barrett is trying to do, the purpose of the legislation is create conditions that will allow a Minister to consult appropriately before making a decision on what to include in or exclude from the list.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While we could have a long debate on who is an appropriate person to perform tuberculosis inoculation, the systems in place for tuberculosis are working reasonably well.  We have fewer cases of the disease than at any time since the 1950s.  For this reason, I am reluctant to tamper with the current systems until we come close to eradicating tuberculosis from herds which I hope will be the case in the not too distant future.  While I understand from where Senator Sean Barrett is coming, I hope he will understand the approach I have taken, which is the right one.</P>

We must be mindful of the fact that we are dealing with animal welfare.  As a parliamentarian, in the past I was often critical of Ministers, including some of our own, who brought in regulations after the primary legislation had been passed.  One example of that is the septic tank legislation.  Although it was passed, we still have not seen the maintenance standard, although we cannot blame the Minister for that.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 3</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, to delete lines 33 to 38.</P>
        <P FLI="0">According to the explanatory memorandum, this section deals with the new provision to enable the Veterinary Council of Ireland, with the consent of the Minister, by regulation to make indemnity insurance mandatory for specified types of veterinary practice.  The requirement will not, however, apply to practitioners in respect of official duties.</P>
        <P>Part of what got the country into the situation it is in is moral hazard.  Why were we exempting people from the consequences of unsatisfactory performance of their duties by not having to carry insurance?  The State needs to borrow money.  Veterinary professionals are educated at substantial expense by the State.  We heard from the Higher Education Authority this morning that the veterinary course is the most expensive among all courses.  A previous Member of the House, T.K. Whitaker, said that the disease eradication programme was one of the biggest financial scandals in the history of the State, and that was in his time.  We have had some other whoppers since.  A fine of &euro;100 million was imposed on Ireland for malpractice in the meat trade, which people tell me could not have been imposed were it not for the connivance of the veterinary profession.  If we do not hold these people liable and they hold their own insurance, the burden goes to the Minister, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and society as a whole.  The exemption of vets acting in their official capacity from the requirement to carry insurance for indemnity purposes is wrong in the circumstances.  Even if we were not in financial difficulty I would still argue that people who are professionally trained to a high standard should bear the consequences of their mistakes.</P>
        <P>On 29 and 30 September 2008 I would have said the same to the bankers who were knocking on Government doors.  People have to take responsibility for their actions.  It is too easy to say that the Exchequer and the national debt will reimburse everybody for ever.  It is part of our new acceptance of responsibility in the new Ireland that we take responsibility to buy insurance to cover malpractice for indemnity purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Our reading of the amendment is that the indemnity applies to the veterinarians but not those under the remit of the Department.  We question why they are not covered specifically under the indemnity clause.  However, we will listen to the Minister&rsquo;s reply before deciding whether to support the amendment.  It appears the vets in the open market are being treated differently from those employed under the auspices of the Minister or by contract through the Minister.  We seek clarification as to why that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was the focus of much discussion between my officials and me because I raised the same questions as the Deputy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Barrett is proposing to remove from the Bill the general exemption from mandatory indemnity insurance which would apply to registered persons acting as an officer of the State, in other words somebody working for the Department to the Government.  This exemption was provided for in the Bill in recognition of the fundamentally different role played by vets who carry out official functions when compared with those in private practice.  As Senators will be aware, the latter generally treat animals for reward.  It was considered appropriate in the interest of protecting clients that there would be an adequate financial provision for any civil claims arising in the event of a misdiagnosis or inadequate or inappropriate treatment by a vet.  This is the rationale underpinning the amendment in section 3 which provides that the Veterinary Council may make regulations, with my consent, specifying the circumstances in which indemnity is to be required.  However, official vets are in an entirely different space.  Vets working for the State, by definition, carry out official functions underpinned by legislation.  They rarely, if ever, treat animals as part of their official duties.  Instead, their role relates to applying their expertise in carrying out inspections on farms or in meat plants or, alternatively, providing expert advice within my Department.  Thus the scope for incurring liability of the type arising from private practitioners is, to all intents and purposes, non-existent.</P>
        
        <P>Having regard to the very different position of vets working on official duties compared with private vets, it would be illogical and unreasonable to require them to carry personal indemnity for the role since they are not acting on their own behalf but on behalf of the State.  Official vets, like any other public servants, are indemnified in respect of the lawful exercise of their functions.  Thus, any legal actions arising in respect of their official role will be directed against the State.  I emphasise, however, that the exemption only applies to vets while undertaking work on behalf of the State.  Therefore, if a vet who works part-time for the State also engages in private practice, he or she would, in principle, be required to have indemnity insurance in respect of his or her private practice.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.  Essentially, we are making a distinction between people who are acting on behalf of the State such as a teacher, for example, and individuals who are using their professional expertise in a personal capacity for financial return.  If we asked veterinarians to take out personal indemnity insurance for the work they are carrying out for my Department or the State and the State was obliged to cover that work also, there would be a double payment.  It would amount to unnecessary duplication.</P>
        <P>We select from a panel of 700 veterinarians for work in meat processing factories, for example, for inspections, quality control and so forth, and they work with the Department&rsquo;s veterinarians in this work.  What if I were to require them to take out personal indemnity insurance, as well as having to cover that work on behalf of the State?  If one of them made a mistake, for example, there would be a civil case not only against the veterinarian but also potentially against the State.  We cannot get away from this.  When somebody is acting on behalf of the State, the State is liable.  We are making the distinction between the work veterinarians do in an official capacity and the work they do in a private capacity and the pay they receive for that private work.  This was the best balance we could strike.</P>
        <P>I will not accept the amendment, but I must admit I asked the same question when I read the Bill for the first time.  I asked why we were making a distinction between somebody who was doing a public servant&rsquo;s work and somebody who was doing private work, given that they should take personal responsibility either way.  However, there is a distinction in terms of the work they do and for whom they are working.  When they are doing private work, they are working for themselves as a sole trader, in most cases, or for a practice.  In the case of a veterinary practice, it will have to provide indemnity cover.  When they are working for the State, it is a very different role and in the vast majority of cases it is entirely different work in terms of it being supervisory or to do with inspections rather than actual animal health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>

	<P>Great minds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has said they generally treat animals for reward.  The economic distinction in that regard between veterinarians on the public payroll and those in private practice requires examination.  Veterinarians who work for the State are doing it for reward, a very handsome reward if one looks at some of the numbers people such as former Senator T. K. Whitaker pointed to previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>However, they are not paid by the client.  That is the difference.  They are paid by the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I am trying to get at their malpractice.  I will use my old analogy.  If I did something wrong to a student in Trinity College Dublin, the lawyers would undoubtedly say that as an individual lecturer, I was not much of a mark.  If they could prove I was acting on behalf of the Provost, that would look a little more promising, while if they could prove I was acting on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, they would be in real business.  Does the exemption from the need to indemnify for professional malpractice leave the State wide open to the type of case mentioned?  It is, perhaps, a far fetched case, but I am sure the lawyers would inquire.  They would say it was not worth taking a case against the individual because he or she was not a good mark which I believe is the phrase lawyers use, but we have made the State a huge mark in terms of the entire national debt, whatever else we can borrow, promissory notes and so forth.  Does it lead to the State being vulnerable that highly trained professionals who are handsomely rewarded by it and supposed to be of the same or higher professional standard as those in private practice are performing uninsured?  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point, but that is the danger.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s clarification about part-timers.  It was brought to my attention the need to distinguish between when they were working for the State and when they were working for themselves and ensure we were not carrying any insurance burden for persons who worked half in and half out of the two systems.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  The Minister and I were asking exactly the same questions.  In human medicine, the NTMA estimates that claims outstanding amount to &euro;760 million.  Ultimately they are borne by taxpayers who have declining and rather low average incomes.  It has been a legal tradition in Ireland to transfer these burdens to the taxpayer, whom I think must have some protection, particularly in the present circumstances.  That is the reason I tabled this amendment.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point, and I will withdraw my amendment.</P>
        <P>Professions must bear responsibility for their own standards, whether they work for the State or in private practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s final point on professional standards.  This Bill is all about standards.  We have drawn a distinction in terms of who pays for personal indemnity insurance between a veterinary surgeon who is working for the State and we are paying him or her to do that versus a veterinary surgeon in practice, where a client is paying him or her for services.  We are seeking to ensure the client is protected in cases of incompetence, malpractice or laziness.  My experience of the veterinary surgeons who work in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been very good.  Let me assure Members that if there is evidence of malpractice by a veterinary surgeon working for the State on official duties, we will take action and will be strongly supported by the Veterinary Council in doing that.  On the specific issue of legal indemnity, having asked the same questions as the Senators have asked, I think we have taken the correct approach.  I therefore cannot accept the amendment.  I appreciate that the Senator has offered to withdraw it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There was one other point arising, which might be of interest.  Some people in the meat trade who are very proud of their reputation say that the customer is the best person to police the product.  It is a longer term project.  Perhaps the veterinary surgeons employed by the State in the meat factories may not be needed in the future in a meat trade that is proud of and defends its reputation.</P>
        <P>I agree that inspections were necessary in the past, because some had reputations which were damaging to the country, but that may not always be the case.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s advice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The overall objective of this proposed amendment is to clarify and update the particular aspects of veterinary practice which veterinary nurses are permitted to carry out.  The amendment is being proposed at this stage of the legislative process because it arises from a submission received at the end of 2011 from Veterinary Ireland, the representative body for the veterinary profession.  I mentioned when introducing the Bill on 21 February that the 2005 Act provided a springboard for development of the veterinary nursing profession, with almost 500 nurses registered to practise.  In the field of education and training we have moved on from the time when nurses had to go abroad to be trained to the current position where five colleges in Ireland now offer approved and accredited degree level courses.  In addition nurses in practice, when the 2005 Act came into force have undergone a comprehensive upskilling process under transitional arrangements which were provided for in the Act.  My amendment recognises the significant improvement in the training of nurses.  It also reflects the positive manner in which the veterinary practitioners and nurses have worked together over recent years.</P>
        <P>My amendment enjoys the support of all of the stakeholders, including the Veterinary Council and the Irish Veterinary Nursing Association and is, of its nature, expressed in quite technical terms.  However, its objective can be summed up in the following three headings, the first of which is to clarify what nurses may do by way of minor surgery.  There was general recognition among stakeholders that the existing definition in section 91(3) of the Act could be open to misunderstanding.  The revised definition, which is intended to clarify rather than expand or restrict the range of specific functions that nurses may undertake by way of minor surgery, has been arrived at following detailed consultations with all concerned, including the Veterinary Council and the UCD veterinary faculty.</P>
        <P>Second, the amendment is designed to afford nurses greater latitude in terms of administering particular forms of medication.  At present they can only be administered by a nurse in the presence of a vet.  Given the greater degree of confidence that now exists between the two professions and the improved training that I mentioned, I propose that nurses would be enabled to administer the treatments when the overseeing vet is not physically present.  This should facilitate a more effective management of clinical situations in future.  The third objective is to clarify the terminology in the Act relating to functions that nurses may perform in the context of sedating and anaesthetising animals in preparation for surgery and post-operative.</P>
        <P>As I have stated, the proposed amendment reflects careful consideration and wide consultation.  It is consistent with the overall thrust of the Bill that practices be permitted to be conducted at the appropriate level of competence.  It is also intended to facilitate the further development of the veterinary nursing profession working in collaboration with veterinary practitioner colleagues.</P>
        <P>I also propose in section 6 to facilitate a greater range of recognition options for veterinary nurses.  Taken in their totality, I hope Senators agree that they are in the interest, not just in the development of the veterinary nursing profession, but also for bringing services to animal owners on a cost-effective basis and with the appropriate degree of quality assurance.  In some ways I regret that this change has come so late in the process but I cannot ignore representations from the Veterinary Council, supported by all of the other stakeholders, in an effort to improve the Bill.  This is why I have introduced my amendment at this late stage.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Nach iontach an rud &eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; mar r&uacute;n againn inniu labhairt faoi Sheachtain na Gaeilge?  I am suitably mortified after Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s remarks that I must speak in English.  It is not that I do not understand Irish, or that I did not spend a dozen years learning Irish, with four or five three week stints in the Connemara Gaeltacht but, somehow, when I learned European languages, the Irish fell to the side.  I spent a lot of time in Italy and now when I speak Irish, it comes out as a mix of Irish, English and Italian.  This is a source of personal embarrassment, that I have only retained a c&uacute;pla focal and there is no point in denying it.  I am like many people across the country who have practically stopped speaking Irish after secondary school.  The nub of the challenge facing the Irish language is contained in this; once it is not compulsory, the vast majority people stop learning it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">How do we change this and how do we turn the tables and make the speaking and learning of Irish a lifelong pursuit that will be followed by the masses?  These are big questions and within them lie clues to the future of the language.  Incentivising the language, using a carrot as opposed to a stick, is a way to achieve more desirable results.  The numbers who take the leaving certificate entirely through Irish are a testament to this.  The fact that a few extra points are to be gained from doing the leaving certificate through Irish seems to have incentivised them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was encouraged to see the launch last year of Na Gaeil &Oacute;ga, Dublin&rsquo;s first Irish speaking GAA club.  The popularity of this club is immense and has resulted in it putting together multiple teams.  The future lies in initiatives such as this.  Another interesting trend was that many people on Facebook are using the Irish forms of their names to mark Seachtain na Gaeilge.  Small things like that point in the direction of a bigger idea, the social and collaborative where people come together to keep the language flourishing, rather than cramming and studying to get it over with, as I did and I hear is what happens with school children.  That is how the language will survive and thrive.  If we can propose change, embrace it and maintain the funding structures, while moving towards bringing the languages to the masses in such a way as to appeal to their every day lives, and changing the syllabus to make it more conversational while applying real thought to initiatives such as Na Gaeil &Oacute;ga and Government and language enthusiasts working together to embrace changes and challenges to make the language thrive again, we will succeed.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">As it is Seachtain na Gaeilge, I congratulate all those involved in organising it.  Once again it has succeeded in focusing our minds on the language.  Comhghairdeas &oacute; chro&iacute; le gach duine a chuidigh chun Seachtain na Gaeilge a chur ar si&uacute;l.  Bh&iacute; an-rath ar&iacute;s uirthi i mbliana agus le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, faoi Sheachtain na Gaeilge na bliana seo chugainn, beidh m&eacute; in ann m&rsquo;&oacute;r&aacute;id ar fad a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</P>

	<P>Like Senator Noone, most of the Irish I have retained is in poetry form.  Perhaps that is the way forward for the teaching of Irish.  I have reflected on that over the years, when I met people from Germany who learned English by listening to the Beatles.  The Irish I remember is usually from poetry, which is very melodic.  Being from east Donegal, which is not a hotbed of the Irish language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Unfortunately I was born in east Donegal and did not have the benefit of growing up in a Gaeltacht.  My wife, however, is a fluent speaker and has passed it on to my kids, who are good speakers of Irish.  When she wants to make a point to me in strong terms, it comes out as Gaeilge.  Perhaps I would be better off not translating that.  I concur, however, with the sentiments expressed today on the importance of the Irish language.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a business in Letterkenny and many years ago I proposed at the town council that all businesses should have their signs as Gaeilge.  My business sign has been as Gaeilge for many years.  Businesses did not follow that, however; therefore, perhaps the Minister of State would encourage that through funding or a scheme in partnership with local authorities in order that people could convert their shop fronts into Irish.</P>
        <P>I got the idea from going to Wales on holiday.  Travelling through the small villages, I noticed most, if not all, of the signs were in Welsh and it gave character to the towns because our towns are becoming like high streets that could be anywhere in England.  We must change that and one thing we have is the language.  Tesco in Letterkenny should be asked to have signage in Irish.  I understand small retailers who do not want to change in the current economic climate but the Minister of State should consider those who want to change, particularly in Donegal, and should offer a financial inducement to do so.  I did it readily but there are only two or three shops in Letterkenny that have a sign as Gaeilge while other small towns in the west would have shop signs in Gaeilge.  I know signs can be controversial, with signs in Irish that should also be in English, but they should definitely be in Irish.  If people come to Donegal they will know how to get to places but for locals it is important signs are changed into Irish.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State outlined the 20 year strategy and Seachtain na Gaeilge and these all feed into the Irish experience.  Younger people are more attached to Irish than they were when I was growing up.  The teaching methods did not encourage people to continue after leaving school.  I met a young Indian man last week in my office and when I asked what languages he speaks, he replied that he speaks English, Hindu, Telugu, Tamil and another language and when I asked if they were all similar, he told me they are all completely different, as different as German, French and Russian.  I asked him how he did this and he replied it was expected of people.  In the long-term we must look at the best way to learn Irish.  At times I am embarrassed that I do not have the command shown by the Minister of State or Senator &Oacute; D&oacute;mhnaill, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, who all speak very melodically.  I regret not having that ability.  There is Irish in my house, I am half way there, but I would love to have the same command of the language as the Senators.  There are many people who are encouraged by the investment the Government has made in the language.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet today as Gaeilge and I would like to contribute to that and one day to address the Minister of State as Gaeilge in the best Donegal Irish.  Anyone I speak to tells me that Donegal has the most melodic Irish and we have already been identified as having the sexiest accent in Ireland.  Someone with a sexy Donegal Irish accent would have no problem in Copper Face Jack&rsquo;s.</P>

        <P>I commend the gaelscoileanna that have worked very hard in recent years.  Many of them came together on a voluntary basis on the basis of a belief in the value of our culture and our heritage and a desire to ensure children could take all school subjects through the medium of Irish.  I pay particular tribute to those involved in Gaelscoil Chnoc Na R&eacute; in Sligo, who have worked very hard for 16 years.  The number of pupils in the school has increased from 22 to 181 as a result of the enormous effort and commitment of parents and local people in the community.  I will raise with the Minister for Education and Skills their concern about the fact that the school seems to have escaped the new school building announcements even though pupil numbers have increased as I have described and the space available to the school in its buildings is limited.  That is for another day.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about Gaelscoil Chnoc Na R&eacute; in Sligo.  The number of children attending the school has increased from 22 to 181 in 16 years.  The capacity available to the school in its buildings is limited.  At a time when it is recognised that new buildings need to be provided to schools that are expanding, it seems strange that this school, which is still growing, is not being catered for.  I would like to give credit to the gaelscoileanna across the country that did a great deal of good work for the language and brought an additional energy to the teaching of it at a time when Irish was continuing to recede.</P>
        <P>I suggest, on the basis of my own experience of teaching, that we need to find a way of reintroducing pleasure and fun to the teaching of the Irish language.  There often seems to be an element of the chore in our engagements with the language.  As we know, children love to enjoy the fun aspects of things.  When teachers try to encourage children to learn German, Spanish, Italian or French, they focus on fun things like food and the culture of the countries in which those languages are spoken.  I believe that in the classroom, we divorce the Irish language from fun aspects of Irish culture to a great extent, particularly when children are young.  Perhaps that is because it is our own culture.</P>
        <P>This country could be reaching a tipping point at which we will appreciate that if we reach out to the authenticity of our language and our culture, it will be there.  We might have to go all the way back to re-evaluate how important our language is to us.  It is part of everything we are.  In a world of large corporations where much authenticity has been lost &mdash; we have become a global society &mdash; the authenticity of who we are and what we have is bound up in our language.  If we can find a way of understanding that authenticity in the 21st century, I think we will find a way of supporting the language.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane spoke about the need to use the language whenever we can, even if it is only a few words here and there.  While that is true, we somehow need to push it a bit further.  Other countries envy us for the authenticity of our language.  We seem to have forgotten that it is an enormously valuable thing.  I do not know how we arrive at that.  I certainly feel that the word &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; is relevant at a time when we are talking about going back to the things that made us who we are, in the food industry and other sectors.  We have walked away from some of those things over the last 50 years.  We need to revisit some of them, in a modern context, without going back 50 years.  In such circumstances, the Irish language would be able to flourish in a new way in the 21st century.

	<P>In 19 November 2009 there was a one in 100 year flooding in many areas in the south, particularly Skibbereen.  On three occasions during that very wet winter Skibbereen was flooded.  On another occasion, thanks to the excellent work of the council and Civil Defence, flooding was averted.  There has been talk of remediating the situation in Skibbereen.   I served my time there in the 1970s with the former Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe.  In those days there was a flood perhaps every five or ten years and there was talk of flood prevention, dredging the river and clearing the waterways around the town.  To date, not a lot has happened.</P>
        <P>The Minister in the last Government made commitments that a report would be commissioned on how to deal with the problem in Skibbereen.  I accept we have had a benign winter and I do not want to over-exaggerate the situation.  However, once a year I like to raise the flag for Skibbereen in case problems arise in future.  It was not only commercial properties which were flooded which impacted on re-insuring premises.  I have stated before that there should be some kind of universal insurance for properties.  In addition, several private homes were flooded, including the very nice houses of elderly people living conveniently in the side streets of Skibbereen.</P>
        <P>I want to know what the current position is on the flood warning scheme.  For example, has the report that was commissioned been published and what is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing funding for flood relief measures?  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, visited Skibbereen some time ago and is fully aware of the problem.  I tabled this matter to receive a full appraisal of the current position in Skibbereen, given that funding has been committed for schemes in Bandon, Fermoy and elsewhere.  The problem in Skibbereen needs to be addressed.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s response with interest.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Brian Hayes, who is unable to be here and has asked me to take this Adjournment debate on his behalf.  As the Senator said, the Minister of State has visited Skibbereen and spoken to many of those affected by the flooding there in the recent past.  He is very much aware of the hardship they have endured and the loss suffered.  Their concern is that steps be taken urgently to prevent a recurrence.  The Minister of State he is committed to ensuring their concerns are addressed.</P>
        <P>Following the flooding events that occurred in the town in 2009, Cork County Council sought funding from the OPW under the grants scheme for minor flood mitigation works and studies to undertake a feasibility study to identify measures which could be taken to reduce the risk of flooding in the town.  This application for funding was approved by the OPW and consultants were appointed by Cork County Council in February 2011 following a public procurement process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The study, the River Ilen (Skibbereen) Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study, has been progressing since.  There have been two public information days, the first being an information gathering day which was held in Skibbereen on 23 March  2011.  This afforded the public an opportunity to provide information on their views as to causes of, and possible solutions to, the flooding problems in the town.  The event was well attended by the public, with over 170 people attending.</P>
        <P>The study has progressed since and a number of reports have been produced by the consultants.  These include reports on hydrology, hydraulics, environmental issues, including appropriate assessment screening, flood mapping and an option assessment report.  Arising from the work done in preparation of these reports, an emerging preferred option has been identified.  This was exhibited in a second public information day on 25 January, an event which was also very well attended.  It is understood the public was very supportive of the emerging option.</P>
        <P>The emerging preferred option consists mainly of flood defences such as earth embankments and defence walls, with some localised widening of the river channel in the Marsh area and some localised improvements to the river channel in the vicinity of John F. Kennedy Bridge.  It is hoped this emerging preferred option will be brought through the statutory planning or exhibition process towards the end of the year.  Subject to a successful outcome to the planning and exhibition process, the detailed design will be carried out, followed by a procurement process for a civil works contractor.  It is hoped construction works might start in the latter part of 2013.</P>
        <P>As regards a flood early warning system, Cork County Council applied for funding in 2010 and 2011 to develop such a system for Skibbereen under the minor flood mitigation works scheme.  It was the OPW&rsquo;s view that the proposal could be technically difficult to implement and was premature pending the completion of the flood risk assessment and management study, for which it had allocated funding totalling &euro;239,000.  In view of the progress made to date on the emerging preferred option for flood alleviation in the town, it is the view of the OPW that the development of an early flood warning system would not be justified.</P>
        <P>Already, in response to calls by the Skibbereen Flood Committee to provide interim flood relief in the town, the OPW allocated an amount of &euro;10,000 to Cork County Council to undertake channel cleaning works in a section of the Ilen river.  These works were completed in November 2011.  A further application for channel cleaning works has been submitted by the council within the past week.  A decision will be made on this application very shortly in the context of the criteria for the minor works scheme, the available resources and progress on the flood mitigation study, to which I referred.  The OPW will continue to work in partnership with the county council to bring forward viable short-term and longer term measures to alleviate the risk of future flooding in Skibbereen as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, for coming to the Seanad to deal with this issue and know he will pass on my comments to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  </P>
        <P>It is common knowledge that the firearms licensing system is problematic.  The number of challenges in both the High Court and the District Court, in which over 95% of decisions have gone against the Garda, bears testament to this.  I am particularly concerned about the remarks of Judge Hedigan on these cases which have highlighted the fact that the system cannot continue and needs to be reviewed.</P>
        <P>The National Association of Regional Game Councils, or the NARGC as it is commonly known, which supported these cases was the strongest advocate of the new firearms legislation when it was introduced in 2009 and played a pivotal role in the consultation process, including chairing the most important user group, the Firearms Consultative Panel.  It warned of deficiencies in the administration of the system, including the absence of a statutory declaration under the wildlife Acts on the licence application form to give effect to the hunting licence endorsement on the firearms licence, but its warnings were ignored.  This resulted in an unnecessary High Court challenge which had the effect of forcing the State to amend the wildlife Acts on a temporary basis to get over a legal lacuna and the costs were paid for by the taxpayer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Licences will be renewed again in the coming months and we will be faced with this problem yet again because, thus far, no permanent solution has been suggested.  In recent days the Garda Commissioner has issued an amended licence application form, but it still does not address the issue of the absence of a statutory declaration.  As a result, the NARGC feels unable to continue its support for the system and the recent court cases are the consequence.</P>
        <P>The NARGC is a largely rural-based organisation which has a long track record of responsible ownership of sporting firearms and setting high standards and organising educational programmes.  In fact, it was one of the first organised sports shooters&rsquo; organisations in the State, providing structured education in the shooting disciplines since its foundation in 1968.  One only has to visit its website to see this.  As a rural Senator and farmer, I am very aware of how important game and shooting clubs and game hunting are to rural people and of how important the NARGC is in parishes as the national representative association.  I am also aware that it is vital for the Garda to enjoy the confidence and support of rural communities and that anything which threatens this must be avoided.  It is, therefore, lamentable that the NARGC which has always supported the rule of law should find it necessary to sue the Garda to have its concerns listened to and dealt with.  In the vast majority of cases the courts have agreed with the NARGC.  Why is this the case?  Clearly, it is a knowledgeable and responsible association; why, therefore, is the State not listening to it?  It obviously has a huge contribution to make and must be part of the solution.  The courts seem to believe it is certainly not the problem.</P>
        <P>The State would do well to pay attention to what the NARGC has to say when a problem arises, rather than trying to defend cases which are indefensible, with serious cost implications for the taxpayer, as we have witnessed in the aforementioned cases.  Do we have so much money to waste?  Any reading of the court transcripts of the Garda evidence and Judge Hedigan&rsquo;s interventions in the High Court confirms beyond argument that garda&iacute; were guilty of wrongdoing.  Statements to the Oireachtas that cases were settled without admission of wrongdoing serve only to mislead and alienate the very people who were victims of the wrongdoing.</P>
        <P>I have met the leaders of the NARGC and I am satisfied that their only wish is to have a firearms licensing system in place which is secure, fair, transparent and free of prejudice and which is administered in a consistent manner, with due regard for the provisions of the legislation as enacted by the Oireachtas.  The State maintains it always wishes to work with stakeholders.  It cannot be only when stakeholders are in agreement with the State on all matters.  I will conclude by urging the Minister to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to engage with the National Association of Regional Game Councils, NARGC, as a matter of urgency to bring to a conclusion what is an unsatisfactory state of affairs on many fronts.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Neill, for allowing me to participate in this debate because he and I are nominees of the National Association of Regional Game Councils in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and therefore have an ongoing interest in this particular issue.  I endorse everything Senator O&rsquo;Neill said and my only additional contribution is to note this ongoing and unresolved problem has existed for a number of years.  As Senator O&rsquo;Neill noted, the previous Administration introduced what in my opinion and that of the NARGC was a stopgap measure in respect of the existing licences to address a lacuna in the law.  I believe this will run out in 2013 or 2014.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Therefore, the Government must address this issue.  This obligation has been further enhanced, as Senator O&rsquo;Neill has noted, by the recent court case which was indefensible and the judge&rsquo;s judgment was clear in this regard.  However, the simple message that has been put forward by Senator O&rsquo;Neill and the council is to engage in consultation with those who are engaged in this process and who have expertise in this regard.  They have no agenda other than to ensure the law is straightened out and they can continue to operate within the law, as they have always done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank both Senators for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who regrets he is unable to be present due to other business.</P>
        <P>It is understood that the Senators are referring to a recent High Court case involving judicial reviews of decisions by chief superintendents in firearms cases.  What was at issue were decisions by chief superintendents to refuse applications for licences for high-calibre handguns.  That case was settled with no admission of wrongdoing on the part of the State and with an undertaking to consider applications afresh and give reasons to applicants where applications are turned down.</P>
        <P>It is important to state the vast majority of licensed firearms holders have encountered no problems with the new licensing regime.  The number of cases involved in this regard is 168, which constitutes a tiny minority of firearms licence applications.  In general terms, Members may recall that for more than 30 years prior to 2004, all handguns effectively were banned in this jurisdiction.  Following a series of judicial decisions, however, almost 2,000 handguns were licensed between 2004 and 2008.  This situation did not come to pass as a result of a decision by the Oireachtas.  The return of handguns also gave rise to new forms of target shooting, which is a cause of concern to the Garda Commissioner.  It is worth noting that the use of handguns is illegal for hunting under the Wildlife Acts and as they are not licensed for personal protection in the State, there is a very limited potential use for them.</P>
        <P>The Minister is particularly conscious of Mr. Justice Hedigan&rsquo;s remarks that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The licensing of powerful rifles and handguns is a matter of the gravest [concern].  The Oireachtas has legislated for the licensing of such...dangerous weaponry on a restricted basis.  The Commissioner and, through designation by him, chief superintendents, have been charged with a heavy responsibility of decision as to who should be given such restricted arms licences.  It is a grave responsibility because the consequences of a mistake may bedevastating.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The judge went on to state:</P>
        <P LI="2">These courts, let it be quite clear, like the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, know better than anyone else in this country the tragic and devastating consequences of gun crime.  The strictest regulation of dangerous weaponry is essential if society is to be spared the menace of proliferating gun crime.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister, Deputy Shatter, shares the judge&rsquo;s views on this matter.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 made the Commissioner responsible for licensing restricted firearms while the licensing of non-restricted firearms is a matter for superintendents.  The Commissioner, by delegating his functions for licensing restricted firearms to chief superintendents, shows the importance he places on regulating this dangerous weaponry.  At present, a chief superintendent is charged with making a decision on a restricted firearms certificate and he or she cannot be subject to directions in respect of how this discretion is exercised.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the people best placed to make decisions on firearms licensing and it would be helpful if the NARGC came to terms with that reality.  It must be stated frankly that recent intemperate material produced by that association undermines any requests which it makes for a spirit of co-operation in this area.  In light of such issues, which arose in the proceedings referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Neill, the Minister sought a report from the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister has received an interim report on the matter and awaits a full report from the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner has indicated he shares the concern expressed by the judge in the case about the alteration of documents after proceedings had commenced.  In the case of the evidence given by another member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Commissioner has indicated that, while an issue did arise regarding the completion of parts of the application forms, he is satisfied the applications were decided in accordance with that person&rsquo;s understanding of the relevant firearms legislation, decisions were recorded in notifications to applicants, and those decisions were informed by understandable concerns of public safety in light of the difficult position concerning crime in his division.  The Commissioner points out that the parts of the forms in question are not a statutory requirement under the firearms legislation and are geared towards the requirements of recording data on the PULSE system through the ticking of a number of boxes.  The Commissioner is addressing as a matter of urgency the whole process of firearms licensing and the administrative functions associated with it in light of the outcome of those court proceedings and will report to the Minister again when he has completed that review.</P>
        <P>Tragically, Members will have been reminded in recent weeks of the dangers which licensed firearms can pose for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others and of the dangers of firearms generally.  For his part, the Minister is determined to ensure that in the operation of the firearms licensing system, the question of public safety is paramount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I accept the Minister&rsquo;s comments.  As for the 168 cases that were brought before the High Court and Mr. Justice Hedigan, one should note these were not new applications but pertained to people who had held handguns and who were renewing their licences.  The fact they were forced to bring these cases means the licensing system does not appear to be working.  As I noted, 95% of these cases have been upheld by the courts.  While I do not suggest the Garda is always wrong, the point the NARGC and I are making is the licensing system must be examined.  Some 120 people in the country make the decisions in this regard.  In other words, in each Garda district, the Commissioner, assistant commissioners and superintendents make such decisions, whereas I propose that consideration be given to a centralised licensing system.  I note such a system is in operation in Northern Ireland and while all Members are aware of the problems experienced there with regard to guns, they were not caused by licensed guns and one should be worried about unlicensed guns instead.</P>

T&aacute; m&eacute; thar a bheith bu&iacute;och d&oacute; f&eacute;in faoi theacht isteach don &aacute;bhar seo, mar is &aacute;bhar &eacute; a bhaineann go d&iacute;reach leis f&eacute;in.

While I am not psychic, I had raised the issue of Clifden community school without knowing there would be an announcement yesterday on capital allocations.  However, it is pertinent that the Minister is present and I am grateful he has come to the House to answer the question I have raised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school in Clifden serves a huge catchment area.  The Minister is familiar with it as he last visited it when the leaving certificate results were being announced.  He met some of the students and staff, saw the school at first-hand and knows it well from his knowledge of the area.  The foundation stone for the existing school building was laid in 1974 and it was opened in 1979.  However, the building&rsquo;s original specifications were never actually completed and studies carried out in 2000 and 2003 both came to the conclusion that a new school building was essential.  The current building does not meet the standards expected of a school located in an area such as that to which I refer, particularly in light of the size of the student body and the quality of teaching required.  A new building was sanctioned and a fair amount of work has been done in the context of the planning process.  I commend the CSI Clifden group and the current principal, Dr. Liam Bolger, who have been driving the project and whom I met just prior to Christmas.  They were of the view that they were doing very well and that the project would be included in the capital plans.  They have done a great deal of fund-raising and the new school will cater for 425 students.  I understand that stage 2(b) of the process is nearing completion.</P>
        <P>The school caters for children from Roundstone to Lettergesh to Recess to Maam, which is a huge catchment area.  It is the only school of its type there, particularly since Kylemore Abbey closed down.  The school is an essential and vital part of the educational infrastructure in the area.  The hearts of those involved in the project relating to the school dropped yesterday when they read the list of allocations under the Department&rsquo;s capital grants programme.  Not only is the project not listed to proceed this year or next, there does not appear to be any suggestion that the new building might be constructed during the next five years.  I would welcome clarification from the Minister regarding the current status of the application for a new school building for Clifden community school.  A new building is badly needed and I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter because it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects during the next five years and to clarify the current position in respect of the application for major capital funding from Clifden community school, County Galway.</P>
        <P>The Senator may find it helpful if I set out the context within which decisions relating to meeting the accommodation needs of schools must be considered in the coming years.  Total enrolment is expected to grow by approximately 70,000 students &mdash; 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at second level &mdash; between now and 2018.  Second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department&rsquo;s budget for the coming years.  The five-year programme I announced on Monday will provide over 100,000 permanent school places, of which over 80,000 will be new places.  The remainder will come about through replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation.</P>
        <P>The design of the proposed new school building for Clifden community school has been developed, based on a long-term projected enrolment of 425 pupils.  The current enrolment is just over 400.  The schools design team is working on finalising the stage 2(b) submission &mdash; detailed design and tender documents &mdash; which will then be forwarded to the Department for review.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally, as well as the demands in Galway, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The five-year programme is focused on meeting those demographic needs.  In that context, it was not possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.</P>
        <P>All school building projects, including that relating to Clifden community school, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible at this time to give an indicative timeframe for the progression to tender and construction of the project at Clifden community school.  I again thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline the position.</P>

	<P>Go raibh maith agat, a Aire.  On behalf of the people of Clifden, I wish to state that I am very disappointed with the reply.  Was the rural scenario to which I refer taken into consideration in respect of this matter?  I accept that the Department is obliged to use some kind of slat tomhais, or yardstick, when making decisions.  Basing allocations on demographic growth alone is extremely unfair to rural areas, particularly in light of the fact that Clifden community school and others like it are very important in retaining the people who live in such areas and thereby ensuring that the demographics are not skewed even further.  If new school buildings such as that required in Clifden are not built, more and more people are going to leave rural areas.  Is there any mechanism which could be used to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision in this regard?  Would the Minister consider such an appeal if a good argument could be put forward?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Senator stated, I am familiar with the area and I visited the school last August.  I take the point he is making in respect of the central role Clifden community school plays in holding the region together.  As the reply I read which was prepared by the building unit in my Department indicates, the process relating to the school is ongoing and the project will move to a point where it will be ready to proceed to construction.  As a result of my personal interest in the area, I will monitor developments with the project.  I will be obliged to obtain further advice in respect of this matter but I suspect that Clifden is one of the more unusual schools in that, as I was informed last August, it serves one of the largest catchment areas in the country.  I will keep in touch with the Senator in respect of this matter.</P>

I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s personal interest in Clifden community school but I wish to express my strong disappointment.  There was huge anticipation that the project relating to this school would be among those granted allocations yesterday.  I wish to make a general point to which the Minister must give consideration.  A mechanism other than that which relates to demographics must be found in the context of assessing the value of rural schools.  The current mechanism is extremely narrow in scope, particularly as it is based solely on numbers.

I request that he reclassify Down&rsquo;s syndrome as a low-incidence disability in order that children who have the condition might obtain teaching and learning resources appropriate to their needs.  The case to which I wish to refer is extremely touching and I am grateful to the family involved for allowing me to highlight it.</P>
        <P>On Tuesday, 18 October 2011, during a debate on special needs education, Mr. JimMulkerrins, principal officer, of the special education section, informed the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.  It was stated at the meeting to which I refer that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The issue of whether Down&rsquo;s syndrome should be classified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, has been raised with the Department subsequent to the introduction of the general allocation model, GAM.  The issue of whether there is an equitable basis for re-classifying Down&rsquo;s syndrome as a low incidence disability is therefore a matter which is under review by my Department in the context of its review of the general allocation model.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is in the context of this extremely useful statement and having met parents in Galway whose children have Down&rsquo;s syndrome, that I wish to strongly advocate that the syndrome should be reclassified as a low-incidence disability in order that the children who have it might access dedicated individual teaching hours as part of their overall education.  This would allow us to meet the requirements of the Education Act in the context of the delivery of an appropriate education that is dependent on individual children&rsquo;s needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister is aware, the allocation of resources in primary schools is based on low and high-incidence categories.  Children with a moderate learning disability are entitled to resource teaching hours, rightly so.  However, children with a mild learning disability are not so entitled.  This is a matter of great concern for parents and teachers and it impacts greatly on the manner of the educational inclusion experienced by such children in mainstream schools.  One-to-one time is hugely beneficial to all children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, particularly when they enter the mainstream, because it assists in their being fully integrated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have experience with this matter, not just in Ireland but also in the United States.  Children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome generally present with both language and physical difficulties.  On occasion, they need to be lifted in order to keep pace with other mainstream children.  In that context, they require more assistance than that which can be delivered by a school operating a general allocation model resource programme.  The fact that children in both categories &mdash; moderate and mild &mdash; have Down&rsquo;s syndrome should copper-fasten the right to resources.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the experience of the parents of one girl in order to illustrate the difficulties children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome are encountering and why the reclassification to which I refer is essential.  The little girl, Maeve, is the youngest of four girls.  She will be five in August and is a bright, endearing child who is very motivated and independently minded.  Her parents, rightly, have never set limits on her ability just because she has Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  She is making great progress and they are delighted with the results of the various inputs to see her developing so well.  She is due to start primary school in September 2012 and her parents have decided on a mainstream school.  Unfortunately, it is not their local school but one based in Galway city, as that school had significant knowledge of special needs, experience of teaching children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome and access to various programmes and good facilities.  They felt Maeve would thrive in the school.They were delighted to hear that a place was available and they filled in the application form and provided the psychologist's report.  A few days later, they received a telephone call from the principal, who was happy to accept the child.  He felt that he needed to inform them that because of a diagnosis of a mild intellectual disability, Maeve would not be entitled to receive additional supports over and above what was already provided for the school.  The school has children with needs and is stretched in the provision of learning support, even down to minutes for certain children.  The principal stressed that the recommendations made by the psychologist for Maeve, such as differentiating the curriculum, providing visual supports, implementing various programmes, planning meetings and individual education plans may not be feasible for the school to implement.  That endangers the provision of an appropriate education for her under the Education Act 1988.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Maeve is a wonderful little girl but she comes with a label of Down&rsquo;s syndrome, has a learning disability, complex needs and is unable to string a sentence together.  She now has, in the view of her parents, the &ldquo;bad luck&rdquo; of being given a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability, which means she will not have allocated learning resources and is therefore regarded as competing for the same teaching resources as any other child on the normal spectrum who may have a reading disability, for example.  Her mother has indicated that she struggles "to understand why this little girl, who has a life limiting condition and is termed as permanently incapacitated by the HSE and the Department of Social Protection is in the same category as those who may have short term difficulties with maths or reading."  Surely no debate is required to justify supporting Maeve by providing the dedicated teaching resources through reclassification from high to low incidence disability or by means of a distinct category for children with Down's syndrome.  Furthermore, she will not even be considered for an allocation of extra teaching time due to her significant speech delay because her intellectual disability precludes her from consideration.  I have always had difficulty with that.  Maeve's mother continues by saying:</P>
        
        <P LI="1">Nobody wants to feel that their child is a burden but this is the reality.  Schools are very willing to accommodate children with special needs but on a supported basis and rightly so.  Teachers are not magicians and principals need to consider the implications for all children. The current system portrays our children as a liability to those who accept them into their school.  The current structure of resource hour allocation is closing doors to children.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Will the Minister look at this case as the principal officer in the Department has flagged it as an issue?  This child will be at an obvious disadvantage but the effects will also be felt by the school, and its teachers will tear their hair out thinking about how to meet her needs under the Education Act.  I look forward to the reply.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have been given the opportunity by the Senator to clarify the position on the provision of teaching support for children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  I advise the Senator that the Department of Education and Skills has put in place a range of teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs, including pupils with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  Pupils with Down&rsquo;s syndrome are entitled to additional teaching support in schools either under the terms of the general allocation model, GAM, of teaching supports if the child&rsquo;s educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the high or more frequently occurring incidence disability category, such as mild and borderline mild intellectual disability, or through an allocation of additional teaching and care support if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by the Department&rsquo;s Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</P>
        <P>As such, resource teaching support is allocated to schools to support the learning needs of pupils with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, in line with the pupil&rsquo;s assessed needs.  Down&rsquo;s syndrome has therefore not been designated as either a high or low incidence disability for the purposes of allocating resource teaching support.  Children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome may qualify for teaching support under high or low incidence provision, based on the extent of their general learning disability level.  Children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome whose level of intellectual disability places them in the high incidence of general learning disability may receive individual resource teaching hours in the same manner as children with other high incidence disabilities through the GAM.  Schools have provision under the GAM to allocate and target resources to those children most in need of these resources and also to make the best use of these resources.  Schools also have discretion to supplement teaching support under the GAM though shared and group teaching for pupils with greatest need.</P>
        <P>Additional resource hours are allocated to schools by the National Council for Special Education in respect of pupils with a diagnosed low incidence disability, in line with the diagnosed disability level.  This includes pupils with a diagnosis of an assessed syndrome, including Down&rsquo;s syndrome, in conjunction with a low incidence disability such as moderate general learning disability, for example.  The disability categories set out in the report of the special education review committee of 1993 form the basis for resource allocations and include a category relating to assessed syndromes.  Accordingly, Down&rsquo;s syndrome is considered for the purpose of allocation of additional resources in line with the general provision for pupils with an assessed syndrome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I can advise the Senator, however, that the issue of whether Down&rsquo;s syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, has been raised with the Department in the context of the Department&rsquo;s recent review of the general allocation model.  The Department has also received a submission from Down&rsquo;s syndrome Ireland regarding this matter, which is being considered.  The issue of whether there is an equitable basis for reclassifying Down&rsquo;s syndrome as a low incidence disability in all instances is under review by the Department.  The National Council for Special Education has also been asked to provide advice to the Department on the issue.</P>
        <P>The Department is readjusting the general allocation model for schools effective for the coming academic school year and also intends to complete its review of the issue of the categorisation of Down&rsquo;s syndrome this year.  The Senator will be aware that any review of policy in this area may only be considered in the context of the resources which are available to the Department, competing demands on teacher numbers and the Government&rsquo;s employment control framework.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good that a formal review is in place because the issue in this case is the mild learning disability in conjunction with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  While the review is being decided and we await conclusions, what advice would the Minister give the family and school?  This child has considerable resource needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the same level of detail as the Senator.  I understand the child has been accepted by the school but the school is not in a position to give an undertaking on the resources.  I suggest that the school should appeal to the Department, indicating that this young person &mdash; Maeve &mdash; has been accepted by the school and it is the most appropriate and preferred school choice of the parents.  It should indicate that in view of the school&rsquo;s understanding of her condition, extra resources are required.</P>
