	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh na dalta&iacute;, tuismuitheoir&iacute; agus m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; &oacute; Ghaelscoil Brian Bor&oacute;imhe i Sord Cholmcille.  I ask the Leader what progress, if any, he or the Deputy Leader made with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste on the upcoming trial in Bahrain of the 20 doctors who are being tried again in civilian court.  I was pleased yesterday that across the House, Members from all parties and Independents showed full support for the Bahrain doctors, one of whom was in the Visitors Gallery yesterday.  I remind the House that there are people already in a military court who have been charged and handed sentences of between five and 15 years for simply doing what doctors should do in looking after people who are in distress and injured.  Did the Leader contact the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste yesterday given that this matter needs to be raised at the highest level, namely, with the King of Bahrain or his Ministers?</P>
        <P>On 6 June I asked for the publication of the letter that the Taoiseach sent to Chancellor Angela Merkel, the President of the European Council Mr. Herman van Rompuy and the other EU Heads of Government in respect of the Government&rsquo;s negotiating position post the passing of the referendum on debt sustainability and how the debt burden will be dealt with here.  At that time the Taoiseach would not give the other House any details of his telephone conversation with Chancellor Merkel.  We do not know what the Taoiseach sought.  Did he seek a debt write down, extension of debt terms or a reduction in interest rates?  If we do not know that the people do not know it either.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator please relax for a minute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach made a couple of disparaging remarks in the other House in response to my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, about the bank guarantee.  He misled the House yesterday when he said there was no file, or a file may have been shredded, on the documentary evidence given to the Minister for Finance at the time in respect of the decision that had to be taken to bring forward the bank guarantee.  I served on the Committee of Public Accounts of the last D&aacute;il where we got extensive files on the advice given and on the choices the Government had to make at the time and the various options.  They were published by the Committee of Public Accounts of the previous D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>It beggars belief that the Taoiseach can come into the House and tell Members he cannot find the file, that there was no file or that it might have been shredded.  Worse than that, his officials are rowing back from the issue.  That is a matter the Taoiseach needs to clarify.  In fairness, the Leader cannot do that today.  However, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s officials gave a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> which the Taoiseach sent on 7 June calling not for a debt write down or debt restructuring but a &ldquo;constructive debate&rdquo; on the challenges of resolving the Irish and wider European banking problem.  That is nothing like what he told the Irish people about getting a better deal.  In no shape or form does he state what Ireland is seeking.  Two weeks ago I asked that the letter be published in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The letter should first go to the elected representatives of the people in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, not to <i>The Irish Times</i>.  All we have is a paraphrased letter.  To make matters worse, the letter is extremely vague on what Ireland is seeking.  It does not refer to debt forgiveness, debt write down or a reduction in interest rates but a Government spokesman said yesterday that there would have been &ldquo;some more specifics in Mr. Kenny&rsquo;s telephone call with Dr. Merkel.&rdquo;  The official apparently knows that but the people do not, because the Taoiseach will not tell us what he said to Chancellor Merkel nor will he tell us what she said to him.</P>
        <P>In the recent referendum, the people made a decision, one I agreed with, to back Europe and support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  At the very least the people deserve clarity on the Government&rsquo;s position.  Will the Leader make contact with the Taoiseach to seek a commitment that the letter he sent to Chancellor Merkel and Mr. Van Rompuy on 7 June will be published in full and given to every Member in order that it can be debated properly to ascertain the Government&rsquo;s real position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Senator asked for feedback on the Bahrain trial.  He will be aware I expressed the strong support of this side of the House, which was shared by everyone in the House, for the people of Bahrain and particularly for the doctors who are on trial and awaiting a verdict tomorrow.  All of us were very impressed by Dr. Nada Dhaif who spoke on the news last night about the trial and the oppression being endured by the Bahraini people and Bahraini medics.  I raised the matter directly with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s adviser yesterday.  The T&aacute;naiste is in Armenia.  I was informed yesterday evening that the matter was raised directly with the T&aacute;naiste.  Therefore, the concerns expressed on the floor of the House went directly to the T&aacute;naiste.  I am confident the issue will be raised at international level.  International pressure has been very important.  The only reason any civilian trial process was engaged in was because of international pressures.  The Senator is right to keep up the pressure, pending the verdicts tomorrow.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate not just on the Bahrain situation but on the situation in Syria.  Anybody who has seen footage in the past 24 hours of the UN peacekeepers being turned back and being unable to investigate the reports of further civilian massacre in Syria would be appalled.  It brings back dreadful and horrific memories of Srebrenica and the atrocities that took place there.  The United Nations will have to take further action on Syria.  The difficulty with Russia supplying the Syrian Government with arms has been highlighted in recent days.  We should have a debate on the matter.  I will certainly raise the issue directly with the T&aacute;naiste as I have raised the issue of Bahrain.</P>
        <P>On a positive note, given the day that is in it, I congratulate my fellow Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe for initiating the inaugural Yeats Day which takes place in Sligo today on the birthday of William Butler Yeats.  It is a dawn to dusk celebration which will feature music, poetry and theatre and will be launched by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan.  The Senator has asked me to acknowledge Senator David Norris in particular, who has given a great welcome for Yeats Day and has played such a pivotal role in the celebration of Bloomsday which takes place in Dublin on Saturday next.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the mayor of Sligo invited?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish Yeats Day in Sligo and Bloomsday in Dublin the best of luck.</P>
        <P>In the context of Bloomsday and Yeats Day I call for a debate on cultural tourism.  I am conscious that events such as Bloomsday, and we hope also Yeats Day, bring in large numbers of tourists and visitors to different places.</P>
        <P>On the Adjournment yesterday I raised with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe Costello, the issue of certificates of Irish heritage.  Some 682 have been purchased and 58 issued by way of presentations, including a certificate to President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton.  These are important assets that can be used in generating further tourism and interest among the Irish diaspora about visiting Ireland.  We could easily have a debate on this topic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the extraordinary happenings within the ESRI.  What has happened in respect of the report on the cost of working in Ireland is remarkable.  The truth should set us free.  Is the problem with the report its findings, its methodology, analysis and calculations or is there a political problem with the stark and dramatic conclusions that the report, whether it is a working paper, has reached?  It is unprecedented that the report should be withdrawn and there appears to be a controversy within the organisation.  It is appropriate that we have a debate on the matter given that this is an important body which receives State funding.</P>
        <P>Since the D&aacute;il is slow to say something it ought to say, perhaps we should say it in here.  Defrauding the State is wrong.  Fiddling one&rsquo;s taxes is wrong.  We should not lose time in making that clear within the House.  We should be slow to accept excuses about the dangers of impacting on due process.  There are things that can be said immediately about misstating one&rsquo;s tax liabilities and they should be said without delay.  A motion of censure should proceed without delay.  There is a certain ambivalence, at which I am surprised, in some parts of the media towards the individual in question.  This is shown in pointing to the apparent hypocrisy among the political establishment parties in pointing the finger at the Independent Deputy in this case, but I wonder whether there is hypocrisy in the media.  I do not recall, for example, an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> about former Senator Ivor Callely.  I had no sympathy for him, but I do not recall an editorial with language such as, &ldquo;He should still ask himself in all conscience whether he remains able to his personal satisfaction either to represent constituents effectively or contribute usefully to the causes that animate him&rdquo;.  There is something rather fawning about that language.</P>
        <P>What needs to happen is that a spade needs to be called a spade.  I have said previously that I am not a big fan of the culture which looks for heads or people to resign.  The people of Wexford can decide on what should happen to the Deputy at their next opportunity, but for somebody who defrauds the State by not paying his taxes, the way to demonstrate positive intent is to come forward with a schedule of repayments, by perhaps going on the average industrial wage and paying the difference to the State.  That would show a genuine desire to put things right.  In a way, in politics we should allow people to put things right and resume a respected place, but a person needs to do something before people can believe in him or her again.  That is what needs to happen in this regard.</P>
        <P>This draws our attention to the issue of ethics in business.  In that context, I am hopeful the Government will support my Private Members&rsquo; Bill &mdash; Business Undertakings (Disclosure Of Overpayments) Bill 2012.  Businesses often overpay and there ought to be a requirement on those who receive such overpayments to disclose them.  Revenue, the local authorities and the Department of Social Protection often make overpayments.  Therefore, there should be an interest in putting an obligation on those who receive overpayments to disclose them and facilitate their repayment, not only as a matter of good ethics and good business practice but also as a matter of law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the intended appointment of an independent planning consultant by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the 12 recommendations made in the review of the planning system in a number of local authorities.  Clearly, there was a lack of guidance on how rules should be enforced and the system administered.  The report highlighted serious issues, including instances of maladministration and inconsistency in the application of planning laws.  I look forward to the independent consultant assessing all of the actions taken and, I hope, proposing additional measures that he or she deems appropriate.  There are broader themes and perhaps there will be further recommendations.  I do not say because the report did not find evidence of corruption that I do not believe there is corruption, but there may have been in the past.  Provincial town centres have been decimated by out-of-town developments that should not have been allowed by managers.  Will the Leader in early course fit in a debate on planning in the light of the Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement yesterday and the recommendations made in the review?  I acknowledge we had a debate on the Mahon tribunal report, but we should have a debate that concentrates on the recommendations made in the report.  I ask the Leader to give consideration to this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Taoiseach come to the Seanad to explain the circumstances behind the allegation regarding the shredding of files in the Department of the Taoiseach and the leaking of a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> and the failure to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The matter dealt with by him in the D&aacute;il yesterday is of the most serious nature and elected representatives are entitled to find out if there was a Garda investigation, who is under suspicion in the Department and whether the Taoiseach is blaming civil servants, the former Taoiseach or a deceased former Minister for Finance?  We do not know.  I would like to know whether it has been brought to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention that a substantial file running to hundreds of pages is available on the website of the Committee of Public Accounts of the previous D&aacute;il.  It is not good enough for him to go into the D&aacute;il to make allegations that he made up on the spur of the moment.  If he were to come to the House, it would give him an opportunity to rebut the suggestion I have made because it seems to have been made on the spur of the moment thrown in a debate in which he was challenged rightly and seriously on behalf of the people on what exactly the Government was up to in negotiations with Angela Merkel.  It is of the utmost importance that he come into the House if he is not available to make an explanation in the D&aacute;il to outline what he is talking about in regard to this file.  We have a right to know.  Therefore, I propose the amendment I have described.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I concur with Senator Paul Coghlan in his comments on planning.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s proposal to appoint an independent consultant is a positive step.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again request the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to grant an extension of the deadline for the receipt of replies from local authority members in the local government reform questionnaire.  It was sent in a strange way to elected members through county managers.  At the close of business yesterday, the elected members of four local authorities still had not received it, despite the requirement to submit replies by next Friday.  During a debate with the Minister of State in the House last week I requested her to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  She assured me that she would and she did.  At the time Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill was present and he assured me that he would also bring it to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  When I checked earlier, the Minister had still not responded.  One of Senator David Cullinane&rsquo;s colleagues raised the issue with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il yesterday who said he would respond by way of consultation with the Minister.  The deadline has still not been extended.  We are simply asking that the Minister, in view of the fact that some elected members have not yet received the questionnaire, extend the deadline from 15 to 22 June.  Furthermore, the methodology used in circulating the questionnaire via county managers to the elected members of both county and town councils was an insult to them.  Every elected member has an e-mail address and the questionnaire should have been sent directly to them.  There is a need to provide for a one week extension of the deadline to ensure an appropriate number of responses can be garnered on this important subject.  Will the Leader bring this matter to the attention of the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy Leader for her kind remarks about Bloomsday.  I was pleased to send a message of congratulations to her colleague, Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe, about Yeats Day.  The President has graciously accepted our invitation to attend the opening of Bloomsday at 8 p.m. in the James Joyce Centre.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I wish to raise a serious issue that I have raised previously and which is covered by No. 23, motion No. 9, on the Order Paper.  The House should discuss the annual report of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman for 2011.  They had 77 cases in hand at the end of 2011.  While one third related to truth and accuracy, there was a threefold increase in the number of complaints about prejudice, but they are passive.  They are not proactive in defending citizens, which is a problem.  I do not believe in calling for people&rsquo;s heads, but we should seriously scrutinise this office.  It is a flimsy report in which I take a certain interest because, for some reason, I take up half a page in it.  Included in it is a photograph of my initial withdrawal from the presidential election campaign without an explanation.  The other picture was of either a fox hunt or a point-to-point meeting.  Perhaps there is a concealed message in this, but the House must take this issue seriously in the light of the fact that it has been demonstrated that similar offices, particularly the office of the Information Commissioner in the United Kingdom, have been used as a buffer to protect newspapers from recourse by members of the public.</P>
        <P>I am particularly concerned at the recent Leveson inquiry revelations that the former British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, decided to manage rather than confront the press because he knew it would relentlessly, consistently and remorselessly pursue not only him but also his family, even after his leaving office.  If the Prime Minister of Britain can be terrified of the press, we should all take note.  Yesterday we had the revelation that Rupert Murdoch had attempted directly to change policy during the premiership of Mr. John Major.  It has been clearly shown that members of the police force, the information system and certain politicians in that jurisdiction have been corrupted, that people&rsquo;s lives have been ruined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am calling for a debate on this report for the reasons I have just set out.  The entire political system has been corrupted and vitiated and politicians made terrified.  Against this background, I was astonished by the observation made by the Press Ombudsman of Ireland on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 29 May that the message from the Leveson inquiry to British newspaper editors was that the current system was &ldquo;not quite up to scratch.&rdquo;  That is a remarkable understatement on a situation where people are dead, telephones were hacked, and the political, police and information systems corrupted, yet the ombudsman who is charged with oversight of this area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can make these points during the debate on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is of the view that the system is merely &ldquo;not quite up to scratch.&rdquo;  We must have a full debate on all of these issues in order that the people can be protected in an increasingly vicious situation where, because of financial pressure on newspapers, young journalists, in particular, are being bullied.  Editors are the worst people in many of the lowest elements of the press because it is they who direct young reporters on what to do.</P>

	<P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the inaugural Yeats Day and look forward to attending the function this afternoon in Sligo.  It is a very good day for us.  </P>
        <P>As my party&rsquo;s spokesperson in this House on marine issues, I welcome the agreement reached early this morning on the Common Fisheries Policy.  I particularly welcome the move to end the requirement regarding discards, whereby fish are thrown overboard.  Given the conditions of poverty and famine in countries across the globe, it is important that this practice should cease and that there be no requirement on fishermen to throw produce back into the sea.  I also welcome moves to assist fishermen operating in a small way along the west coast.  These are positive developments for the fishing sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for undertaking to examine my request yesterday for a debate on the issue of poverty.  I hope it will happen in the coming weeks.  Like Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, I have concerns about the report of the Economic and Social Research Institute which was subject to some discussion in the House yesterday.  The inferences flowing from it were that the 440,000 people out of work in this country were somehow better off than those in employment.  I greeted much of what was stated in the report with circumspection and it now transpires that the ESRI cannot stand over it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The author of the report stands over it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The author might stand over it, but the ESRI has withdrawn it and stated it cannot stand over its findings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It begs the question as to whether pressure was applied to the organisation to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESRI is a Government-funded body, yet we are told that the report was subject neither to internal nor external peer review, the accepted norm for all such reports, and that although it was available on the ESRI website for three weeks, it did not adhere to the process of refereeing, to which this type of academic research was usually subjected.  The question arises as to whether the report is part of a broader agenda which involves certain public representatives, sections of the media, academics and others seeking continuously to undermine the social welfare system and promote the impression that people on social welfare are somehow better off than those who are working.  As I said, I was circumspect about much of what was set out in the report.  There certainly are issues about the plight of the working poor, with many low income families, because of strict means-testing thresholds, not qualifying for certain benefits.  However, there are questions to be asked about the ESRI following this report.  I ask the Leader to get back to me personally or report back to the House when he receives a response from the agency on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the strong criticism by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, of the delay by the seven university presidents in bringing forward new proposals on the points system for third level admissions.  The universities must get their act together on the matter without delay.  Last September the college heads &mdash; all vocal critics of the leaving certificate and rote learning &mdash; promised to bring forward proposals for reform without delay, but nothing has happened to date.  As King Lear said to his daughter Cordelia, &ldquo;Nothing will come of nothing.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne.</P>
        <P>In regard to No. 17 on the Order Paper, Registration of Wills Bill 2011, will the Leader ask the Minister to reconsider the Government&rsquo;s legislative intentions in this regard in the light of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced by Deputy Liam Twomey, a former Member of this House, in the D&aacute;il last week.  The Advance Healthcare Decisions Bill 2012 which provides for so-called living wills was accepted by the Government and will, in due course, be passed into law.  Ireland is one of only seven member states of the European Union without a system for the registration of wills.  Five of the seven have initiated a legislative process in this regard, with Malta considering such a proposal.  A convention on the establishment of schemes of registration was agreed to by the Council of Europe in 1972, but it was not signed by Ireland.  It is fine to bring forward legislation providing for living wills, but there is no reason to suppose that all or even most such wills will ever be enacted, given that they may not be found when needed in a situation where so many solicitor firms have gone out of business in the current recession.  The wills books held by such companies may be mislaid or lost and the wishes of those concerned will not be fulfilled.  I have raised this matter before and intend to bring it to the attention of the Taoiseach as soon as possible.  I am not interested in whether the Bill is in my name; my concern relates to the principle of having legislation enacted.  On the one hand, there is so much unnecessary legislation, while, on the other, so many legislative provisions are being ignored.  This is very important legislation, about which I have been contacted by several people who are concerned about it.  We cannot have a situation where people&rsquo;s wills are lost and their last wishes not fulfilled.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader consider this matter with his advisers and perhaps bring it to the attention of the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Will the Leader consider a debate on how inquests are conducted, particularly in cases of suicide?  We attended a presentation in the audio-visual room recently by a group campaigning for increased sensitivity in the Coroner&rsquo;s Court in the holding of inquests in cases of suicide.  Obviously, it is a very harrowing and difficult time for families.  We must ask ourselves whether such inquests should be open to the public or whether they should be confined to family members, close friends and witnesses who may have information; whether the holding of such inquests in public serves a useful purpose, and whether the media treat them with the sensitivity required.  Families go through enough trauma and difficulty without having the cases sensationalised in the media afterwards.  Whether the court setting is the best place to hold inquests or whether a hotel, community centre or hall might be a more suitable venue is an issue which needs to be discussed.  It is an issue on the minds of many.  Suicide causes great pain for many families.  The group campaigning for increased sensitivity in the holding of inquests deserves our support.  Perhaps it is an issue the House might discuss on a future occasion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was pleased when Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy raised the issue of the Minister for Education and Skill&rsquo;s annoyance with the university heads for their failure to respond.  The problem has to do with the Trade Descriptions Act and perhaps the cartel legislation.  The problem is that the Irish Universities Association does not represent anybody who lectures in Irish universities.  It is the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities with a new label.  They would not know anything about those who come from schools into first year lectures because it is so long since they have given a lecture.  The Minister has made a mistake in unwittingly giving them this status.  Their view that the leaving certificate was not a suitable qualification to attend university was not based on direct experience and their failure to respond is understandable because literally they do not know what they are talking about.  What I hear from examiners from outside Ireland &mdash; as recently as Thursday of last week &mdash; is that the standard of students is excellent by international standards and that the level of attention in lectures and the care received in a pastoral sense are way above the international average.  As Senator Ivana Bacik and I said a few weeks ago, the points system and the CAO were invented by Professor William Watts who came from a humble background in Athy, County Kildare.  He devised it because any other system would be based on influence and he did not want entry to higher education to be based on a system which would be open to such manipulation.  There are too many quangos in the higher education sector which speak regularly.  However, they do not represent the views of those of us who actually do the work, are proud to do it, proud of the young people who come to us from second level and very proud of how good their degrees are when they graduate.  The Minister, as a noted democrat, really needs a new communications strategy to consult the people who actually give lectures and would be able to reassure him on many of the points about which he is concerned.  In this instance, he is asking the wrong people.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns expressed by Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy about overpayments at the highest level.  This discredits the entire sector.  One should not seek to be a millionaire at any level of the education sector.  It is a service to the younger members of our society and we are proud to serve them on that basis.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join others in highlighting the fact that this is the inaugural Yeats Day.  As I am sure others have done, it is important to mention the commitment of Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe to this project and the committee which put it together.  We have seen another great example during the years in the case of Senator David Norris and Bloomsday.  Yeats Day, like other international events we host such as Rally Ireland, the Volvo Ocean Race, the Tall Ships and so on, has huge potential to create employment in the tourism industry.  The Volvo Ocean Race, Rally Ireland and other such events generate &euro;48 million in tourism revenue.  It is very important to realise that for every &euro;1 million spent on such events, incuding Yeats Day and Bloomsday, up to 13 jobs can be created.  At a time of scare resources, we should focus our efforts and try to increase to the maximum extent possible the small budget available to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, and those involved in the tourism industry.  Notwithstanding what is going on elsewhere in Europe and other areas which is perhaps outside our control, this is a sector we can grow to create employment.  For that reason, it is appropriate for all of us to celebrate the inaugural Yeats Day and the contribution it and other such events can make.  I say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe and all those involved.  I hope the Government can support it and other such events, including, as I mentioned, Rally Ireland, the Volvo Ocean Race and the Tall Ships.  We should box clever in trying to host these events on an annual basis to grow our share of the tourism industry in the European market.</P>

	<P>Yesterday a number of us referred to the ESRI report and expressed concern about its key finding that some people were better off on the dole than at work.  Within a number of hours we saw the report being pulled.  What concerns me is that the director of the institute has dissociated it from the findings made in the report and said it had not been peer reviewed and validated.  We need to ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and, in particular, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute;, to check this out.  How often has this happened, or has it happened before?  Does it involve an internal dispute between a researcher and the institute because many issues seem to be at odds?  We must remember that the ESRI has a very good reputation in and is of enormous value to the country.  We need to know that papers which have not been validated do not lead to findings which could scare people and change behaviour, in particular in the world of work.  At the very least, the House should receive a statement on what has gone on at this highly credible institute which should not fall into disrepute as a result of what perhaps is an internal issue.  We also need an assurance that this has not happened before and that something did not come to light because it might not have been the subject of a controversial report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Last week it was announced that protected geographical indiction status, PGI, was being allocated to Lough Neagh eels.  I say this with pride because my maternal grandfather was an eel fisherman on Lough Neagh.  The reason I mention this is that I have discovered that more than 50 foodstuffs in Britain, including the Cornish pasty, have obtained PGI status.  Only four have been allocated such status in Ireland.  Blaa in Waterford has applied for this status and I am sure the Leader is anxious it is allocated to it.  The evidence shows having such status is of huge benefit.  The French cheeses that have it are something like three times the price of cheeses that do not have it.  We can do a lot more about this.  Bord Bia is doing its best and doing everything it can but it needs publicity and evidence.  There are some restrictions.  The products that have designation at present are Timoleague brown pudding, Connemara hill lamb, Clare Island salmon and Imokilly Regato cheese.  We hope to add the Waterford blaa bread.  Publicity and a sense of urgency are required.</P>
        <P>It was stated during the week that the makers of Cashel Blue cheese are not going to apply for designation as theirs is a commercial operation.  The reason is that if Cashel Blue were to receive PGI designation, anybody in Cashel could produce a blue cheese and call it Cashel Blue cheese.   I understand some of the difficulties that arise but I am raising this today because I believe it is worthwhile addressing the matter.  Publicity is required and availing of the opportunity that presents itself would certainly help the dairy and food industries and the agriculture sector.  Let us ensure that the work Bord Bia is doing is encouraged and that we achieve far more than we have achieved to date.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Landy&rsquo;s call for an extension in respect of the questionnaire on local government reform that was circulated to city and county managers by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government some weeks ago.  I would like to try to answer the question as to why it was not sent directly to the councillors and why the Minister is not willing to extend the deadline of Friday next.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I have.  Perhaps the Leader could confirm that the reason the deadline is not being extended is that he has already made up his mind on local government reform and does not care what councillors have to contribute to the process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>On a number of occasions, I asked the Leader and Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the House to discuss with him the reform of local government.  He has failed to come in and it does not surprise me that Senator Landy must raise this subject again this morning.  The Government and the Department have already decided on local government reform and do not care what we or the practitioners on the ground, the councillors, have to say about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Feargal Quinn is a great advocate of organ donation.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the impending transposition into Irish law of organ donation legislation, without debate, by the health committee.  The matter is not to be discussed in the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  Organ donation transforms lives.  It is absolutely astonishing that legislation amounting to 38 pages will not be debated by any Member of this House before the Minister signs it into law in August, as he is required to do under EU legislation.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House to discuss why people who are exempt from the non-principal private residence and household charges cannot obtain a certificate from any Department stating they are exempt.  When they go to sell their properties, solicitors will ask them whether they have paid the charges.  In cases where the properties are exempt, there will be no mechanism to demonstrate this to the solicitor.</P>
        <P>Yesterday a pardon was announced for 5,000 former soldiers who deserted from the Irish Army.  I welcome the pardon.  The British Government pardoned many who were executed for desertion and cowardice in the First World War.  The Minister previously described Ireland&rsquo;s position during the Second World War as morally bankrupt.  I disagree with that vehemently and would like to praise the many thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands who served in the Irish Army and the local defence forces during the Second World War.  Newspaper reports state those who are still with us say they deserted because they wanted to fight in a war or wanted more money.  That is fair enough but one should remember they did desert the Irish Army.</P>
        <P>Consider the question of who were the most likely people to have invaded Ireland in 1939 and 1940.  In the words of Winston Churchill, if it had suited Britain it was militarily prudent, it would have invaded us.  It would have been ironic that those who deserted, many for the greatest and most noble of reasons, would have ended up attacking their former colleagues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Small business costs have rocketed in the past year.  After having raised the issue of banks lending to small businesses yesterday, I was inundated with calls from small business interests who are all saying the same thing, namely, that the cost of business for the small and medium-sized enterprise has gone through the roof.  It is no surprise that a survey by ISME states turnover was down for 52% of small businesses in 2010 and 2011.  While turnover is falling, business costs are rising.  For example, the cost of fuel has gone through the roof.  There has been a 25% increase in the cost of gas and an 11.2% increase in the cost of electricity in the past year alone.  The cost of insurance has risen, an issue raised with me by many people.  It seems incredible that insurance costs of buildings are rising when property prices have fallen by up to 50% in some areas.  This is having a considerable effect on the cost of doing business.  Keeping a delivery van on the road has become almost non-viable considering the increased cost of fuel and van insurance.</P>
        <P>We must revisit the issue of upward-only rent reviews and arrive at a solution.  As I stated yesterday, we ignore the small business sector at our peril.  It comprises the backbone of the Irish economy.  So much emphasis is placed on multinationals, which provide approximately 100,000 Irish jobs.  While we acknowledge their importance, we must not allow our focus to shift away from the sustaining role the small and medium-sized enterprise sector can play.  I ask the Leader to include in the debate on banking and the advancement of credit to small businesses the question of the cost of doing business.</P>

	<P>That is not the matter I wish to raise, however.  I wish to refer to an instance of pointed unfairness in regard to social welfare.  Perhaps the Leader will pass my message on to the Minister for Social Protection.  If somebody has an investment property and is now not working, the value of that property is used in means tests by the Department.  However, if the loan on that property is not classified as a mortgage, but as a bridging loan or otherwise, the Department disallows one from offsetting the amount of money owed on the property against the value.  I have encountered a number of such cases.  It is particularly unfair because the Department has a very narrow interpretation of the wording.  People who have worked, paid taxes and invested in a property are now not allowed to claim any social welfare payment because of the interpretation.  It is pointedly unfair.  I ask the Leader to pass on my concerns.  I am sure others have come across this anomaly.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I note Senator Daly&rsquo;s comments on the pardon announced by the Government for 5,000 brave Irishmen who did what they felt was right.  The Senator&rsquo;s comments were a little ungracious and ungenerous.  It is correct that the Government would acknowledge the wrong that was done to these men.

        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien called for a debate on funding and bank debt.  I clarified in the House that the Government&rsquo;s position is that we are looking for restructuring and the alleviation of bank debt.  That is clear and the Taoiseach has made his point clear in that matter also.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised the question on Syria which was raised here yesterday.  We all would agree that the UN must take more forceful action when dealing with this issue.  It is dreadful to see such atrocities taking place and standing idly by and allowing this to happen.  More pressure must be put on the likes of Russia and China to comply with UN regulations and to support the UN in its efforts to solve this problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik also raised the question of Yeats Day, as did Senators Norris and the Sligo Senators.

	<P>I do not propose to take No. 23, motion 9, at present but I will certainly investigate whether we can have a debate on the matter.  We had a debate on media standards here in the House not so long ago and I will see whether we can have a further debate in that area.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen, Cullinane, Healy Eames and others referred to the ESRI report.  We discussed it on the Order of Business yesterday.  The report has been withdrawn, as has been mentioned this morning.  Some 67% of those on the live register have total social welfare income of &euro;188 a week or less and this means that the great majority of those on the live register have a significant financial incentive to work.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has been reforming the social welfare system to ensure that work pays for welfare recipients.  I can assure the House that the contents of the ESRI report and the circumstances in which it was withdrawn are matters for the ESRI and that, contrary to what has been suggested by some, the Minister had no role whatsoever in the withdrawal of this report.  There is no question of the Minister having any role in the withdrawal of the report.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen also raised the matter of persons defrauding the State, which everybody agrees is wrong.  The matter of Deputy Wallace is a matter for the other House and, indeed, for the Revenue Commissioners and other relevant authorities.  We look forward to the debate on Senator Mullen&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill tonight to which he alluded.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Coghlan raised the planning review announced yesterday by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  The Minister of State published the findings and the recommendations of the planning review report.  The report sets out 12 actions which will address the current deficiencies in the planning system.  The Minister has given a firm commitment to implement all 12 actions, and that is to be welcomed.  In addition, the Minister has announced the planned appointment of an independent planning consultant who will be required to assess all the actions contained in the planning review report and propose any additional measures which are deemed appropriate.  The independent consultant will also be tasked with examining a number of broader themes identified in the report and submitting recommendations for the actions.  That is positive.  When these recommendations and the report are finalised by the independent consultant, we can probably hold a wide-ranging debate on planning in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Byrne proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to bring the Taoiseach to the House.  I do not propose to accede to the request but I can inform the House that the Taoiseach will address the House in a matter of weeks.</P>
        <P>Senators Landy and Wilson raised the consultation on local government reform and the extension of the timescale from 15 June to 22 June.  I have been assured by the Minister that all local authorities were informed at the same time.</P>

        <P>I was coming to Senator Norris&rsquo;s query on the Press Council, but I have dealt with that.</P>
        <P>Senator Comiskey raises an important issue relating to the discards of fish.  It is something which has been discussed in this House on a number of occasions over the past ten years.  Certainly, Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and &Oacute; Clochartaigh, and many others in coastal villages and towns throughout the country, have raised this question of discards.  In what was the most significant EU fisheries Council meeting in over a decade involving over 20 hours of negotiations which ended at 5 a.m. this morning, the EU fisheries Ministers agreed their position on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The issue of discarding of fish whereby unwanted catches of dead fish are thrown back into the sea has been a most contentious element in discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, put forward a new compromise approach setting down a definitive timescale for the elimination of discards on a phased and planned basis.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposals offered a practical and progressive solution which was accepted by his fellow Ministers early this morning.  This approach will end the waste of valuable resources and would enable stocks to grow.  It is welcomed by all involved in the fishing sector and beyond.</P>
        <P>Senators Jim D&rsquo;Arcy and Barrett raised the lack of action by the heads of universities on the proposals for reform of the points system.  I note Senator Barrett&rsquo;s comment in that regard, namely, that the wrong persons were being asked.  That is a point which we will certainly raise with the Minister for Education and Skills.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy also raised the &euro;8 million in unauthorised payments.  It is a disgrace that there should be such payments.  Certainly, the heads of universities have a lot to answer for in that regard and I hope they will be forthcoming in their answers in early course.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael Mullins has called for greater sensitivity in the Coroner&rsquo;s Court when deaths by suicide are being discussed.  Perhaps we might have a debate on that issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, which could encompass other issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn urged encouragement of Bord Bia to consider the need for further designation of Irish foodstuffs, including those he mentioned.  Certainly, the Waterford blaa is one with which I am very familiar.  I can assure the Senator I have the constitution to eat many blaas.  I agree totally that we should be supporting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am expanding in many ways.  We should be expanding the number of foods that can be designated and supporting Bord Bia in its efforts in that regard.  No doubt it is an area in which those involved in the food sector should be more proactive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mark Daly made three points.  On organ donation, a matter Senator Feargal Quinn raised on several occasions, perhaps we might debate the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The NPPR charge is a matter the Senator could probably raise on the Adjournment.  The vast majority of Members, if not all, welcomed the pardon for the 5,000 Irish soldiers in question.  They were brave Irishmen.  The statement made by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, in that regard is to be welcomed by all.</P>
        <P>Senator Tom Sheahan again raised the matter of small business costs.  It is one which has been raised on several occasions in the House.  We will have the Credit Guarantee Bill to discuss when the Minister for Finance is here on 3 July.  Yesterday I advised the House that the micro-finance Bill would be brought to the Seanad.  I understand, after the Cabinet meeting yesterday, that it has been decided to take that Bill first in the D&aacute;il, rather than the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I have given a draft schedule for the next three or four weeks to the group leaders, to which there are changes already.  We will update it as we move along and notify the group leaders accordingly.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy mentioned the anomaly in the social welfare system.  It is a matter he might raise on the Adjournment to receive an adequate response from the Minister for Social Protection.</P>

    <Title>Seanad Report on the Rights of Older People: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to the House.  We will have statements on the rights of older people on which a report has been completed by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  I invite the Minister of State to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Senators for giving me an opportunity to make a statement on its report on the rights of older people.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We all acknowledge and indeed welcome the fact that society can only be enriched by the increasing number of older people in the coming years.  This not only is a reflection of our shared values and aims but also represents the success of various policies and services developed in recent decades to extend life expectancy through improved health services and to advance the overall quality of life of older people.  There is, I am sure, common agreement within this House and beyond that the challenges and opportunities presented by our changing demographics should be addressed in the best and most realistic way possible.  The report is timely, therefore, and raises, rightly, important issues that will help inform debate and decisions in the future.  Many of the questions raised in the report have been or are being pursued on various fronts, including through the programme for Government, for example.  Other issues surfacing in the report will have to be considered with a view to their feasibility in the current climate.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of Government policy in terms of health and personal social services is to support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible.  This is, after all, where most older people want to be and is realised throughout the country by a range of valuable and widely appreciated community-based services.  These are designed to be as flexible as possible to best meet the needs of older people and their families.  Alternatively, where home-based supports are not an option, for whatever reason, the State supports access to quality long-term residential care.  We are also moving beyond the existing accepted spheres of care delivery towards enhanced transitional or intermediate care options.  These not only are designed to deliver more appropriate care in a more integrated setting, but also are a new approach to alleviating pressures across the wider care system.</P>
        <P>In tangible terms, the investment dedicated to services for older people is significant by any standard with, for example, slightly more than &euro;1.4 billion being provided this year for the health sector alone, of which approximately &euro;350 million is for home supports.  These services are often delivered on a partnership basis with the not-for-profit and private sectors.  Existing policies, services and Exchequer funding across the public domain therefore reflect to varying degrees at least some of the eight recommendations and themes contained in the report, balanced against the equity and rights we all should expect and enjoy as a society.</P>
        <P>Such balance is key to the call for a new UN treaty on the rights of older people.  This, as the report indicates, is being considered at UN level and by the EU where, it is fair to say, there seems to be little enthusiasm so far for such a proposal.  This issue is obviously still at a very formative stage, with no guarantee that a treaty will materialise in the near future.  There are, however, a number of interesting points raised in the report which I will consider in due course with the Government.  These include the view that policies in the past tended to be more passive than active on older people, or the need for clarity surrounding how any new treaty might relate to other legal, policy or rights-based approaches.</P>
        <P>On coming into office, the Government made a firm commitment in the programme for national recovery to introduce a mental capacity Bill in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  One of the remaining core elements to ratifying the UN convention is enactment of new mental capacity legislation.  I do not wish to go over my time but I wish to say that it may not be called the mental capacity Bill, which is a harsh title.  We will discuss assisted decision making in regard to mental capacity.  Language is important.  Work is ongoing to ensure alignment of the Bill with the convention, and the Government legislation programme indicates the Bill will be published in the current session.  The mental capacity Bill will reform the law in respect of adults who lack some or all mental capacity to make important decisions for themselves and will provide a legal framework to support such persons in fully exercising their legal capacity.  It will modernise the law on capacity &mdash; largely dating back to the 19th century &mdash; and will bring Irish capacity legislation into line with current thinking and modern international legislative frameworks.</P>
        <P>Societal and demographic changes make the need for reform of the law on capacity more pressing.  Changing family structures, for example, or the isolation of vulnerable persons generally, present challenges for both society, and existing law.  Over time, as the population ages, more of us will require the assistance of others to support or intervene in decisions about our personal welfare, finance and property.  In modernising the law on legal capacity, the Bill will address such needs while striking a balance between an enabling approach and protection.  The main proposals in this regard are: to provide a statutory framework for supported decision making for persons lacking capacity and to abolish the wards of court system; to change existing law on capacity, shifting from the current &ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo; approach to a more flexible functional one where capacity is assessed on an issue and time-specific basis; to provide that, where it is not possible for a person to exercise capacity even with support, a court or a court appointee may act as his or her representative; to clarify, as indicated in one of the recommendations of this report, the law for carers who take on responsibility for persons who lack capacity; to establish an office of the public guardian with strong supervisory powers to protect persons lacking in capacity; and to repeal and subsume the provisions of the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 in order that its provisions would be brought into line with the general principles and safeguards in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I am most conscious of the key role quality home care plays in the lives of so many people, and the need to progress more improvements in the sector generally.  As referenced in the report, the Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 commits to developing and implementing national standards for home support services which will be subject to inspection by the Health and Information Quality Authority, HIQA.  New statutory regulation of this sector must take account of various issues such as those raised in recent reports of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P>Primary legislation and additional resources will be required to introduce statutory regulation for home care services, including the private sector.  The question of possible legislative changes, including regulation and inspection for relevant services, is under consideration in the overall context of licensing health care providers.  Various options are being examined, including the complex legal issues involved and the need to prioritise legislation across the social care area, such as that relating to children or disabilities.  It is important to emphasise that statutory regulation is only one way of improving the safety and quality of services and that other operational measures have or are being taken to improve community services for older people delivered by, or on behalf of, the HSE.</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge the point made in the report on the need for improved planning data for community care for older people, the position is that the existing data available to the CSO and the health authorities is robust enough to meet projection requirements.  I will, however, take this suggestion on board to see what improvements might be possible, while balancing priorities in the area of health data overall.  I also make the point that the majority of HSE home help has traditionally gone to vulnerable older people, and this continues to be the case, with an increasing focus on meeting more personalised care needs for the most vulnerable.</P>
        <P>We recognise the tremendous contribution that carers make to society.  However, it is important to understand the carer&rsquo;s allowance is primarily envisaged as an income support where someone is unable to work because of caring responsibilities.  It is not a payment for providing care.  The point at which a close relative who has been providing care begins to claim carer&rsquo;s allowance is usually when the extent of the caring interferes with his or her ability to work.  Family members have natural responsibilities for the care of one another beyond supports the State may provide.  The State is not the normative way to meet human needs and it is not appropriate to compare the cost of State care with the cost of that provided within the family.</P>
        <P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.  Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.  I checked on this matter before attending the Seanad, as there is a great deal of concern about it in particular.  The Department assured me each case is dealt with on an individual basis, which is important.  Sometimes, circumstances arise in which family members must travel home in a hurry.  Irish nationals returning to live in Ireland on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P>There is no discrimination on grounds of nationality in social welfare legislation and to introduce any such provision would be contrary to the equality principles that Ireland has adopted in its equality legislation, the treaties of the European Community, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and other international conventions.</P>
        <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann as well as Luas and services provided by more than 90 private transport operators.  Funding for the scheme was frozen by the previous Government at 2010 expenditure levels, as outlined in the National Recovery Plan 2011-14 and the 2011 budget.  This cap was confirmed in the 2012 budget.  The Department of Social Protection, therefore, is not in a position at this time to extend the scheme in any way, including through provision of a taxi voucher scheme.</P>
        <P>Some 700,000 customers are in receipt of the scheme, a figure that is increasing annually.  The scheme was set up to take advantage of available unused passenger places on public transport services.  This is the only basis on which the scheme can be viable in the long term.  The use of taxis in place of scheduled public passenger services would represent a significant expansion of the scheme, with considerable additional costs that could not be countenanced in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P>The rural transport programme provides a degree of flexibility for older people in rural areas where regular public services are not available.  All of the schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection, including free travel, were examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure and continue to be kept under review, given the ongoing need for savings.  The review continues to inform the Government&rsquo;s decisions on future spending.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that, during 2008, an interdepartmental group undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a national carer&rsquo;s strategy.  However, due to the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set achievable targets or time limits.  In this context, rather than publishing a document that did not include any significant plan for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.  I am pleased to inform the House that the development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy to support carers and to address issues of concern is a key commitment in the current programme for Government.  The strategy will address the needs of informal and family carers.  It will be conceptual and visionary and will establish a number of high level principles, goals and objectives and a roadmap to implementation.  The State faces challenges in maintaining existing levels of services from within limited resources, in which context the strategy is being developed.  It will not be an operational plan but will set the strategic direction for future services and supports for carers in recognition of their role and contribution to maintaining children, adults and older people with physical or mental health difficulties in their own homes.</P>
        <P>While issues relating to carers span a number of Departments, the Taoiseach has allocated responsibility for co-ordination of the preparation of the strategy to me, with the support of the Minister for Social Protection.  Work on developing the strategy is ongoing and a consultation process with other Departments took place in early 2012.  A draft was completed at the end of March as a basis for final consultation with other Departments and with national organisations representing carers.  Carers&rsquo; organisations have made formal observations and it is hoped a draft will be completed for submission to Government during the summer.</P>
        <P>Government policy on palliative care is contained in the 2001 report of the national advisory committee on palliative care and the HSE&rsquo;s palliative care services Five Year/Medium Term Development Framework 2009-13.  It is worth stressing that palliative care, in which non-statutory players feature prominently, is moving beyond the traditional life-limiting area of cancer to address other non-malignant or chronic conditions.  The Government remains committed to the delivery of the best possible palliative care services, as reflected with funding of some &euro;78 million for this year.  In this context, I am pleased to inform the House that the centralised medical card registration unit of the HSE operates a scheme for issuing emergency medical cards, which would cover persons in end-of-life situations.  A person or general practitioner, GP, can at any time seek assistance from or direct his or her emergency application to his or her local health office.  The HSE has also provided functionality to GPs to extend eligibility for one year in certain cases.</P>
        <P>The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system, the aim of which is to deliver a single-tier health system supported by universal health insurance, UHI, where access is based on need, not income.  There are a number of important stepping stones along the way, each of which will play a crucial role in improving our health service in advance of the introduction of UHI.</P>
        <P>Given the multidimensional nature of this report, I and other relevant Ministers and Departments will require more time to absorb its content and implications fully.  The report will also be taken into account in the context of finalising the forthcoming national positive ageing strategy.  Therefore, it is not possible to give firm commitments today on the report of the House.  However, I assure the House that, from my initial examination of this recently received report, I regard it as a valuable contribution to the vision we all embrace of enhancing the lives of older people in whatever way possible.</P>
        <P>Given the work involved in the report, there is a clear commitment to the general view that the question of how we age is important.  We hope to publish the positive ageing strategy this year, given the year that is in it.  The strategy will be subject to consultation and it is hoped it will map the way to our future.  As I often tell people, it is as if older people are out there and not part of what we are.  I thank the Seanad for going to the trouble of producing and presenting this report and for allowing time for this discussion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment her on her tremendous work.  One regularly reads newspaper stories about her activities.  I congratulate her on meeting my expectations.</P>
        <P>I will discuss the Fianna F&aacute;il policy document, entitled &ldquo;Acting Ageing and Quality Caring&rdquo;.  Its publication two months ago coincided with the EU&rsquo;s selection of 2012 as the European year of active ageing and solidarity between generations.  Europe&rsquo;s populations are ageing quickly as a result of low birth rates and increasing life expectancies.  Here in Ireland, people are also living longer and have more years of healthy active living than previous generations enjoyed.  As the lifespan of older people extends, the frailties and disabilities which affect them need a caring, effective response.  As Ireland becomes a more urban society and more socially fragmented, social isolation and its many negative impacts on older people need to be recognised and countered.  Only last week we saw the tragic case of two gentlemen in their 80s in Williamstown in north Galway who were beaten up and robbed.  One of them even suffered a stroke after confronting the robbers and is still in hospital in Ballinasloe.  What kind of a society are we living in?  This should never happen.  Those living in isolation need to have instant contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Today, a woman who reaches the age of 65 years has an average life expectancy of 20 further years while a man can anticipate 17 additional years of life.  We have an ever growing number of older people in our midst.  They are projected to double in number from some 500,000 today to 1 million in less than 20 years according to EUROSTAT data and projections for 2030.  The majority of older people who reach the age of 65 years can look forward to many years of healthy, active ageing.  Public policy must respond to this extension of active ageing in the workplace and the community.  As the lifespan of older people extends into years not experienced by previous generations, a minority are affected by illness and disabilities associated with ageing which require special care.  Most can remain at home given proper support.  It should be the overriding objective of public policy to ensure the supports available &mdash; family, State, voluntary, community &mdash; can help them to stay in their own homes.  Does anyone wish to end up in a nursing home?  It reflects badly on society that so many people are in nursing homes.  In the past families looked after older members who gave their experience and wisdom to the younger members.  The new nursing home arrangements for care of the elderly are a significant sociological change that is not good.</P>
        <P>It is time to recognise the potential of our ageing population to contribute to and enrich our society in many diverse ways given their talents, experience and wisdom and the many years of healthy life expectancy which most can enjoy.  Equally, their human rights as citizens must be affirmed and the many forms of discrimination on grounds of age against them exposed and eliminated.  The policies set out in this document are founded on these two principles.  Fianna F&aacute;il will introduce legislation to ban mandatory retirement at 65 in the private and public sector.  Making people retire at 65 is a denial of human rights.  This mandatory retirement was introduced over 100 years ago by Bismarck when average life expectancy was 40 years of age.  People should have the right to stay on in their jobs, if they so wish.  It is a logical move.  People who continue to work continue to pay tax and we already have a serious issue with pension funding.  The UK and Northern Ireland have introduced legislation which allows people to stay on in work after 65.  Like everything else, we are always slow to take on a new initiative.</P>
        <P>I want to personally thank the Minister of State for all she is doing for Ireland.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I also welcome some of the stakeholders in this report who are in the Visitors Gallery.  I thank them for engaging in this new process for the Seanad and the Oireachtas making this a public consultation in the true sense of the word.  These stakeholders experience the difficulties and challenges faced by those involved in care of the elderly.  There is an opportunity to make older people&rsquo;s lives better.  This report is a reflection of their aspirations and it is a healthy exercise.  The Seanad has already embarked on other reports in other areas.</P>
        <P>Some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations are practical and aspirational.  I commend the Minister of State&rsquo;s comprehensive and realistic response to the report.  The positive ageing report will be published later this year and I am glad this Seanad report will feed into it.  Ireland has played a very important role in fulfilling UN obligations.  While it may be aspirational to seek a UN convention on the rights of older people, at least we have called for it.  Ireland will hold the EU Presidency next year which will give us a platform to advance that call.  The reality is the world population is ageing and the UN will have to face up to the need for a charter of rights for older people.  On the point about habitual residence, the Minister stated each case is dealt with on an individual basis.</P>
        <P>The report took a holistic approach to the issue and examined the practical, as well as aspirational aspects of care for older people and what people wanted in this area in the future.  When people get older, they naturally develop disabilities or impaired mental capacity.  The Minister of State has spoken about being careful in the use of language.  She is very much in tune with the importance of the use of language, and I welcome that.  I know the heads of that Bill have been discussed at the Oireachtas joint committee dealing with justice matters.  We are heading in the right direction and we will see significant movement.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has given an initial response and I hope that later in the year, when we consider the positive ageing report that is to be published, we can have a more detailed and advanced response.  Perhaps the Minister of State will take time from her busy schedule to come back to the House for a more in-depth discussion.  If it is relevant to other Ministers, we could develop an ongoing process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this discussion on the Seanad Public Consultation Committee&rsquo;s report on the rights of older people.  When the 24th Seanad assembled last year, there was overwhelming support across the House to improve the way the Seanad works and make it more relevant and accessible to the public at large.  To that end, the public consultation committee was created, which constitutes a strong addition to the overall committee system and brings the Seanad closer to the citizen by allowing community representatives to appear before the House.</P>
        <P>It was decided by the public consultation committee that the rights of older persons in Ireland should be the theme of the first project, and the choice was endorsed by all Members of the House.  The report was compiled following widespread consultation by the committee with various stakeholders in the area, and in the following interesting sessions, the Members were addressed by experts on the floor of this House.  In a time when the country is facing massive change and the sand seems to be shifting beneath our feet all the time, it is only right and proper that the more senior members of our society have the ear of public representatives so their needs can be heard and, we hope, met.  The generation who laid the ground work to lead us to prosperity in the recent past and who have subsequently been in many cases unfairly affected by the economic turmoil of recent years deserve to have that contribution and sacrifice recognised.</P>
        <P>Submissions were received from a diverse range of bodies and organisations, and recommendations were made concerning a host of items pertaining to the lives of older people.  Having passed this report to the Minister of State and knowing her dedication and commitment to all aspects of the portfolio, I am confident some of the very worthwhile recommendations made in the report will work their way into policy and legislation in future.</P>
        <P>As Leader of the House I can say that none of us is seeking personal recognition but we are honoured and proud as a body to have the work we have completed here translated into real outcomes for the section of society we all agree is deserving of special attention from politicians and policymakers alike.  I compliment Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe and Senator Zappone in particular on their work in compiling this report.  The committee worked very hard and the two Senators worked above and beyond the call of duty in formulating the report.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for her very comprehensive response to the report, which is much appreciated by the House.  I welcome the fact the positive ageing strategy will come later in the year, and it should be welcomed by all organisations involved in the care of the elderly.  As Senator Conway mentioned, I hope when the strategy is published that the Minister of State will come before the House to respond to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Minister of State&rsquo;s personal commitment to this issue and echo the sentiments of my colleagues in thanking her for a very comprehensive response to the report put together by the consultation committee.  Today&rsquo;s debate, if anything, hopes to inject a sense of urgency into the various issues for older people.  I am somewhat disappointed as I do not get a sense of urgency in some of the comments of the Minister of State.  Her contribution was comprehensive but I worry about its sense of urgency.  I have some questions and comments on the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution, and I hope she can respond to those questions at the conclusion of these statements.</P>
        <P>I will begin with the comments made by Senator Cummins and Senator Conway in acknowledging the statement on the national positive ageing strategy.  Work on that strategy has been ongoing since 2006, and the Government programme has promised to complete and implement the strategy for older people so they are recognised, supported and enabled in living independent lives.  We need this publication of a national framework which aids effective policy planning sooner rather than later and a co-ordinated and coherent approach is essential so that the rights of a growing number of people in the population are sufficiently protected.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State may be aware of an opinion piece in <i>The Irish Times</i> today written on behalf of Older and Bolder which referenced this national positive ageing strategy.  It stated that the official approach to the strategy has been lacklustre, and the cross-departmental group of civil servants and non-governmental organisation liaison groups set up to assist the Minister of State and her officials are simply not functioning.  I heard the Minister of State indicate she hoped the strategy would be published by the end of the year but I wonder if she can be more specific.  Is she certain it will be published before the end of the year and could she specify when it will happen?  That is my first question to encourage a sense of urgency in the issue.</P>
        <P>In her opening comments the Minister of State referred to the right to home care and community services.  In the report we indicated that research has shown that the majority of people wish to remain at home in their older years, and the Minister of State has indicated that as well.  Under the Health Act 1970, citizens have a right to an inpatient hospital bed but there is no comparable right to home and community care services available on a discretionary basis.</P>
        <P>Our report highlighted the trend towards reducing the supports available to people to remain at home, although these are more cost effective than institutional care.  The number of home help hours provided to older people will be cut by 4.5% and the disability services budget will be cut by 3.7%.  A number of nursing homes will be shut down, as well as an unspecified number of public hospital beds, meaning there will be a greater emphasis on diverting older people to private nursing homes.  We also mentioned that a large number of hospital staff retired from the health service, which makes home care services even more important.  We must ask again today how our most vulnerable older people will be protected in the midst of all these cuts.  The Minister for Health must make good on the commitment in the programme for Government to provide adequate and effective care in the community.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State may also be aware that in 2011, the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, observed that people do not know where they stand in terms of entitlements and HSE obligations to provide services.  Our committee heard evidence that it is difficult to obtain information about services and reliable access to them at critical points.  An example would be on discharge from hospital or at the onset of a disability.  Eligibility criteria for home care services are not published in a coherent way.  Our report is simply calling for clarity around the availability of entitlements for older people, and that those entitlements be given a statutory footing.  Without the necessary legislation, access to services is difficult, discretionary and unequal.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the report states that the HSE should make more use of the HealthStat performance information system to audit the existing services and provide more information about the HSE services available in the community.  An audit of community care services by HealthStat could have helped to identify the deficits and planned for the future of community care.  Can the Minister of State indicate if home care entitlements will be placed on a statutory footing and whether the audit we recommend will take place?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and Senator Conway, among others, referred to the UN treaty.  It was noted a UN working group is considering the drafting of a United Nations treaty on the rights of older people but that there is little enthusiasm for this.  Perhaps there is a lack of enthusiasm at some of the meetings but a man who gave expert evidence to our committee, Professor Gerard Quinn from the centre for disability law and policy in Galway, does not lack enthusiasm, nor does his team.  He was one of the main drivers behind the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  He highlighted to the committee that older people are seldom explicitly mentioned in existing international human rights treaties and that this lack of explicit mention makes it difficult for universal rights to be equally as effective for older people as for other groups.  The main point of a new treaty would be to tailor the general rights to this particular population, as we did with women and disability.  The tailoring of a treaty in this case would ensure the rights of older people could be more effectively enforced through the UN system.  Will the Minister of State to tell the House whether the Government will support our recommendation to support the drafting of this treaty in light of the comments we have put forward in response to the report?  From our perspective, there is a need for this type of treaty, in the same way we need a treaty for women, ethnic minorities and those with a disability.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made some detailed remarks on the legislation relating to mental capacity.  Evidence was presented to the committee on the subject of legal capacity and, as the Minister of State pointed out, there is an international trend away from laws or policies based on deficits or what people cannot do towards the concept of support to enable people to maintain independence and to stay in charge of their personal destiny.  There is a lack of up-to-date legal capacity legislation and that is one of the barriers to the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State on noting that we must be attentive when it comes to language.  Perhaps the name of the legislation might be changed to include the phrase &ldquo;assisted decision making&rdquo;.  I like that.  &ldquo;Legal capacity&rdquo; refers to a person holding and exercising rights with assistance or support if need be.  Perhaps legal capacity legislation could be made distinct from mental capacity legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment that the legislation will be published in the current session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Dillon from Older and Bolder is also present, as are the former Lord Mayor, Michael O&rsquo;Halloran, and Mrs. Connolly, who have come in to listen to the debate.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  There is not much to argue with in the report.  I hope we will do our utmost to achieve the optimum in protecting and enforcing the rights of older persons.  As people are living longer, our older population is increasing.  It stands to reason that we restructure and adapt to support such a huge demographic change.  I believe by implementing the national positive ageing strategy, we will go a long way towards facing up to and alleviating the trials and challenges older people face today.  I have discussed this issue at length with the Minister of State on occasions and I am aware the strategy is at an advanced stage.  It will be published before the end of the year, which we welcome, and we will debate the issue again, no doubt when the strategy is about to be published.</P>
        <P>Older people should be viewed not as a hindrance but as a huge advantage and resource to society.  Older people contribute to society in many ways, through paid and unpaid work, caring roles and as skilled and knowledgeable members of our community.  They are the people who have built our country, reared their families, paid their taxes and contributed hugely to society, and now it is our responsibility to ensure we do all we can to make life as easy, as comfortable, as stimulating, as healthy and as fulfilling for them as possible.  The intention behind the strategy is to put in place arrangements that would ensure issues affecting older people are mainstreamed in policy making at all levels and across all sectors.</P>
        <P>Creating a programme for older people that works takes cross departmental co-operation.  We need co-operation from all sectors to ensure a viable, cohesive, sustainable and positive strategy is created and implemented.</P>
        <P>Our number one priority must be the publishing and implementation of the positive ageing strategy but there are other issues that I would like to highlight, such as the effect on pension entitlements following changes in the Social Welfare Bill.  While I agree with the changes, as the more a person works and contributes, the larger his pension should be at the end of his days, there is one sector of society that these changes will affect through no fault of their own: the women who had no choice but to give up work when they got married under the marriage bar.  These women were obliged to give up their job the minute they got married and many of them returned to the workforce when their children were reared, but under new legislation their reduced yearly average will result in a reduced contributory old age pension.  I have written to the Minister for Social Protection seeking home maker&rsquo;s credits for these women.  It should be easy enough to verify their years as home makers by the children&rsquo;s allowance or by birth certificates.  These women whose careers were nipped in the bud are owed something in return.</P>
        <P>The age-friendly initiative currently being undertaken in Dundalk should be extended to all towns in Ireland.  Louth will be the first age-friendly county in Ireland, and I hope it will lead the way for others to follow.  The thinking behind this new strategy has been strongly influenced by the World Health Organization&rsquo;s guideline for age-friendly cities.  This strategy can be applied to communities of all sizes.</P>
        <P>We should be moving towards a model of care in the community.  It is a priority, in so far as possible, that older people continue to live in their own homes.  Older people should be able to live in safety and peace, not in fear of being broken into or attacked, as happened in the horrific stories we were alerted to in recent weeks of two sisters and a brother in Limerick and, again last week, of the two brothers in Galway, innocent and vulnerable people who were subjected to horrific, mindless and sickeningly vicious attacks.  Safeguards in the form of panic buttons, community alert schemes, senior alert schemes and, above all, harsh penalties for those who commit these horrendous crimes must be looked at.  Unfortunately, with increasing lack of confidence in the banking system, some older people are once again reverting to keeping their money at home, which unfortunately makes them targets for such scumbags, if I can use such a word, who resort to intimidating, robbing and violently attacking them in their homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the perfect word to describe them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Another area I believe is vital in supporting older people is education.  Informing the elderly of their entitlements is very important as many do not know their entitlements.  This is highlighted in the national positive ageing strategy, and rightly so.  Many older people would benefit from basic computer classes and, in many cases, classes in the use of mobile phones and texting.  In a world which is increasingly technological and digital, and where a password or PIN is required to undertake even the most basic transaction, taking the fear away from this would be greatly beneficial and, perhaps for many, life enhancing.  These types of courses could be given in a local setting, such as community centres, resource centres, active retirement meetings or day care centres, at very little cost.</P>
        <P>Clarity of available entitlements for older people is a must and I am glad this is picked up in the Seanad report on the rights of older persons.  It is crucial that older people have access to this type of information and are fully aware of their entitlements.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Access to rural transport is a necessity, especially for elderly people living in the countryside.  As the Minister of State said, the recommendation of the taxi voucher is likely not to go ahead so the service is even more valuable as it provides an outlet for people, is inclusive socially and lessens the risk of people feeling excluded and depressed.  It has the knock-on effect of lessening the risk of suicide.  Social isolation is a huge contributing factor in suicide, particularly in rural Ireland, and funding for the scheme must be maintained as much as possible.  Such transport schemes provide the only means that some people have of reaching their day care centre, pick up their pension, visit their GP or simply interact socially.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are many measures that would help the elderly that incur little or no cost, for example, if people on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance gave one day per month to their community.  That is not too much to ask.  A person could cut the grass and hedges, paint houses or chop some wood for the elderly.  Organisations like youth clubs, the girl guides and boy scouts could undertake projects to help the elderly.  We, as a society, must revert to the old tradition of dropping in on neighbours for a chat or a cup of tea, checking if a person needs something from a shop or just see if they are okay.  We owe older people a decent standard of living and providing for their needs is a key priority for the Government.  What is meant by the term &ldquo;older people&rdquo; is a matter of judgment.  Growing old must be looked on positively and not shrouded in negativity.  The national positive ageing strategy addresses important issues and it is up to us to implement its findings when published.  It is the least we can do to help older people enjoy the quality of life they deserve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of an old friend and former Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Halloran.  We need to adopt a positive view and a bit of vision.  Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Halloran showed vision by founding the Irish Senior Citizens&rsquo; Parliament.  We need to think not just in terms of a medical model, although it is terribly important, but also in terms of the positive aspects of ageing and how elderly people can be facilitated.  I must declare an interest because I am an OAP, old age pensioner, without the &ldquo;P&rdquo;, to which I am entitled, because I did not take my contributory pension.  I did take the bus pass which is extremely important because it is practical.  Another practical idea is encouraging older people to contribute to their community, helping them to return to education, return to college and to participate.  We must remember that however old one is, one is still a citizen.  We must recognise the citizenship of the elderly and the importance of their participation in society.  The more they participate the more curious they are, the more they will be involved, the better quality of life they will enjoy and the longer they will live.  It is important that we support elderly people in this way.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report as far as it goes.  It seems to be a good one.  I agree with my colleagues that spoke previously when they asked for the national positive ageing strategy to be published urgently.   It is significant and I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment on its publication if she has not already done so.</P>
        <P>Community and care services are fine as long as people know about them.  Information must be made available in order that people can access them.  Very often people simply do not have information.  I remember having the same battle many years ago when citizens advice bureaux were closed by a previous Government.  It was the meanest cut of all because the closures were used to stop people availing of services to which they were entitled.  There should be clarity and it should be statutorily based.  I am relying on an extremely good briefing by Older and Bolder that is in the classic Albert Reynolds format of just one page.  The organisation called for health staff to carry out an audit.  It would be very useful because then we would have information to act on.  I also agree with its call for a register of professional home carers.   The Minister of State knows of an instance because she responded brilliantly to a case on carers that I raised with her.  There are cases where carers have language difficulties.  They simply cannot communicate because they do not know the English language.  There is also a lack of qualifications, a lack of understanding, the giving of inappropriate medication and turning up drunk for work.  We need to have information on the quality of services provided because sometimes the families are heartbroken by the poor quality of a care provider.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of legal consent and respect, that is fine but let us have it in practice.  I have raised the issue for constituents.  As the Minister of State will know, people were evicted from the Bethany Home, Carlow, by HIQA and the HSE against their consent which was a legal requirement and without the consent of their families.  They were just turfed out.  The home was not in a bad condition.  The same happened at a centre in Abbeyleix which I visited and viewed.  Unfortunately, I was given directions to travel through Carlow but I should have known better and listened to my good Laois instinct.  Again, it is a superb facility and the Minister of State knows of it.  The facility has had a little remission that I would like to see continued.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the Cottage Hospital on Valentia Island where a community exists and people visit their hospital residents, including the two residents that do not have relatives.  There was a proposal to split the residents up and disperse them on the mainland thus destroying their island community.  I have made the argument before but I shall not repeat myself because I want the Senator to have his full time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time.  I know that Older and Bolder is concerned about the national positive ageing strategy and the Minister of State referred to it as &ldquo;forthcoming&rdquo;.  The organisation is concerned whether it will happen this year.  A commitment was given.  Will it be implemented this year?  I listened to her presentation and read it later but I did not see a date mentioned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One message that we need to convey to people is the huge benefit provided by older people, particularly in employment.  In the company that I ran for many years I had a strategy of keeping people working, or giving them an opportunity to work, because of their experience, the example they set for younger people and their abilities.  My company benefited greatly from the measure and I want to convey the message to employers that compulsory retirement at 65 years is disastrous and wrong.  I can think of Betty O&rsquo;Reilly who works in Superquinn, Sutton.  She is 82 years of age and I know that because I was invited to her 80th birthday two years ago.  She does not work every day but comes in a few days each week or for a few hours.  It is a privilege to see her enthusiasm, ability and the example she sets for others.  I am also reminded of John Davitt who worked in the Superquinn branch in Ballinteer.  He approached me early in December 1993 to say that he and his wife had decided that when he reached 65 years on 31 December he would finish working.  He also took the opportunity to tell me that he had worked in many jobs beforehand but for his last nine years he had not lost a day at work.  He said that from the age of 56 to 65 he had looked forward to going to work every morning and he often looked at his watch in the evening expecting to see 4 p.m. only to discover that it was 6 p.m.  His days at Superquinn always went faster than he thought they did.  Sadly John died on Christmas Day that year, just six days before he was due to retire and his wife died three days later so staff at the Ballinteer branch had to attend two funerals.  The benefit he gained, even at that age, was great.  In the mornings he always looked forward to going to work and so do many others.</P>
        <P>Earlier Senator White talked about the retirement age.  At present there is no statutory retirement age for employees in the private sector here although many written employment contracts, including those in the public sector, specify a retirement age of 65 years.  Many other employees apply what they call a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; retirement age which is founded on common practices within a particular sector.  I am not talking about forcing anybody to work up to or beyond a certain age.   I am talking about where a person is able and willing to continue working but is prevented from doing so by a compulsory retirement age.  There should not be a compulsory retirement age.  It is particularly important as a new Eurobarometer survey has found that almost three quarters of Irish people want to work after they reach 65 years of age and more than half of those surveyed are against a compulsory retirement age.  On that basis a compulsory retirement age should be removed from legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the positive comments made about older people in society, especially that we owe them a huge debt.  Society would not exist without older people, and showing respect to them is a must.  I will put as questions the statements I had intended to make.</P>
        <P>First, will the Minister of State make a statement on the training of undergraduates for nursing and gerontology?  Following the submission of the review group findings, the Department and the Higher Education Authority are to lead any changes required in the delivery of the nursing and midwifery programme in the higher education system.  Are contacts being made with the higher education facilities and the authority to ensure that programme is ready to proceed when that comes in?</P>
        <P>Second, Nursing Home Ireland made a submission to the Department in January as part of the review of the nurse training process.  It states there is insufficient exposure of nursing students to appropriate person-centred gerontology and limited exposure to private health care environments, especially private voluntary nursing homes.  That is easy to arrange.  It will not cost the earth, and we should not have to wait too long or wait for reviews or publications to try to get representation for voluntary private nursing homes <i>en bloc</i>.</P>
        <P>Third, I welcome what the Minister of State said about the national positive ageing strategy but she said it will not be an operational plan.  Will she explain what she means by that because we need to get processes into operation?  We have had enough consultation, surveys and so on.  The Minister of State might tell me what the plan will be when it is published.</P>
        <P>Regarding the mental capacity Bill, I welcome the name change referred to by the Minister of State.  There is a recommendation that clarity and availability of retirements for older people be made a priority.  There is a pressing need for legislation to establish a clear right to community care versus an aspiration.  There is a need for an audit of community care services.  Some nursing homes have applied to HIQA.  Persons aged more than 65 years of age will be taken but there is no flexibility for a person of 64 years of age.  There are huge issues here.  I have six or seven questions but as my time has expired, I will send them by e-mail to the Minister of State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for taking a proactive approach to elderly care and keeping people at home for as long as possible.  That is very important.  One of the problems in this area, particularly in 2004, was a reactive approach to elderly care rather than a proactive approach.  The Maud McInerney case in 1978 set out clear guidelines on certain issues, yet there was no response from the Department for a further 26 years.  This is the time to plan not only for the next five years but also for the next 20 years.  The report presented today is constructive and takes into account the views of the organisations that represent the elderly.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of home care and the need for regulation in that area.  The Law Reform Commission has produced a report and has suggested a way forward.  Is there a timeline in regard to taking on board that report?  It is not something that can be pushed down the road for action at a later date.  People are living longer, as many speakers have said, and the number of people over the age of 65 is continuing to grow each year.  It is an issue on which there is a need for forward planning.  What are the views of the Minister of State on the Law Reform Commission report in that area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, who is the most regular visitor to the House, and commend her on her efforts.  It was a retrograde step on the part of the Government not to appoint a Minister with specific responsibility for older people, as we did on the previous occasion.  In fairness to the Minister of State, she is almost a Minister for everything in the areas of mental health and older people.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure it is fair to her or them to expect her to comprehensively cover all these areas, despite her valiant efforts to do it well.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few points.  I commend the work of Senator Zappone, Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe and the various other people.  I commend also Senator Mary White on the substantial document she produced in the context of care for the elderly.  As a colleague has said, the stones on the road know what needs to be done.  We welcome the representative from the Senior Citizens&rsquo; Parliament, Mr. Sean Dillon from the Older and Bolder campaign, and others who have taken the time to listen online and elsewhere.  There is no mystery in respect of what needs to be done.  That is clear.  We need to publish the path.  Nobody is stupid in the sense that we all know there are constraints on the public purse.  While a strategy may be published, it will not be possible to achieve everything in the first week, month or five years.  That is fine.  Let us publish it.  In the previous Government I was critical of the fact that while it had the aspiration for a carers&rsquo; strategy, it chose not to publish it because it had no budget for its implementation.  Why have a plan we could not follow?  I take the other extreme.  That is like telling a business that whatever it does, it should not have a strategic plan because it will never achieve it.  Nothing is surer than if the plan is not published, it will never be achieved because there is nothing to target.</P>
        <P>I ask that the report be published as quickly as possible.  The consultation phase ended in November 2010.  Since then various civil servants are passing it from one drawer to another for fear it might get published because it would increase their workload in terms of what they are expected to do, to get more for less, to reorganise things, and to connect boxes that are not connected in a way that can help the elderly.  Let us try to move it forward quickly.  The net cost for implementation of our proposal is &euro;60 million, which is a large sum in the circumstances.  I ask the Minister of State to explain to the people what the Government proposes to do to improve the lot of the elderly.</P>
        <P>In the report, we recommend not cutting the pension, changing housing aid for older people to include personal alarm systems, and issuing a medical card to everybody who has had a diagnosis for end of life.  To pay for that we suggest putting to working people that if they pay an extra amount, this is what we will be able to do.  When it comes to care of the elderly or the good education of the youth, most of us would be happy to contribute a little more if it was put to us.</P>
        <P>In preparation for today I put on Facebook that the debate was about to take place.  I have received a couple of comments from older people which I promised to raise.  The fastest growing use of Facebook is by the over 55 age group.  One suggestion was that people visit the elderly.  What is being done with all the unemployed people?  Could it be put to them that they voluntarily visit the elderly?  There is a huge amount of fear in regard to the travel pass and the pension.  I disagree with the new proposals in terms of the contributory pension and they should be revisited.  If it was up to the Minister of State, notwithstanding the fact she has to work with her colleagues, it would not happen.  I ask her to look at that.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State concluded by saying the strategy, when published, would be a consultation piece.  Please do not let it be that.  Let it be a roadmap we can follow and let us all work together to secure the resources to ensure we can do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Kelly.</P>
        <P>I warmly welcome the Minister of State to the House again and I commend all those who have put tremendous work into producing the report.  I am fortunate in that I happen to live in County Louth, the first county in Ireland and one of 33 areas worldwide to meet the criteria of the WHO Global Network of Age-friendly Cities and Communities.  I have been fortunate also in recent months to have had the opportunity to witness at close hand the work being done, in particular in Dundalk which aims to make it a great place in which to grow old.  Following my meetings with the team in the Netwell Centre of the Dundalk Institute of Technology and the presentation the centre gave in the Oireachtas audiovisual room at the end of February, I have become increasingly aware of the potential that exists to ensure Ireland becomes one of the greatest countries in which to grow old.  We must recognise, first, that people of all ages benefit when communities are designed to be age-friendly and older people live healthy, active and fulfilled lives.  The Minister of State has visited the Netwell Centre and witnessed the excellent work done there.</P>
        <P>In compiling this report, two major themes emerged from the submissions: the need for the rights of older people to be enshrined formally and recognised and the need to support and encourage independent living at home for as long as possible.  Sometimes, listening to media reports, one would think the majority of elderly people spend their latter years in residential care, but this is far from the truth.  The majority of elderly citizens live at home, which is where they choose to live.  It must be ensured this choice is available to everyone who wants it by supporting the elderly in their communities through ensuring services and supports for them are made more responsive, caring, professional and accessible through imaginative and cost-effective partnerships.</P>
        <P>It is one thing for these services to be available, it is another to ensure people are aware of their entitlements and how to access this support and assistance.  Older and Bolder, in its submission, drew attention to the issue of information and accessibility to services.  One of the main focuses of the Nestling Project in Dundalk, a project I would advise everybody to look into if they have an interest in this area, is to contact elderly people through home visits, groups and the dedicated volunteer telephone line, Good Morning Louth, which was set up recently to keep in touch with the elderly.  These contacts ensure information is relayed about services and entitlements.  Underpinning this through legislation is the only way to ensure access to services and community care becomes a right for the elderly rather than the minefield it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Having worked with older people for 28 years as a community welfare officer, it is obvious they want to live at home for as long as possible.  My experience over recent years has been that home care packages have not been funded properly and that home help hours in my county would be better described as home help minutes.  I made a proposal to the Minister for Health in the House previously to make greater use of community employment schemes to provide home help.  The cost would be minimal.  Carers are employed under the rural social scheme and the same should be done under community employment schemes.</P>
        <P>The mindset in the Department of Social Protection regarding medical referees for carer&rsquo;s allowance applications is to refuse everything.  People are being put through enormous grief.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I met a young man recently who gave up his job ten years ago to look after his mother.  Thankfully, she is still alive but now he is being told by her public health nurse that her incontinence pads will be rationed, even though she has a medical card.  It is a huge issue and I acknowledge the Minister of State will take on board all the issues we raise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State in whom I have great faith.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees imagined the notion of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  We might not have been the first to imagine it because &ldquo;there is nothing new under the sun&rdquo;, as John Donne said, but it was brought about by the Leader and the House itself.  The first consultation was on the rights of older people, and some of the stakeholders are in the Visitors Gallery.  Sometimes, I feel they should be in my seat because they know more than us from their experience, knowledge, inspiration, history, productivity and communication.  I was nominated a Senator to represent, to be a conduit, a voice, a doer or a champion and to legislate.  The Minister of State has the privilege of being appointed as an implementer.</P>
        <P>The rights of older people to primary community and continuing care services and in all aspects of their lives as they age with grace and dignity is no longer a priority of conversation.  We can no longer argue it is a priority of cost in the context of the uselessness and incompetence of the banks and the money we put into them but it must be a priority of implementation.</P>
        <P>I would like to make two points.  The first is I will be 60 in September and I do not know how that happened.  It is like I woke up one morning and I was 60 in a flash, although I feel 37.  My mother is 89 but she thinks and laughs like a 50 year old.  Life passes quickly and it is only when one reaches one&rsquo;s 50s and 60s that one realises this.  I associate two words with ageing, one of which is profundity.  That word is there because it is about a life well lived and all that implies.  The other word is &ldquo;urgency&rdquo;.  I do not feel a sense of urgency in the Seanad, although it may be in the back of our heads, regarding the implementation of the strategy for positive ageing.  Urgency is needed because nothing can keep at bay age and age&rsquo;s wrinkles, which is a marvellous line from Hopkins.  In other words, it is urgent and crucial that the strategy be implemented; that primary community and continuing care services be put on a statutory footing for all elderly people; that people grow old in their own homes and have access to all the services that make that possible; and that this becomes their statutory right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been in the House for one year and it has been a great privilege, but when I worked in third level education, I became used to achievement and the finishing and implementation of goals within specific deadlines &mdash; work well done and seen to be done &mdash; because after three years, a student had to be crafted, formed and educated to go out into society, look up and contribute in whatever way.  I find that this does not happen in politics but it should.  I have a belief in the Minister of State that she might be able to reverse that trend in the context of older people.  She, of all people, may be able to do that and insist that the public consultation committee recommendations be implemented as a priority and not take &ldquo;No&rdquo; for an answer.  If we cannot look after our old, we cannot look after ourselves.  The recommendations are as urgent as age and ageing.</P>

	<P>With respect, the process in the House is that we engage with people outside the House.  Parties, organisations and people who are represented in this House should be given the same opportunity.</P>
        <P>I commend the report and the work undertaken to bring it about.  It also highlights the role a second Chamber can undertake and I have long made the point that the Seanad can be a place to give us a unique opportunity as public representatives to engage with the public and people of expertise.  It is to be hoped this will happen in the long term as part of Seanad reform.</P>
        <P>I agree with the bulk of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  In particular, Ireland can take a leading role in the advancement of the UN convention on the rights of older people.  This is a significant gap in the UN&rsquo;s body of treaties and it is clear from other treaties such as the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment that such conventions can play a positive role in advancing the rights of vulnerable groups.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to mental capacity.  Whatever about the language used, we are all agreed that this is an area which has caused consternation over the years and must be reformed.  That reform must apply not merely to older people but to everybody.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recommendations contained within the report to revise the area of wardship, a Victorian concept that is no longer fit for purpose.  I also find much to recommend in the proposals relating to quality standards for home care packages, health statistics audits for community care, a greater degree of flexibility in respect of carer&rsquo;s allowance and clarity regarding entitlements for older people.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Acting Chairman is indicating that my time is up.  I will conclude by pointing out that both Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and I have called on several occasions for the publication of both the national ageing strategy and the national strategy on carers.  I look forward to the publication of both of these plans in due course and, more importantly, to their implementation in a properly resourced and effective manner.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it ar&iacute;s go dt&iacute; an Teach.  Ireland&rsquo;s ageing population presents us with an opportunity to introduce important social and economic initiatives.  Spending on pensions, health and long-term care within the European Union is expected to increase by a factor of three by 2050.  Europeans are important consumers with a combined wealth of more than &euro;3,000 billion.  Older Europeans, including Irish people, will be healthy and active and will participate in employment for longer, contributing their wisdom and experience to value creation.</P>
        <P>With 13% of its current population over 65 years of age, my county of Louth is still a relatively young county.  However, there is an urgency to be smart about ageing if we are to capitalise on emerging opportunities and leverage the county&rsquo;s leading position as the first age-friendly county in Ireland.  As Senator Marie Moloney observed, Louth is part of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s global age-friendly cities network.  I am especially proud to point to it as an example for other counties, cities and towns wishing to adopt an age-friendly agenda.  Louth has a plan for its older people which was developed with them, not for them.</P>
        <P>People are living longer<i>, </i>with life expectancy increasing at two years per decade or five hours per day.  The majority of children born in the developed world this year will live to 100 years of age.  In fact, the first person is already born who will live to be 150.  Older people represent a rapidly increasing percentage of our population, with the 60 plus demographic set to double in size from 11% today to 22% by 2036.  Older people&rsquo;s needs and behaviours are changing fast and we must plan and provide for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to a very useful debate.  The reason I come to this House so often is that, although we may differ in our views, it is always an enjoyable experience because there is a more free-flowing discussion than one gets in the Lower House.  One always has the sense that Members are engaged.  Perhaps my visits here will become a burden at some point in the future, but they are certainly not so at this time.</P>
        <P>I commend the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on this report, which will be one of the tools we take forward as we seek to provide for the needs of older people in a coherent way.  This debate has reinforced my conviction that older people are like any other group of people.  What we have as a diverse group of people when we are younger we carry into later life as we age.  People have different concerns and different ways of living at all stages of their lives.  We must bear in mind at all times in this discussion that only 4.4% of older people, or 22,000, are in full-time nursing care, with the remainder living in the communities where, in many cases, they were born and reared and where they married, worked and raised their families.  We all know these people.  They are part and parcel of what Ireland is and who we are.  As we age, we all develop disabilities, some of them major but, if we are fortunate enough, less serious ones such as failing eyesight or deteriorating hearing.  I am confident we can manage all of this very well.</P>
        <P>What is most important is that there be a recognition of older people&rsquo;s contribution rather than a focus on notions of burden and so on.  My mother lived to 84 years of age and was ill for only one week &mdash; the week before she died &mdash; her whole life.  Whenever I had a problem or required any particular advice &mdash; as the youngest of 11 children, I needed it more than most &mdash; I went to her.  She either told me not to be silly and stop worrying or she advised me to do X, Y or Z.  Older people have a wealth of experience to contribute and I hope each one of us will be able to make that contribution.</P>
        <P>Senator Katherine Zappone and others asked when the positive ageing strategy will be published.  It would have been done by now but for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s request that I concentrate in the first instance on the carer&rsquo;s strategy.  Mine is like any other job.  When the boss asks one to do something, one must do it.  The plan for carers is now completed and we hope to publish it during the summer.  There is a huge amount of work already done in regard to the positive ageing strategy.  When the carer&rsquo;s strategy is brought to Cabinet, the departmental officials, who have not, by the way, been simply shuffling the national ageing plan around, will then do the concentration piece in terms of pulling together the type of consultation that is necessary.  We are convinced we will be in a position to publish it in October.  I am anxious that it be published in 2012, given the year that is in it, but I do not want it to run into the end of November and coming into the Christmas period, which might suggest it had been rushed.  That would not be accurate and would not do it justice.  Our intention, therefore, is to publish early in the last quarter.</P>
        <P>In regard to community-based services, I agree we must begin relocating resources into the community.  The advertisements in respect of the review of the fair deal scheme will be in the newspapers tomorrow.  A sizeable sum of money is involved and we are considering whether we will extend it to community care.  For example, rather than a person having to apply for the fair deal scheme and going into a particular long-stay facility, as good as such facilities are, perhaps that funding could be diverted so that the service is delivered in the person&rsquo;s home or community.  We are working closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in this regard.  Not everybody will be able to spend all of their old age in their own home, but the majority should be able to do so within their community by way of the type of assisted living and decision-making processes we intend to put in place.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, and I are working on that.</P>
        <P>The age-friendly cities, counties, towns and communities initiative offers us a great deal.  It is not a money issue but rather a question of planning and taking into consideration the needs of elderly people when deciding where a bus stop should be located, for example.  It is about consultation and putting together a forum to listen to what people think about their own place.  That is how it comes about.</P>
        <P>In regard to the treaty, there will be an opportunity next year when we hold the Presidency but I cannot give any commitments on that.  It will be a Government decision but it is not something to which I would be opposed.  What is important is the fact we have a President who talks in glowing terms about the contribution people in later life have made to the arts, society and so on.  That is something we need to start to beef up and talk about.  In that context, maybe we could push the agenda out a little bit.</P>
        <P>In regard to legislation on home care, I do not know anyone who could argue about the priorities set in terms of standards, which are children, children in foster care, people with disabilities in residential care and the home care service which will be inspected by HIQA.  The children part is being worked on very actively.  In regard to the disability issue, we hope to have HIQA roll out those standards by the middle of next year.  The home care part should not be too long after that.  I worry sometimes that people only hear half the message.  It will not be about HIQA going into people&rsquo;s homes but about HIQA talking to the service provider.  It will be about language, qualifications, attitudes and so on, which Senator Norris spoke about and which are important.</P>
        <P>We have a new helpline for people who feel they are being abused, and it is working extremely well.  Those types of safeguards are very important.  However, we need to look at other areas.  Last week I had personal experience of someone in later life who got notification for a doctor&rsquo;s appointment six months ago and who would have completely forgotten about it but for the fact we put the date in our mobile telephones.  The statistics show that 25% of people do not turn up for their appointments.  Look at the resources being wasted.  A whole team is waiting for this person to turn up.  Surely we can use technology.  If the older person is not into text messaging and so on &mdash; God knows I have difficulty reading them sometimes &mdash; he or she should nominate someone who is prepared to take on that function, who will receive the text saying that the doctor&rsquo;s appointment is the next day, and who will say it is important he or she shows up.  Let us see where that goes.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, UCD published a report on mental health.  Five years ago, they asked for a large mix of people to volunteer and then they advertised for people who had a persistent and enduring mental health difficulty to get involved in the programme.  Over a five year period, they matched people up and now they have become friends and go to the cinema and go for a cup of coffee.  They do the type of things fully functioning people, if that is what one wants to call them, do not like to do on their own.  What makes us think older people or people with mental health issues want to do things on their own?  That costs nothing.  It is about that sort of mix of research and the effect it had on that group of people.  I see that being translated to older people as it was such a good and well-developed piece of research.</P>
        <P>We will have to take a serious look at the mental capacity legislation or the assisted decision-making capacity legislation.  We took a serious look at the legal capacity issue and title.  According to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, we all have legal capacity.  It is an entirely different process.  Therefore, we had to look at something else.  I would not be opposed to the legislation nor to taking a serious look at the treaty.  It will be about bringing other people along with us.  There are people who advocate in that space who would be as powerful as any politician.  Most of the big changes which happen in society come from outside.  One is lucky if one has someone on the inside who agrees with one and includes it in the legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to speak.  Its report will form part of how we go forward.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012.  The Government appreciates the work done on this issue by the Law Reform Commission, whose landmark report on spent convictions, published in 2007, provided the background research and a solid platform on which to build the robust legal regime this Bill delivers.  The commission&rsquo;s report included a draft Bill that subsequently became the Spent Convictions Bill 2007 and, more recently, the Spent Convictions Bill 2011, a Private Members&rsquo; Bill brought before the D&aacute;il by Deputy Calleary.  While those Bills contained many of the features of this Bill, it is widely recognised they were deficient in a number of key respects.  In drafting the Bill, we have taken on board the views of various interested parties.  I am confident the Bill we are debating today represents a balanced approach that is generous to those offenders who want to leave crime behind them while safeguarding the legitimate interests of society where serious serial criminals are concerned.</P>
        <P>The discourse on the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report and the Bills produced on foot thereof has been marked by its maturity.  I look forward to the same considered approach in this House during the passage of this Bill.  I assure Members that I am open to proposals that would improve the Bill.</P>
        <P>A somewhat unique feature of this legislation is that the changes being made to the original Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s draft Bill are almost all in the direction of what some would say would make the Bill more liberal &mdash; if that is the correct word &mdash; in regard to most of its key provisions.  It is my strong view that if legislation like this is to have any meaningful impact, it must err on the side of generosity to the offender who has paid his or her debt to society, has left criminality behind him and just wants to move on.  The provisions of the Bill are an antidote to recidivism and support the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.  The passage of the legislation will be an important step in the development of an holistic approach to criminal justice.  It fits into a range of reforms in the approach to fines, community service and restorative justice that seeks to focus on the reintegration of offenders once they have made reparations to society.</P>
        <P>Our criminal justice system, to be effective, must be fit for purpose.  It must have the capacity to deter criminality, detect crimes when they occur, prosecute them and impose appropriate sanctions on offenders.  There can be no debate about this but, once a person has paid his or her debt to society, it is very much in society&rsquo;s interest and that of the offender that the latter be reintegrated into society as quickly as possible.  The exclusion of ex-offenders from normal society, and particularly employment, is in no one&rsquo;s interest.  It begets repeat offending and ensures a vicious cycle of interaction with the criminal justice system.  It is costly for the State, society, and the offender himself.  Effectively, no one wins.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an important contribution to reintegration.  It strikes the right balance and does not wipe the slate clean.  Offences remain on the record.  What it does is allow ex-offenders, after a certain period has elapsed since their sentences were imposed, to move on with their lives.  This is particularly important where relatively minor offences committed in one&rsquo;s youth are concerned.  It is worth mentioning that there is an extensive and very generous spent convictions regime already in place for children, under section 258 of the Children Act 2001.  In this Bill, we are putting in place a similar, if somewhat more restrictive, regime for adults.</P>
        <P>I mentioned that the general approach to the drafting of this Bill has been to make it as accessible as possible to those about whom I have spoken.  Having said that, I believe it is broadly agreed that certain convictions can never become spent.  In particular, I propose that convictions secured in the Central Criminal Court and convictions in respect of sexual offences be excluded from the benefits of the legislation.</P>
        <P>Spent convictions legislation has three key variables: sentences eligible to become spent; the length of time a person must remain crime-free before the conviction is deemed spent; and the range of employments covered by the legislation or, alternatively, the ones excluded.  Turning, first, to the sentences eligible to become spent, the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report had recommended that only custodial sentences of six months or less could become spent.  I have reflected on this matter and considered the views of interest groups.  As Senators will see, the Bill provides that prison sentences of 12 months or less are covered by the regime, compared to the six month threshold recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  The 12 month threshold I am proposing would, if they had had no other convictions, have covered 90% of all persons committed to jail in Ireland in 2010.  The remaining 10% who would not have benefited from the legislation are, by definition, persons jailed for serious offences.  I emphasise the legislation is not aimed at these persons.</P>
        <P>The second key variable is the rehabilitation period, that is, the period during which a person must remain conviction-free in order for a conviction to become spent.  The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report provided for a straightforward regime in which non-custodial sentences would attract a five year rehabilitation period and custodial sentences a seven year period.  These periods are too long and the decision to move to include sentences of up to one year requires a graduated approach.  In the legislation I am providing that for custodial sentences of six months or less, the rehabilitation period will be five years; for sentences of between six and nine months, the period will be six years; and for sentences of between nine and 12 months, the period will be seven years.  For non-custodial sentences, the rehabilitation periods will range from three years to five.</P>
        <P>The third variable is the range of excluded employments.  This is a complex area and good arguments can be made for excluding a wide range of employments.  These arguments must, however, be balanced against the fact that if this legislation is to be of material use to those who want to move on to gainful employment, the range of excluded employments must be kept to a minimum.  With this in mind, I have applied a few basic principles to the formulation of the list.  Any employment involving direct or indirect contact with children or vulnerable adults is excluded.  Equally, any employment involving the conduct of the international relations of the State, the administration of justice or the security of the State is excluded.  Outside of this, most employments are covered by the provisions of the legislation.  The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report proposed that the entire civil and public service be excluded.  I have decided against this approach and instead targeted the exclusions at sensitive employments in the Civil Service and provided that other sensitive posts can be added by ministerial order but only on request from the Public Appointments Service, a body of integrity with a well deserved reputation for probity and fairness.  The public service, as a major employer, can be reasonably expected to lead by example in an area of public policy such as this and the Bill follows a middle course that recognises the sensitive nature of certain posts in the public service, while eschewing the tendency to assume that all public service jobs are<i> ipso facto</i> sensitive.</P>
        <P>On excluded employments, even where an employment is excluded, a minor conviction that has no bearing on the employment opportunity on offer should not be held against a person.  Responsible and fair employers should pick the best person for the job and only allow a person&rsquo;s conviction to enter the equation where it is a material consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Both the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust have published commentaries on the Bill in the past week.  Their observations are a valuable input into our deliberations on the Bill and I will give due consideration to the recommendations made by both bodies, many of which overlap.  I can say at this stage that I will be bringing forward amendments to the Bill to address some of the recommendations made in these commentaries.  For example, I intend to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to provide that where a person has a number of qualifying convictions imposed at one court sitting in relation to one incident or event, the convictions may be treated as one order of conviction.  The amendment is aimed, for example, at the person who is convicted of a number of road traffic offences in relation to one incident and who would but for such an amendment have to carry forward all bar two of the convictions for the rest of his or her life.</P>
        <P>The Irish Human Rights Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust also raise the interaction between the Bill and the forthcoming national vetting bureau Bill which will put vetting in relation to positions involving children and vulnerable adults on a statutory footing.  While it is essential that the two Bills work harmoniously, this can be achieved with appropriate cross-referencing between the two, as recommended by the Irish Human Rights Commission.  The primary source of law on the important issue of vetting will be the national vetting bureau Bill and my only concern in relation to this Bill is that it does nothing that will undermine the intent of the vetting Bill.</P>
        <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is the standard provision containing the definitions of terms used in the Bill.  I draw the attention of Senators, in particular, to the definition of &ldquo;excluded conviction&rdquo; as a conviction resulting in a jail sentence of more than one year; a conviction in respect of an offence reserved by law to be tried by the Central Criminal Court; and a conviction in respect of a sexual offence.  The custodial sentences covered by the legislation are listed.  Essentially, the legislation covers any sentence of one year or less, whether imposed as one sentence; as consecutive sentences, totalling one year or less; or as concurrent sentences, the longer or longest of which is one year or less.  Non-custodial sentences are defined as including suspended sentences of up to one year; fines; probation orders; community service orders; and restriction on movement orders.</P>
        <P>Section 2 is a key section of the Bill.  It sets out the circumstances in which a conviction may become spent once a conviction-free period has elapsed.  The Bill is retrospective and applies to all convictions, regardless of when they occurred.  No more than two may become spent.  Subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) provides that a person must have complied fully with any sentence imposed in order to benefit from the scheme.  Subsection (2)(<i>e</i>) provides that where a person has more than two convictions, the first two qualifying convictions, in date order, are the two that can become spent.  I have indicated my intention to bring forward an amendment to cover a situation where a number of convictions are handed down in relation to the one incident or event.</P>
        <P>Section 3 deals with applicable relevant periods, that is, the time that must elapse before a conviction can become spent.  The relevant periods are set out in tables in Schedule 2, Part 1 of which deals with custodial sentences, while Part 2 deals with non-custodial sentences.  Subsection (3) states the relevant period commences on the effective date of conviction which is defined in section 1 as the date the sentence becomes operative.</P>
        <P>Section 4 covers the situation where further convictions are incurred during the relevant period.  While the general position is that the relevant period must be conviction-free in order for the conviction to become spent, provision is made to allow both a first and subsequent relevant conviction to become spent, where the subsequent conviction is incurred during the relevant period for the first conviction.  In this case, the relevant period applying is whichever expires later.  Taking a relatively simple example where a person has a conviction with a three year rehabilitation period and during that three years the person is again convicted of an offence carrying a five year rehabilitation period, in this scenario the rehabilitation period for the first conviction will be extended to the end of the five year period applying to the second conviction and both will become spent together at that time.  The rule in section 2(2)(<i>e</i>) stating no more than two convictions may be deemed spent continues to apply.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides that, in general, a person who has a spent conviction may not be required to disclose it.  Section 6 deals with how spent convictions are to be treated in the course of court proceedings.  Subsection (1) states no evidence of a spent conviction is admissible in court proceedings and that no question can be asked regarding a spent conviction and that, if asked, it need not be answered.  However, subsection (2) provides that a court may require the disclosure of a spent conviction if justice demands it, but it will take whatever steps it deems necessary to prevent or restrict publication.  Subsection (3) sets out a number of situations where a person may be required to disclose a spent conviction: in criminal proceedings where he or she is a party or a witness; in adoption, guardianship or custody proceedings; in proceedings relating to the provision of accommodation, care, training, or schooling for a child or vulnerable adult; or where the person consents to the disclosure.</P>
        <P>Section 7 sets out limitations to the general effect.  Subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) states a person must also disclose a spent conviction to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under questioning following arrest, in an interview with the Criminal Assets Bureau and in an application or during an investigation under Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  Subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) provides that the fact of a conviction being spent under the Bill does not cut across any disqualification, disability, prohibition or penalty otherwise imposed.  Let us take the example of someone who is convicted under the Companies Act and receives a suspended sentence.  He or she may be also disqualified as a company director and this disqualification continues in force regardless of when the conviction becomes spent.</P>
        <P>Section 8 deals with information sought by another state.  As the Bill applies only to Ireland, a person may be still required to disclose convictions if the laws of the state making the request or in respect of which the request is made require disclosure.  This section does no more than restate the law as it stands.  The Oireachtas cannot legislate extraterritorially to provide that our spent convictions regime will apply in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides that certain employments are excluded under the legislation.  Details on the employments concerned are set out in Schedule 3, Parts 1 and 2 of which deal with employments involving children and vulnerable adults, respectively, while Part 3 deals with the civil and public service.  Subsection (2) provides that the Minister may, by order, exclude other positions in the civil and public service at the request of the Public Appointments Service and having consulted with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and any other Minister with an interest in the particular post.</P>
        <P>I explained that we have taken a much more liberal approach to excluded employments than the Law Reform Commission recommended.  My sense from previous debates on the issue in the other House is that there was support for this approach.  However, in a way there is a more important point that goes to the heart of this legislation.  A previous conviction, including one that resulted in the jailing of an individual, should not be a mark on that person for all time in all but the minority of serious cases.  Instead, as a society we should encourage the person to move on and integrate himself or herself into normal society and his or her community.  Employers have a duty to consider everyone who applies for a job on his or her merits.  Where a person is applying for a job in an excluded employment, including in the public service, there is an onus on the employer to take into account only the fact of a conviction, where this is declared, in so far as it calls into question the capacity of the person to carry out the job.  For example, there is a raft of minor convictions that one would have to disclose when applying for a position with children which would not have any bearing on one&rsquo;s fitness to do the job and a prospective employer should not allow his or her judgment to be jaundiced by the fact of a conviction that has no relevance.</P>
        <P>Section 10 mirrors the provisions in section 9 in the case of licences.  Persons applying for certain licences, including public service vehicle, private security, taxi and firearms licences, must disclose their convictions.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides that where a person requests a copy of his or her criminal record from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the record is to be provided in two parts, with the spent convictions provided separately.  This means that in most cases a person who is required to provide a copy of his or her criminal record will be able to produce a clean record, provided that if he or she has been convicted, his or her conviction or convictions are spent.  Sections 12 to 14, inclusive, are general provisions relating to expenses, transitional arrangements and the Short Title.</P>
        <P>In framing this legislation the Government has tried as far as possible to make it accessible to those who may benefit from its provisions.  This is a relatively straightforward, self-administered scheme.  Unlike in other jurisdictions, there is no application process, tribunal to attend, judge to satisfy, bureaucracy or unnecessary cost.  This is the way the process has been designed and I make no apology for keeping it simple and easy to administer.  Obviously, the provisions are most easily explained and understood by a person who has been convicted once of a relatively minor offence more than seven years previously.  Such a person does not need to disclose a conviction when applying for most employments.  It gets more complex for people with multiple convictions, some of which may become spent under the legislation and some of which may not.  With this in mind, we have provided some worked examples in the appendix to the explanatory memorandum.  I have asked my officials to begin preparing a frequently asked questions booklet that will be available on the Department&rsquo;s website once the Bill is enacted.  This frequently asked questionnaire will set out the position in layman&rsquo;s terms for a range of circumstances in which people find themselves and will be added to over time as new scenarios emerge.</P>
        <P>This is a landmark Bill which allows Ireland to join the majority of its European Union partners in providing hope to many people who have felt themselves excluded from society by a past misdemeanour.  It is another tile in the mosaic of measures introduced in recent times to reduce recidivism and to facilitate reintegration into society.  The Bill is targeted at the person who makes a mistake and wants to move on.  It encourages good behaviour but does not provide succour to the repeat offender.  It is a balanced proposal designed to deliver on its principal objectives without incurring unnecessary public expenditure or introducing unnecessary procedural complexity.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party broadly supports the Bill.  Substantial work was done on the framework of the legislation by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the previous Government, Mr. Dermot Ahern.  I note also that the Minister acknowledged the Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Dara Calleary.</P>
        <P>The Bill will bring us close to having a European standard of legislation for dealing with spent convictions for relatively minor matters.  Previous legislation, the Children Act 2001, addresses the issue of spent convictions in section 258.  I am pleased to note the process of having a conviction spent is self-administered and applies to prison sentences of 12 months or less.  I ask the Minister to address a number of queries I have before we proceed to Committee Stage.  I understand certain categories of offences are excluded from the provisions of the Bill, including sexual offences, and I do not have a problem with such exclusions.  I note in the context of reoffending that not more than two convictions may be spent during an individual&rsquo;s life and the conviction free period that must be served before a conviction will become spent ranges from three years for a small fine to seven years for a one year jail sentence.</P>
        <P>As my time is limited, I will raise only two matters which were brought to my attention by individuals in the Cork area.  I forwarded information to the Minister on the cases in question.  The first is a plea from a recovering gambler who has not gambled in 11 years.  I do not propose to name the individual in question.  He got into trouble at the age of 23 years in 2000 when he was in the midst of addiction.  To his eternal shame he took money to which he had access at work and gambled it over a period.  When this was discovered, he was arrested and later received a two year suspended sentence.  He has since turned around his life, repaid every penny he took and become a regular member of his local Gambler Anonymous group.  He has not gambled for 11 years and argues that it is harsh and unfair that his conviction remains on record given that he fell foul of an addiction to gambling at a young age.  Having seen the error and wickedness of his ways, he has, in one sense, expunged his guilt by repaying all the money he took.  I am not making light of his actions.  The individual in question notes that our nearest neighbours in the United Kingdom have recently passed the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act and recommends that the Minister closely examine circumstances such as his conviction.</P>
        <P>Punishment must fit the crime.  However, in my experience sentencing for road traffic and minor criminal offences shows a lack of consistency.  This is an historical problem for which no fault lies with the Minister.    We may be getting closer to a situation where the courts will be inclined to look at precedents, but just as doctors differ and patients die, judges differ in different circumstances also.  Some extraordinary decisions have been made in the courts recently and perhaps the Minister might bear this in mind.   I understand what he said about the time limits and so on, but that man&rsquo;s case seems to be reasonable and fair.  The Minister might look at it and come back to me on it on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I have received another email from a professional legal person, whom I shall not name, but he has some queries on the Bill.  He makes a plea on behalf of a client of his who was convicted a number of years ago for the possession of cannabis.  Somebody he knew was staying in his house as a lodger and had a large supply of cannabis.  As the property owner at the time, even though he was not dealing himself, he was regarded as being in possession of cannabis, for which he received a five year suspended sentence.  He was 20 years old at the time.  He fully acknowledged everything put to him and did not deny that he knew at the time that his friend was storing cannabis in the house.  He has been of good character since and not come to the attention of the Garda, to use the time honoured phrase.  The chief superintendent for the area is prepared to vouch for his integrity and crime free standing.  He now has a family and is in secure employment.  However, he is anxious to further his career which might involve travelling abroad to engage in further training.  The problem is that his conviction would block access to Canada or the United States, and possibly Australia and New Zealand, as the case may be.  Even though he received a five year sentence, the important point is that it was suspended and that it occurred when he was at the tender age of 20 years.  He has since moved on in life.  He was convicted for keeping his mouth shut about something that was of importance to him.  Perhaps the Minister might look at this case also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another Bill I debated vigorously at the time was the fisheries Bill dating from 2006.  Criminal sanctions were introduced for fishermen for log book offences and other relatively minor incursions in terms of quotas.  As a result, some young men and their families would have difficulty even in seeking a temporary visa to travel to the United States.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, assured me that he would look at the possibility of imposing administrative fines for certain fishing offences rather than leaving fishermen with criminal records.  Perhaps the Minister might look at that issue also.  I will again raise with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine the issue of what he proposes to do to update the law.  Some of the fishermen involved feel very aggrieved.</P>

	<P>I will conclude on a matter that will only take me a few seconds to mention.  I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response to the comments of Dr. Maurice Manning of the Irish Human Rights Commission and a former Member of this House.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The grounds of discrimination in the employment equality and equal status legislation should be extended to include discrimination on the basis of a criminal conviction.  Without such a prohibition on discrimination the Spent Convictions Bill may be of little assistance in practice.  Such an anti-discrimination provision would enable the future Human Rights and Equality Commission to consider cases of discrimination based on a person&rsquo;s criminal record.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a strong statement from someone for whom I have great personal admiration.  Perhaps when the Minister is responding, he might allay the fears expressed by Dr. Manning.  I welcome the thrust of the Bill and look forward to a vigorous debate on it and a number of amendments that will be tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Once again I welcome the Minister who has become a very regular visitor to the House.  I also welcome the Bill which is very fair and balanced.  I am reminded of the line in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>:  &ldquo;The quality of mercy is not strained.  It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven&rdquo;.  We need to reflect on the concept of mercy when we debate the justice legislation which flows regularly through the House.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done in his portfolio to date.  He has a difficult balancing act because in the media we read daily accounts of criminal activity, about people being attacked in their homes, vandalism and so on.  There is an obvious public demand that he respond strongly by way of law and order measures.  While we need good and robust law and order measures, we also need justice and a degree of mercy to be shown as part of the equation.  That is provided for in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting to learn from the Minister that 90% of all convictions in a given year carry a 12 month sentence or less.  There is a view that people end up in court and receive significant jail sentences for major crimes, but the statistics show that many crimes are of a relatively minor nature and that the majority of sentences are not of lengthy duration.  Those falling within that category will now be able to take advantage of the Bill.  I welcome this because we have to give people a second chance.  There must be a second chance for people in every walk of life.  In report after report and in debate after debate there is a complaint that so many go back through the revolving doors into prison.  There is a conviction today, a jail sentence tomorrow, a person is out next week and back in the following week.  I know that is an exaggerated view, but, sadly, reoffending is a major problem and obviously we are not succeeding as well as we should be on the issue of rehabilitation.  The Bill is a step on the ladder towards rehabilitation by striking a person&rsquo;s record clear.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to hear this measure described as a form of self-assessment.  The people who will qualify under the legislation will not have to go to the Garda station, back to court or go to a peace commissioner, rather they will be able to take advantage of the legislation themselves.  Certainly, that is to be welcomed.  The sentence categories allowed for within the Bill are very fair and balanced.  The exclusions are also necessary.  We had another debate yesterday on the abuse of children and vulnerable people.  It is important that the Bill excludes persons convicted of such offences.  Therefore, the Minister is striking the right balance.  The waiting period set before a person can have his or her conviction declared spent under the Bill is very fair.</P>
        <P>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan made an interesting point that may not be totally pertinent to the Bill, but it forms part of the equation as it relates to sentencing guidelines.  In some cases, two people might be convicted of the same offence.  One might receive a six or ten month sentence and thus would be able to qualify under the Bill to have the conviction declared spent in due course, but in another courthouse the sentence handed down by another judge could be 13 or 15 months and the person concerned would not qualify.  I appreciate it is a debate for another day.  There seems to be a little difficulty.  Although I do not have the Minister&rsquo;s legal expertise, consistency of sentencing is something on which we must reflect and debate at some future stage.  We will not discuss judicial appointments but judicial training is something the Oireachtas could take on board and debate in some detail in the future.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  As the Minister indicated, he is adopting a slightly more liberal approach than that suggested by the Law Reform Commission.  That is not a bad thing.  The Minister is introducing fairness and a second chance into the equation.  That must be welcomed.  Our aspiration must be that everyone convicted of a crime in this country will get every assistance possible to ensure they will not commit further crime.  I refer to the probation and welfare service and where it applies in the Prison Service that the concept of rehabilitation and getting a second chance for a new beginning will always be available and will always be a strong and positive option.  The legislation is a small part of the equation.  I am sure there is much more we need to do but I welcome the legislation.  Other political parties have worked in the same direction and if they introduced the same type of proposal I am sure it would get unanimous support in the House.  I look forward to the Bill being passed speedily.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House and the Bill before the House.  It is five years since the publication of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report in 2007.  My understanding is that this country is the only remaining jurisdiction in the European Union and one of the very few in the Council of Europe area without a spent convictions scheme for adult offenders.  That is regrettable given the negative and far-reaching consequences the present system has for ex-offenders, their families and society in the long run.  The majority of convictions passed by Irish courts are for minor and non-violent offences which incur short prison sentences, fines or community-based sanctions, yet in the absence of a spent convictions regime, those individuals face serious restrictions and barriers in employment, training, education, travel, taking out insurance and, therefore, buying their own home, setting up bank accounts and many other areas.</P>
        <P>Family members are also directly impacted.  I know of a woman who has encountered serious difficulty securing home insurance because her son who has a criminal conviction is living in the family home.</P>
        <P>I heard a story recently from the Irish Penal Reform Trust of the devastating consequences of a criminal conviction that could not be expunged.  The person whom the story concerned was called Siobh&aacute;n:</P>
        <P LI="1">I shoplifted a bar of chocolate and was caught by shop security.  I was so afraid I could not tell my name.  I have never been in trouble as a kid.  If a teacher gave out to me I cried and the thought of being in trouble with the law scared me to pieces.  Security said that if I did not co-operate they would call the guards.  I didn&rsquo;t and so they did.  I was arrested and I appeared in court.  I ended up with a &euro;20 fine for theft.  I felt this has impacted me beyond belief.  It was seven years ago and I still feel as bad as I did then.  While it may seem small in the wider world of criminal justice this offence has affected me tremendously.  I was excluded from working with a community project for refugee women that I was interested in becoming involved in because of it, not to mention the many care assistant jobs I could not apply for as the recruiter was seeking to only hire somebody with a clean record.  I made a mistake and no one is more sorry than me.  The stigma has sometimes led to my feeling deeply distressed and unable to cope.  Expungement would grant me the self-forgiveness I would need to move on with my life.  I am not a bad person, just someone who because of a lack of support coping abilities at a hard time in her life lost her way.  It makes me sad because our system by not having spent sentences does not recognise change and so is not really rehabilitative in the way it claims to be.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the type of story we are trying to address with this Bill.  The current situation does not allow Siobh&aacute;n and the thousands of others in her shoes to wipe the slate clean and neither is it just or equitable.  Furthermore, by hindering the rehabilitation and reintegration back into society of those who have served custodial sentences, we are creating a recipe for re-offending.  If our system does not allow for individuals to put their past behind them, what incentive is there for them to do so?</P>
        <P>I very much welcome, therefore, the introduction of the Bill.  It is long overdue.  I welcome the fact it has built positively upon the proposals contained in the Law Reform Commission report in 2007 by raising the maximum limit from six months to 12 months imprisonment and by shortening the conviction period of five to seven years down to three to seven years.  The original proposals were far too conservative and restrictive.  I am concerned, however, that the new proposals do not go far enough to deliver on the main purpose of the Bill, which is set out in the explanatory memorandum as being to assist the rehabilitation of offenders who often experience difficulties securing employment as a result of having a conviction.</P>
        <P>I note with considerable interest the recent developments in the UK spent convictions arrangements and a review of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 by the Ministry of Justice in 2011 judged the limit of 30 months sentences to be too restrictive.  In response, the UK Government through the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 has reformed the relevant sections of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act by setting the limit at 48 months.  This is four times the limit we propose in the Bill.  The UK has had a 40 year head start on us with spent convictions legislation.  During that time the Ministry of Justice has strived to strike the appropriate balance between public safety and reducing barriers to reintegration for those who have moved on from offending behaviour.  We have an opportunity to capitalise on what the UK has learned.</P>
        <P>I also note in the UK legislation that the conviction-free or rehabilitative period is at the lowest end of the spending scale &mdash; two years.  That seems sensible given that Home Office research into reconviction rates suggests that if an individual has not offended in the first two years he or she is at equal risk of future offending as someone without a previous conviction.  The length of time required for rehabilitation must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence committed but it should not be so long as to constitute an additional and disproportionate punishment, nor should it discourage ex-offenders from moving on from their offending behaviour.</P>
        <P>There is merit in the calls for a hybrid model whereby anti-discrimination provisions are incorporated into the Bill.  That is a model of incorporation adopted in many Australian and Canadian territories and is recommended in the current Bills in New Zealand.  The personal testimonies I have read are irrefutable evidence of discrimination in employment, education and access to goods and services on the basis of a criminal conviction.  Such discrimination must be addressed in some form.  What we are doing today is a good and strong start.</P>
        <P>I have listened closely to what the Minister has said and I will take time between this and Committee Stage to consider my position with respect to the blanket exclusion of certain categories of employment, in particular for those working with children and how that interacts with the national vetting bureau Bill.  I will propose amendments on Committee Stage if I consider they are warranted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister to the House.  I congratulate him on the general direction in which he is taking the justice system.  The Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Bill recognised the importance of using prison as a last resort and this Bill is a step in a similar direction.  The Minister&rsquo;s announcement on Limerick Prison is very welcome.  We are all well aware that our current prison system is not exactly fit for a modern-day society and it shames us.</P>
        <P>It is a bit of a misnomer, however, to use the title, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill.  The fundamental problem with the Bill is that it does not expunge criminal records.  The Minister stated that it does not wipe the slate clean and that offences remain on the record but what it does do is allow ex-offenders, after a certain period has elapsed, to move on with their lives, so to speak.  I would regard it as a bit like the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; type of situation in the army in the United States whereby if a person is gay, the argument is that one does not ask and one does not tell.  I am somewhat concerned that this legislation is a little bit along similar lines.  Were I to ask the Minister one question, it would be to explain to the House why he did not go down the route of expunging the criminal record entirely.  The current position is a half-light.  One might even call this the &ldquo;disregarding convictions in certain circumstances Bill&rdquo;.  While we must try to weigh the difficulties the Minister faces in terms of media approaches to people with criminal records and the incitement to hatred in the public domain, given fearful headlines about criminals being let loose on society, I am concerned by the extensive exceptions in the Bill, for example, when working with children.  Under no circumstances would the sentences covered by the Bill encompass the type of sentence one might incur for having molested a child, etc.  Why would someone with a criminal record for the non-payment of a television licence fee or some other minor conviction not be eligible for this type of disregard?  The Minister stated that responsible and fair employers should pick the best person for the job and only allow a person&rsquo;s conviction to enter the equation when it is a material consideration.  We would love it if employers always behaved appropriately, but we have an entire body of law to ensure that they do because circumstances arise in which they do not.</P>
        <P>We live in a modern age in which electronic media is used in a way not envisaged by the bulk of law when the criminal justice system was established in the 19th century.  People can discover a wide range of information about other people without their consent.  A self-administered system that does not expunge the record of offences will leave people vulnerable to electronic surveillance and electronic disclosures.</P>
        <P>I am stating the obvious, as the Minister is well aware of my next point.  We are discussing minor crimes.  In 2009, 3,601 sentence committals were for road traffic offences and represented one third of the total number of committals.  Some 20.8% of sentence committals in 2009 were for offences against property without violence.  Although crime rates have decreased, the number of prison sentences quadrupled between 1980 and 2010.  Therefore, the number of people to whom this legislation is relevant has increased.</P>
        <P>Let us be realistic, in that this is a class issue.  Teenagers or people in their early 20s might go on the rampage after a night of drinking and a little bit of committing property damage.  I am not trying to undermine this type of offence, but the average prisoner in Mountjoy Prison is statistically likely to be a 28 year old male, with a 16% chance his father went to prison, a 44% chance a sibling served time, only a 7% likelihood he stayed in school after the age of 16 years, a 40% chance he suffers some form of psychological condition, and a 79% chance he is an intravenous drug user.  Many authorities, including the school of criminology at UCD, agree there is a link between deprivation and the likelihood of committing a crime.  Some 60% of people serving sentences of six months&rsquo; duration or less are poor and have often experienced homelessness.  If we want to give vulnerable people in society a chance, we must be realistic about what that chance is.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction, but I would be interested to know why the Minister did not go down the road of expunging sentences entirely.  When people have served their punishments, we should cease the practice of discriminating against them.  The best way to do so is to clean their records.  I do not mean this in the context of non-disclosure, but in terms of cleaning their records entirely.  I am sure the Minister has received papers on the same statistics.  Some 225 college courses offered through the CAO require Garda vetting.  Some may include social work elements.  For someone coming from a deprived community who wants to do social work within a deprived community, especially with children, surely it would be better for him or her to be allowed to do so.  Will the Minister reconsider the exemption on working with children?  If an offence is not a serious one concerning a child, why should disclosing it be obligatory?  Minor offences such as failing to pay for a television licence should not be barriers to employment in the case of, for example, driving a taxi.  I refer in particular to vulnerable people who have experience of the prison system.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation.  It is a step in the right direction, but will the Minister go further?  In the electronic age, the choice not to self-disclose is not a sufficient protection for people with convictions.  They would be better served by having their entire records expunged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  As an employer, I initially and sceptically questioned whether it was wise legislation.  I used to entrust new employees with responsibilities that I would not have given them had I known their histories.  One person had a bad history, but we did not check up on it.  As an employer, I would have liked to have known whether employees had records.</P>
        <P>Having read the Bill and listened to the Minister and Senator van Turnhout, who referred to how a person she called Siobh&aacute;n took a bar of chocolate and was left with a record, I realise the legislation must change.  This Bill is necessary, as it would help people to return to work.  Having minor convictions on record can be a sizeable barrier to employment.  People may become frustrated.  In the worst case scenarios, they may turn to crime or suffer health problems.  Employment is key to putting people back on the right track.  A record affects employment, training, education, travel and taking out insurance, which means people can face barriers to owning homes.</P>
        <P>The Minister explained the Bill well.  Should society be judged on how it treats criminals, be they people who made mistakes or committed crimes deliberately and who will consequently suffer for the rest of their lives?  We are creating a pool of unemployed people who will have no other option but to live on State benefits.</P>
        <P>Recently, the UK Secretary of State for Justice, Mr. Kenneth Clarke, told up to 40 retailers that they should recruit more people fresh from prison.  When I read his comments, I wondered whether a retailer would employ someone who was straight out of prison over someone who had never been to prison.  Mr. Clarke encouraged them to set up training courses in prisons.  A similar scheme was being run by a locksmith and engraving specialist.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Getting somebody into a steady job upon release from prison is one of the most successful ways of getting them to stop reoffending.  With support from organisations like Timpson, we can make a real difference to the lives of prisoners and their families and above all, a reduction in the victims of crime.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Does the Minister agree that there should be such private sector links?  Should we do more to foster this work?  Having a job plays a large role in breaking the cycle of reoffending and having taxpaying individuals would be a better alternative.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Another recommendation is that 25% of prisoners&rsquo; gross salaries should go to victims funds, while the remainder of their wages should be used to support dependants or as savings ahead of their release.  What about the proposals regarding the making of payments to prisoners?  I ask this question in the context of the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s introduction of a new gratuity regime to reward inmates for good behaviour, while penalising those who are disruptive or refuse to engage with rehabilitative services.  We should also ensure everyone convicted of a criminal offence is made aware of the new legislation and offered information and guidance on the long-term impact of having a conviction.  Could a person be informed by letter?  How does the Minister intend to address this issue?</P>
        <P>It has been mentioned that Ireland is the only country that does not have legislation to let criminal convictions lapse after a certain period.  From that point of view, the Bill is welcome.  By introducing it, we are incentivising people to stay clean, that is, there will be a reward for not committing further crimes.  As the Minister explained, this is an essential element.  If we continue to label someone as a criminal for the rest of his or her life, it will influence his or her behaviour.  We need to remove labels and allow people to move on.</P>
        <P>As has been pointed out by the Irish Human Rights Commission, a conviction may be declared spent &mdash; that is a good word &mdash; for the purposes of the Bill, but information on the existence of the conviction will still be available to employers under the vetting Bill.  This seems to be a significant contradiction which will result in barriers for persons convicted of even minor offences who want to return to work.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the length of time a conviction will remain on record.  It is not appropriate to have a minor offence or fine on someone&rsquo;s record for up to seven years.  Should the commitment in court not to reoffend not count?  The report of the Irish Penal Reform Trust reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">While the limit of 12-months as the maximum sentence to which the legislation will apply is an improvement on the 6-months originally proposed, IPRT believes the Bill should extend to at least 30 months.  (In the UK, a 2011 review of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (1974) judged the limit of 30 month sentences to be too restrictive.)</P>
        <P FLI="0">The UK example is interesting, in that, under a proposed reform of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, the time after which the convictions of medium-term prisoners would be declared spent would be reduced from ten years to four, while the convictions of short-term prisoners serving sentences of up to six months would be declared spent after two years instead of seven.  This reform would cover thousands of persons recently fined or ordered to serve community sentences.  They would no longer need to declare their criminal records after one year instead of the existing five.  In the United Kingdom a fine would be declared spent one year after being handed down, while a jail term of up to six months would be declared spent two years after the end of the sentence.  We should seek to follow this example and help to wipe an offender&rsquo;s slate clean earlier.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</P>
        <P>We all know that some young people go astray for a number of reasons, including the challenge of growing up.  Should we be more lenient on a 17 year old who stole a bicycle and did not know any better?  Should we seek to reduce the length of time minor offences are on record for this age group?  This might result in them standing a better chance of finding work and turning their lives around.  We must try to brighten a younger person&rsquo;s prospects and not end them before they begin.</P>
        <P>How does the issue of the publication of convictions relate to archives and online sources which include thousands of reports on trials and convictions?  Do people have the right to wipe them clean?  It is all well and good that an employer would not see the minor conviction during the hiring process, but he or she could Google a name.  This is a complicated matter to which I do not have the answer.  There will be a challenge to this provision.  I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s opinions on the matters of privacy and convictions.</P>
        <P>Before the Minister of State entered the Chamber, I mentioned that, although I was initially concerned about this legislation, I had come to support and agree with it.  However, there are questions to which I would like answers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach ar&iacute;s.  She is present almost as often as the Cathaoirleach.  It is remarkable that she has been present twice on the one day.</P>
        <P>This legislation is long overdue and was recommended by the Law Reform Commission in 2007.  Even then its recommendation was long overdue.</P>
        <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Aideen Hayden&rsquo;s contribution.  She has stolen my thunder to a great extent, as I agree with many of her sentiments.  As public representatives, each of us has dealt with difficult situations involving 18 or 19 year olds who had gone off the rails.  They might have been considered adults legally and technically, but they were not adults mentally.  In many cases, they were charged with minor offences.  In one case a young man in his first week in university was kicking a football on the Stillorgan dual carriageway when he was arrested by the Garda.  He was too scared about telling his parents to obtain proper legal advice.  He was charged and paid a fine of &euro;200.  Ten years down the road he applied for a job in his chosen career in the film industry.  He was offered a placement in Canada, but he could not enter the country because his conviction had raised its head.  His record in the intervening ten years was clean.  His family was devastated and he has not got over the incident, despite the fact that nearly 20 years have since passed.  It is a travesty that a career was destroyed by a prank during his time as a freshman in university.</P>
        <P>I listened to the story told by Senator Jillian van Turnhout while I was in my office.  Such issues must be addressed.  This legislation is a step in the right direction.  When a sentence is for less than 12 months, a person should not be criminalised for not declaring it after a certain period has passed.  If someone who was charged ten years ago for not having a television licence is subject to a Garda check when he or she applies for a taxi licence, that incident should not appear on his or her Garda clearance documents, nor should he or she be denied a public service vehicle licence.</P>
        <P>We need to be fair and realistic.  As a society, we need to show a certain degree of empathy and forgiveness.  Like Senator Ivana Bacik, I am a member of the Sub-Committee on Penal Reform which is doing great work.  There are many good developments and I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, for their work in this regard.  Even this week there has been an announcement of an upgrade of Limerick Prison which is badly needed.  Recently I attended Mountjoy Prison and it is heartening to see the investment taking place there.  Slopping out will be a thing of the past in a couple of years.  It is a gradual and incremental process, but basic human rights prevail in Irish prisons.</P>
        <P>This legislation will assist those who have gone to prison, done their time and mended their ways.  Society must work with people like them and in doing so there is a better chance they will not reoffend.  When an individual has mended his or her ways through a prison sentence, society must meet him or her halfway.  I commend the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister for bringing forward this common-sense legislation after only 16 months in office.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is present for the debate, her second time to be in the House today.  I hope this becomes a habit because she is one of the Ministers with more common sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the officials from the Department of Justice and Equality.  I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, for bringing the Bill into the House as quickly as he has.  I also commend the officials for their work on this detailed and comprehensive legislation.  The Bill, however, should be amended by Members because there is a tremendous and experienced pool in this House.  As I was in the Minister of State&rsquo;s seat many times before, I understand this.  I was anxious to amend Bills at the time and know the Minister of State is also of that opinion.</P>
        <P>Interesting contributions have been made to the debate.  I have noted the examples given of the effect this legislation will have on a person who committed a minor offence at a young age and thereby remove a lifelong burden.  Seven years is a long time to pay after finishing a sentence.  If a person reoffends, he or she is in serious trouble.  It is a great incentive for someone with a minor criminal offence to ensure it never happens again.</P>
        <P>Will the record of an offence covered by this legislation be removed from the PULSE system?  I understand someone with a minor offence must decide if he or she qualifies to avail of the spent conviction provision.  The Minister has given examples of how the system will work in the explanatory memorandum.  Would it not be preferable to have a certificate from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stating the conviction is spent?  I know this would put extra work on the Department, but no one would object to paying a small or reasonable fee to cover whatever costs would be involved.</P>
        <P>The Minister has stated there are certain jobs for which persons with a spent conviction may not qualify to apply, one being the Garda reserve.  However, that should not be the case.  It is a significant decision to inform a person he or she cannot serve in a particular position because of some minor offence committed in their youth.  When I was first elected to the Oireachtas, I came across the case of a person who had applied to join the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but he was deemed unsuitable because his uncle was selling <i>An Phoblacht</i> at the time.  At the time <i>An Phoblacht</i> was neither profitable nor popular, but it has become so now.  Sinn F&eacute;in was not in the same position it is in today.  I went to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister on this outrageous action taken against the individual in question to have the matter resolved.</P>
        <P>This is good and practical legislation which I am delighted to see being introduced.  The views expressed in the House today are very sincerely held by experienced Members.  I know the Minister of State and her officials, in particular, will take them into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the opportunity to debate this long overdue legislation which has been broadly welcomed.  I am also pleased it has been introduced in the Seanad first.</P>
        <P>The need for a statutory framework for the rehabilitation of offenders has long been recognised by those working in the criminal justice system.  I must declare an interest as I am a practising criminal barrister.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, referred to a 2007 Law Reform Commission report which provided draft legislation on spent convictions.  There has been legislation in place covering the rehabilitation of offenders in England for some time.  The Minister stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Obviously, the provisions are most easily explained and understood by a person who has been convicted once of a relatively minor offence more than seven years ago.  That person does not need to disclose a conviction when applying for most employment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This legislation will make a significant difference for persons in such circumstances.</P>
        <P>Members gave testimonies of individuals.  Like many others, I have met individuals in the political system who have been debarred from applying for different jobs or undertaking different career courses because of a minor conviction in the past.  This legislation will be an aid and a comfort for the people concerned.</P>
        <P>In my work as a criminal lawyer I have come across the real problem presented by old convictions.  Where it becomes most apparent is where one is representing an individual charged with another offence 15 or 20 years after committing a minor offence.  Until the Children Act was introduced, even if one had committed a very minor public order offence as a child, it was still on one&rsquo;s record.  The Children Act helped by providing for the expunging of records for offences committed when people are minors but it did not help people who committed very minor public order offences when 18 or 19 and who then had a clean slate for ten or 20 years before being brought up on another minor offence.  That would not be a first offence in that case.  The consequence in the very practical criminal law world is that the Probation of Offenders Act can no longer be applied and people cannot receive the benefit of the Act.  In other words, instead of the judge indicating the conviction is found but not recorded, it would show up.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s point that the scheme he is introducing is a straightforward, self-administered scheme which does not expunge the record but removes the duty to disclose for all but certain employment after the relevant period has passed.  Senator Leyden raised one of the issues I have with the practical side, which is how this works with PULSE.  It is clear a person convicted of a minor offence seven years ago no longer has to disclose that conviction when applying for a job, but what happens when we are not dealing with self-administration?  For example, a person may apply for a visa to work in the US and the American immigration authorities would seek the PULSE record of that person from the Garda.  Is that a spent conviction?  Perhaps I missed how that issue would be dealt with in the Bill.  A second point relates to sentencing procedures.  In practice, judges will take a minor conviction from years ago in a way to prevent an offender having the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, so will that still be the case in respect of spent convictions under this Bill?</P>
        <P>Those are the more detailed questions on the Bill&rsquo;s operation.  I very much welcome it and it has long been called for.  Senator Hayden made some excellent points about the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; analogy and how the Bill does not go far enough.  It is something of a missed opportunity, although I fully accept the argument that the Bill goes further than what was recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  I welcome the fact the Minister has raised the threshold to 12 months from six months, which is very important, but he could have gone further.  We could have extended the sentencing threshold, and the Irish Human Rights Commission has stated the rehabilitation periods are too long, with shorter periods maximising the possibility of rehabilitation and re-integration.  Similarly, the Irish Penal Reform Trust suggested the Bill could and should go further in the interests of rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>Others made points about the impact of the vetting bureau Bill, which we dealt with in the justice committee.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcements that he will take on board some of the recommendations of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust, with amendments to be brought forward on Committee Stage.  I look forward to debating those.  I ask the Minister to consider going a little further and making the Bill even less restrictive in terms of facilitation of the re-integration of offenders into society.  I fully appreciate the commitment of the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to rehabilitation of offenders, and it is a very important goal for us to have in the shaping of a criminal justice system.  We are glad to see it being very clearly expressed today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House and I give a broad welcome to the publication of the Bill.  I am in favour of this type of legislation as part of a package of re-integration of former prisoners into society.  The Bill provides for a non-disclosure regime whereby certain convictions are considered spent or do not have to be disclosed to a prospective employer after a set period of conviction-free living, defined as the rehabilitation period.  This Bill is a long time coming and is long overdue, although we welcome that it has been published.  In Britain there have been spent conviction laws since the 1970s, so it seems we are a long way behind some other European countries.  The fact we have been waiting so long for this legislation is an issue in itself, but I welcome its publication.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice and Equality spoke about the liberal nature of some of this Bill, and I could describe myself as liberal in some respects.  I see the primary objective of general justice policy not to be solely about punishment but rather rehabilitation, and I am sure the Minister of State would agree with that.  The primary focus and objective of any justice policy should be to reduce crime, offending and re-offending.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is primarily to ensure that minor offences will not follow an individual for his or her life or hinder a person in gaining employment.  Getting people into gainful employment is crucial in tackling recidivism and offers an incentive to individuals to prove they are reformed and can get back to being a productive member of society.  It therefore offers an incentive to avoid crime.  A range of barriers to inhibit the rehabilitation and re-integration of ex-prisoners, in particular, has been an issue not just for ex-prisoners but for all people with past convictions.  Studies have indicated that 48% of employers would not take on somebody with a criminal record, and a survey carried out by the Small Firms Association indicated that between 76% and 87% of firms would not employ an ex-offender.  We heard earlier from Senator Quinn about his experience with the issue.  Such issues can hold back some individuals from gaining meaningful employment, and there have been examples of the effects of minor convictions acting as a barrier to employment.  Nobody would want to see that.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the majority of sentences handed down in the courts are of this nature.  The proportion of sentences of up to 12 months accounted for 78% of all sentences in 2007 and 80% of sentences in 2011.  We have concerns about some of the detail of the Bill, and these are similar to some of those highlighted by Senator van Turnhout and others.  We will consider tabling a number of amendments in this area.</P>
        <P>We support the exclusion of offences where an offender wishes to work with children or vulnerable adults or where a sexual offence has been committed.  We are concerned that limiting this to offences which incurred a maximum of one year is unduly narrow.  The nature of this exemption from the spent conviction regime should be offence relevant.  Where the nature of a past conviction is not relevant after a rehabilitation period, we should not present employers and others with an unwarranted opportunity to discriminate.</P>
        <P>I also note some of the points raised by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, and a number of Senators have highlighted the waiting periods for the convictions to be spent, along with the limits on the sentences to which this legislation applies.  Our party criticised the 2007 Bill for its conservatism and we welcome that this Bill is, as the Minister stated, liberal in its approach.  We also note the limiting period in the application of such legislation was six months, which was too great.  This Bill improves this, extending the period to 12 months, although the Irish Penal Reform Trust recommends 30 months.  In the UK the period is two years and there may be room for improvement in amendments that could be accepted by the Minister.  The waiting time of three to seven years represents an improvement on original proposals, but the Irish Penal Reform Trust is also of the view that these could be shortened to two to four years, and the periods in the UK are shorter.  There are also a number of European examples, and perhaps the area could be examined.</P>
        <P>Under the Children Act 2001, an 18 year old who commits a once-off minor offence may have this conviction hanging over him or her until the age of 27, as the seven year rehabilitation period dates from the conviction, which takes place up to two years after the offence is committed.  This is a valid point and we should not allow the mistakes of a young person hang over him or her.</P>
        <P>We are 14 years on from the Good Friday Agreement and there are many former political prisoners with convictions we believe should be expunged.  I know the Minister has indicated he will consider the matter, perhaps with separate legislation, at some time in future.  It would be helpful as part of the conflict resolution process we all support.  It concerns not just prisoners associated with the IRA but also from a number of other organisations.  Those records should be examined and expunged, depending on circumstances.  The issue should be considered by the Government.</P>

	<P>Records will remain on PULSE when a person emigrates to the USA.  Most countries require a person to disclose all convictions, including spent convictions, and we have no control over that.  We cannot tell other countries what to ask for.</P>
        <P>On sentencing in court cases, the prosecution can refer to previous convictions despite the fact they are covered by this legislation.  There was a suggestion a person could apply to the Garda for a certificate but that provision already exists and the Bill provides that where a person requests his record, the spent convictions will be provided separately.  There would be two certificates.  In reply to Senator Leyden, we were hoping to stay away from that process on the basis that we do not want people going into the system again, but I understand hispoint.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice and Equality had to leave because he has been busy in recent days and he asked me to respond and to express his gratitude for the support Members of the House have given to the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill.  As the Minister said when he addressed the House earlier, this historic legislation is at one with other initiatives aimed at making our criminal justice system work better for society.  We want to reduce crime and see offenders caught and brought to justice.  We want them to undergo whatever sanctions the courts impose, not from any desire for revenge but to ensure those who offend against society pay their debt for doing so.  When the debt has been paid, however, it is in all our interests that those people do not re-offend and are reintegrated into society as quickly as possible.  Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comment that it could be an incentive not to re-offend is well made.</P>
        <P>This is an important Bill that resonates with Members on all sides of the House.  Those of us in public life have met countless numbers of people whose lives have been blighted by some misdemeanour committed many years previously.  We all know decent people who want to move on but feel they will never get an even break when they admit to a conviction, no matter how minor or how long ago.  This Bill has the potential to remove the ball and chain a criminal record can represent to people.  Even when everyone else has moved on, the person still feels a cloud hangs over him.  This is the case even where the cloud relates to a minor misdemeanour that occurred a generation ago.  There is a sense, and I am sure Members have encountered this when dealing with the public, that the stain of a criminal record is indelible.  While we might wish for a more enlightened society where a person is judged on his own merits, the concern, legitimate or otherwise, of the person is that he will never get a fair chance.</P>
        <P>The contributions to this debate have been both thoughtful and thought-provoking.  Those contributions have recognised the overall positive aspects of the Bill and understandably have raised questions about its discretionary aspects, such as the length of sentences covered, the length of the rehabilitation periods and the exclusions related to employment.  In each of these areas, the Minister has tried to strike a balance between the competing interests of the offender and society.  There is no right answer in the sense that where the line is drawn is a matter of judgement.  Spent conviction regimes, where they exist across the globe, vary widely.  In some jurisdictions, such as New Zealand, only non-custodial sentences are covered.  This means that who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, no matter how short, can never have that conviction disregarded.  In addition, the rehabilitation period for all convictions is seven years.  Meanwhile in various Australian states, the sentences covered range from six months to 30 months, with a ten year rehabilitation period.</P>
        <P>While Britain has recently reformed its regime to make it one of the more liberal, with shorter rehabilitation periods and covering longer sentences, the scheme outlined in this Bill places Ireland at the more generous end of the international spectrum.  The safe option would have been to follow the Law Reform Commission recommendations.  Instead, the Government made the conscious decision to make the scheme accessible to the greatest number of ex-offenders, consistent with the protection of society at large.</P>
        <P>A defining feature of this Bill is that the scheme is self-administered.  This means individuals can establish for themselves whether they qualify, and once they have done so they can choose whether to declare a past conviction, as the case may be.  The alternative of an application-based system as applies in many countries would involve costly administration for the State and the individual and would in many ways negate the positive aspects of the Bill.  The ordeal of having to make a case before a judge to have a conviction declared spent could deter some from availing of the scheme.  It is arguably counter-intuitive to force people back into the justice system to escape from it.  Instead, we are providing a system where people, in the privacy of their homes, can determine whether they qualify.  To my mind that is one of the more appealing aspects of the scheme and one that will recommend itself to those who wish to avail of it.</P>
        <P>None of this is to say the Bill cannot be improved, and the Minister said he is open to all proposals that will improve it.  He will be bringing forward a small number of amendments on Committee Stage to address some gaps in the Bill, and he looks forward to hearing suggestions as to how the Bill might be improved.  Coming at this later than most of the rest of the western world has its advantages.  We have their experiences on which to draw and we have been especially fortunate to have the Law Reform Commission report to guide our work.  I pay tribute to the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust for their work and whose commentaries on the LRC report were taken into account in the drafting of this Bill.  The Irish Human Rights Commission has also issued observations on the Bill this week and these will be considered as it progresses through the Houses.  From the reaction to the Bill, both in this House and from members of the public, we are satisfied the legislation addresses many of the concerns of people and will allow the majority of law-abiding people to get on with their lives.</P>
        <P>There are some who have turned over a new leaf but the seriousness of whose crimes means they will not benefit under the Bill.  People convicted of sex offences, people sentenced to more than 12 months in prison and people tried in the Central Criminal Court do not benefit under the Bill.  The line has to be drawn somewhere and the reality is the provisions in the Bill go much further than the Law Reform Commission recommended, by doubling the length of sentence covered from six months to one year.  By our estimate, in excess of 90% of custodial sentences handed down by the courts are covered, as well as all non-custodial sentences with the exception of suspended sentences of more than one year.  While it is difficult to put exact figures on this, it is almost certainly the case that in excess of 95% of all sentences are covered by this spent convictions regime.  By any standards, that is the majority of sentences and, except for the serial offenders, the majority of people convicted in our courts.</P>
        <P>While the focus of this legislation is on offenders and their rehabilitation, we must never forget the victims of crime.  That we might address the plight of ex-offenders is not to suggest in any way that we are any less concerned for victims of crime.  Those who commit crimes must be caught, prosecuted and convicted.  They must pay their debt to society and, in appropriate cases, to the victims of their crimes.  This Bill does not deduct from these principles one iota, but once that debt has been paid and once a reasonable crime-free period has elapsed, society has an interest in allowing the person to move on and contribute fully to society &mdash; no more, no less.</P>
        <P>I again express my appreciation and that of the Minister for the general welcome the House has given the Bill.  I assure Senators that all their suggestions as to how the Bill might be improved will be considered and we look forward to a more detailed discussion of the Bill an Committee Stage.  We may have opinions on whether we could have been more liberal or more restrictive, but this is the Bill as proposed.  It will be amended and there will be a broader discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Business Undertakings (Disclosure of Overpayments) Bill 2012: Second Stage</Title>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  This proposal arises from the need for ethics and transparency regarding overpayments which occur in the course of business transactions.  The Bill does not seek radically to alter how business is done or essentially to create new rights where there is none.  Rather, it seeks to address an issue which presents a real difficulty and potential injustice in regard to the question of overpayments.  The background to the Bill is relatively simple.  In a business transaction where one party, whether a private individual or a company, overpays another, there is no statutory obligation on the party receiving the overpayment to give notice of the fact to the payer or return the payment unasked.  Statute law has been strangely silent on the matter.  There are instances where the recipient will duly notify the person who overpaid or where the overpaying party discovers the error and promptly seeks a refund.  However, there are many instances where there is not this beneficial outcome, either through a deliberate intention of the recipient to exploit the situation or for incidental reasons.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The common law terms an overpayment which is not returned or otherwise disposed of correctly between the parties as unjust enrichment and the description is apt.  The party that receives the overpayment has certainly been enriched, but the enrichment is not one which can be justified.  The common law allows in principle a claim for restitution based on moneys had and received<i>. </i> However, the route of a civil claim is hardly a desirable one and will be costly and protracted.  It cannot even be embarked upon unless one knows of the overpayment and it may not be effective in terms of timeframe if delay means a greater risk of inability to repay on the part of the recipient.  In short, dealing with the matter solely within the confines of the common law is inadequate.  Statutory regulation focusing primarily on requirements of disclosure and a duty of co-operation is the preferred and necessary route.  Such a path would provide a balance of rights for all parties and promote fair outcomes.</P>
        <P>Overpayments in the course of business are common and occur for many reasons.  Among the more obvious instances are inadvertently paying the same invoice twice or simple calculation errors.  They also extend to situations where there is no physical transfer of cash but where credits due are not taken, resulting in loss to one party and unjust enrichment for the other.  The multiplicity of trade transactions taking place daily, ranging from the complex electronic payment runs of large companies to a farmer paying his or her bills to a local co-operative, for example, contains innumerable possibilities for overpayment to occur.  Legislative provision which affords protection to an overpaying party and instills confidence that the matter will not be exploited would be of real benefit to all who make payments for goods or services.  The Bill, it should be noted, would extend to all overpayments made in the course of business transactions, irrespective of whether the payment was made by an individual or incorporated entity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is useful to consider an example of how an overpayment can be treated in a way that is grossly opportunistic.  Let us say a small trader accidentally duplicates payment of an invoice for &euro;5,000 to a supplier.  He or she has not reconciled a statement from his or her largest supplier and makes the overpayment as he or she rushes to achieve a month-end payment deadline.  The supplier has a policy of saying nothing about excess payments and of leaving them on the debtors ledger for six months, only refunding or otherwise affording value to the payer if requested to do so.  To make matters worse, this supplier does not display the excess payments on a statement of account to the customer.  At the end of the six-month period, it is the supplier&rsquo;s policy to treat any unclaimed payments or credits as unearned profits.  In the situation just described, the supplier has broken no law and, amazingly, has not departed from the rules of accounting as interpreted in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Unless our hypothetical small trader subsequently discovers his or her error &mdash; the chances are he or she may not &mdash; he or she has lost &euro;5,000.  Assuming a net profit is 6%, he or she would have to obtain additional new business of more than &euro;83,000 merely to break even from this situation.  He or she should not have to do this nor should the supplier have the gratuitous benefit of money for which he or she provided neither goods nor services.  Under the Bill, this situation would not be allowed to arise because of duties of disclosure and prohibition of any form of concealment of the overpaid sum.  As stated in its explanatory memorandum, this Bill closes avenues to a range of fraudulent and suspicious practices.</P>
        <P>Are overpayments frequent and can they accumulate to large amounts?  Let me give the answer to that question by reference to a topical first tier tax tribunal case in Britain in 2010 &mdash; the case of Pertemps Recruitment Partnership Limited <i>v.</i> HMRC.  Although the question here was the taxable status of overpayments rather than issues as to how they were handled, the facts given in the case about the extent of such payments were staggering.  In a five-year period from 1999 to 2003, the company received &pound;1.6 million of unreconciled payments equating to 0.18% of the value of the company&rsquo;s turnover.  While by no means all of the payments were left unrefunded, it was noted that in one financial year, 990 individual payments amounting in total to &pound;486,000 failed to be reconciled and were transferred to the profit and loss account.  If the overpayment level evident in this case was replicated even partially in business in Ireland, then the problem must be very widespread indeed and the extent of the money involved must be very large.</P>
        <P>The Irish Institute of Credit Management, a professional body with more than 40 years experience at the coalface of debtor-creditor interaction, has responded to the problem of overpayments by issuing guidance notes for the treatment of trade overpayments in May 2011.  In the foreword, it refers to the prevalence of the issue of overpayments and a lack of uniformity in how they are treated and how some businesses seek to reclassify such receipts as unearned profits without any reference to the customer and to how a substantial injustice could be done to the overpaying party.  The IICM recommends a number of measures for the correct treatment of overpayments with the need for adequate disclosure being central to best practice.</P>
        <P>In Britain the Auditing Practices Board has registered strong concern about retained overpayments in its 2010 practice note on money laundering.  The APB states that the auditor considers whether the retention of the overpayments might amount to theft by the audit client from the customer and, if so, the client will be in possession of the proceeds of its crimes, a money laundering offence.  That point drew particular support from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, we already have an excellent system for dealing with abandoned balances in financial institutions, thanks to the Dormant Accounts Acts 2001 to 2005.  The provisions of the Acts have generated a strong culture of due diligence and follow up with customers regarding inactive balances long ahead of the statutory dormancy period.  The Business Undertakings (Disclosure of Overpayments) Bill 2012 would drive a similar culture of transparency in the business sector with little cost to the State.  Aligning the two sectors, financial services and business activity, in regard to duties of disclosure would effect a welcome cohesion in supporting customers rights.</P>
        <P>The United States has long recognised and dealt with the issue of overpayments in the context of its unclaimed property law.  Each state is required to establish and administer a law on unclaimed intangible personal property in line with the general principles of the Federal Unclaimed Property Act 1995 which instances credit balances, customer overpayment, credit memorandum &mdash; another phrase for credit notes &mdash; and unidentified remittence.  These are among the wide range of items governed by the Act.  These are headings we now seek to include under rules of disclosure.</P>
        <P>In the US, these balances must either be reunited with those entitled to receive them or, if not, they must be transferred to the custody of the local state treasury at the expiration of three years.  I am sure that is not something to which the Minister would object in principle at a time when sources of income are hard to come by from the State&rsquo;s point of view.  A rightful owner can, however, claim from the State fund in perpetuity.  That is also a feature we find in the Dormant Accounts Acts.</P>
        <P>As I have outlined, this Bill sets out to address a real and serious need for probity in these areas of financial transactions.  It nonetheless avoids introducing onerous burdens which would only hinder the dynamics of business administration.  Its real beneficiaries would be the paying public and business communities whose discharge of their debts makes an ongoing and absolutely necessary contribution to economic life.  This Bill removes from them the danger that an inadvertent mistake on their part will ever be seized upon by an unscrupulous creditor availing of a gap in regulation.</P>
        <P>This is a practical measure to enhance the standards of a more ethical Ireland where hopefully many types of inappropriate practices, and not just those which are the subject matter of this Bill, will soon become a thing of the past.</P>
        <P>Mar sin, creidim go bhfuil s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go dtac&oacute;dh an Rialtas leis an mBille seo.

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  It is always a pleasure to listen to this Minister.  I second Senator Mullen&rsquo;s Bill.  It is trying to extend the dormant accounts legislation to include other forms of dormant property and to increase the property rights of persons over such property.  Senator Mullen mentioned the US Federal Unclaimed Property Act 1995.  We Googled it today and found that there is $32.88 billion outstanding in that fund.  This appears to be an area worth looking into.  We did it with dormant accounts.</P>
        <P>In terms of my personal finances, I dislike standing orders and direct debits because I do not want to pay too much as it is difficult to get it back.  Senator Mullen referred to the Irish Institute of Credit Management, the fact overpayments end up as unearned profits, the case in the United Kingdom where &pound;486,000 sterling was transferred to the profit and loss account in one case alone, and the concerns of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.</P>
        <P>Assets in general, whether deposits due back from landlords, insurance policies not claimed, travellers cheques, money orders, unclaimed wages and individual retirement accounts, are all property which should not fall by default into the hands of the person to whom the payment is made.  There is scope for us to look at the extent of this problem, along with the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens Advice Bureau and MABS.</P>
        <P>This morning the Leader has informed us that the Government intends to move against moneylenders on the basis of taking money that is not properly theirs where persons pay too much for money.  I gather the Government also intends to reduce the interest rates they can charge and act against those who overcharge.</P>
        <P>This is interesting new legislation.  Some Government Senators have stated that this problem has only been tackled as systematically in the United States as in Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen&rsquo;s Bill.  It would be of value to find out whether this is a cause of a person&rsquo;s financial problems and whether the Oireachtas could help in the resolution of these problems.  One may take it that power in society frequently rests with those in companies who take in these payments and that it can be difficult for individual citizens to get their money back.  Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen has raised important issues that are well worth discussing in the House.  I look forward very much to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen for raising this issue and tabling the Bill.  We all need to look at areas where, perhaps, the business environment can be improved.  However, at a time when many enterprises are already complaining about excessive regulatory burdens, my Department must be extremely careful to ensure the imposition of a new regulatory burden is justified and proportionate.  The basis for the regulatory regime outlined in the Bill has not been established and, unfortunately, I will not be able to support the Bill as a consequence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The core provisions of the Bill are set out in section 2 which, first, provides that where an undertaking receives an overpayment of more than &euro;25 from a business, it should furnish details of the overpayment to that business within 20 working days and seek its instructions as to how the overpayment should be corrected.  Second, the undertaking that has received the overpayment should make available to the business that has made the overpayment such additional information as it may reasonably request to investigate the overpayment.  Third, the undertaking that has received the overpayment should comply in a timely manner with the reasonable instructions of the business that has made the overpayment regarding the return, offset or other disposal of the overpaid sum.</P>
        <P>The Bill goes on to deal with the investigation and enforcement of alleged breaches of section 2.  Section 3 provides that a person would be able to request the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to investigate alleged breaches of the provisions of section 2.  Section 4 would empower the Minister to appoint authorised officers to investigate such breaches and sets out the powers of such officers and the requirement on persons under investigation to co-operate with authorised officers.  Sections 5 and 6 deal with offences and penalties, including offences by corporate bodies, while section 7 outlines the defences that would be available to persons charged.</P>
        <P>A regulatory architecture is being designed to deal with this problem.  Our principal objection to the Bill is that it has not satisfied the most basic test of the principles of better regulation to demonstrate that it is necessary to create that architecture which would have both significant obligations in terms of tracking accountants and movements of cash and compliance requirements for the Department to set up procedures for investigation and enforcement, etc.  That is the background against which I must view this issue at a time when we, as a nation, are seeking to reduce the regulatory burdens we impose on business, particularly small business.  My Department has recently completed a process of reducing administrative burdens by 25%.  We have recently reached that benchmark.</P>
        <P>On the principles we are applying to new regulations, the first task is to establish convincingly the regulatory impact assessment or the benefit compared to the cost.  In this case, no such need has been established.  The explanatory memorandum asserts that there is an important regulatory gap, but no empirical evidence is produced of any such gap.  I hear the Senator quoting United States data which, as I understand it, from our investigations, apply in different circumstances.</P>
        <P>The explanatory memorandum argues that the multiplicity of trade payment transactions taking place daily and the often impersonal and system-driven nature of these transactions create what is called &ldquo;a ready possibility&rdquo; for overpayment.  That may be the case, but it also demonstrates the significant tracking requirements that would be imposed in seeking to keep track and ensure none of these represented overpayments.  We need to have proper evidence to show that new regulatory obligations are needed and would be proportionate.  That is an important principle.</P>
        <P>The explanatory memorandum goes on to state the absence of a more regulated environment has led to &ldquo;unmistakable incidences&rdquo; of retention and unilateral appropriation of trade overpayments and other credits, but it gives no information on either the scale or severity of such practices.  While my Department has not had much time to research the matter, it has not come across evidence to date to suggest overpayment is a significant problem or a serious concern for businesses operating in Ireland.  The Senator will recall that the Small Business Forum which reported in 2006 undertook a comprehensive review of the environment for small business in Ireland and that it made no mention of the matter, nor did its predecessor, the small business task force, which reported in 1994.  As he will be aware, the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, has an advisory group on small business established within the Department.  Its action plan, produced in November 2011, made no reference to this issue.  In contrast, it has sought to ensure we will take a number of measures to look at regulatory burdens in other areas.  We are undertaking an audit of licences issued, the allegation being there are far too many licences issued, requiring compliance by persons in various trades in order to set up and become established.  We are devoting resources, constrained as they are, to delivering on this agenda.  The various inquiries have voiced concerns about all sorts of matters such as late payments, non-payments and underpayments but nothing in respect of overpayments.  I must focus the resources available to my Department on investigating the capacity to reduce existing burdens.  In reducing regulatory burdens, it is an onerous task for Departments to establish whether we can safely reduce certain burdens.  That is the focus of my work.</P>
        <P>Senators Ron&aacute;n Mullen and Sean D. Barrett cited dormant accounts as an exemplar.  In these cases there was a substantial amount of work done to establish that there was a serious problem.  In the case of dormant accounts, there was clear evidence that the problem being addressed was substantial.  Inquiries undertaken by the Department of Finance in advance of the introduction of the legislation in 2001 had established that the number of dormant accounts &mdash; defined as accounts in which there had been no customer-initiated transaction for 15 years &mdash; could be in excess of 840,000 and their value in the order of &euro;130 million.  These estimates have been broadly borne out by the fact that the transfers to the Dormant Accounts Fund, from the date of its establishment in April 2003 to February 2012, totalled &euro;631 million, including earned interest of &euro;36 million.</P>
        <P>I repeat that the time available to my Department to research the issue has been limited, but we have come across no example of comparable legislation in other jurisdictions.  The apparent absence of such legislation in other countries supports the view that there is no evidence of a regulatory deficit regarding overpayments that needs to be addressed by statutory means.  At a time when our overriding concern must be to enhance the competitiveness of Irish enterprises, we need to look critically at the imposition of regulatory burdens on enterprise which, to the best of our knowledge, have no counterparts in the economies with which we trade and compete.  While there are legislative provisions governing the disclosure of significant overpayments in the United States, these apply to the award or performance of government contracts or sub-contracts.  The enactment of these provisions appears to have been prompted by concerns that government agencies were overpaying private contractors for goods and services and that these overpayments were not being reported by some contractors.  The Bill before the House, however, would not appear to cover overpayments by public service bodies as it defines an &ldquo;overpayment&rdquo; as one received by an undertaking &ldquo;from a person in the course of trade&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is also questionable whether a problem of this nature should be tackled by means of legislative provisions along the lines proposed.   It would also need to be shown that the existing remedies available to businesses where they had made an overpayment were inadequate.  As the explanatory memorandum notes, the common law provides a ready restitutionary remedy for money paid under a mistake of fact.  As Lord Wright observed in the leading English case, Fibrosa <i>v.</i> Fairbairn Lawson: &ldquo;It is clear that any civilised system of law is bound to provide remedies for cases of what has been called unjust enrichment or unjust benefit, that is to prevent a man from retaining the money of or some benefit derived from, another which it is against conscience that he should keep.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>There is no suggestion in the explanatory memorandum that the existing legal remedies are inadequate or unsatisfactory.  Even if the Bill were to be adopted, it would be up to the business that had made the overpayment to take a civil action to recover it.  The Bill&rsquo;s enforcement provisions deal only with criminal penalties for persons found guilty of breaches of the obligations to disclose and correct overpayments.</P>
        <P>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen referred to rules such as accountancy rules and auditing practice.  Rather than creating statutory penalties or large enforcement regimes, the route proposed in the legislation, there may be more fruitful avenues for ensuring good practice prevails across the system.  Even if there were evidence to show that inadvertent overpayments occurred on a significant scale, it would not necessarily justify the introduction of statutory provisions along the lines proposed.  If the business that makes the overpayment acts in error, it is not unreasonable to assume that the business that receives the overpayment may also do so in error.  Subject to the defences provided for in section 7, the effect of the Bill would be arguably to require a higher level of administrative and accounting competence and diligence from the payee than from the payer.  A case can reasonably be made that the obligation to ensure payment is made in the correct amount rests in the first instance with the payer.  In many cases, for example, in the case of a supermarket chain paying a small supplier, the business making the payment will be larger and better resourced than the business receiving it.  Should we expect a small business with no developed finance function to apprehend and correct a payment error made by a supermarket chain with a large accounts department?</P>
        <P>This is not consumer legislation designed to protect vulnerable consumers dealing with businesses possessed of superior knowledge and resources.  Its focus is solely on overpayments in business to business transactions.  It is a well established policy precept in this and other jurisdictions that the threshold for regulatory intervention is substantially and justifiably higher for business to business transactions than for business to consumer transactions.</P>
        <P>I have referred to the need to ensure additional unnecessary obligations are not placed on businesses in the current difficult economic and trading climate.  It is no less important to ensure additional financial burdens are not placed on the Exchequer in the current difficult budgetary conditions.  The proposed legislation would require the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to appoint authorised officers to investigate complaints of non-compliance with its provisions and, where required, initiate court proceedings in respect of such breaches.  Another inspectorate is not something enterprises are seeking or would happily embrace.  While an estimate of the cost of the additional posts is not provided, it would not be insignificant.  In a context where every aspect of public expenditure has to be examined and justified, it is reasonable to ask whether the State should be expected to meet the costs arising from the failure of private businesses to make the correct payments to the businesses with which they deal.  Even if the public finances were in robust health, the case for such expenditure would be open to question.  In the current extremely difficult budgetary climate additional expenditure for this purpose cannot be justified.</P>
        <P>While I commend the Senator for taking the initiative to bring forward this measure, I ask the House to oppose the Bill.  No evidence has been produced to show that the problem it seeks to address is significant and no other jurisdiction of which we are aware has seen fit to introduce similar legislative provisions.  There are adequate remedies for businesses that wish to retrieve overpayments of which they become aware.  Businesses that make overpayments of which they remain unaware should seek to improve their payments systems rather than look to the State to correct their negligence.</P>
        <P>While I recognise that the Bill has been introduced in good faith and addresses an area in which regrettable cases of people having lost out have come to light, the correct approach is not statutory and does not involve inspectorates and regulatory requirements.  If the Senator is to develop the legislation further, perhaps it should be done on the basis of codes of practice for the accountancy profession and improving the payment systems of private companies to track such payments.  The bread and butter of business are keeping track of cash inflows and outflows.  This, as opposed to establishing a legally onerous infrastructure or architecture, is the way to tackle the issue under discussion.  The Senator&rsquo;s case has not been justified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen on preparing and bringing the Bill before the House.  It is an interesting debate and I thank the Minister for his considered and thought provoking response.  He has made a fair point in noting the task he faces in reducing the regulatory burden on business, especially the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.  In this instance, it is necessary to balance the rights of the customer with the need to ensure the regulatory burden on business is not excessive.  On balance and having examined the Bill, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party errs on the side of the rights of the consumer and supports the Bill.</P>
        <P>Perhaps Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen might refine section 4 which would empower the Minister to appoint authorised officers and an inspectorate.  Having listened to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the section, I am unsure as to whether it is the correct approach.  Notwithstanding this, it is important to have in legislation a statutory obligation, albeit one that does not place an onerous burden of responsibility on the Department.  In the case of many other statutory codes, it has not been necessary to appoint an inspectorate or additional officers for monitoring purposes.</P>
        <P>Senators R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and Sean D. Barrett have noted that most transactions are system driven and impersonal.  It is difficult to regularly track one&rsquo;s bank balance because increasingly it is provided online and no longer sent to consumers in paper format.  Most banks now charge a fee to send retrospective statements.  It should, therefore, be within the gift of businesses to avail of regulations requiring the repayment of overpayments.  Without wishing to stretch out this matter, we should bear in mind the number of times customers of businesses in the financial services sector have been found to be due refunds.  The most recent case involved Allied Irish Banks which had to repay millions of euro to customers, including many who held accounts with other banks but were charged for using AIB&rsquo;s automatic teller machines, ATMs.  It was only on foot of an investigation by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank that the repayments averaging some &euro;500 were made.  The AIB case did not specifically involve overpayments as it related to overcharging for which refunds were due.  If the legislation were to be implemented, many businesses, including larger businesses, would focus much more on ensuring their charging structures were correct and tighten procedures for collecting charges.  As a result, cases such as that involving Allied Irish Banks would occur less often.</P>
        <P>I accept it is difficult to quantify the extent of the problem, although I note the figures provided by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen for the United States.  The Minister has indicated his belief overpayment is not a major problem in this country.  It would be worthwhile to ascertain the number of such cases, perhaps with the assistance of the Government.</P>
        <P>I concur with the statement in the explanatory memorandum that the Bill would complement the successful dormant accounts legislation.  It would also focus minds in business.  I am cognisant, however, of the need to avoid imposing an onerous additional regulatory burden on the business sector.  Perhaps the Government might allow the Bill to complete Second Stage in order that amendments could be made on Committee Stage.  With the agreement of Senator Mullen, I would certainly look at areas like section 4 and perhaps even section 3 to take some of the duties away from the Department and to bring it in more as a regulatory code that would not require much more additional resources but would simply set down in law that people must return any overpayments within a given period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is very worthwhile and if it was allowed to pass Second Stage and those relevant amendments were added to take into account some of the very valid concerns mentioned by the Minister in his speech, I think we could enact a good Bill which would protect the hard-pressed consumer while not putting an onerous burden on the business sector.  While we will be supporting the Bill, I hope some mechanism could be worked out whereby it would pass Second Stage to allow amendments to be made and in order that we can frame important legislation that would not cause the Department or the business community any great difficulty but would protect the consumer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator Mullen on bringing this Bill before us.  It is informative, thought provoking and an education for me when preparing to speak today, having listened to the Senator&rsquo;s contribution and that of the Minister.  When I first read the explanatory memorandum of the Bill, I wondered whether it was necessary to introduce legislation to deal with such an issue and whether provisions were already in place.  I have no doubt overpayments occur, some of which are in error.  For those that are not returned &mdash; the subject of today&rsquo;s discussion &mdash; perhaps in some cases the recipients are not aware there has been an overpayment.  There could be an error on both sides.  Where does this Bill stand from that point of view?  Many payments are made now through electronic means.  Senator Mullen himself mentioned double invoicing and the fact the recipient of the moneys may not realise it at the time.  Errors can occur in many ways.</P>
        <P>I did a search and found a report about an individual who had overpaid when paying by electronic means.  Instead of paying &euro;14.95, he omitted the decimal point and paid &euro;1,495.  It took about six months of dealing with bureaucracy to get that money back.  I have no doubt overpayments occur, but I would still question whether we need to deal with it through legislation.  As the Minister said, there may be other means through accountancy standards or whatever.  I know in some instances we may be dealing with a large organisation versus a sole trader, but sole traders must also have bookkeepers in place and prepare end of year accounts.</P>
        <P>The figure of &euro;25 was mentioned as a minimum in section 2 and that seems to be a very small amount.  There is also a provision whereby the money must be returned within 21 days.  A situation may arise where neither party is aware of the overpayment.  I am sure Senator Mullen will respond to that.  It may be only for those who are aware of the overpayment.  However, 21 days seems like a short time, especially when dealing with many transactions.  I do not see the demand for such a provision.  I am a member of the jobs and enterprise committee and we see many business representative groups coming through, such as IBEC, the Small Firms Association and ISME.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, has been in the House regularly talking about his small business forum.  The issue of overpayment has not arisen in any of these meetings.  I have no doubt it occurs, but it certainly is not a burning issue for these organisations.  We could ask the opinion of the representatives of these organisations on whether they believe such an issue is important to them.  If there is an overpayment, can it be resolved by means other than legislation?  I do not wish to trivialise the overpayments issue.  I am sure there are overpayments, but I do not know at what level they occur.  Senator Mullen quoted examples from the US, but do they apply here?  I am not sure.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about sections 3 and 4, whereby a person may request the Minister to investigate.  The Minister is a very busy person, not that he would be doing it personally.  It seems to be an onerous obligation to be placed on the Minister and on the system as a whole.  The appointment of authorised officers to investigate complaints will be a cost to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been compared also to dormant accounts legislation.  In his own contribution, the Minister stated that when the dormant accounts legislation was brought forward, there was knowledge it was needed.  The returns from the dormant accounts fund of &euro;630 million show there was an issue that needed to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Do we need to introduce legislation to deal with this issue?  I do not see the need for it.  I am concerned at the level of red tape that would be introduced, because that is the major issue for any small business.  There is already quite a level of legislative requirements with which businesses need to deal, and we certainly do not want to add to their burden.  We want to free them up to ensure they can focus on the areas that are important in order to preserve the jobs they have and develop further jobs.  I know I am repeating myself, but I would question the need for legislation at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I find Senator Mullen&rsquo;s Bill to be very interesting.  He aimed at something for which he believes there is a need.  I think there is a need for it.  I would like to tell a story that happened in my company many years ago, as the Minister spoke about a supermarket and small trader a few minutes ago.  There was a farmer supplying us with potatoes for a year &mdash; a very small supplier &mdash; and he charged us mistakenly for one bag when he was supplying four bags.  Our accounts office drew my attention to it after about six months. This may have been 30 years ago, and there was a &pound;10,000 discrepancy.  My own credit man asked whether we really had to draw his attention to this, because it was costing us a lot of money to check these accounts, and since we check them to make sure we are not being overcharged, perhaps we should get the benefit if we are undercharged.  However, there was no real discussion on it; he was just making a point.  We asked the supplier to come in and he came in with his accountant.  I must say that I was a little naughty because when the four of us sat at the table, I told him there had been a mistake in his invoicing for six months.  His accountant, who obviously made a deal with him that he was not to open his mouth, claimed there was no mistake.  This went on for around ten minutes until we drew his attention to the fact that we owed him &pound;10,000, rather than the other way around.  I gathered the accountant was no longer working for him the following day.</P>
        <P>There is a need for some remedy, whether it is legislation such as Senator Mullen has proposed or whether there is, as the Minister said, some other way of doing it.  The Bill highlights the area of business ethics.  I am not sure how big a problem it is, as most businesses need to form close working relationships with their suppliers and they are mutually beneficial.  Most companies with which I have worked have behaved in an ethical manner, but it is an area that needs to be highlighted none the less.</P>
        <P>Let us say one finds a wallet in the street with &euro;200 and the name and address of the owner.  If one keeps it and makes no attempt to return it, that would be considered dishonest.  It is dishonest.  If one receives a duplicated payment of &euro;200 from a client, one knows their name and address and if one keeps it and makes no attempt to return it, then it is surely as dishonest as the previous example.  There is little doubt it is unethical and dishonest.  One could ask whether there is a need for legislation.  I think there is a need.</P>
        <P>One could also ask whether we should look more explicitly at Government contracts.  Will the legislation fully apply to Government and private sector business?  Senator Mullen has spoken of how in the United States the rules governing the relationship are much more explicit.  As the Minister has explained, in the United States the federal acquisition regulation, FAR, is limited to procurement contracts.  I gather from what he said that it is to the government&rsquo;s benefit to do that.  The regulation refers to: &ldquo;Knowing failure by a principal, until 3 years after final payment on any Government contract awarded to the contractor, to timely disclose to the Government, in connection with the award, performance, or closeout of the contractor a subcontract thereunder, credible evidence of...significant overpayment(s) on the contract&rdquo;.  The obligation to return overpayments as outlined in the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act 2009 applies to overpayments made in virtually any context, including under grants, core operative agreements and other federal acquisition rules-based agreements.  Our procurement industry is massive.  The all-island market is currently estimated at approximately &euro;20 billion.</P>
        <P>One could ask whether we should examine other issues such as Government-public relations and issues such as overpayments of social welfare.  Overpayments rose from &euro;50 million to &euro;83 million between 2007 and 2010, including mistakes by recipients and administration.  Should individuals be legally required to notify an overpayment by Government?  The Department of Social Protection indicates that approximately 6% of overpayments made to welfare recipients are as a result of departmental error.  I am not sure whether there is a legal obligation to inform of overpayment by the Government if one gave the correct details to the Department of Social Protection, but if not, should there be a legal obligation?  I mention it because it gives rise to a problem of ethics, honesty and also cost to the State.  Senator Mullen&rsquo;s proposal and legislation is worthy of much more consideration.  I support what Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien suggested, that we would pass the Bill on Second Stage and promise to investigate whether we could improve it on Committee Stage.  I understand the Minister&rsquo;s concern about the difficulty small businesses have with the extent of legislative controls that exist, but the Bill is the right way to go.  It is just a question of whether we could tamper with it to the extent of improving it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is very welcome to the Chamber.  Senator Mullen&rsquo;s Bill is a most interesting one to which I have given a great deal of consideration.  In his opening remarks the Minister outlined the necessity to demonstrate that the new legal architecture is necessary.  The Bill fails to do so in terms of necessity and also in terms of proportionality.  The relationship between a supplier of goods and services and the purchaser of those is based on more than the regulatory and statutory frameworks; it is based at least as much on goodwill and trust as it is on the law.  I listened carefully to Senator Mullen&rsquo;s contribution and while much of what he said was disturbing, it points more to unethical activity, especially fraudulent activity and particularly with false accounting and poor auditing.</P>
        <P>The Bill identifies a problem and defines it as an overpayment by a purchaser of goods and services and the explanatory memorandum identifies the legal gap the Bill purports to fill.  It speaks of the common law remedy and states that since most overpayments &mdash; this is key to our opposition to the Bill &mdash; are inadvertently made, it is often self-defeating to pursue a remedy in common law since the ability to bring a claim under common law in respect of unjust enrichment from moneys had and received requires knowledge of the overpayment in the first instance by the injured party.</P>
        <P>According to Senator Mullen, the Bill fills an important regulatory gap by imposing a statutory duty to disclose overpayments.  He might well be correct, but I do not believe the remedy proposed in the Bill adds value to the existing body of law in the area, namely, the aforementioned unjust enrichment for moneys had and received, in that it imposes a legal duty of disclosure while the actual disclosure remains dependent on the willingness of the party receiving the payment to disclose that such an act has taken place.  The same remedy as that proposed by Senator Mullen exists in common law.  The proposed Bill does not move in the direction of discouraging deliberate benefit from overpayment and it relies, as per the current arrangements, on the willingness of the beneficiary to disclose.  Therefore, we will be unable to support the Bill.  It is a worthy objective but it is flawed legislation.  Senator Mullen has identified an issue and we commend him on doing so.  However, his proposed remedy does not satisfactorily address the issue.  Perhaps if he addresses the fundamental issue and reintroduces the Bill at a later date, we might be in a position to reconsider our current position.</P>
        <P>I also draw Senator Mullen&rsquo;s attention to the fact that perhaps in his deliberations he might also consider deliberate underpayments in the event of such a legislative proposal coming before us again.  We are unable to support the Bill.  I am certain that, as the Minister has outlined, other avenues under other legislative and regulatory frameworks are available to address the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to not take too long.  Like Fianna F&aacute;il, we in Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill.  If it proceeds to Committee State, we will commit to amending it and making it as good and as strong as we possibly can.  As has been indicated, there is no obligation currently requiring someone who has accidentally been overpaid to disclose or return the overpayment.  We need a uniform system of some kind to protect the rights of parties who make overpayments.  We agree the complexity of modern business transactions and the multiplicity of those transactions which can take place in short periods can create difficulties for businesses in terms of accounting, especially small businesses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reference has been made by other Senators to the Dormant Accounts Acts 2001 to 2005 which govern the position of unclaimed balances in certain financial institutions.  They mentioned there is no legislation directing or governing the treatment of trade overpayments, although there are a number of relevant provisions in the Companies Acts 1963 to 2009.  The Bill recognises there is a disparity between the approach taken by, for example, financial institutions and that taken by other sectors on the treatment of overpaid balances.  The lack of uniformity in how overpayments are treated in different businesses means in some cases there is a diligent practice, as Senator Quinn mentioned, of notifying customers of overpayments and immediately agreeing a disposal, while in other instances there can be indifference to the erroneous receipts or the payee may seek to reclassify such receipts.  It is difficult for a company, having realised its mistake, to reclaim its money by way of restitution, which the explanatory memorandum notes could be unduly onerous on some businesses.  Likewise, it could be very difficult for a business which made the overpayment to reclaim the sum if the payee company has gone into liquidation or receivership.  The legislation should take account of errors on the part of a company which has received an overpayment.  The multiplicity of trade payment transactions daily and the often impersonal and systems-driven nature of payments creates ready possibility for overpayment.  This is as true of the party receiving the overpayment as of the party marking it.  We must ensure, if the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage, that this is clearly set out, especially in section 7.</P>
        <P>We are strongly supportive of section 5(2) and 5(3) which provide for sanctions for those who fraudulently conceal the existence or extent of an overpayment or other credit, or issue any statement of account or document purporting to be a statement of account which omits details of any overpayment or other credit.  Such behaviour not only defrauds the person who has made the overpayment but could also create a false impression of the company&rsquo;s accounts, as overpayments may be declared as assets or used to offset liabilities.</P>
        <P>My main concern in regard to the Bill is how it can be implemented, particularly in terms of ascertaining what will constitute a genuine mistake as opposed to fraud on the part of the recipient of an overpayment.  I would welcome any clarification from Senator Mullen on how this question might be interpreted by the courts.  In summary, notwithstanding the concerns I have indicated, we are of the view that any faults in the legislation can be resolved on a cross-party basis on Committee Stage.  As such, we urge the Government not to block its passage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, for his comments on this proposal and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, who has just come into the House.  I also thank Senators Sean Barrett, Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Deirdre Clune, Feargal Quinn, John Gilroy and Kathryn Reilly for their contributions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There are two core aspects to this Bill.  First is the criminal offence aspect whereby a particular onus is placed on businesses receiving overpayments to take certain steps.  The second aspect is the ability of or requirement on the Minister to put in place a mechanism to allow a person formally to make a complaint and for that complaint to be investigated.  I am disappointed by the evidence in the Minister&rsquo;s response to the proposal of lazy thinking by the Department.  My first difficulty in bringing forward the Bill was in establishing whether it came under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  There was a sense that each was trying to palm it off on the other.  It is hardly surprising, in that context, that the Minister should complain that he has had limited time to study the Bill, but that is not my fault.</P>
        <P>I am especially disappointed the Minister does not seem to be interested in exploring whether there is a problem in this area.  There is an obvious way of identifying whether money is left lying in bank accounts, as we saw in the bringing forward of the dormant accounts legislation. I accept it is not so easy to identify where what is referred to in this Bill is happening.  Logic would surely dictate, however, that if the Minister is not convinced there is a great problem, he can hardly argue the measures I propose will impose an onerous requirement on businesses or on his Department.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>
        <P>We are dealing here with the mentality of light touch regulation.  It is all very well for the Minister to talk about better regulation and avoiding a harsh regulatory regime, but what we are really talking about is a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach and a lack of sympathy with those who might lose out as a result of making an overpayment.  The Minister failed to acknowledge that when it comes to doing business, it is those who charge out for services who have the primary responsibility to reconcile payments received with services or goods given.  As Senator Gilroy observed, it hardly seems likely that an underpayment would ever be a relevant issue.  A person will not disclose that he or she has deliberately made an underpayment.  In any case, where an underpayment is made, it will appear in the next statement.  There has been no response to the provisions in this legislation which seek to criminalise that which should manifestly be criminalised, namely, any misstatement or omission in respect of an overpayment, something which does, unfortunately, happen in business.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not respond either to the expert evidence on which this Bill relies.  The Irish Institute of Credit Management might not have existed for all his response had to say about its concerns.  Once again, I must conclude there is a degree of lazy thinking within the Department and a type of cavalier, hands-off attitude to good ethics in business, which is partly what has led our country into its recent difficulties.  There is a certain lack of interest in any problem that is not already hitting us over the head.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Brien, Reilly and others asked that I consider certain amendments, which I will be willing to do.  In response to Senator Clune, I initially intended to provide for a 20-day period within which a receiving entity must inform a payer of an overpayment.  However, I opted instead for 60 days in recognition of the day-to-day reality of what goes on in businesses.  I thank the Senator for raising this point.  She was right to do so because when I initially advised people of what would be contained in the Bill, a 20-day timeframe was what I envisaged.  Several speakers suggested the minimum threshold of &euro;25 should be reconsidered.</P>
        <P>I am not sure whether the Minister makes a relevant comparison in pointing to federal legislation in the United States.  I accept his point in regard to the particular issue of procurement by the State and overpayments arising from that.  Apart from the fact the State should be interested in recouping any moneys lost through overpayment, it is consistent with good business practice and facilitating of ethical practice that any party that makes an overpayment should be in a position to recoup the moneys.  It could be a potential source of funds for the State, as in the case of dormant accounts.  That alone should have led to a more constructive, intellectually curious and inquiring approach from the Department as to what is proposed.  It is almost as if it wants to deny there is a problem and would prefer if people would not come forward with evidence of such.  That is a very regrettable attitude in our current straitened circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Minister questioned whether the provisions could be applicable to the State because an overpayment is defined as a payment received by an undertaking or by a person in the course of a trade.  The definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the legislation includes a body corporate.  I would have been open to an amendment seeking to ensure public bodies involved in procurement and which make overpayments are covered.  That was certainly my intent.  Again, I am surprised this issue has been put up as a major objection by the Minister when it could be more properly the source of a constructive amendment proposal.</P>
        <P>I regret what can only be described as the non-engagement of the Department with these proposals.  That is not good enough given the issues at stake and the broader question of business ethics.  Given the potential for money savings to the State, the Minister should at the very least have undertaken to investigate the proposals further.  I wonder about the negligent attitude that underlies his deficient response.  Again, I thank everybody, including the Minister, who took the time to respond, particularly those who offered amendment suggestions.  Unfortunately, the Bill seems unlikely to proceed to Committee Stage, but I certainly will be putting it to a vote.</P>

	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, for allowing my Adjournment matter on the West Cork Arts Centre to be taken first.  The Minister of State has had a taste of what west County Cork has to offer since last week.  He went down a treat in Bantry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise another parochial issue, that of the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen.  I highlight the great background work done by the local community, including those involved in the arts, as well as my former colleague and Minister, Mr. John O&rsquo;Donoghue, who has west Cork connections.  His wife comes from the area.  He did great work in preparing the framework for the arts centre which is likely to go ahead, as funding has been set aside for it.  Those involved were asked to go back to the drawing board to determine whether they could achieve better value for money, which was a reasonable request.  </P>
        <P>In recent weeks I met a group of local business people who were concerned that, under the new tendering system, west Cork contractors might not get a fair bite of the cherry.  The Minister of State visited a gaelscoil in Bantry last week.  Not only is the gaelscoil wonderful, but a new community campus was constructed by a public private partnership at a cost to the State of &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million.  The companies involved were Pierse Contracting and Sisk &amp; Son Limited, but Pierse Contracting got into difficulty in the middle of the work.</P>
        <P>The same problem permeates Skibbereen, in that there are no local contractors, be they plumbers, electricians, plasterers, labourers or carpenters.  Any company that undertakes work is not required to be Irish.  I hope the work on the arts centre will proceed.  When it does, what mechanism is in place to ensure local anchorage?  If a contractor from Northern Ireland or England tenders for the job, there will be no local input.  We would have a fantastic facility for the area, but there would be no <i>quid pro quo</i> for the local community.  In the Bantry example people travelled 60 or 70 miles to do their work and then travelled home.  That local people were not employed meant the local economy received no input.  This issue should be examined.  The tendering process must be followed under EU regulations, but the same situation could obtain in Gweedore in north-west County Donegal just as much as it could in Bantry in west Cork.  It is not good for a community or area if locals are not involved in what is a great project.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State might confirm whether the news for the arts centre is positive.  People in west Cork deserve it, as they have done trojan work behind the scenes.  West Cork is a cosmopolitan area, with a mix of artists, important members of the film industry and so on.  Will the Minister of State allay my fears and those of the community that, if the project proceeds, local builders and contractors will be denied a bite of the cherry?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I enjoyed my visit to west Cork, particularly Bantry last Saturday for the opening of the gaeilscoil.  I was impressed by that wonderful facility, which comprised the gaelscoil, the col&aacute;iste phobail, the cr&egrave;che and the na&iacute;onra.  I thank the Senator for his attendance at the function.</P>
        <P>The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has taken a direct role in the provision of grant aid for arts and cultural infrastructure and allocated more than &euro;150 million in funding for capital development of facilities throughout the country in recent years.  The arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, was designed to assist in the provision of high standard arts and culture infrastructural projects, thereby enhancing access to all aspects of the arts.  The programme has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in this regard.  Under the scheme, facilities funded to date include integrated arts centres, theatres and galleries, as well as art studios and other arts production and performance spaces.  Almost &euro;86 million has been granted to 120 projects, many of which are community-based arts groups.</P>
        <P>The Department provides the bulk of capital funding for building and refurbishing arts facilities, mainly in the not-for-profit sector, while the Arts Council provides the ongoing revenue support for many facilities.  Facilities that have been funded to date include integrated arts centres, theatres, galleries, studios and creative and performance spaces.</P>
        <P>The first round of ACCESS II funding was announced in April 2007 and some &euro;32 million was allocated to 67 projects.  In May 2008 an additional &euro;10 million was allocated to a further 13 capital projects.  The emphasis of this round of ACCESS funding was on the enhancement and refurbishment of existing facilities.  Only 30% of the funding was provided for new build projects.</P>
        <P>Among the major ACCESS II projects assisted were the Royal Hibernian Academy, the Druid Theatre, the Cork Opera House, the Waterford Theatre Royal, the Gallery of Photography, the Model arts centre in Sligo, the Irish Film Institute, the Belltable in Limerick, the Wexford Arts Centre and the Sweeney Memorial Library in Kilrush.  The West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen was allocated a capital grant of &euro;1.5 million in April 2007 towards a project costing &euro; 3.7 million.  The project may go to tender in August this year.  Tendering for the project is a matter for the project promoter, the West Cork Arts Centre, but this process is not yet complete.  The timing of invitations to tender for this project is a matter solely for the promoters.  Grant aid from the Department is subject to the terms and conditions in the original letter of offer of grant aid, Department of Finance procurement conditions being fully complied with, as well as the availability of funds in my Department.  The Department at present is bound by very tight budgetary constraints and some projects will have to wait for capital drawdowns until 2013 and possibly later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  It does not, however, allay my concerns.  The need for the Department of Finance procurement conditions to be fully complied with could be the devil in the detail but that is not the Minister&rsquo;s problem.</P>
        <P>I was slightly amused to note that in the reply that was circulated, the West Cork Arts Centre was located in &ldquo;Siberian&rdquo; and not Skibbereen.  I know west Cork can sometimes be like Siberia, like this morning at 4 a.m. when I left home, but I hope this is just a typing error.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>An important issue I have raised for some time concerns several schools that met the DEIS qualifying criteria in 2005 but were not awarded DEIS status by the Department of Education and Skills.  I am eager for it to be realised these schools cannot take the same cuts as normal schools.</P>
        <P>Courtown, County Wexford, is in the second fastest growing area in the country with a population of 5,000.  Its school, Riverchapel national school, met the DEIS criteria in 2005 but did not get the status.  It is now expected to take the same reduction in school allocations as other rural schools or those in better-off areas.</P>
        <P>I realise the financial implications that giving these schools DEIS status may cause for the Department&rsquo;s budget.  However, will the Department identify the schools which met the criteria but were not awarded DEIS status?  The Minister and the Department made a mistake with the significant cutbacks to DEIS schools in the last budget.  This was rectified on the basis it was wrong.  Another rectification is required in this case.  We cannot abandon the children in these schools as they are the most vulnerable and exposed in our State.  I hope the Minister&rsquo;s response tonight will not be the standard stock response just prepared by somebody in the Department because this matter exercises me much.  I want the message to go out clearly that something must be done to resolve this matter.  This cannot be a question of sitting back saying, &ldquo;Ah sure, it will be all right&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the position on primary schools and DEIS.  The action plan for educational inclusion is the Department&rsquo;s policy instrument to address educational disadvantage and which focuses on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities from preschool through second level education.  The identification process in the primary sector was based on a survey carried out by the education research centre in May 2005 in line with international best practice.  The process had regard to and employed the existing and most appropriate data sources available.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that an independent review process was available to schools that did not qualify for DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The results of the review were notified to schools in August 2006 and schools which succeeded in the appeal process were added to the programme.  Schools which were unsuccessful in the initial identification and subsequent review processes have never been admitted to the DEIS programme.</P>
        <P>It must be noted that all children from disadvantaged backgrounds in all schools, including non-DEIS schools, can avail of the free books scheme.  Families experiencing financial difficulties can avail of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, family income supplement, supplemental welfare service, exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments, all administered by the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>A key priority for the Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  That challenge is significant given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure.  This also limits the capacity at present for the inclusion of any new schools in the DEIS programme.  In this context, the Minister has no plans to undertake the type of exercise to which the Senator refers.</P>
        <P>It is important to note also that the total provision for educational inclusion programmes in 2012 is approximately &euro;720 million across all levels of education.  This includes early education, primary and second level, further education programmes and third level student support schemes.  In addition, funding for the National Educational Welfare Board, the school completion programme, youth projects and early education is provided by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  While the majority of schools include among their pupils children with disadvantaged backgrounds, in general, most schools will successfully address the individual needs of these children without recourse to additional targeted resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has stated he will not identify the schools in question but that &ldquo;a key priority for the Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.&rdquo;  He has clearly decided to abandon those schools which should have DEIS status and have met the criteria for it.  That is wrong.  I will be moving an all-party motion on identifying these schools and I hope other parties will support me on this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this Adjournment matter is to evaluate the performance of the national spatial strategy and Waterford as the gateway city to the south-east region.  A recent ESRI report entitled, Enterprise and Labour: Hubs, Gateways and Inter-regional Specialisation, measured the progress made in the ten years since the publication of the national spatial strategy.  The figures give rise to concern for Waterford and the south east.  It showed Cork, Galway, Dublin and Letterkenny were the only areas that gained employment.  Dublin, Cork and Galway saw a combined increase of 12.5% in employment share but the other gateways, including Waterford city, had a decrease of 12%.  There is something systemically wrong in the south east and to me there is no natural reason the region should be underperforming.  The recent live register figures show the unemployment rate in the region is 19.5%, 5% ahead of the national average, as bad as that is.  The south east has most of the ingredients.  It has a strong agricultural sector and there are ports in Waterford and Wexford.  We also have easy access to markets, and there are recent improvements in infrastructure with the construction of the bypass, the second bridge in Waterford city and the outer ring road.  There has been much infrastructural development in recent years.</P>
        <P>The $1 million question is why the region is underperforming, and the answer to that partly lies in the region itself.  Nevertheless, most of the blame lies in the fact that the national spatial strategy did not come with any implements or tools to back it up.  For example, the enterprise agencies have never positively discriminated in favour of Waterford as a gateway city or the south east in general.  Government employment policies have not had a real and tangible regional focus, and the south east does not have a university, which puts it at a unique disadvantage.  Waterford city is the only gateway without a university.</P>
        <P>It is also interesting that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is seeking to merge the two local authorities in Waterford, in the process removing the autonomy of the authority for Waterford city.  He is not doing the same for Galway on the basis that it may compromise the gateway city of the west.  Why is there one rule for Galway and a different rule for Waterford?  These are genuine questions.</P>
        <P>Policy is on paper but the national spatial strategy must be backed up with resources and tangible instruments that deliver change.  We must get to the bottom of the question of why the south east is underperforming.  In the Lower House earlier today, one of the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues, Deputy John Deasy, stated that we were not performing because of the reputation of the trade unions.  It was a disgraceful attack on the trade union movement and had no basis in fact, and the Deputy was scapegoating the trade unions for Government failures.  We must ensure that the region has the resources it needs, that the national spatial strategy does not just exist on paper and that it has the instruments, resources and tools to be able to ensure that places like Waterford and the south east deliver.  That is why I have tabled this matter for debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  The aim of the national spatial strategy, NSS, includes achieving a better balance of social, economic and physical development between regions through the co-ordinated development of nine gateway cities and towns, including Waterford, and nine hub towns, together with complementary policies to activate the potential for lasting economic development in their hinterlands and wider regions.  The emerging research, which is timely and which I very much welcome, clearly confirms that some of the gateways and their wider regions are performing well, albeit with regard to an individual but very important indicator of employment.  National recovery depends on individual regional contributions so the performance of gateways such as Dublin and others must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The research confirms previous work by the Department, in conjunction with the two regional assemblies in 2009 in developing a gateway development index, that some of the other larger gateways, like Waterford, are not performing to their full potential and that is adversely affecting the performance of their wider regions.  The conclusions of the 2009 gateway development index fed into the NSS Update and Outlook Report, which was published in October 2010 and reaffirmed the importance of implementing long-term planning frameworks such as the spatial strategy.  The Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, continues to work with other Departments and agencies and the local government sector under the following headings: better alignment and prioritisation of scarce infrastructural investment; improved governance at national, regional and local levels; and the promotion of more sustainable patterns of development, both in rural and urban contexts, through more effective, evidence-based planning policies.</P>
        <P>Much good work has been completed already.  Through the adoption of updated regional planning guidelines and the introduction of core strategies in city and county development plans, this Government is taking real steps to prioritise the development of the gateways in a way that previous Administrations did not.  Taking up the governance theme referred to in the update and outlook report, the Senator will also be aware that the Minister of State is currently finalising a comprehensive policy statement on local government that will address local government structures at regional, county and sub-county levels, their powers and functions, as well as other matters.  The rationalisation of local government structures in a number of areas, including Limerick and Waterford, is also live on the agenda at present.  This is not just talk about joined-up government but rather implementing the NSS.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response, which cites better alignment and prioritisation of scarce infrastructural investment, better governance locally and in the region, and the promotion of more sustainable patterns of development.  It does not deal with the critical ingredients we need, such as positive discrimination by the enterprise agencies, their performance for the region and what they must do.  National enterprise policies must also reflect what the national spatial strategy was designed to do, which is deliver for all the regions.  The response does not deal with the need for increased educational infrastructure and, more critically, university facilities.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State might indicate to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the real concern arising from Galway as a gateway city retaining its single authority in Galway City Council.  It appears the Government does not want to compromise the gateway status of Galway but it is seeking to merge the two authorities in Waterford.  That would potentially compromise the gateway status of Waterford city.  At a time when the region and city are underperforming, we must be very conscious of decisions taken by the Government which could make matters worse.</P>

      <sTitle>Unfinished Housing Estates</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this issue following the announcement by Cork County Council this week that it is to move ahead with a public consultation on the development of a new town on the north-west side of Cork city that will accommodate up to 12,500 homes.  It is a relatively long-term project but nevertheless much surprise and frustration followed this announcement in the media this week.  It comes against a background of a collapsed property market, with &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; signs all over Cork.  We have heard of distressed mortgages and people being put out of their homes.  NAMA has a land bank and is taking control of loans associated with property developments.  Today I saw on the Internet reference to unfinished housing estates in County Cork which included examples which have not been started and only exist in the form of planning permission.  There are no details of the extent to which housing estates are unfinished but the list is lengthy.  There are 132 such estates.</P>
        <P>What is being done about these unfinished housing estates?  There has been a property collapse so why are we talking about developing a new town when we should be getting to grips with the problems we have already?  The council statement has let down people who are finding it difficult in the areas in which they live.  They want to know what the State is doing in the guise of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or Cork city and county councils.  People want answers to what is being done in their areas and the news that a new town is to be developed in the city is very frustrating.</P>
        <P>I have examined figures from the recent census and compared them to the last census in 2006.  The population in the centre of Cork city is dropping and the county population has increased.  We must consider what can be done in the greater city area and revitalise the city centre before beginning to develop new towns.  I know the Minister launched a sustainable development strategy last week.</P>
        <P>It is all very well to have the strategy in place, but we must look at the current situation and how we can resolve the issue for those living there, while ensuring areas in Cork city and county can continue to be developed.  The docklands has been identified as an area in which potentially 10,000 homes could be provided.  Is it now being neglected?  Are we abandoning unfinished housing estates and previously identified development areas in the city in favour of building a new town?  The talk might be premature and has annoyed many in Cork, particularly those who are suffering in difficult situations.  The Minister of State will probably refer to the Cork area strategic plan, of which this new town is part, but it was developed as a strategy for the period 2000 to 2020.  However, things have changed utterly since and the many people living in difficult situations want answers about what is being done to resolve the issues involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which continues to affect the lives of thousands of families across the country.  Despite the enormity of the problem the Government inherited, we have made significant progress in alleviating some of the problems associated with unfinished housing estates across the country, a large number of which are to be found in County Cork.</P>
        <P>Progress to date on unfinished housing developments has required a multi-faceted approach which has included the establishment of an advisory group on unfinished housing developments, the publication of a report in 2011, Resolving Ireland&rsquo;s Unfinished Housing Developments, and the establishment of a &euro;5 million fund under the public safety initiative.  To date, there are 167 estates within the initiative, in respect of which submissions have been received in the case of 150.  So far, there have been approvals of funding totalling &euro;3.21 million for 132 developments, with a further 35 estates to be allocated funds.  We expect the final outturn to be in the order of &euro;3.5 million.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the national co-ordination committee on unfinished housing developments, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, has delivered a code of practice for stakeholders which defines the rights, responsibilities and inter-relationships of the key parties involved.  It has published a guide for residents living in unfinished housing developments, formulated site resolution plans for stakeholders in estates to agree the aspects of their developments which remain incomplete and require resolution, and established a legislative review group to review legislation with a view to strengthening or amending provisions to take account of the issues associated with unfinished housing developments.  It is also examining the issue of bonds and their adequacy in the light of recent experience.</P>
        <P>The national housing development surveys in 2010 and 2011 established an authoritative baseline analysis of unfinished housing developments to assist in fully understanding the scale and extent of the issues involved.  The 2012 national housing development survey is under way and will prove to be an invaluable resource in monitoring the current state of the housing market and inform the future direction of our policies in this area.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is totally committed to this agenda and takes a particular interest in all aspects of resolving the spectrum of issues which have arisen.  The issues surrounding unfinished housing developments are numerous and it will take some time and a lot of effort to resolve them.  The initiatives I have outlined demonstrate the determination of the Government to tackle these difficulties and reintroduce equilibrium to the housing construction sector which will, in time, allow it to revert to a position where it will function properly.</P>
