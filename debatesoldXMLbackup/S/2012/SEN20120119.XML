      <P>I have received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to clarify the reason he is targeting small rural schools for increased enrolments before the publication of the value for money review of small schools.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mary Moran of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation to make a statement on the closure of the Diageo plant in Dundalk, County Louth and the implications for the economy of the town.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the report of the advisory group on small business (resumed), to be taken following the Order of Business and conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with the contributions of Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply to the debate not later than 1.20 p.m.; and No. 2, statements on ideas for job creation, to be taken at 2 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of Senators not to exceed five minutes each.</P>
      <P Just="Left">For the information of the House, following the conclusion of this discussion each group leader will draw up a document highlighting the main points raised during the course of the afternoon by his or her group and the Leader of the Seanad will forward a composite list of recommendations to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, for consideration.  Senator Cummins asked me to specifically say that would be the outcome of the debate today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader to make contact with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to invite him to meet the residents of Priory Hall.  Dublin City Council is being of no assistance at this stage to the residents who are still, in effect, homeless.  Numerous requests have been sent to the Minister <Col N="760" />by the residents&rsquo; group in Priory Hall but he has refused to meet it.  The residents have written to the Taoiseach but he has also refused to meet them.  The Government has a responsibility in the matter.  At the very least the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government should afford some time to meet a delegation of residents.  I ask Senator Bacik to pass on my request.</P>
      <P>I am most interested to note the comments of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in Germany yesterday and, specifically, why he chose to make the comments he did in Germany.  He said he would ensure that there is no private sector involvement for Irish senior bank payment or sovereign debt.  That is a departure from what he has been saying up to now.  When he went on his much heralded visit to Washington he said he would impose significant losses on some senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  He told a meeting of German bankers yesterday that this country would not seek any private sector involvement in sharing the debt burden.  Why has a Minister chosen to make significant remarks of this nature outside the Houses of the Oireachtas?  What is the Government position on the issue?  It is of no great surprise to me because there have been so many U-turns up to now.  Could the Deputy Leader confirm to the House today that it is the Government&rsquo;s stated position that there will be no private sector involvement in any debt burden sharing?  This is a new departure for the Government.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Finance saw fit to make the announcement to German bankers first, as opposed to making it to the elected representatives of the people.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to education, in particular small schools, rural schools, and minority faith schools.  I raised on the Adjournment yesterday an issue relating to a Church of Ireland school in my constituency.  I seek as a matter of urgency that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, would come to the House for a full debate on education.  Not only has the Government effectively increased the pupil-teacher ratio for small rural schools and small schools in the Dublin area and in other city areas, it has been confirmed to me by the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, that by the end of the month there will be an increase in the requirements for permanent learning support within those schools.  Any four-teacher school will now lose its permanent learning support post.  We spoke in this House and in the other House yesterday about the importance of education, young people and especially those who require assistance in education to bring them up a level.  This is a serious departure that has been slipped in under the radar.  Effectively, any school with four teachers or fewer that has a permanent learning support post will lose the permanent post.</P>

      <P>Does Senator O&rsquo;Brien have a question for the Deputy Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to come to the House today.  I know, however, that will not be possible, but I seek a commitment that he will come to the House next week for a detailed debate to explain to me what the Government is doing.  Not only is there an attack on rural schools but in this instance there is an attack on minority faith schools.  Why is the Government going after smaller schools?  It is because it does not believe there will be a critical mass for protests on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien can raise such issues during the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinConway">
      <NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to seek clarity from the Minister for Finance on the story in <i>The Irish Times</i> today regarding the possible threat to our corporate tax rate.  Ireland is experiencing its worst economic recession in generations.  For years a key element of our economic prosperity was our attractive corporation tax rate.  While I understand the position in Europe is turbulent and European finance Ministers and Heads of Government are trying to devise proposals to ensure the euro and the European Union survive, which I am confident will be the case, this a small island nation and the key to future growth will not just be the development of the agriculture and tourism industries but also the retention of our corporation tax rate.  Will the Deputy Leader seek clarity from the Minister for Finance on the Government&rsquo;s position on its retention?  I do not doubt that the Government will fight tooth and nail to retain it at the current rate, as this will be the deal breaker.  Irrespective of whatever else occurs, the rate that has contributed to our prosperity and will be an important element of our economic recovery must be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>During the week there were reports on the Government selling Aer Lingus.  Even considering its sale would be dangerous.  The carrot is that we will maintain the slots at Heathrow Airport, but this is not a tin pot country that will put up with being told to remove ownership of the airline from Irish hands.  Ryanair is a commercial concern.  What would happen if we were to need a national airline to evacuate Irish people from a country in which there was a problem?  What would happen if we were to need an airline but had lost control?  I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s attendance in the Chamber to discuss this issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We must highlight the fact that we do not consider the sale of Aer Lingus as one of the options being imposed on us by the troika which has told us that we need to sell national assets.  If we are to sell the national airline, let us ensure no foreign company takes more than a 49% stake.  Tourism is essential, yet Irish tourism would have no importance for a foreigner for whom any decision would be purely commercial.  I have argued strongly in favour of privatisation of many concerns, but Aer Lingus is an Irish icon and has established itself as something of which we can be proud.  Retaining ownership of it is essential if we are not to lose control of this outlet for tourism and exports.  While tourism is one of our great earners, it would not be in the interests of a commercial concern to regard it as such if other outlets would be more beneficial commercially.  We wear two hats &mdash; commercial and security.  We should strongly recommend to the Government that it not allow one of the options imposed on it to be the sale of more than a 49% stake in Aer Lingus to be placed in foreign hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaitKeane">
      <NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to events to take place on National Diabetes Day.  Thanks to the media which have provided facilities and doctors who are freely giving of their time, tests are ongoing at various shopping centres throughout the country.  Why is this test not mandatory when a patient presents to a general practitioner?  The pinprick blood test is not common.  The way the country is going, preventive medicine should be as important as curative.  Today is about preventive medicine, but there should be facilities available.  I do not know how expensive the machines are, but there should be one in every area with three or four GPs and the public should be made aware of the test&rsquo;s availability.  Currently, patients queue for blood tests in hospitals, which is time consuming for nurses and other staff whose time could be otherwise used.  Will the Minister for Health investigate why such tests are not a daily occurrence in GPs&rsquo; surgeries or even area GPs&rsquo; surgeries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our thoughts and prayers today are on the rescue attempt under way following the tragedy in Glandore in my area.  Today is probably the start of a 48 hour window of opportunity in seeking to recover the bodies which everyone hopes will be found.  As someone who has experienced a tragedy and the recovery of a body in January 1985, many <Col N="762" />landlubbers do not know what it means to a fishing community and the families of those who are missing, presumed drowned, to have their bodies recovered.  It would help to bring closure and be a small relief to the community.</P>
      <P>I compliment the considerable efforts of the Garda divers in their attempts to access the vessel.  Thankfully, there was one survivor, an Egyptian who was washed off the boat.  His opinion is that the bodies are still within the vessel and can be recovered sooner rather than later.  I also compliment the Irish Coast Guard, the cliff and shore rescue workers and the community in Union Hall and the greater west Cork area who have bonded together in what is a difficult situation for the fishing and coastal communities.  Such tragedies reverberate in the psyche of everyone living along the coast or with a connection with the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I ask that the Seanad send its good wishes and prayers to the recovery service.  Today and possibly tomorrow are critical, as the weather is somewhat benign, but this window of opportunity can evaporate quickly.  We wish the recovery operation every success and are thinking of the families involved, the local community and the fishing community which is sometimes forgotten during this difficult time.  For years as a Deputy and Senator, I have raised the problems of the fishing community week in and week out.  I will continue to do so, as it is important that we think about our friends, fishermen, those who are lost and the grieving families in their most difficult hour.  It is good that we speak on such issues to show our support and solidarity.  I am satisfied that every Senator, regardless of politics, will support me in my call, reflect and say a prayer for the success of the recovery battle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe">
      <NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">Our thoughts are with the community mentioned at this time.  We join Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan in wishing luck to everyone involved in today&rsquo;s difficult endeavours.</P>
      <P>I thank Members in engaging in yesterday&rsquo;s vigorous Private Members&rsquo; debate on rural transport.  That it was followed by the resumption of statements on suicide brought to light the need for the issue of isolation to be debated.  The word &ldquo;isolation&rdquo; was used often during our two hour discussion on rural transport and the statements on suicide.  I hope the House will continue to emphasise the need for rural transport services, particularly for the elderly.  During the public consultation committee meetings the issue of providing a taxi voucher or introducing a voucher scheme for the elderly was raised by a number of groups.  On the basis of their evidence, the Labour Party believed the matter was important enough to be raised in the House again.  We hope to maintain dialogue with the Minister on that matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Health to ensure that the rural transport budget is allocated as soon as possible?  Some of the schemes around the country are in a very uncertain situation and do not know how much or when the moneys will be allocated.  I hope this matter will be expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh">
      <NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to the House as soon as possible?  I understand he and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, are giving a press conference this morning on the details of the fifth EU-IMF report.  <i>The Irish Times</i> reports today that the issue of public service increments has been totally dismissed by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, notwithstanding the calls by Fine Gael Party backbenchers to address the issue.  Any Minister in Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s position should not rule anything out given the seriousness of our fiscal situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, we have another Labour Party Minister talking about heaping a broadcasting charge on top of the list of charges already being imposed on hard-pressed householders, including the household charge, water charges and septic tank charge, not to mention the <Col N="763" />increased cost of health insurance as a consequence of off-loading inefficiency and excessive costs in the public sector on to the private sector.  It is unconscionable that a greater effort is not being made to ensure savings across the public service.  Current public expenditure for 2012 is budgeted to exceed last year&rsquo;s expenditure by &euro;1.4 million.  That is irresponsible.  The Minister should come to the House to deal with the EU-IMF report and to explain how we will extricate ourselves from these difficulties.  As it stands, he is in real danger of becoming the Minister for over-expenditure and no public service reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune">
      <NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the issue referred to by Senator Walsh, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources indicated this morning that he is considering a broadcasting charge.  Moreover, he made clear that this would not be an additional charge.  In other words, any household already paying a television licence fee will not be required to pay any more.  It makes sense to replace the licence fee with a broadcasting charge because there are now so many different media through which people can access information provided by the public service broadcaster.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange for a debate on public sector broadcasting?  Such a debate should encompass such issues as the mixing of commercial revenue with licence fee income and the excessive fees paid to some broadcasters.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s salary should be a benchmark if not a ceiling for anybody working in the public service.  Public service broadcasting has served us very well heretofore, but it is helpful to retract, review and revise every so often.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">Will the Deputy Leader indicate whether there will be a debate in this House once the findings of the Moriarty tribunal are published?  I commend Mr. Paul Melia and Mr. Michael Brennan of the <i>Irish Independent</i> who, on Tuesday last, 17 January, published details of the cost of the tribunal, which are now running at almost &euro;50 million.  The tribunal has created no fewer than 17 millionaire lawyers.  Ms Patricia Dillon has earned &euro;5.5 million, Mr. Desmond O&rsquo;Neill was paid &euro;5.27 million, Mr. Patrick Quinn got more than &euro;5 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden">
      <NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Gross amounts of money have been paid.  The one man who raised this issue, over and over again, was Senator Jim Walsh.  His was a voice in the wilderness, pointing out that, for example, the daily rate of pay for senior counsel at the start of the tribunal was more than &euro;2,250, and &euro;1,500 for a junior counsel.  Where else in the world would that level of pay be available?</P>

It is about time we had a 90% super-tax on the earnings of lawyers.  It is absolutely outrageous how they are ripping off this country.

      <P>Will the Deputy Leader give a commitment to the House that the report of the tribunal will, immediately upon its publication, be brought before this House for discussion of its findings?

    <Speaker pid="TomSheahan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I could not have predicted Senator Leyden&rsquo;s outburst, the issue I wish to raise is somewhat relevant.  I noticed recently that Kerry County Council&rsquo;s budget includes a provision for &euro;350,000 to run the coroners office in Kerry.  Coroners throughout the country are generally solicitors, with their coroner role merely a part-time sideline, at significant cost to local government.  I propose that each local authority area should have one full-time coroner.  As I understand it, every local authority currently has at least two, with some, such as Mayo County Council, having three.  Should this cost not be defrayed by the Department of Justice and Equality rather than the local authority?</P>

      <P Just="Left">Next June Ireland will host the 50th international Eucharistic Congress, which will involve 25,000 participants from five continents on a daily basis and culminate in a ceremony attended by 80,000 in Croke Park.  We have had a long period of reflection in Ireland on church-State relations, particularly between the State and Rome.  Many people believe it is now time to move on.  It would be helpful if the Taoiseach would consider extending a personal invitation to Pope Benedict to attend this congress, bearing in mind that the former British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, did precisely that in 2010 when he facilitated the Pope&rsquo;s successful visit to Britain.</P>
      <Col N="765" />
      
      <P>Yesterday more than 60 Oireachtas Members attended a briefing on this issue in the hotel across the road.  I was very impressed by that attendance.  I ask the Deputy Leader, on behalf of the Seanad, to approach the Taoiseach in this regard.  He is a very good man who would like to see something like this happening.</P>
      <P>The Seanad could take the lead in this.  It can only be good for the welfare of all people on this island if the relationship we have had with Rome down through the years continued.  I would be delighted if the Taoiseach would take this opportunity to extend that invitation to Pope Benedict.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to come to the House for a debate on education.  It is not entirely accurate to say that four-teacher schools will lose a full time learning support teacher.  Some schools were not entitled to a learning support teacher.  This entitlement was based not on the number of teachers but the number of pupils in a school.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I previously raised in this House, in a trade context, the need for Ireland to recognise the National Transitional Council in Libya.  Our failure to do so is affecting Irish businesses trying to trade in Libya.  When I raised this issue previously, including on the Adjournment with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, I was told that it was premature for Ireland to recognise the National Transitional Council.  Last Friday, the British Embassy held a trade and business reception in Tripoli.  I received a copy of that invitation by e-mail from a Libyan businessman.  It was a huge success for the British which has increased its trade in Libya.  The ambassador involved was the Right Honourable Herbert Asquith, grandson of the former Prime Minister.  The Libyans want to trade with Ireland and are asking why we will not recognise their National Transitional Council.  One goes into the room when there is a mess and helps to tidy it up.  One does not wait until the room has been cleaned to go in and ask if one can help.  I ask the Deputy Leader to take up with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade the need for Ireland to recognise the National Transitional Council in Libya.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader to provide time for a debate on broadcasting and communications in Ireland.  Technology changes quickly and it would be interesting to hear the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on how the industry is expected to develop during the next few years and the Government policy in regard to television broadcasting.  Issues such as policy with RTE journalism, private terrestrial stations and the roll-out of Saorview and so on have been discussed on numerous occasions.  I am interested in hearing about the role of TG4 in the broadcasting industry and the use by many people in Ireland of iphones, ipods and computers to access material on Netflix which recently entered the Irish market.  I would like also if we could in such a debate address the issue of a broadcasting charge, as highlighted recently in the media, the logic behind it and how it sits <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> current television licences and so on.  It is important that the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, come to the House to discuss these issues, in order that <Col N="766" />we can set out our concerns in regard to the imposition of another charge on households already hit by water, septic and household charges.  If the media rumour is true and this charge is to be imposed, its logic should first be explained here.</P>

      <P Just="Left">The issues of service delivery and medical cards were discussed recently in the House.  However, the issue of family income support has not been addressed.  I have been contacted by a number of constituents about family income support.  People in receipt of FIS receive notification of cessation of payments six weeks prior to the date on which it will cease.  They are told when they apply for it, that there is a waiting time of 12 weeks for completion of applications and that they should in the interim apply for supplementary welfare, which creates much work for many people.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, stated recently that processing medical card applications is being streamlined.  Rather than having to fill in a new application form for family income supplement payment every nine months, people should be asked six weeks prior to the date on which payments will cease to provide a statement of affairs, including bank statements and proof of income, in order that their payments can continue.</P>
      <P>As has been stated, many people are concerned about how they will meet the new charges introduced.  People in receipt of family income supplement are deeply concerned about how they will meet these charges during the time between cessation and recommencement of payments.  This is causing great hardship.  Delivery of this service must be streamlined.  Politicians have a responsibility to ensure this happens.  I would welcome a debate with the relevant Minister on this issue.  Also, it should be possible in this day and age for these applications to be processed electronically.</P>

      <P>I support the call by other speakers for an urgent debate on the issue of broadcasting.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, announced on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning his intention to introduce a broadcasting charge based on advice that many people are watching programmes on ipads and so on, in respect of which they are not obliged to pay a licence fee.  I invite the Minister to visit parts of north Sligo, north Leitrim and Donegal where the broadband speed is so slow one can hardly open an e-mail much less viewtelevision.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As rightly pointed out by Senator Jim Walsh, the programme for Government aimed to protect people struggling with mortgage arrears and the economic downturn but all we have witnessed is increased burdens on households, be it septic tank charges for those in rural Ireland or the household charge.  It is now proposed to introduce a broadcasting charge despite that many people throughout the country who own a computer and may be able to access e-mail do not enjoy the type of bandwidth to sustain programme viewing.  Of all the stealth taxes introduced, one never expected such a stealth tax from the so-called protector of the workers, namely, the Labour Party which has done nothing more than ensure that charge after charge is introduced, thus increasing the burden on struggling families in Ireland.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On the cost of tribunals, I would welcome a debate on the Mahon report as soon as it becomes available.  No one in these Houses has exclusivity in terms of aspiring to the highest standards in public office.  I recall the lack of debate on the Moriarty tribunal report.  It is important to state that Senator Walsh was no less robust in demanding that Fianna F&aacute;il when in government would ensure the costs of tribunals were reduced.</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on what our public broadcaster provides.  The State funds RTE and there is a need to debate what we, as a country, get in return for that funding from, say, TV3?</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I, too, called yesterday for a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  On this occasion, I seek a debate with him on the Economic and Social Research Institute study &ldquo;Growing up in Ireland&rdquo; which addresses issues such as quality of education, differences between schools and the differences between teaching and learning depending on the social class of a school and on gender.  It would be a little naive of us not to think there are differences between schools: there are huge differences between schools.  Even children know there are differences between schools.  Children learn differently, one size does not fit all and it is right that there should be a difference in approach depending on the child.  Moreover, the teacher must be trusted to deliver that.  However, I agree there should be broad guidelines in respect of core subjects such as mathematics and I strongly support active methods on foot of the significant body of evidence on that.</P>
      <P>I have an allied question for the Deputy Leader.  This is a serious matter that she should confirm and should put to the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  Is there truth in the rumour that it is the INTO agenda that is driving the changes in, and the cuts to, small rural schools?  I consider this to be a highly serious charge that must be debated.  The pupil-teacher ratio always has been a plank of the INTO, of which I was a member previously and am an associate member at present.  However, I state clearly there is far more evidence to support the proposition that what counts is the quality of teaching and learning.  I am sure Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy would support me in this regard.</P>

      <P Just="Left">On the issue raised by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; of the invitation to Pope Benedict to come to the Eucharistic Congress, this significant event is taking place in Ireland and all Members would be delighted were Pope Benedict to visit Ireland as part of a healing process for many Catholics who have been seriously hurt by the Church&rsquo;s inactivity and inability to deal with issues over the years.  I understand from my attendance at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade that the process dictates the approach would have to come from the Vatican.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, state that were the Vatican to indicate the Pope was interested in attending, the Government would not be found wanting in issuing that invitation.  Will the Deputy Leader confirm with the T&aacute;naiste that this is the position?  Everyone would like this event, which is being held in Ireland, to have the highest possible profile because of all the benefits it would have for the country and the people.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the call to invite the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House to discuss the proposal he outlined on radio this morning.  Members must establish the reason that &euro;25 million in revenue is being lost each year.  In addition, they need to know how the revenue collected through the television licence fee is being spent, whether good value for money is being obtained and whether a level playing field exists.  In respect of an issue raised by Senator Clune regarding the exorbitant salaries being paid to some people in RTE, Members need to establish whether good value and good bang for our buck is being obtained from the licence fee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the call made by Senator Healy Eames in respect of RTE and value for money, I have spoken to some people associated with broadcasting, film making and programming.  Members will notice that during the forthcoming summer, RTE will be obliged to broadcast reruns because all the available money will have been diverted to coverage of the Euro 2012 championship and the Olympics.  There will be no funds left to develop new programmes.  RTE does not appear to have a plan and many people who are not direct employees but who have found work on particular programmes will be let go.  Consequently, Members will notice the broadcasting of reruns during the summer.  The function of RTE, however, should be to produce home-grown programmes and talent.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to come to the House to explain a report from Donegal to the effect that the council has no power to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.  Many county councils have passed motions to ban fracking in their areas of responsibility, but according to a report today from the <i>donegaldaily.com</i> news website, a quote from an unnamed source states it is an utter waste of time because councils do not have the power to outlaw it.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify this point.  If fracking is being banned by local authorities throughout the country without any effect, the councils should be made aware of that.  Alternatively, the Minister, should clarify that if a council bans the practice of fracking, it is banned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">While it is clear there is a degree of dissatisfaction with the Croke Park agreement, it is important to emphasise its positive aspects.  For example, it means there is industrial peace in the country and no Member seeks to have public sector workers taking to the streets.  It also must be emphasised, however, that managers and public sector workers in general must buy into the Croke Park agreement in a more urgent way to ensure the benefits of the agreement are seen.  The problem is that neither Members nor the public at large can discern the benefits of the Croke Park agreement in an expeditious manner.  I call on managers and workers generally in the public sector to buy into it.  In a manner similar to the decrease in VAT that was introduced for tourism products and other related products, it will be necessary to bring it back to the table if it is not working.  Ultimately, the public sector must have an idea of what the private sector goes through.  It is accepted in the private sector that there are no pay increases.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I have in this regard concerns the increments.  I note increments worth &euro;250 million are being paid at a time when the Government is obliged to make some seriously difficult decisions.  It strikes me that such increments certainly should be examined and this issue may be slightly separate from the Croke Park agreement itself.  I call on the Deputy Leader to suggest that a constructive debate in this regard could be held.  Perhaps a consultative debate, similar to that held in this Chamber with the older people, could be held with leaders from the public sector to ask them what they are doing to introduce the reforms suggested under the Croke Park agreement, as well as making constructive suggestions.  If this agreement is not working, we must return to the drawing board.  Consequently, I seek such a debate.</P>

      <P>The Senator also requested that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, come before the House to discuss the speeches he made in Germany.  It is fair to say the Government has, through negotiation, obtained terms in respect of the bailout that are more favourable than those originally agreed.  In the context of this matter, Senator Martin Conway sought clarification on the corporation tax rate, on which the Government has made it clear that it is not for turning.  As far as the Government is concerned, Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate is non-negotiable.  That is the correct stance for which I am sure there is all-party support.</P>
      <P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien also requested that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, come before the House for a general debate on education.

I agree with the Senator that Aer Lingus is a national icon and that we need to guard the national interest in respect of it.</P>
      <P>Senator C&aacute;it Keane referred to National Diabetes Day which I am sure everyone agrees is a commendable initiative.  The Senator also raised the issue of mandatory testing for diabetes.  However, such testing would have to be carried out with the consent of patients.  It would be interesting, from the point of view of prevention, if GPs were requested to ask patients, as a matter of routine, whether they would like to be tested for diabetes.</P>
      <P>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan spoke very eloquently about the tragedy at Union Hall.  Our good wishes go to the families of the men who sadly and tragically were lost.  Many Senators expressed their sympathy and offered condolences on the Order of Business yesterday.  I am sure, however, we all share Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s concerns and echo his commendation for the search and rescue teams operating at Union Hall and the members of the local community.</P>
      <P>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe referred to last night&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; debate on rural transport and helpfully pointed to the link between that debate and the public consultation that had taken place in this Chamber on the human rights of older people.

      <P>Senators Jim Walsh, Deirdre Clune, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Marc MacSharry, Fidelma Healy Eames, Michael Mullins and Jimmy  Harte sought a debate on the household broadcasting charge with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who has indicated that he is contemplating the introduction of such a charge.  A number of Senators referred to it as a new or additional charge, but the Minister has made it clear that it would not be a new charge.  It would replace the existing TV licence fee and could prove to be lower.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the Minister referred to the sum of &euro;25 million lost each year because people did not pay the TV licence fee.  He also referred to the fact, as did a <Col N="772" />number of Senators, that many people accessed public broadcasting services through means other than television, namely, via the Internet and other new forms of media, and indicated that this would have to be taken into account.  His proposal seems sensible, but I agree with colleagues that it should be the subject of a debate in the House.  The Minister has agreed to come before us to engage in a general debate on issues relating to his brief when this matter could be raised with him.  A specific date has not yet been arranged for that debate, but the Minister has committed to come before the House for it.</P>
      <P>Senators Terry Leyden and Marc MacSharry requested a debate on the Mahon tribunal.  I certainly support them in that regard because it would be useful to engage in such a debate.  It must be pointed out that the fees about which Senator Terry Leyden was so critical were set by the previous Government.

      <P Just="Left">Senator Tom Sheahan referred to the need to reform the coroner system.  As the Cathaoirleach helpfully pointed out, the Coroners Bill 2007 is before the House on Committee Stage.  I do not have information on a timeframe for it, but we should try to ascertain when it will be taken.</P>
      <P>Senators Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Michael Mullins and Paul Coghlan referred to the Eucharistic Congress and extending an invitation to the Pope.  As Senator Michael Mullins pointed out, <Col N="773" />there is a protocol relating to invitations of this nature.  However, we can certainly raise the matter with the T&aacute;naiste to discover whether it can be progressed.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy referred to trade with Libya and recognition of the National Transitional Council of that country.  This is an extremely important matter.  The T&aacute;naiste has committed to come before the House on 2 February for a general debate on foreign affairs matters.  The Senator should raise the issue with him at that stage, particularly as a female doctor who previously lived and worked in this country is serving as Minister for Health in Libya.</P>

      <P>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames requested a debate on a particular matter with the Minister for Education and Skills.  As stated, it is hoped to have a general debate with the Minister at some point.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Mary White referred to the food and drink industry in the context of an issue relating to the Irish Creamery and Milk Suppliers Association.  I am aware of that issue and would be concerned about any organisation in respect of which there might be evidence of discrimination.

      <P>Senator Jimmy Harte spoke about RTE and the broadcasting charge.  He also asked that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources deal with the issue of fracking.  When we have a date set for the Minister to come to the House, these issues can be raised with him.</P>
      <P>Senator Catherine Noone referred to the Croke Park agreement and called for statements on the issue.  We can certainly explore how we can deal with issues such as this without having a Minister appear before the House.  The format for today&rsquo;s debate on job creation is very innovative because we will not have a Minister present.  The idea is that we pool ideas and avail of the benefit of our expertise in pursuing different careers outside the House and then bring these ideas to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I will not refer to Senator Paul Coghlan&rsquo;s Kerryman of the Year references, but I think I have already dealt with the issue relating to the T&aacute;naiste and the visit of the Pope.  The T&aacute;naiste will be in the House on 2 February when we can talk to him about any foreign affairs related issue.</P>

    <Title>Report of Advisory Group on Small Business: Statements (Resumed)</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome back to the House the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry.  The list is rotating.  In view of the fact that the Government side has more speakers, we will begin with the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, for agreeing to return to the House to resume the debate on this very important report to which many Senators contributed last week.  A number of other speakers wish to contribute.  Overall, the report provides a very good and detailed analysis of the climate for small businesses and there is more of a focus on domestic companies than those involved in the exports sector.</P>
      <P>I wish to focus on finance, the county enterprise boards and Government procurement procedures.  There should be clear identification of the financial requirements of a small firm.  Many face cash-flow problems which are short term and should be dealt with separately from requests for finance required to ensure growth and expansion.  Banks are already training staff to understand the provision of finance based on performance rather than on the asset base which was the norm previously.  The recommendations on managing cash flow should be initiated immediately as training and the prompt payment rule could easily be provided for.</P>
      <P>On investment finance requirements, there should be a mechanism whereby other sources of finance could easily be identified by small firms.  The emergence of angel syndicates throughout the country shows the potential to tap into private finance sources.  Matching this with Government and bank funds would be an innovative way to bring private investors into small business markets.</P>
      <P>Clarification is required on the position of county and city enterprise boards which play a critical role in new start-ups and are the only source of support for non-exports based enterprises which should also be supported.  There is great merit in getting companies to participate in courses on how to start one&rsquo;s own business, but such courses should be audited, with agreed delivery standards throughout the country.  In addition, the experience of successful businesses should be drawn upon locally to ensure the start your own business courses are practical, relevant and tailored to the specific industry or sector.</P>
      <P>There is also an opportunity within the framework of enterprise boards to incentivise business owners to consider their options for expansion.  A proposal under consideration in Waterford is to invite business owners with a proven track record but limited export or growth focus to examine their businesses with a view to development opportunities.  Those interested would have mentoring and support to develop their growth opportunities and if only a small percentage are encouraged to take the chance to develop their sales that would still be an increase in jobs and investment locally.  Those with potential could then proceed to more advanced management development and training.</P>
      <P>Regarding clarity for enterprise boards, the Government needs to decide whether that will be under the local government umbrella or Enterprise Ireland.  We need clarity soon in that regard.</P>
      <Col N="775" />
      <P>With regard to Government procurement, there is a very good initiative to get smaller companies to co-operate in tendering for Government or large procurement bodies.  However, it should be developed further to create a structure which could be expanded to facilitate small businesses co-operate in tendering for private sector business and into other jurisdictions, overcoming the economies of scale achieved by larger companies.</P>
      <P Just="Left">An initiative in the south east, through the FUSE initiative, has seen the appointment, with the help of Enterprise Ireland, of an experienced procurement manager who is developing a process through which local companies can tender for business to the multinationals in the region.  Already there is co-operation with multinationals and the system, when complete, will facilitate joint tenderers through a secure and confidential portal.  That could then be expanded on a national basis.</P>
      <P>All the points in the report are necessary and should be carried out promptly.  It is essential that whoever is charged with monitoring and delivery should report to the Minister and to the House on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>We will have a debate on ideas for job creation today and it is our intention to send the ideas we come up with to the Minister and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  The Minister might put those ideas to his Cabinet colleagues and the advisory group on job creation and come back to us on them at a later stage.  It would be beneficial for the House to see that something is happening as a result of our ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate.  I commend him for the amount of time he has spent in this Chamber on the small business area.  The report of the advisory group indicates that we have more than 200,000 businesses employing approximately 665,000 people.  We all know people in areas in our constituencies who are running businesses.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will focus on several points.  I commend the advisory group on its report, which is easy to read and contains some actionable points.  Section 3 contains the big ticket items and the biggest ticket item is credit.  The banking survey undertaken by the county and city enterprise boards last September showed that 48% of small business owners felt their businesses were being curtailed by banking restrictions.  That figure is up from 44% in the previous year.  All the initiatives the Government can bring forward are important but the elephant in the room for the past three years has been that the banks are not lending as they should to business.  I do not want them to lend to businesses that are not viable.  None of us proposes that.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We had a case in my constituency in north Dublin.  I will not mention the company&rsquo;s name but it is well known.  As a result of the Bank of Ireland arbitrarily withdrawing the company&rsquo;s overdraft facility, 48 people were made redundant before Christmas.  I have written to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about the issue.  The Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, is trying to assist in terms of the redundancy payments and, if the Minister present does not mind, I will pass the details to him also.  This is a clear case involving a profitable company with 48 staff which is 25 years in the recyclables business.  It was a market leader and broke new ground in this area 25 years ago but Bank of Ireland pulled the plug.  Mr. John Trethowan will say, as he rightly states in the report, that there are two sides to every story.  That is understood.  I know this company inside out.  I have a background in finance and therefore I have an interest in that.  Our biggest single issue is credit.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister about costs and commercial rates.  In my local authority of Fingal County Council &mdash; I commend the county manager &mdash; the councillors and those who supported the last four budgets in Fingal have seen significant reductions in rates.  We have had reductions of between 6% and 10% year on year.  That has been done because of the late Minister, Mr. Brian <Col N="776" />Lenihan.  On the basis of a local authority making savings and showing that savings are made, there was a repatriation of the amount of savings from the Department of Finance to the local authority.  If we set a target for Fingal of savings of &euro;10 million and it reached 40% of those savings, they were repatriated to the council.  In recent years the county manager, Mr. David O&rsquo;Connor, proposed to the members that those savings would go directly to reduce business rates.  That approach incentivises county councils to reduce their costs on the basis that they will get a rebate, and that rebate goes off against commercial rates.  I ask the Minister to examine the Fingal model on that because it is working.</P>
      <P>The county enterprise boards are crucial.  They were not given enough support by many Governments, including the previous Government.  For small start-up businesses and existing businesses that are finding it difficult to trade the county enterprise boards provide an excellent resource.  The county enterprise board in my area, headed by Mr. Oisin Geoghegan, does a superb job and more businesses should be aware of what the enterprise boards do.  We must do some work on letting people know about mentoring, grants and various other services.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On the cost to businesses, and this goes against my party&rsquo;s stance on the issue, I support the initiatives the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is taking with regard to premium hours and Sunday rates.  Having been in government I am aware of the pressures small businesses are under.  In the retail and hospitality sectors the premium rates and Sunday hours must be tackled.  If an individual is working from a Wednesday to a Sunday, that is part of their working week.  Obviously, bank holidays and exceptional circumstances should be included.  I welcome the initiative on the ability to pay principle for a business.  It should not be abused but I support the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in what he is trying to do, and the Minister.  We must become more cost effective and Government has to support our businesses to do that.</P>
      <P>I refer to the back to work allowance for people who wish to set up their own businesses.  They may have lost their jobs and want to become self-employed but the process in terms of the Department of Social Protection, F&Aacute;S or SOLAS does not work as well as it should.  I ask the Minister to examine that because people who have lost their jobs are coming up with good business plans and good business ideas and they can apply for the back to work allowance.  That means they get at least a portion of a salary for the first year which is reduced into the second year but it takes an inordinate length of time to get that approved.  It is a confusing system for people also.  I ask that something be done between the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the Department of Social Protection to ensure that process is more seamless and that we support people who want to get back into the workforce under their own steam.  We should support that entrepreneurial spirit.</P>
      <P>Credit is the issue.  My colleague, Senator Sheahan, raises that issue regularly.  The &euro;3 billion targets per pillar bank, Bank of Ireland and AIB, are not being met.  I refer to roll-over commercial loans.  In the past two months some of our covered institutions have imposed increases of up to 2% in the variable commercial rate.  I ask the Minister to specifically examine that.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>When loans come up for review and are rolled over, the institutions in question deem them to be new business and use them to meet their lending targets.  When a bank removes an overdraft from a small business and provides for a term loan in its place, that is also deemed to be new business.  Irish business people are not fools; nor are we.  I am not asking the banks to lend to businesses which are going to fail, rather I am asking them to support those which will survive.  They were supported by the same businesses, by us as taxpayers and by the country as a whole to ensure they survived.  It is good to see the capitalised banks coming through that system, as they would have gone under.  The principle that applied to them should also apply to viable businesses.  We need to grapple with that issue which is a difficult one.  The Minister of State should not believe the figures he is <Col N="777" />being given by the banks.  We need to drill down into them, as it is not new business.  The banks are not supporting businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte">
      <NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I again welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, whose business background means he is well placed to understand the needs and difficulties of small business at this time.  The problems in large and small towns reflect what is happening worldwide.  However, the statistics show that exports are booming.  If one confined one&rsquo;s analysis to exports, one would think Ireland was doing very well.  However, I know from experience that the problem is that the domestic economy is flat.  We have to get it going and cash moving.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have been in business for over 25 years.  The difficulty when things get tight is that cash stops flowing.  It is like oil in an engine and it is happening everywhere.  At Christmas, the strength of sterling gave a small boost to businesses in the Border area.  Although it was welcome, it also gave a false sense of optimism.  If sterling had been weak, many more retailers in Border areas would have gone under.  There is a fear that any currency fluctuations next year will have a detrimental effect on the establishment of businesses.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in what he said about credit.  If a person from a Border area goes to a bank to look for money for his or her business &mdash; he or she might have a good idea and some finance in place &mdash; the first question the bank will ask is how he or she will cope if the value of sterling increases or decreases.  That might be the difference in the business surviving, but that is a bigger issue for the longer term.</P>
      <P Just="Left">One section of the report relates to the management of the crisis.  I do not think a single business in the domestic economy can state its future is secure.  It is important to bear in mind that every business established in the past 15 years has seen the good times, but not many of them allowed for the difficulties being experienced.  They thought the Celtic tiger would continue.  In addition to helping people to set up businesses, we need to help them to manage their businesses in order that they will survive the difficulties they are experiencing.  The stark reality that businesses are suffering was set out during yesterday morning&rsquo;s briefing by the CSO when it was made clear that if cash and credit did not start to flow, more companies would fail and more people would emigrate.</P>
      <P>The lack of confidence in the domestic economy is stark.  I encourage the Minister of State to develop facilities that will help people to manage their way through the crisis.  Many of the small business people to whom I speak say they do not know where to turn.  They are sometimes in denial until things reach the stage where it is too late to do anything.  They should know that help is available.</P>
      <P>There is no lack of help for companies when they are being set up.  If one contacts the relevant agencies, one will receive very good help and support.  However, if one has a viable company which is struggling, one might not be able to receive the extra help one needs to get through the difficult times.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien spoke about a company in his local area which had waited until the last minute, when the bank called in its overdraft.  It would be useful if a mentoring service or advice was provided for such companies at an earlier stage.</P>
      <P>When I set up my own business, I did not have much experience.  I had to manage each month until I reached a position of viability.  I suggest help should be provided in the middle and at the end, rather than just at the start.  Therefore, I welcome the establishment of an advisory group comprising people with experience in small business.  I hope the group will examine these matters more closely.  The availability of mentoring services needs to be advertised.  Accountants often fail to see beyond the bottom line and are happy to sign off by saying things need to change.  However, the company in question might not know where to go.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure greater emphasis is placed on this service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I give a warm welcome to the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry.  I thank him for his commitment to the House which he has attended on a number of occasions and his contributions on each occasion have been worthwhile.  It is clear from the comprehensive statement he made earlier in the debate that the Government is aware of the importance of the small business sector to the economy and its potential to generate employment.  I agree with Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Maurice Cummins that the Minister of State faces difficulties as he tries to eliminate red tape, bureaucratic madness and bungling.</P>
      <P>I was struck by what Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien had to say about the hospitality sector when he agreed with the stance being taken by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  As someone with a background in the tourism and hospitality sector, I understand well the importance of flexibility in this context.  Saturday and Sunday are part of the normal working week in the sector.  Every day is the same for those trying to fill hotels and guesthouses.  That is an important aspect of the debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the package of initiatives outlined by the Minister of State, the aim of which is to directly assist the enterprise sector.  A combined total departmental budget of &euro;980 million, comprising &euro;366 million in current spending and &euro;514 million in capital spending, has been allocated to the sector in 2012.</P>
      <P Just="Left">All Members agree with the Minister of State that access to credit and finance is the key issue facing the small business sector.  This point was ably reinforced by the two previous speakers.  Lending targets totalling &euro;21 billion have been imposed on the two domestic pillar banks in the period 2011 to 2013.  The introduction of a targeted temporary partial credit guarantee scheme and a microfinance loan fund should assist in the flow of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises which, in turn, should sustain employment and create new jobs.  As Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said, we know that what has been set out in this regard is not what is being followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>True.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">There are mistakes and errors in the system.  Although Mr. John Trethowan and his staff are doing a very good job, many are not aware of the existence of the Credit Review Office.  They do not know they can submit an appeal when they are refused credit.  Perhaps more use might be made of this facility.  Mr. Trethowan, a former banker, is a good and practical man.</P>
      <P>Everything is so centralised in the two pillar banks that there is no longer a reliance on the local bank manager.  One of the inherent flaws in the system is that the authorities in Dublin are calling the shots.  I accept that in the case of AIB everything goes through the county business centres.  I have nothing against the people who work in them, but they often come from other areas.  They do not know the credit rating or the history of some of the businesses with which they are dealing.  There is not a need for what they bring to the process, as they are too concerned with red tape.  The banks need to return to the system under which they used to be able to receive a quick report and a recommendation from the local bank manager.  He or she is usually a person of experience who has come up the ranks and spent several years in banking.  I know this subject is close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s heart, but I suggest it needs monitoring.  I am aware that some other Ministers have an interest in this area and perhaps the Minister of State could liaise with them or with the Department of Finance on this.  He needs to ride shotgun on the lenders and should have a system of monitoring.</P>
      <Col N="779" />
      <P>With regard to the move to assist the cash flow and working capital of small businesses, I welcome the initiative to extend the 15-day prompt payment initiative beyond the 15 central Departments to the wider public sector for invoices received after 1 July 2011.  I note that the advisory group&rsquo;s report recommends the development of a voluntary code of conduct and payments within the private sector aimed at reducing payment terms.  This is vital.  I also agree with the two previous speakers, Senators Cummins and Ann O&rsquo;Brien, with regard to what they said about the county enterprise boards.  We must find ways to increase links in that regard because businesses and start-ups are not availing of or relying on the boards.  This may be due to a lack of communication and perhaps this is something the Minister of State can aim to improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AideenHayden">
      <NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are all aware of the excellent export figures we have had recently.  However, this good news belies the real issue that in order to recover, the economy must look to the domestic market.  I will highlight three issues that are important in this regard.  The report of the advisory group mentions the laws relating to insolvency and debt and the importance of changing those laws.  However, it does not deal with one aspect of the situation we had in the 1980s.  Then, certain businesses folded up one day and reinvented themselves the following day.  I do not suggest there was anything untoward or illegal about that.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Let me give an example.  The former <i>Business and Finance </i> publication restructured itself in 2002 and recently, Murano Publishing, the publishers of <i>Business and Finance</i>, folded owing &euro;500,000 to Revenue and other preferred creditors and significant other sums to unsecured creditors.  It is these unsecured creditors about whom I am concerned.  There is an issue with regard to the current situation because the suggestion seems to be that as long as  Revenue and the principal banks are taken care of, we are happy with what is happening.  The position of small businesses is not well catered for in this regard.  We need to look at the rules relating to restructuring and insolvency to discover what can be done to protect the non-preferential creditors, in particular those who comprise the sector this report tries to highlight.  These are small businesses such as those secured against <i>Business and Finance, </i>owed amounts of, for example, &euro;34,680 for one creditor, &euro;11,380 for another and  &euro;41,979 for another.  These are sums that are very significant to any small business trying to run from day to day and month to month on very narrow margins.  I have concerns about that.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The second issue I raise is the importance of expertise.  We could go further in this area.  It is well recognised that one of the major constraints to the growth of small businesses is management expertise.  Part of the difficulty is that many of the courses offered to business are offered in very structured formats and are time constrained, rather than in the format of what I call &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; learning, which allows expertise to be given to companies and businesses when they need it.  We need to place more emphasis on support and mentoring groups such as Plato.  Our third level institutions, our institutes of technology sectors in particular, are also a huge resource that could be made available to businesses through, for example, creating relationships between Plato organisations and local institutes of technology.  The Letterkenny Institute of Technology in my colleague Senator Harte&rsquo;s area, for example, is an excellent institution that could be brought in to play to offer that type of &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; learning and support to businesses at the point when they need it, for example, in terms of strategic plans, marketing and so on.  I envisage a situation where qualifications could be earned by entrepreneurs and business persons on the basis of the business plans they prepare.  In that way we would not just provide people with help, but would give them expertise that would be of value to them in the future.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The third issue has been touched on by a number of other speakers and relates to funding and money.  We are all aware that our banks are not lending.  The State is pouring money in at <Col N="780" />the top level, but it is not filtering down to the bottom.  This concerns not only small businesses but the mortgage market.  One of the groups not mentioned in the report of the advisory group is the construction sector.  It is now down to forming just 3% of our GNP, but as any statistics show, a vibrant economy needs a construction sector at or around 10%.  There is significant difficulty in that regard.  We will never grow back to those levels if we do not have finance coming into small businesses.  Many of the small businesses here were construction companies, based in small communities and employing two, three or four low-skilled workers.  I am not being critical, but we will not solve this problem through the micro-finance fund or the partial credit guarantee.  We need to look again at the resources available to us.  The State now owns the branch network of the INBS, the old Irish Nationwide Building Society, which I understand is on the market.  I suggest we do not sell that branch network, but reopen it as a bank aimed at small business and at the ordinary man on the street.  As we know the main banks are not lending and that no amount of carrot and stick will make that proposal work, rather than putting money into them, why do we not get around that problem by using the facilities that are available to us and putting the money directly through those facilities to the people who need it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and welcome the Minister of State to the House.  My main bone of contention is the lack of credit from the banks.  I will tell a brief story.  In 1977, my father had just died and I, armed with an honours law degree, approached three banks with my mother, God be good to her, seeking to borrow &pound;100 to send me to Dublin to the law school there at the time.  We were refused the loan of &pound;100 by all the banks, which we found difficult and embarrassing because they had the money to lend.  I came out ashamed from the last bank.  Eventually, one of the banks rang up and said that if my mother signed as guarantor we could have the &pound;100.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Now the banks may not have the money to lend, but we are back in this sort of situation.   Now, because of lack of credit, restaurants, drapery stores and small corner shops in our streets and towns will close.  When the problem with regard to offshore accounts was uncovered, what did the banks do but go off and do a sweetheart deal with Revenue and hand over the names of everybody involved.  I did not condone offshore accounts, but many people were advised by the banks to put their savings into them.  As a solicitor, I was asked by bank managers if I knew of anybody getting a few bob from a claim or selling an acre or a site, and asked to send them down to the banks to be sorted out with an English bank account or whatever.  That was rife at the time, but when the muck hit the fan, the banks did their deal.  I knew one man who committed suicide over a small little bit of money.  He had &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000.  I do not know what the banks told him, but he, an elderly man, could not handle the shame for his family and he got the rope.  That happened, but the banks did not give a damn.</P>
      <P>The previous Government bent backwards to help the banks in their hour of need.  It probably went too far with bank guarantees and all of that.  Anglo Irish Bank should have been put into the bottom of Bantry Bay, with 20 tonnes of stone on top of it to keep it down.  That is my view.  All the banks seem to be interested in now is profit and they are closing little shops and not so small businesses.  I know of a restaurant that closed in west Cork last year because of an overdraft of &euro;20,000 being reduced to &euro;10,000 unilaterally without any prior consent or consultation by the bank and a Revenue debt of &euro;12,000.  The restaurant employed a total of 21 full-time and part-time employees.  This is short-sightedness.  It was a successful restaurant which was very popular.</P>
      <P>I also know of a drapery store and a sports shop in west Cork which are surviving from day to day.  It is almost like begging as each day they wonder whether the bank will allow them to <Col N="781" />continue in business.  The banks state that they are lending but I also know of a man in Dublin who is not very well paid but in a profession and whose wife is a midwife.  They have saved approximately &euro;40,000 and are trying to get a loan to buy a house.  They have been trying for three years and still have not received a loan and this is a good time to buy property.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Government should no longer pay lip-service to the banks.  We own the AIB, whether it is a good or bad thing, and have a share in the Bank of Ireland.  We also own several other banks.  I do not mean this in a derogatory fashion but the Minister, Deputy Noonan, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste should bring in the banks and kick their backsides a bit because they are not lending.  We see and hear advertisements in the media stating that if people deal with particular banks, those banks will look after them.  However, they are not giving credit to businesses.  Let us be fair and honest about this.  If I do one thing today I want to nail thislie.</P>
      <P>Another issue crippling small businesses, and I am not sure how we can tackle it, is that of rates.  Much re-rating of property took place in the late 1980s and 1990s.  I know of one property struggling to pay now which was re-rated for &euro;26,000 or &euro;27,000 from &euro;9,000.  The business people accepted it at the time because it was a boom and money was being made, although they challenged it as much as they could.  The Valuation Office decides the rates but we blame the local authorities which collect them.  They were decided in the boom and no thought was given to a downturn.  It is like building a boat for calm weather, but sometimes one must go out on a day which is not that calm.  Rates are crippling many businesses, as are the abnormal rents some people charge their clients.</P>
      <P>This morning I advised a friend of mine who has a little shop and who is in difficulties.  Rather than closing the shop he plans to lease or rent it for three or four years until the economy recovers.  It has been in his family for five generations.  My advice was to set the rent at an amount which will not give him much profit but which will ensure the tenant will survive.  He accepted it as good advice.  He does not have a mortgage on the building but the business is going down the Swannee.  H proposes to lease it for three or four years after which he might be able to sell it and make a few bob or when things come around &mdash; as they will although it might take three, five or seven years &mdash; another family member might be able to meet the challenge again.</P>
      <P Just="Left">My main point is that I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister and the Cabinet and ask them to tackle the banks and get them to face reality.  If the Government does not do so the closure of small businesses in the next 12 to 18 months will be frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomSheahan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, stated with regard to the banks.  From my experience I have no respect for banks and have not had for a long time.  In 2000 I bought a business and I wanted an overdraft facility of &pound;15,000 but the banks would not give it to me.  Three days prior to opening the business, 30 miles away from where I was born and bred, I did not have an overdraft facility.  However, when push came to shove we opened and worked away.  Several years later, when business was going very well, I purchased a site where I wanted to build something like the Minister of State has, namely, a bigger supermarket than I had.  When I asked the bank for &euro;500,000 a manager and two members of staff came out to me with two laptop computers and before they left they were offering me &euro;3 million that I did not ask for.  I then lost much more respect for bankers.  Recently, they took an overdraft facility and rolled it into a personal loan.  One can imagine my esteem and respect for banks.  I will have to be restrained in what I state about them.</P>
      <P>I concur with what Senator O&rsquo;Donovan stated about rates.  Businesses had no problems paying rates when things were going well.  On an annual basis we had an approximately 3% top-up on the rateable valuation.  However, businesses paid this because they had the footfall <Col N="782" />and turnover and things were going well.  Now, we have the reverse situation.  In fairness, the majority of local authorities are retaining rates at current levels.  However, they were good enough to increase them by 3% per annum while providing no extra service and they should now roll them back when the footfall, turnover and margin is not there for businesses.</P>
      <P>An issue that gets lost in the debate about self-employed people and small businesses is that nobody takes into consideration the self-employed person who works 100 hours a week.  Nobody in small businesses works 39 or 40 hours a week; the minimum any of them work is 80 hours a week but now they work up to 100 hours a week.  In many cases, they do not take a wage or salary from the business.  They are living from it but they do not take a wage or salary, and this is lost in the debate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">One of my constituents established three businesses in 2011 and employs 300 part-time and full-time workers.  When he established those businesses he did not receive even &euro;5 of an overdraft or stocking loan from his bank.  He received no assistance.  The problem is very acute in certain industries.  My family is involved in butchering where the price of stock has increased by 100% over the past two years.  Sheep now cost &euro;150 per head and animals cost up to &euro;1,200 per head, but people cannot get an increase in their stocking loans and banks have withdrawn overdrafts.  How can a businesses continue when the cost of the stock in which it trades has increased by between 50% and 100% but it has no stocking loan or overdraft facility to carry it?  It cannot do so.</P>
      <P Just="Left">With regard to receivership and insolvency which was mentioned, Revenue must be paid, banks must be paid and the last people to be paid are the creditors.  What happens then?  The creditors&rsquo; businesses close because they cannot pay Revenue, the banks or their creditors.  It has a domino effect down the line.  There should be a more equitable manner of dealing with insolvency and receivership whereby creditors receive something.  In the vast majority of cases they do not receive anything but there should be a <i>pro rata</i> payment system to Revenue, the banks and creditors.</P>
      <P>Former trading records and business records mean nothing to banks any more.  It means nothing to banks that a family business has been trading for 100, 120, 50 or 60 years.</P>
      <P>We must also be very careful about the following issue.  I know of companies that let go staff prior to Christmas to avail of the 60% redundancy rebate rather than the 15% redundancy rebate.  It was a bad move and we must be careful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Our topic of discussion is the No. 1 issue in the country and I will speak on the solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>Several people from Valentia and I published the Valentia Island Red Tape Report, which examined how bureaucracy was preventing job creation on the island.  Expanding on this microcosm highlights the number of private sector jobs that the Government is preventing from being created.  On Valentia Island, 72 full-time jobs, 42 short-term construction jobs and 25 seasonal jobs were being prevented by the Government.  If the Government could cut the red tape, private enterprise could create jobs for those who need them badly.</P>
      <P>I will give examples of the Government preventing job creation.  A marina was proposed for the island.  The breakwaters are in place, but the foreshore licensing process is too bureaucratic.  The Foreshore (Amendment) Act 2011 does not outline the timelines necessary to allow people <Col N="783" />to go through a process and get results quickly.  In one case in County Donegal, people have been trying to get a foreshore licence for four years.  Galway County Council went ahead and installed a pipe because it could wait no longer for the Department to make up its mind.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Some 35 jobs are being held up because the foreshore licence in respect of the Valentia marina is not being sorted out.  In one boatyard, a boat builder wanted to expand his operation but was prevented from creating 20 jobs by bureaucracy because a man who had a holiday home in the locality objected.  While this was the objector&rsquo;s right, in England and other jurisdictions one is only allowed to object if one is a full-time resident living within a certain distance of the site to which the planning application pertains.  A man who lived in the area for a few months per year objected and prevented 20 people from being employed.  The boatyard lost out on its tender for constructing rigid inflatable boats, RIBs, for the Irish Coast Guard.  It could have built RIBs more cheaply than the Irish Coast Guard, but the manufacturing job went to England.  We were borrowing money from the IMF to build RIBs in England when we could have created five jobs at home.  A hotel next to the marina wanted to expand but was told that it would not get planning permission because the infrastructure was not in place, that is, the sewage treatment system needed to be upgraded.</P>
      <P>I will turn to more comical job creation issues.  Someone wanted to install seaweed baths in an existing building, given that tourism is a major concern in County Kerry, but the person was refused permission.  One of the grounds for refusal was that the building could be seen from Sleigh Head.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has ever been to Sleigh Head near Dingle, but one would want very powerful binoculars to see Valentia Island, never mind the proposed seaweed baths.  The objection was made by An Taisce and did the State no service.  These were not reasonable grounds for objecting, but the Government believed it was a good idea to refuse permission to someone who would have created jobs.</P>
      <P>Bureaucracy, red tape, licensing issues and delay after delay prevented from proceeding, an art gallery, a retail unit and a scallop fishing endeavour that would have created 15 jobs.  In such situations, people eventually give up.  They cannot deal with this level of bureaucracy.  In a country that is starving for jobs and in the case of Valentia Island in particular, bureaucracy seems to be one of the greatest obstacles.  Although we need systems, they must work and be transparent.  As we all know from our constituents, they submit applications, provide the documents requested of them and, after the deadline has passed, are asked for even more, delaying the application process for months.</P>
      <P>We have discussed Seanad reform.  In light of our public consultation system, I suggest that organisations such as IBEC, the unions and those with an interest in creating jobs propose detailed, analysed legislation on how the Government can cut the red tape that is preventing job creation and ensure that people return to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLandy">
      <NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are in the second half of the debate and many of my points have already been made.  Several Senators referred to the role of enterprise boards and development companies in helping small businesses to start up and survive.  These two groups should be taken under the remit of local authorities.  In some cases, the people who need their services are not aware of their work, as they are not making themselves known in communities in the way they should.  The established position of local authorities in their communities would provide greater exposure to enterprise boards and development companies.  Greater democratic accountability would also be afforded to the dispersal of the moneys they provide to local businesses and entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In recent years, the level of grant assistance provided for enterprise boards has decreased, resulting in most boards running out of money by the end of the first quarter.  For the rest of the year, they have no money to provide for the applicants they accept.</P>
      <Col N="784" />
      
      <P>During the debate, a number of Senators referred to the ordinary, small town businesses, for example, butchers and bakers, that are closing down because of multiples entering their areas.  The five large multiples are Tesco, Dunne Stores and Superquinn.  The names of the fourth and fifth elude me.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Aldi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLandy">
      <NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
      <P>Aldi and Lidl.  Up to 80% of retail trade is handled by these multiples, leaving 20% for small businesses.  One might ask how this has happened in Ireland but not elsewhere in Europe.  Planning regulations in mainland Europe protect artisan businesses such as butchers, bakers, fishmongers, and so on.  In Ireland, we have allowed the Tescos of this world to sell everything from fish to meat to bread in store and unregulated.  Therefore, we have wiped out our towns&rsquo; artisan main street shops.</P>
      <P>It is not too late to do something about this.  Many towns have survived because the large multiples have not come to their doors yet, but they are on the way.  Something can be done for certain areas.</P>
      <P>Many Senators have discussed my next point, namely, commercial rates.  Some 13 staff work in the rates valuation office.  If a business or local authority applies for a general rates valuation for a town, it will likely need to wait years for it to be done.  The most recent valuations took place in Donegal.  In most cases, its property rates were decreased.</P>
      <P>The calculation of rates is a blunt instrument and no account is taken of a company&rsquo;s trading figures.  There must be a link between how a company is trading and the rates it pays.  If this was the case, we would have a fairer system.  I ask the Minister of State to take a serious look at this proposal.</P>
      <P>Many speakers, including Senators Sheahan and O&rsquo;Donovan, mentioned that smallbusinesses cannot get finance to sustain their businesses.  I have been contacted by manysmall businesses, which are limited companies, who have put vast amounts of money intotheir pension funds and who, because of current legislation, are unable to access thesepension funds which they wish to invest in sustaining or growing their businesses at full risk to themselves.  However, legislation to allow this would be required.  When legislation in this regard is introduced in the House in the coming weeks, the Minister of State should supportit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be here again.  I note there is to be a three-hour debate this afternoon on jobs ideas, which will be an important debate.  I discussed earlier with the Leader the importance of ensuring the advisory group, which is the group that advises Government on actions for business, receives a copy of the transcripts of that debate and is given an opportunity to respond.  Some great ideas were put forward during last week&rsquo;s debate, as I am sure will be the case today.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate today and last week on the report of the advisory group for small business, The Voice of Small Business &mdash; A Plan for Action.  I appreciate the quality of the interventions and acknowledge that many Members spoke from personal experience of running successful businesses and the challenges in that regard in the current economic climate.  I thank Senators Mary White, Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, Fergal Quinn, Tony Mulcahy and Jimmy Harte for their business insights.  Many useful points were made by all <Col N="785" />Senators.  The Government must listen to and take on board the many good ideas put forward by Members of this House.</P>
      <P>All Senators who contributed welcomed the setting up of the advisory group and the dialogue structures that have been put in place.  It is important that there is dialogue with people who have first-hand knowledge of operating a business.  The Government cannot create jobs but it can create the environment within which employers can retain and create new jobs.  I welcome publication of the group&rsquo;s first report, in respect of which I thank Senators for their respective contributions, which have been noted by the Department and will be brought to the attention of the advisory group who will listen in to this afternoon&rsquo;s debate on jobs ideas.  I thank Senators for their support of the work of the advisory group.  Small business is the backbone of this economy.  Access to credit is the lifeblood of business. People who run their own companies know only too well the difficulties currently being experienced in this regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Many Senators spoke about the no problem-no business concept.  Business is about problems and dealing with them.  The taxpayer has invested heavily in the banking sector and the banking sector is now duty bound to invest in companies that can create jobs.  This does not appear to be happening.  Senators also acknowledged the importance of the small business sector to the future well-being of the economy and local communities throughout the country.  Some Senators outlined examples of where small businesses can make a real difference to local employment, thereby helping to build local confidence and self-belief.  Management of local enterprise and artisan companies was mentioned.  It is important, in the context of regeneration of town centres, that the advantages of the stand-alone shop versus the multiple is taken into account.  It would be a real tragedy if, as is the case in the UK, all our town centres were closed down.  Planners must ensure this does not happen.  The message of building confidence and self-belief must be highlighted and encouraged at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>Practically all Senators who contributed to the debate over the two sessions referred specifically to access to credit as thekey issue facing small businesses at the current time.  I referred last week in my remarks to the Seanad, to the various initiatives taken by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to restructure and recapitalise the banking system, which is the Government&rsquo;s principal response to making the banks once again fit for purpose and in a position to make credit available to viable businesses.  The loan guarantee scheme and micro-finance funds are additional Government responses to supplement normal bank lending and to provide additional lending where specific measures are warranted.  However, this will not substitute for banks doing their job.  The banks have been well capitalised.  My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, is working to implement these two initiatives.  The pillar banks operate in an arms length capacity in relation to their operational issues.  It is a matter for the respective individual boards and management to determine and implement operational policy in their organisations.  Given AIB is in State ownership and the Government&rsquo;s stake in Bank of Ireland, it is important that these banks meet their obligations.</P>
      <P>Senator Clune highlighted the fact that when businesses are applying for credit they must have credible business plans.  As a businessman, I fully agree with this as I know the importance of being able to show the reasons for requiring credit and one&rsquo;s capacity to repay any loans from ongoing cash flow.  This is all about confidence in the economy.  A series of meetings are to be held with Mr. John Moran, head of banking, to discuss the issues pertaining to companies experiencing huge difficulties in terms of accessing funding.  Mr. John Trethowan, of the Credit Review Office, has commented on this issue in his quarterly reports.  Some &euro;3.5 billion has been invested in the two pillars and they must meet their obligations.</P>
      <Col N="786" />
      
      <P Just="Left">Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, working with Mr. John Trethowan, have developed standard credit application forms in order that customers can clearly see what information is required in support of an application.  This will ensure customers who wish to shop around between banks are not faced with different sets of information requests.  The application form has been standardised and simplified.  Where appropriate, small businesses can seek assistance from Government agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards to ensure that their business plans are as developed as possible.  It is important that viable small businesses refused credit are not afraid to use the banks&rsquo; internal appeals systems and that if this route proves unsuccessful, they consider seeking the assistance of the credit review office.  There is no question of the banks taking a negative view of customers who follow these procedures.  The more people who use these procedures, the better picture we will have in terms of the banks&rsquo; performance in meeting the needs of viable businesses.</P>
      <P>Small businesses also have statutory rights under the code of practice on SME lending, which is overseen by the Financial Regulator.  I highlighted last week that both pillar banks have given commitments to sanction lending over the period 2011 to 2013 as follows: at least &euro;3 billion in 2011; &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013.  It is important the banks deliver on this and do not, as suggested by some Senators, engage in reinventing or recapitalising existing loans.  The banks must engage in new lending rather than in reconfiguration of existing loans.  Senators Mulcahy, Comiskey, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, van Turnhout and Keane raised the issue of access to credit from banks.  That is very important.  The Government will monitor lending patterns to ensure banks honour commitments.  Furthermore, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will meet representatives of the banks to ensure the &euro;3.5 billion from both banks &mdash; or &euro;7 billion in total &mdash; will be lent to small companies.  We must see this benchmarked independently with Mr. Trethowan.  The Government will monitor the issue and I will return to the House to provide an update on the matter.</P>
      <P>This House will consider recommendations for business this afternoon and the Government is in listening mode.  The small business advice group will take on board recommendations from the Seanad.  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, this morning, and we are anxious to respond to that debate as all the contributions from today and last week are very important.  People do not want lip service and there should be a meaningful benefit for small companies.  The backbone of this economy is made up of 200,000 small companies employing 655,000 people.  We should never lose site of an employer and the wonderful initiatives such people take, in partnership with good staff, despite risk.</P>
      <P>As part of this monitoring process, we are also holding a series of regional meetings around the country in the coming weeks, with the banking section of the Department of Finance, to discuss access to bank credit with key local stakeholders.  I will be on that roadshow with Mr. John Moran from the Department.  It is important that when these meetings are advertised we get people to clearly debate the issues.  We will get small firms associations and representative bodies to attend as well.  These meetings will explore the findings of the latest Mazars survey on credit demand published by the Department of Finance late last year and look at the actions being taken by the Government to improve access to credit for SMEs.</P>
      <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s report from Enterprise Ireland indicated the highest export level ever in this country and that can lift the mood of the domestic economy.  There is much pessimism out there, even within some media outlets, and some of the companies and small businesses I have seen would lift the confidence of employers and the domestic economy.  It is amazing how jobs can be created, and people must be optimistic for the future.  Considering the successes of some extraordinary companies in Ireland, which I have seen at first hand, I am encouraged about <Col N="787" />the capability and competence of business people.  They know how to deal with recessions and can manage the crisis.</P>
      <P>The meetings will allow both our Departments to hear at first hand the views and experiences of local business representative groups, local bank representatives and State agencies on access to bank lending.  I very much look forward to fruitful and constructive exchanges at these meetings.  It is important that these meetings compliment the information provided by the Mazars survey and ensure that ongoing and future Government policies on credit to SMEs are based on as much information as possible and be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Mazars survey has shown that 36% of SMEs surveyed requested bank credit in the period April to September 2011, and when applications pending were excluded, 70% of those requests were approved.  With the 64% of SMEs which did not request bank credit in this period,80% did not need credit or had sufficient internal reserves and 7% believed the banks were not lending.  Access to the Mazars report is available through the Department of Finance website.  It is important to study it as it runs contrary to what one may hear from those in business.  We intend to have those meetings around the regions to discuss the findings of the report.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators John Kelly, Quinn, Mullen, Reilly and Harte highlighted the issue of red tape and administrative burdens being placed on small business.  We want to keep processes simple and issues such as the numbers of licences required to sell food, burdens placed on employers in the area of employment law and wage rates, rents and local authority rates costs have been raised.  These are important, and we must consider the number of inspectors that come to a company, and regulation.  Senator  Darragh O&rsquo;Brien mentioned Fingal, where rates have been reduced, and some local authority regions have tried their best not to increase them.  The cost of doing business by Government agencies must be reduced.  Initiatives are being taken by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, with regard to wage setting arrangements under EROs and REAs, which are addressing labour market costs and flexibilities.  I welcome the support for this.  The job was difficult because the arrangements have been in place since 1946, and Sunday is very much part of the working week now.  Any employer must take those changes into account when managing staff.</P>
      <P>Local authority structures and reforms have been highlighted and are also being advanced by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in consultation with his ministerial colleague, Deputy Bruton.  We will work on management within local authorities, volumetric water charges, refuse charges and other costs from local government on small companies.  These can be prohibitive and there may not be a return from local government.  We must encourage enterprise and small companies to retain staff.  It is far simpler to encourage employers to create a job than make somebody redundant.</P>
      <P>In my capacity as chairman of the high level group on business regulation, I am working across Departments with a view to reducing burdens on business.  Progress has already been made in a number of areas, including in my own Department, where we already have cut the administrative burden it places on business by 22%.  My Department has measured administrative burdens arising in three key areas of regulation, namely, company law, employment law and health and safety law, which amounted to some &euro;831 million per annum in costs for business, which is outrageous.  The Government&rsquo;s target is to reduce these burdens by 25%, and this dictates that &euro;208 million must be cut from these costs for business.  At this stage,  &euro;187 million of this &euro;208 million target has already been reached. We are also working across seven Departments and the Revenue Commissioners in reducing administrative burdens for business, and this work is to be completed by mid-2012.</P>
      <Col N="788" />
      
      <P>I am personally taking an initiative to convene &ldquo;simplification workshops&rdquo; in all the major areas of regulation affecting business.  These workshops will be arranged shortly around the country, and I would encourage business people to attend them and help us to identify the most practical ideas for reducing measured red tape costs. The advisory group&rsquo;s report also makes recommendations in this area and they will be progressed in consultation with the high level group on business regulation.  This is about cutting regulatory and administrative burden on companies.  We are anxious to get the report from Senators on today&rsquo;s debate and how they feel the regulatory burden can be eased.</P>
      <P>I also referred last week to the initiative to extend the 15-day prompt payments initiative beyond central Governments to the wider public sector in respect of all valid invoices received from 1 July 2011.  This is further assisting the cash flow of many small businesses.  Business can follow the lead of Government and do more in paying suppliers on time.  I will be discussing with relevant stakeholders the introduction of a voluntary code of practice for businesses to improve payment performance.  There is an opportunity for businesses, especially bigger businesses, to respond favourably to such an initiative and contribute to the stability of smaller businesses.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins mentioned the management of cash flow and it is important to consider other methods of funding, such as crowd financing.  The issue of enterprise boards was raised and there will be an announcement shortly regarding a single point of contact in every county for anybody establishing a company.  There will be a reconfiguration of enterprise boards and a new initiative with local government.  There will be a one-stop shop for doing business, involving a reconfiguration of services to eliminate duplication.</P>

      <P Just="Left">The matter of procurement was raised, particularly with regard to the &euro;15 billion of State contracts.  We had a meeting yesterday with the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, on procurement contracts for Irish companies.  We are considering a procedure that will allow small companies to access this critical area.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien raised the matter of credit and I advised him to send me details of the company to which he referred.  He also referred to the fact that the Fingal County manager had reduced rates by 60% and this is a model we will look at.  He emphasised the role of enterprise boards, mentoring and support for small companies, which are important issues.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien was also in agreement on wage rates and the back to work scheme, which is very important.  He made a point about the roll-over of commercial loans.  Regarding banking and giving facilities to businesses, the message is very clear that this is about jobs and supporting viable companies.  The banks have a critical role to play.</P>
      
      <P>Senator Harte made a point about the CSO figures released yesterday, which I have seen.  Managing our way out of the crisis is very important and mentoring ideas are important.  Senator Coghlan referred to monitoring banking and enterprise boards.  We are dealing with this.  Senator Hayden referred to unsecured creditors, which is an important point in respect of non-preferential creditors and the importance of just-in-time learning.  Mentoring companies, Plato Ireland and the ICT sector have great potential.  Dealing with the construction sector is also critically important.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to the loan guarantee scheme, which we must examine from the viewpoint of rents and rates.  Senator Sheahan referred to county enterprise boards, artisan products and trade.  It is important that we deal with that and rates and valuations are equally important.  Rates have a major effect on companies.  Senator Sheahan&rsquo;s point concerned bank<Col N="789" />ing.  Senator Daly used the example of the difficulties Government imposes on the development of companies, the potential of Valentia Island and the disincentive to create jobs.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">Getting enterprise boards working with local authorities and the recognition of small enterprise companies is very important.  I have tried to give due recognition to the points made over the two sessions.  If I failed to mention any Senator by name, I ask Members to accept my apologies.  I listened carefully to what has been said and I will give due consideration to the points made.  Small businesses are not just a vital part of the economy, they play a vital role in our society and in our local communities.  I refer to community regeneration and community enterprise, which we must tap into, and community economic development, which was very successful in past recessions.  It is amazing how one can get the regeneration of the community through community economic development companies.  We must look at this effective model once again.  It is about bringing the lifeblood into the empowerment of communities and the empowerment of business people who can give of their time in mentoring, which is very successful.</P>
      <P>The BIC Network is having what will be a very successful event in Cork in the coming weeks where 21 successful business people mentor start-up companies.  Many successful people have retired from companies and they can give of their time.  As Minister of State with responsibility for small business, I intend to continue to ensure that the business environment supports them.  Our future economic prospects depend on sustaining a strong entrepreneurial spirit, even in the face of unprecedented economic challenges.  The Government is focused on ensuring small businesses are supported in every way to develop their businesses, increase exports, create jobs and rebuild the economy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I thank every Senator for participating in this debate.  It is important to buy-in to this document.  Many reports were published in the past and it is very important that we empathise with business people.  We must recognise them, understand them, display concern and respect and the Government will give service to smaller companies that are the backbone of the economy.  They are run by the people who create up to five jobs.  If 25% of the 200,000 small companies created just one job, we would have 50,000 jobs at little or no cost to the State.  It is important to lift the mood of the economy and encourage people who have entrepreneurial ideas.  They should be encouraged and supported and the micro-finance fund will strongly support the commercialisation of knowledge through third level colleges.  This represents a major business opportunity.</P>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for setting aside time over two days in this very important discussion.  I look forward to coming back to this Chamber to discuss further reports.</P>

      <P>Issues raised last week will be taken on board.  My officials intend to reply to every Senator on the issues of concern.  The report has an impact on the job strategy, which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, will launch in the coming weeks.  Many issues that were raised last week will emerge once again in the important three-hour debate here this afternoon.  This is a work in progress and I welcome the Leader coming to the special advisory group with ideas from Senators.  I can arrange for Senator <Col N="790" />Cummins to speak to the advisory group on issues debated this afternoon and on some of the points made today and last week.  We do not have all the answers and the report is the benchmark of where we are starting from.  The five actions in the report have been acted upon.  The theme of the debate last week was access to credit, procurement and the regulatory burden on companies.  This is a question of recognition, understanding, concern and respect for that critical part of the economy.  All Members of the Oireachtas must be conscious of the importance of small business.  I value the input from Senators last week.  The views of Senators will go to the advisory group and the ideas that emerge this afternoon will be acted upon, hopefully in a way that will benefit all of us.  If I did not refer to an area specifically, it is because it would take too long and go beyond the time allowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for facilitating this important and innovative debate &mdash; it could even be termed a brainstorming session &mdash; which will prove useful and productive.  The high level of unemployment is the greatest challenge facing the country.  The loss of our best and brightest to emigration is impacting on nearly every family, community, club, organisation and business.  Our economic recovery is dependent on getting people back to work in order that income tax can be generated to pay for the many services provided by the State, while reducing the dependency on social welfare for the majority of those who want to be gainfully employed.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are in the worst global recession since the 1930s makes the creation of employment all the more challenging.  We need to think outside the box to consider what opportunities can be exploited to create badly needed employment.  It is true the Government does not create jobs, but it can create the environment in which they are created.  On taking office the Taoiseach said he wanted to make Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  Accordingly, the Government must focus on issues such as further improving our competitiveness, reducing bureaucracy, increasing funding from the banks which particularly affects small businesses, improving infrastructure and education and retaining the 12.5% corporation tax rate, as well as providing incentives for multinationals and indigenous companies to invest in job creation projects.</P>
      <P>Even in the midst of the recession, some sectors of the economy are performing well.  Last year exports by multinationals, particularly pharmaceutical and health care companies, were up 9%, making it the second highest figure on record.  Our trade surplus in 2011 amounted to &euro;4.3 billion, an increase of 16%.  Agricultural exports now amount to &euro;9 billion, with food exports up by 14% and dairy products by a whopping 28%.  The tourism sector showed significant growth in 2011, with an increase of 7% in visitor numbers.  These sectors have the potential to generate further growth and jobs.  The fact that eight out of ten of the world&rsquo;s largest medical device and pharmaceutical companies are located in Ireland gives IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland a major marketing advantage in their efforts to attract foreign direct investment.  Our improving competitiveness will help, but we must ensure we have in place the physical infrastructure and skilled personnel required by these companies if we are to benefit from the global economic upturn that will inevitably come in the next few years.</P>
      <P>There is much potential to generate growth and promote job creation in the tourism sector.  Ireland has a great tourism product, with the best food and hotels, for example.  We will celebrate many historical events in the next five years.  This year, the Eucharistic Congress will take place in Ireland and the Olympic Games in London.  When tourists visit Ireland, we need <Col N="791" />to attract them throughout out the country.  Travel costs are a major issue we need to address.  Heavily discounted rail and bus tickets should be available for tourists on producing their airline or ferry tickets.  This initiative needs to be marketed aggressively because, for example, the numbers travelling here to partake in angling activities have decreased significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>The construction sector caused many of our economic problems but it can help the economic recovery.  The Government should consider providing a grant or tax relief for a home improvement scheme targeted at older homes to make them more energy efficient, comfortable and adapted to cater for older, less mobile people.  Such a scheme would clean up some of the black economy issues because contractors engaged in this work would have to be registered and tax compliant.  A significant number of jobs could be created quickly.  An incentive to provide for the extension of family homes should be also considered where accommodation is provided for a family member who may be on a council housing list or in receipt of rent allowance. I suggest this because many young people will never have access to the money to finance their own homes.  This should be considered for rural Ireland, in particular, where sites are larger.</P>
      <P>We need to make it easier for people to switch from social welfare to work even on a temporary basis.  Many small employers say they find it difficult to attract people to take up part-time or short-term work because of the loss of benefits they will suffer and the waiting time to reclaim benefits.  It should be a simple system where one could go to an employment exchange and indicate that one worked for two days and claim for three days.  This would cut out the bureaucracy and make it easy for employers to take people on a short-term basis.</P>
      <P>The Government needs to take four actions to aid small businesses, namely, address the lack of credit provided by banks to viable businesses; reduce red tape; link the rates system to turnover or profitability; and give a financial incentive to companies to hire additional employees with a baseline of 31 December 2011.  The Government should also examine the service it provides and consider if the private sector could deliver a better and more cost effective service.  I suggest this against the backdrop of decreasing numbers in the public service.  A good example is a home help service provided for the elderly in my area by Roscommon Home Services.  Last year, it added 70 new workers because of the demand for its services.</P>
      <P>We need to properly resource county enterprise boards.  There are many unemployed people with skills and ideas who could create jobs.  They are easy to access, the minimum of red tape would need to be overcome and they have a proven track record.  Many successful small businesses were given a start by a county enterprise board and we should have a county by county call for ideas.  A job creation supremo or ambassador should be appointed who would report to the Minister to centrally co-ordinate all employment initiatives introduced by Departments, State agencies, businesses, employers, colleges and universities.  This person would link employment strategy in the private sector with training and education and the policies of the Government and State agencies.  I very much welcome the debate and I hope many good ideas will evolve from it.  I look forward to the Minister bringing them forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to focus on countries that will be the new engines of growth for Ireland such as Russia, China and India.  As Senator Mullins said, Bord Bia reported last week that sales in the agrifood sector increased by &euro;1 billion last year but we are still relying too much on the UK market, given 41% of food and drink products were exported to that market.  It is not good enough that we are still so heavily reliant on this market.</P>
      <P>Exports have increased to the Netherlands, Germany and France but my message is that the Government needs to invest in teaching the languages used in the new engines of growth, such as Russia, South America, India and China.  My experience of setting up a business began in a kitchen and involved going on the road burning shoe leather to generate sales.  My purpose <Col N="792" />was to create employment.  We did not have a marketing budget and all the money had to go into production.  I had to carry boxes in cars and on buses and trains and I put a large number of boxes on the carousel in Moscow airport when I started selling Lir chocolates in Russia.  Britain has traded for hundreds of years but, because we were colonised for more than 800 years, we have only got into trading in recent decades.  Irish people prefer to market rather than sell in my experience.  One has to have fire in one&rsquo;s belly to sell.  One cannot be afraid of rejection and I understand that having been there myself.  It is much different from cold calling such as when one is canvassing for a Seanad nomination and is trying to get the message across that one is a decent, trustworthy person with whom to do business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
      <P>China has 1.3 billion people, almost 20% of the world&rsquo;s population, while Russia&rsquo;s population is 143 million and South America has 590 million people.  The Government should invest in every level of education, beginning at primary level, in order that people learn more foreign languages such as Mandarin, Russian and Spanish.  It is tremendous to be able to speak French and German and I do not take from that but the new engines of growth are Russia, China, South America and India.  We must be able to communicate in their language.  It will help business people on the way but they still have to cut the deal and make the sale.  We need to become multilingual in order that when we break into new markets, we can speak, for example, Mandarin, Russian and Spanish.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade recently signed a trade agreement with Russia.  Typically, Ministers are accompanied by business people on trade missions.  That is pleasant and nice from a social perspective but the difficult part is doing the hard sell with one&rsquo;s product and convincing somebody to take it.  I hope I am getting my point across that we need to have proficiency in languages, the new engine of growth.  I ask Senators to, please, bear with me on the cost issue, already mentioned by Senator Michael Mullins.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ger Tighe, Townsend Street, Dublin has gone to the trouble of writing to me about labour costs in Ireland.  According to EUROSTAT, in 2008 hourly labour costs were 60% higher in the Twenty-six Counties than in the Six Counties.  Operating costs in the North are highly competitive, with typical salaries in the financial services sector approximately 30% below those in Dublin.  While we hear talk from the Government about competitiveness, there is no action.  The Government can do something about electricity costs.  Our gas prices are 4.76% higher than those in the rest of the eurozone countries and 52% higher than the UK average.  Electricity prices in Ireland are 19.3% higher than the eurozone country average and the UK average.  I do not know how we can compete.  Some 41% of our business is done in the United Kingdom.  It is much cheaper to manufacture and do business in the North than it is here.  Irish people need to get out of their comfort zone, not just be into marketing and fancy plans.  They need to have the stomach to go out, sell and promote their products.  David Dand &mdash; may he rest in peace &mdash; carried bags of bottles around Europe to promote the Baileys brand.  As I did the same with Lir chocolates, I know it is not easy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on job creation ideas is very important.  Governments do not create jobs &mdash; except in the public service &mdash; and as the Government is committed to reducing numbers in the public service, that avenue is closed off to us.  Therefore, if the Government cannot create jobs, we can certainly create the framework in which jobs can be created.  Multinationals account for 2% of enterprises in Ireland, yet they account for about 20% of employment.  More than 200,000 enterprises trade in the State, employing 900,000 people.  Some 90% of SMEs employ fewer than ten people.  If we are to create this framework, there is a great number of things the Government could do and we would do well to concentrate our attention on the small and medium enterprise sector.  We need to support SMEs to help them to maintain and increase the numbers in employment.</P>
      <P>The lifeblood of business is access to credit.  A recent ISME study shows that nearly half of small and medium-sized enterprises were refused credit in the past three months, which means that Ireland ranks second only to Greece in credit refusals.  While the banks will dispute these figures, we must ask whether they have given us any reason to believe them.  We all know the answer to this question.  A feature of Irish lending practice that is so pervasive that it is taken for granted by many borrowers is the provision of personal guarantees.  We might make an argument that banks wish to collateralise their loans which may be fair enough, but when we see this being applied to limited companies, we should be suspicious.  Limited companies limit the liability of company owners in order that personal assets are not put at risk.  The owners are protected from their creditors, but with personal guarantees the banks retain a claim on personal assets.  It seems strange that the institutions charged with providing capital forcompanies, the core job of which is to access and manage risk, are the only ones to have a claim on the personal assets of owners.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We have seen how personal guarantees were required for access to credit for many of the biggest construction companies in recent years and can see exactly how useless they proved to be in covering loans.  No amount of personal assets could guarantee the borrowing of hundreds of millions of euro, nor was it the function of the personal guarantee in these instances.  It seems the banks were relying on personal guarantees to concentrate the minds of borrowers on the business discipline required to repay borrowings.  However, these guarantees distracted the lending institutions from the real issues around repaying loans, issues such as the core potential of companies to repay borrowings, based on realistic business plans and properanalysis of their ability to repay.  The guarantees helped to create the very problems they had been designed to prevent.  However, no lessons were learned.  The banks continue to insist on the provision of personal guarantees.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to several business people in recent weeks about this issue.  A robust business plan was produced in all cases of persons seeking credit and the credit meeting went well until the issue of personal guarantees was raised by the bank.  Without the personal guarantee, there would be no loan.  The quality of the business plan and the potential of the business were not enough; they were hardly even assessed by the lending institutions.  The single criterion for granting loans was the owners&rsquo; personal assets and ability of these assets to repay the loan.  One company had a turnover of more than &euro;5 million and the loan sought was &euro;60,000.  Without a personal guarantee, the loan was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinConway">
      <NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>It is shocking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  In another case a company lodged &euro;400,000 on deposit &mdash; venture money that had been gathered.  A &euro;40,000 balance was required for the business to set up.  Again, the meeting with the lending institution went well until the issue of the personal <Col N="794" />guarantee was raised.  The loan was refused without a personal guarantee, even though the &euro;400,000 would be spent before the overdraft came into play.  The creation of eight jobs remains at risk and will probably not be created.</P>
      <P>I could talk about this isue all day because I have been very active on it in recent months.  A final case concerns a borrower who was asked by the bank to provide a retrospective personal guarantee for a loan taken out two years previously, which is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
      <P>It is crazy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we think the provision of personal guarantees is a problem, the problem is compounded by the requirement of some banks for all directors to provide a personal guarantee which makes all directors of a company jointly and severally responsible.  Therefore, for a company with five directors seeking a loan of, for example, &euro;10,000, each of the directors is responsible for the full &euro;10,000, instead of the directors being responsible for &euro;2,000 each, allowing the company to spread the risk.</P>
      <P>We have sympathy for the lender which wishes to reduce risk and it is prudent that it do so, but we cannot tolerate the lender which wishes to eliminate it completely.  That is not the function of the banking industry, unless, of course, we wish to see it become the growth industry, instead of conducting business as a bank should.  The core duty of a bank in this regard is to channel capital into the more important areas of the economy.  We own the banks and need to decide what we want to do.  Do we want the banks to dictate economic activity and stifle it as they are doing or can we do something more?  The banks have moved full circle &mdash; from being profligate in the past to being completely risk averse today.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the issue of personal guarantees and see if this practice is restricting access to credit as the anecdotal evidence suggests it is.  If so, I would go so far as to suggest he should introduce legislation, if deemed necessary, to ban the giving of personal guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone">
      <NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I thank the Leader for holding this think tank session on job creation because the topic is not only of great significance but also timely.  Last week the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, said: &ldquo;As a society and as a Government, we must become obsessed with jobs.&rdquo;  I have two messages for him and they will form the shape of my intervention.</P>
      <P>The first message is that social innovation delivers jobs and the second is that the jobs action plan must include social innovation proposals.  I am a social entrepreneur.  I have fire in my belly, Senator White, but it is not for selling &mdash; it is for something else.  I bring an entrepreneurial and innovative determination to solving social problems.  Some 25 years ago, my life partner, Dr. Ann Louise Gilligan, and I established a community organisation with and for people living in Tallaght.  The problem was poverty, especially women&rsquo;s poverty, and the solution was education.  This was our simple formula back in 1986.  We started with 12 women and one course in our sitting room in the Shanty and now we have a large multi-purpose building, An Cos&aacute;n, in Jobstown, which educates more than 400 adults and 200 children each year.  Recently, we set up Fledglings, a not-for-profit social franchise model for the provision of early years education and care services with five centres having already been established.</P>
      <P>What has been the impact of these works?  Thousands of people from Tallaght, through education and subsequent employment, have broken the intergenerational cycle of poverty.  In terms of the House&rsquo;s debate, this example is helpful, not only for the social impact achieved, but also for the number of jobs that the organisation has delivered in a sustainable way.  An <Col N="795" />Cos&aacute;n employs 105 people, 90% of whom are from Tallaght, and contributes &euro;760,000 to the local Tallaght economy and &euro;515,000 to the Exchequer by way of taxes.</P>
      <P>I will highlight the Jack and Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation, founded by my colleague, Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, which is another case of social innovation that provides care and support for children with severe neurological development issues and offers respite to parents and families.  It has created 17 full-time jobs and has a network of 1,000 carers across the country.  Other Senators may have undertaken projects in this regard, but these two case studies have delivered jobs and social solutions.</P>
      <P>Social innovation meets social needs and contributes to economic growth.  Social entrepreneurs tackle entrenched social and environmental problems for the benefit of society.  Social enterprises are organisations or businesses set up to tackle social, economic or environmental issues that engage in trading or commercial activities to pursue these objectives.  We are not profit driven and we use excess income, if we have any, to further our social mission rather than to benefit owners and shareholders.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, chaired by Mr. Declan Ryan, is a prime mover in the field of social innovation and supports more than 150 social entrepreneurs to grow social change and create jobs.  Each of these entrepreneurs has created on average 23 employment opportunities.  I will reschedule a briefing by them for next week.  According to figures in the report of the social enterprise task force chaired by Mr. Maurice Healy, the social enterprise sector employs more than 9,300 people, a great many jobs.  If the sector is supported properly, it holds considerable potential for thousands more jobs.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Bruton, stated that the jobs action plan will focus on &ldquo;the changes necessary to make jobs a priority in this society.&rdquo;  One prime change is the need to drive the growth and development of the social enterprise sector.  The Government included such a commitment in its programme to build national recovery.  The jobs action plan, which we have been promised will be with us relatively soon, should include social innovation proposals.  Some well-researched proposals include: designating a Minister of State with responsibility for the social entrepreneurship and social enterprise sector; establishing a social innovation unit within the responsible Minister of State&rsquo;s Department to drive the formulation and execution of policy at national and local level; incorporating social entrepreneurship and social enterprise into the brief of county enterprise boards, CEBs, Enterprise Ireland and local authorities&rsquo; community and enterprise sections; and creating a social innovation fund by developing a new partnership between the Government and private investors, in this case philanthropists.  For example, the UK&rsquo;s Big Society Capital group offers &pound;600 million of equity in Britain.  This is viewed as an investment to bridge the social divide.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Social innovation delivers jobs, increases well-being &mdash; as many of us know from the briefing provided by the Central Statistics Office.  The CSO defines well-being as an increase in income, more employment and less deprivation.  Social innovation also contributes to the reversal of an erosion of our social as well as economic sovereignty.  I hope we will see proposals such as the ones I have outlined in the new jobs plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the jobs action plan will focus on the short term, as the most pressing issue for everyone is the need for jobs to be created in the short term.  I have never been and probably never will be one for airy fairy ideas, for example, that there might be a market for X, Y or Z in 20 or 30 years time.  We need to start creating jobs and producing now.</P>
      <P>To this end, I am involved with a group that is developing a hydroelectric station in south County Kerry.  To give the House an idea of the project&rsquo;s scale, 300 jobs would be created during the three years of construction and the dam would measure 1.25 sqare miles.  The water <Col N="796" />would be pumped by windmills from the sea into the mountains and the lake.  On its way back down, it would turn the turbines to create electricity, which would be transmitted by underwater cable to Moneypoint.  An investment of &euro;3 billion is required and all Government agencies need to come on board.</P>
      <P>When I first raised this idea at committee level, the response of a member of staff at the then Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food told me a great deal about bureaucracy.  I grasped the idea as a way forward in terms of significant job creation, but the departmental official&rsquo;s first reaction was to throw eight or ten obstacles at me one after another, including the need for offshore and foreshore licences.  This was an indictment of the type of advice and people involved in this area.  I hope that the relevant Government agencies can work together to bring the project to fruition.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Our nearest neighbour, Great Britain, will need to import electricity from 2015 until 2035, presenting us with a 20-year market.  We are Britain&rsquo;s nearest neighbour and have that electricity.  Just in case anyone is wondering where we will get the &euro;3 billion from, the funding is already available, but I want the agencies to do what must be done to bring the project to fruition.</P>
      <P>On a smaller scale, the majority of my constituency is coastal.  A member of the community approached me some time ago regarding job creation.  Although the timing is ironic, I have in my possession three letters from companies that run cruise holidays and are seeking somewhere to berth in Kerry.  Their ships carry anywhere between 1,500 and 6,000 tourists who, by and large, are well-heeled, retirees or just people who have come into a few pounds and have always wanted to take a cruise.  A small investment in the renovation and extension of a pier in my constituency would result in 30,000 extra visitors to south Kerry.  I recently told the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, in response to his statement that no money was available for capital investment, that regeneration of Limerick, which is costing billions of euro, is going ahead and that &euro;2 million would regenerate the whole of south Kerry.  Three different companies have expressed an interest in berthing on the Kerry coast.  The Government must play its part.  I do not believe the response from the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that he does not have &euro;1.5 million, which would assist in the creation of hundreds of jobs, was satisfactory.  Funding must be ring-fenced for special projects which can create jobs.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I want to focus today on the need for us to recognise the necessity for, not alone financial but cultural investment in technology, bio-medicine, in particular science and general research.  I was reminded recently of the famous and, it is hoped, apocryphal story about George Bush junior when he said the trouble with the French was that they did not have a word for &ldquo;entrepreneur&rdquo;.  The phrase &ldquo;social entrepreneur&rdquo; has emerged recently.  It has dawned on me that I am one, although I did not realise it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCrown">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of other work in which I was engaged in recent days, I did a little mental arithmetic on a small nugget initiative which we started approximately 11 or 12 years ago, which I reckon has brought tens of millions of euro into the country and has probably created approximately 200 jobs, namely, formalising the arrangement of the country for to conduct cancer clinical research.  I will try not bore the House with all the details.  However, as new drugs become available for cancer patients, they must be trialed and studied, <Col N="797" />sadly in patients&rsquo; whose cancers are far advanced, who have no other option and who may be desperate and willing to try anything, even if speculative.  As the drug becomes a little more established in terms of what it can and cannot do, it is then given, in conjunction with existing treatment, to patients who, perhaps, have a slightly better outlook in terms of their cancer.  Needless to say the ethical, legal and professional considerations in organising this endeavour are complex. </P>
      <P Just="Left">Internationally, large organisations are primarily focused on ethical research conducted under the aegis of the Helsinki treaty and on research which is scientifically appropriate in terms of providing answers in regard to whether new treatments are actually better.  Sadly, with the exception of some heroic figures, including Professor Shaun McCann who undertook this work on leukemia patients in St. James&rsquo;s and Professor Tom Hennessy, who did it also in St. James&rsquo;s on patients with oesophagus cancer, there is no global Irish network for doing this.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In 1997, my colleague, Professor John Armstrong and I, established the Irish Co-operative Oncology Research Group on &mdash; to say it was a shoe-string budget would be an exaggeration &mdash; no budget.  The feeling at the time was that in Ireland the first item on the agenda &mdash; to quote Brendan Behan &mdash; at the first meeting of any new organisation is the split.  We did not have a split.  We survived and did what people thought was not possible, namely, we got all the cancer specialists in the country to join the organisation.  While originally there were only a few of us, the organisation now comprises 350 members, including oncologists, surgeons, radiotherapists, cancer-focused nurses and scientists.  What is more, a country that was putting no patients on international breast cancer studies recently placed its 7,000th patient on one.  As a result of this, a number of drugs, including, Herceptin, which have been shown to be life prolonging, life saving and quality of life enhancing in patients with breast cancer have been made available to Irish patients years in advance of when they would otherwise have been made available.  Another drug, Gleevec, is being used to treat leukemia.  As a result of the existence of ICORG patients are receiving treatment approximately two years ahead of the European average.  As such, there are many people alive who would not be alive but for the existence of this group.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Needless to say, we were fairly self-congratulatory about what we had achieved.  We were also happy that we had brought millions of euro worth of free drugs into the country.  One of two papers from Ireland included in the <i>New</i><i>England Journal of Medicine</i> in October was mine on behalf of ICORG.  This journal is the world&rsquo;s leading medical journal.  This would not have happened had ICORG not been established.  This has enabled young people to see the benefits of a career in oncology and to develop a love for research and be stimulated by it.  It has also been great for patients.  One of my happiest moments was approximately eight or nine years ago when a patient thanked me for information on a particular treatment and then asked, &ldquo;Is there a trial because I would like to join a trial?&rdquo;  It is completely part of culture for people to do this now.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As regards job impact, ICORG receives funding from a mixture of sources, including philanthropic sources, companies in respect of studies, the cancer society and, increasingly, through the health research board by way of peer reviewed grants, which are rigorously applied for and reviewed by international review panels.  As a result, there are approximately 100 people working for ICORG, 20 in the central office in Dublin and 80 mostly research nurses dispersed across various hospital sites in the country who are available to patients wishing to join trials and to ensure a high level of compliance.  Patients from as far away as Letterkenny, Limerick, Waterford and Galway can now join ICORG studies.  They can get access to drugs to which they would not otherwise have had access.</P>
      <Col N="798" />
      <P>It dawned on us lately that to service the sophisticated needs of the trials, the international drug companies, whose affiliates in Ireland were previously no more than a couple of representatives driving around the country giving out biros and selling drugs, now have research and development and clinical trials offices, which we estimate have created 150 highly paid jobs here, which are entirely funded from external sources.  This is about as close to win-win as one can get.  I know, having had the privilege of meeting and discussing these issues with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, that he is well disposed towards research.  We need to keep this issue on his agenda and on the agenda of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We could replicate this in every area of biomedicine in Ireland, including in cardiology &mdash;  we have one of the highest rates of heart attacks &mdash; and in the treatment of arthritis and diabetes.  I believe this could result in hundreds, if not thousands, of highly paid jobs and in the attraction of a huge amount of investment.  Investment tends to raise standards in the health service.</P>
      <P>As I have stated several times before, if we are to change this culture, it is essential that every student in Ireland studies science until the day they leave school.  Whether they intend a career in science, it is important that they understand it if they are to be part of the national debate on scientific advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I note the reaction of the children in the Visitors Gallery to Senator Crown&rsquo;s suggestion that the study of science the whole way through school should be compulsory.  It is certainly an innovative suggestion.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is a new departure for the Seanad to hold an idea-sharing or, as others have described it, a &ldquo;think tank&rdquo; session in which we can generate ideas and new concepts on job creation which we will then share with the Minister and will feed into the policy process on job creation.  I agree with those colleagues who pointed out how important and vital job creation is for the future of the economy and in terms of us pulling ourselves out of the current economic crisis we are experiencing.  Some excellent ideas have been already put forward.  This shows the strength of the Seanad and the wide range of different experiences and expertise which each Senator brings.  I note, as I look around the Chamber, the number of people here who could be described as entrepreneurs, social or commercial or both.</P>
      <P>Some of the ideas put forward, including the social innovation office and job supremo, are useful ideas that will help the Government in facilitating the creation of jobs.  As Senator Gilroy stated, we must be mindful of Government&rsquo;s role in this.  I would like to address two points.  My first is an idea not for job creation but for job support and retention of jobs.  This was referred to in the Unite trade union&rsquo;s submission of May last to the Government&rsquo;s job initiative.  It is a concept I came across with the German model &mdash; its car manufacturing industry in particular &mdash; and what happens when there is a downturn in consumption and the purchasing of cars, as happens from time to time internationally.  One finds that in certain L&auml;nder, or states, there is a very well developed subsidy scheme where employees are kept on, retaining the jobs in car manufacturing, but there is a subsidy from the state.  It saves the state having to support the payment of redundancy and people from going on social welfare.  The state ends up subsidising private industry to some extent.  Unite has referred to this as the &ldquo;exceptional short time working scheme&rdquo; and points out that it has worked in other European countries, and as I mentioned, I am familiar with the German scheme.  It allows employees reduce working hours without loss of job or income.  Essentially, individuals employed in the car manufacturing industry go on shorter weeks of two to three days and are paid a reduced wage topped up by the state.  This keeps people in work and the employer&rsquo;s business going while saving the state in the long term by retaining jobs.  We should consider it here for certain areas and sectors.</P>
      <Col N="799" />
      <P>Another idea comes from my background in legal training and education.  To those who believe the public sector is bereft of entrepreneurial ability, I argue there are many examples of entrepreneurs created from the university sector.  Some of our most successful indigenous companies have come from academia.  I am currently on unpaid leave from the law school in Trinity and colleagues some years ago set up a very successful masters in law programme that has generated a significant amount of income for the university and the law school.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Having spoken to legal colleagues, I wanted to try to use that experience.  A key idea would be to export legal services, particularly in legal education, in which we have a very good reputation.  I trained at the bar in London and saw that at the Inns of Court School of Law, a large number of people &mdash; generally from the Commonwealth but also from other countries &mdash; came to London not just to study academic law but also to take a professional training course that would qualify them for the bar of England and their home countries.  It occurs to me it would be very useful model for us to use as an English-speaking nation steeped in the same common law tradition.  We could consider such markets, many of which are emerging, and the universities are already targeting those student numbers.  We could also consider this in light of professional legal training.  Universities are already looking to build on that process.</P>
      <P>We will have a debate on the Legal Services Regulation Bill, which envisages the opening up of professional legal training to the university sector beyond the current professional bodies.  There are also opportunities for expanding the body of students we envisage teaching.  There is a very sad fact of life in legal training currently in that we are educating many of our own students for export, and it is very hard for recent graduates in Ireland to get work in the legal professions.  We must consider how to take a positive from the level of legal education we can offer by looking to offer it to people from other countries, in anticipation that such people would return to their countries with the benefit of legal training here.  We could expand the legal education system in that way, not only creating jobs but a great deal of good will.  It would strengthen our links with many countries.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Somebody mentioned our trade links with Libya and there are immense opportunities for us in developing further links with countries in the Middle East, north Africa and in the Far East, where there are many emerging markets, as others have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkDaly">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a timely and most welcome debate.  We should have more like it.  I suggest an amendment to its content, and the public consultation committee, of which I am a member, could play a role.  The proposal is for experts in different fields of business, education and law &mdash; there are some experts in this room &mdash; to be invited to the Seanad Chamber with the relevant line Minister to outline detailed and specific proposals on legislation or statutory instruments that affect job creation in the country.  This should not be a brief debate where we argue that a Minister should change the law relating to planning or foreshore licences, for example, because they prevent job creation.  We should examine legislation, amendments and how they affect EU law.  We must ensure that we do not breach EU regulations.  We should ask representatives of the organisations which are greatly affected by the laws we create here, although the regulations may be unintentionally preventing job creation.  Those affected should come before us with proposals to change the laws.</P>
      
      <P>I suggest we have a session like this on a Thursday afternoon every fortnight.  There is no more pressing job now than creating employment for people in this country.  If the call goes out through the public consultation committee inviting organisations to come before us to make detailed presentations on the legislation we need to change to help create jobs or prevent job losses, there could be a role for the Seanad.  I know there is no Minister present today but we should have a line Minister involved.  A briefing would be given well in advance to which the Minister could respond.  The proposals should be detailed, including, for example, the amount <Col N="800" />of jobs that could be created.  Nobody should be brought in just to make a pitch, for example, to change foreshore licences, etc.  That is not a good enough day&rsquo;s work, and we must work in a specific and detailed way on the required changes.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I spoke in the earlier debate on what is preventing job creation.  We did the Valentia Island red tape report as an exercise in Kerry.  The island has a population of approximately 600, which is falling, and we found that 72 jobs could not be created because of Government red tape.  That is aside from access to funds in the banks, which is another issue.  The jobs in question are viable, as a marina is being funded by the private sector but the foreshore licensing system is difficult, bureaucratic and not streamlined, despite the fact that we introduced a new piece of legislation recently.  Those difficulties mean 35 jobs will not be created.  There is a hotel across from the marina but the infrastructure is not in place.  Although the funding was available, bureaucracy means the hotel cannot expand.  A boat yard that could also create jobs is also seeing planning objections from outside the area, which are not allowed in England.  A person should have the right to object if he or she lived within a certain radius full time but people coming for a few weeks every year are objecting to this proposal, so the planning application has been stopped.</P>
      
      <P>The issue preventing the creation of jobs can be within the Government.  We all know the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Government do not create jobs but rather the framework to do so.  We are not in the business of giving jobs to people, as it is not sustainable.  The private sector creates employment and it is our job to facilitate that.  The public consultation committee and its structure could facilitate industry representatives in coming before us to outline what legislative changes are required to help create jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">This exercise is most important, as everybody has said, and it may prove very useful if any good ideas are aired.  It could prove very worthwhile and the ideas could be a great aid to the Government if it listens to them.  As several speakers have mentioned, we all know the importance in business of access to credit, and unfortunately, there is a lack of credit and capital currently that is hindering job creation.  The Government&rsquo;s partial loan guarantee scheme should be introduced without delay and must be larger than the proposed &euro;150 million per annum over three years.  The microfinance loan fund must be accessible as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>On the cost of doing business, further employment incentives should be introduced such as granting tax credits to employers for every unemployed individual hired and retained for a certain period, for example, one year.  Firms should be encouraged to reduce business costs, including by way of managing stock levels, reducing waste and identifying ways to increase productivity.</P>
      <P>Reform of the system of local authority funding is vital.  We should accelerate the introduction of the annual property tax and water charges to ensure commercial rates will not remain a burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.  We should also reduce the number of licences or permits required by a single business for operation.  Their cost as well as the renewal process for them can be particularly onerous.</P>
      <P>On public sector procurement, we should enable greater access to public tenders by small and medium-sized enterprises by reducing the administrative burden and not having rigid application criteria.  Firms have also complained about the absence of formal appeals mechanisms.  This should be put right and the Government should be open to consortium bids from SMEs.  Tenders could be split into lots, where appropriate.</P>
      <Col N="801" />
      <P>We should do more to make the public more aware of the impact of black economy activity on legitimate businesses which are suffering in certain areas.  A centralised advisory service would assist small firms in producing a credible business plan for banks and credit unions when attempting to access credit.  The creation of a one-stop shop information web portal for small business and potential entrepreneurs would also be a great help.</P>
      
      <P>With the right structures and incentives in place, there must be an opportunity for Ireland to develop and market itself as a global centre of choice for the management, licensing and trading of intellectual property.  I refer to patents, copyright, design rights and trademarks.</P>

      <P>I commend Members for suggesting we bring this very important matter to the fore to elicit ideas on job creation.  This is the foremost consideration for every citizen and I am glad to say that the Government is committed to tackling the issue of unemployment.  We saw this recently in our efforts to create jobs through various initiatives such as the JobBridge programme, the jobs initiative and the reduction in VAT for the tourism sector.</P>
      <P>This is a very significant issue affecting every city, town, village and household.  In particular, rural towns are dying a death as they watch their best and brightest leave in search of pastures new.  Consequently, there is a sociological impact, whereby the whole fabric of communities is being destroyed.  I know of areas in which there are not enough players available to field a GAA team because team members are living in Sydney.  I know of towns that look no different at the weekend than on a Monday night because most of the youth are in Canada and those who are left feel there is no hope for the future.</P>
      <P>This did not happen by accident.  We only have to look back over what happened in the past few years and at the mismanagement of the economy and the economic armageddon bequeathed to us by the previous Government.  We must look at both the good and the bad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is clear &mdash; we offer access to a highly skilled workforce, speak English and have a low corporation tax rate which must not be touched.  Our cost competitiveness has improved and we have built a critical mass of firms in a number of important <Col N="802" />industries such as pharmaceuticals, Internet and financial services.  In turn, this sends a strong message internationally and bolsters our credibility as a place in which to do business.</P>
      <P>Let us put the good news story in respect of foreign direct investment in a national context.  In 2011 approximately 1,930 Irish companies failed.  That means almost 160 companies collapsed every month last year.  These figures include only corporate insolvencies and do not take account of sole traders or partnership failures, for which there are no official statistics available.  It is plausible to assume that, for the most part, these were indigenous Irish companies.  Therefore, it is imperative that we reverse this statistic through the lifeblood of credit.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As public representatives, we have been contacted by businesses about the non-availability of finance from banks.  While I welcome the announcement made in the budget by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that he has set a lending target of &euro;3.5 billion for Bank of Ireland and AIB to SMEs, I highlight my concerns in this regard, as I have been made aware of an ugly practice rearing its head.  I understand customers of these banks are having their overdraft facilities withdrawn, with unreasonable notice periods in many cases.  The banks are putting the business people of Ireland under duress by forcing them to convert their overdraft facilities to term loans.  They are effectively recycling loans masqueraded as new lending.  This practice is not helping businesses or businesspeople and it is certainly not helping to create new jobs.  As a result, we urgently need to take steps to rectify the matter because, without credit flowing through the economic arteries, we will not help businesses to grow and expand and will thus fail to create jobs.  I suggest we ignore the loan approval statistics and focus on the drawdown figures in order to secure an accurate reflection of what is going on.</P>
      <P>Other aspects are hindering the prospects of good Irish businesses growing and developing.  We only have to look at the tendering processes for any State contract in Ireland.  In many cases, Irish businesses which hope to compete for these contracts are stymied by the requirement that they must have a turnover of over &euro;1 million.  In the light of the harrowing statistics for business failures in Ireland in 2011, we need to eradicate this prerequisite and encourage Irish businesses to grow and develop and compete for these contracts which, in turn, will help to create Irish jobs.</P>
      <P>We need to look further at our education model.  I am advised that we have major shortages in the information communications technology sector.  In particular, many software companies cannot find suitably qualified engineers.  We must, therefore, look at providing subsidised training to bridge the gap.  Furthermore, we must help indigenous companies to gain access to suitably qualified staff; therefore, courses should be run locally, perhaps in VECs, in order to cater for these requirements, which might limit the outsourcing of services and thus create home-grown jobs.</P>
      <P>We have to reduce the overbearing bureaucracy in the Companies Registration Office.  While I understand and respect the employees of this office have a code to adhere to, I know of one instance where a man sought to register a new business with the word &ldquo;global&rdquo; in the title.  However, he was informed that this was not possible.  He went to England and registered his business there, thus creating jobs in another country.  We need to put a halt to this unfortunate practice and need to do it now.</P>

      <P>We have huge potential in this country.  I will focus on the area in which I have expertise, the arts, media, culture, language and natural resources.  If we can capitalise on our culture, there is great potential.  To this end, a section was set up in the business department in DCU, <Col N="803" />called Fiontar DCU.  The person who set it up, Fionnbarra &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, also established a number of projects to examine the Irish language and the possibility of initiating projects based on it.</P>
      <P>Gaillimh le Gaeilge has been operating for 20 years to convince businesses that it is in their interests to use the Irish language.  Recent research shows having bilingual signs and staff is worth &euro;136 million a year to Galway.  If this could be matched nationwide and done in every town and city with some seed funding, we could turn this into an island on which everyone would be bilingual, which would give us an added benefit when trying to sell the country from a tourism point of view.</P>
      <P>I attended a think tank with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, in Galway a while back, at which we met people from various arts groups.  Somebody asked why an artist was not put on every State board because artists brought creative thinking to problem solving.  We tend to think of putting accountants and people from a business background, etc., in such positions, but it might be a good idea if the Government adopted a policy of appointing artists to State boards to bring critical and creative thinking, problem-solving skills and ideas for job creation to them.  In order to do this, we need to encourage such creative thinking at school.  When I was in college, I set up a theatre company.  We travelled around Gaeltacht areas teaching drama to children in schools.  People should be sent to schools for one hour a week to give every child the experience of drama, theatre and performance because it would engender a sense of self-confidence, give them great pride in themselves and be good fun.  If one could do it through Irish, it would give them some Irish language skills also.  However, it would encourage the critical creative thinking that we need.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago I saw this taken a step further in Denmark.  When I was working as series producer on &ldquo;Ros na R&uacute;n&rdquo;, we copied the concept of a cultural dynamo.  As we needed to link people who thought creatively with the entrepreneurial spirit, we devised a part-time course to give them the skills to see opportunities in the cultural sphere, whether it be the media, the arts, or otherwise, and turn them into a business idea and create jobs.  We need to develop a course for cultural dynamos.</P>
      <P>At a  practical level, Irish is an official language of the European Union.  A number of jobs were created as a result, but there is the capacity to increase the amount of Irish used and the services provided.  The European Union is actually waiting for the State to ask for more services to be provided.  If the Government were to do this, we could create approximately 100 jobs for translators almost overnight.  I call on it to look into this.</P>
      <P>The development of film commissions has happened in a number of areas.  For example, there is a film commission in Galway which actively seeks to sell Ireland as an ideal space in which to create films and media.  We have incredibly talented film makers, writers, artists, people who can make props, etc., but we are not utilising them enough.  We need to set up film commissions and provide greater support for the Irish Film Board to do this work.</P>
      <P>Yesterday during the debate on the Irish language many Members said they would like to be able to speak Irish more.  We are calling for teacher training through the medium of Irish for one year in order that everybody teaching in a primary school would have a very good level of Irish.  This would have a wonderful effect on Gaeltacht areas.  It would form part of the college cycle for students and be a great bonus in grounding people in the language and give them a sense of what it is like to live in a Gaeltacht area.  A teacher mentioned to me that we should do this with transition year students, as it would create employment in Gaeltacht areas and give children a much better grounding in the language.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Katherine Zappone&rsquo;s thoughts.  Employment does not always have to be created through the private sector in that much can be done through promoting the concept of <Col N="804" />social entrepreneurship.  During the years Gaeltacht areas have been very good at setting up co-operatives.  We should try to set up more throughout the country.  When I was in Canada recently, I saw a number of alternative energy projects, one of which on tidal energy really inspired me.  A space had been provided in which one could try out different technologies.  One of the companies involved was from Shannon and it was using something like a jet turbine.  It was building smaller prototypes which could be bought for approximately &euro;1 million by local co-ops.  They would pay for themselves in a number of years and the money generated would be put back into local communities to generate more jobs.  It would be done by giving them a preferential rate for the electricity purchased.  This concept is certainly worth looking at.</P>
      <P>If fishing quotas were changed, we could create jobs in the processing sector overnight.  Some 80% of the mackerel quota is held by 27 boats in an elite industry.</P>
      <P>I could go on for much longer, but I will not.  Perhaps we might have another session like this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone">
      <NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate and commend my colleague, Senator Michael Mullins, who came up with the idea for it.  It is good to have a constructive debate in which we can come up with ideas.  </P>
      <P>I welcome many of the comments made by Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh on the arts.  It is not an area on which I will focus today, but I welcome, in particular, his comments on creative individuals being appointed to State boards.  They do not necessarily need to be artists but creative &mdash; perhaps artists in the wider sense.  This is definitely something which should be encouraged.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are many industries in which Ireland could become a global focal point if its talent pool was leveraged effectively.  We should focus on the specific areas in which we could really make a difference in the short term while planning for the long term.  An area at which I have looked is technology.  The Taoiseach has spoken about the importance of cloud computing.  I have seen at first-hand, while visiting a company which is creating 180 jobs in Dublin &mdash; Zynga, a Facebook-based games company worth more than &euro;6 billion &mdash; how this could happen.  Ireland could become a European, if not a global, focal point for the new wave of technology &mdash; small and large technology companies, with some focusing on cloud computing and others on the web.  There is already great synergy, with Dublin becoming one of the major hubs for technology companies in Europe.  Facebook, Google and Linkedln are based here, while other home-grown successes which place emphasis on technology include Paddy Power.  We can continue this trend and should look to set goals and targets for the sector.  Creating a further 15,000 jobs in this field is a strong possibility.  However, in order to reap that reward, some changes must be made.</P>
      <P>We need to address two major strands.  In regard to investment made within the country, we need to set up more small and medium enterprises, particularly in the technology sector.  We need to incentivise people to set up their own businesses in this field.  We also need to make the environment more conducive to attracting venture capital and ensure incubators such as Dogpatch Labs, to which I will come back, based near the Grand Canal, are encouraged to base themselves here.</P>
      <P>I also refer to attracting investment from outside to make Ireland, in the words of the Taoiseach, the best small country in the world in which to do business.  How will we achieve this?  In the technology sector we have started in the right direction.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and Enterprise Ireland recently appointed a technology ambassador, an external industry expert, Mr. Dylan Collins, whose mission, in effect, is to attract entrepreneurs to Ireland.  His job is to bring back enterprising people and <Col N="805" />prove to them that Ireland is the place they need to be from day one.  This is a great  idea and we need to push further in this direction.  If successful, we should look to scale upwards.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The technology sector, in terms of web technology applications and cloud computing, is moving rapidly.  By 2015 Ireland could find itself having 50% of the major companies based here.  The talent is being acquired and we need to continue to be at the forefront of that hunt.  Dogpatch Labs is a technology incubator unit based on Barrow Street, in my constituency of Dublin South East, in a building beside Google.  It is an interesting place and based on a successful model in the United States &mdash; there are several similar incubators in California.  It is an open plan office in which small technology companies share space and ideas and a model which really appeals to those involved in technology.  The idea that a successful web company can get up and running with perhaps as little as &euro;5,000 is fantastic and should be encouraged.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In addition to encouraging investment from within and attracting the best from abroad, the major challenge facing the technology sector is, surprisingly, the shortage of graduates, to which Senator Lorraine Higgins alluded.  This has been pointed out in numerous studies and was the subject of a recent Irish Internet Association seminar.  There are approximately 1,000 vacant jobs in the sector.  In the words of Joan Mulvihill, chief executive officer of the Irish Internet Association, &ldquo;The skills shortage is the greatest impediment to business growth in the digital sector.&rdquo;  We need to address this issue. I suggest we look as a matter of urgency at having new technology universities, with IT skills at the forefront.  Moreover, I suggest we look at having conversion courses in all relevant IT skills areas, including applications development and programming.  It is also vital that this happen at second level.  The time has come for Ireland Inc. to grasp the nettle and introduce a proper IT and programming-optional syllabus at junior and leaving certificate levels.  When considering what to study in college, most people come to the view that IT is not an option because they do not know enough about it.  The succession to third level is often reduced to IT hobbyists only, whereas there really should be an open door for anybody who wishes to pursue this subject.</P>
      <P>With the measures to which I refer, I believe Ireland is poised to reap great rewards and could become a serious force in the technology sector.  It could, for want of a better term, become Europe&rsquo;s Silicon Valley.  The proposals I have offered are humble enough in nature.  They could also prove to be extremely cost effective at a time when we can have a major impact and bring about positive changes.  Such changes would be good for Ireland in both the short and the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1932, when the unemployment rate in the US stood at 25%, Franklin D. Roosevelt argued for bold, persistent experimentation and stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is common sense to take one method and try it.  If it fails, admit failure frankly and try another.  But above all, try something.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Government must be encouraged to experiment and try new things.  Some years ago, Denis Desmond approached the Government of the day with a proposal relating to establishing the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and was informed that it would not work.  He approached C. J. Haughey, who was not in power at the time, with his proposal and the latter stated he would run with it.  One of the messages we must get across to the Minister for Finance and others is that it is sometimes possible to make far more money on foot of a lower tax rate.  In other words, by reducing the percentage one can take in more money.  Those of us who are in business are aware of that.  However, there appears to be an assumption, particularly among accountants and others, that the way to bring in more money is by increasing the tax rate.  Past experience has shown that lower tax rates often lead to greater amounts of money being accrued.  That is why we succeeded so well in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</P>
      <Col N="806" />
      <P Just="Left">I wish to make a number of points and hope I will have time to refer to them all.  The first relates to the degree to which we concentrate on farming.  There is good reason for this because farming has become a much more profitable occupation in which to be involved than was the case for some time.  I would like schools to highlight to students the benefits of farming as a career.  It was not possible to do this in previous years because farming was not paying for itself.  However, the position has changed.  It is even more important that there be support, encouragement and enthusiasm in respect of food.  In the long term, food production will be even more important than farming in the context of job creation.  Senator White referred to the success we have already enjoyed in this sector.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is a need to reduce red tape.  I recently spoke to an individual who opened a petrol station and who was obliged to obtain ten licences in order to run it.  How can people succeed in business in such circumstances?  Is it not possible to apply regulations in respect of individuals who employ four people which are different from those which obtain with regard to companies that employ 1,000?  The UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Vince Cable, MP, has given a commitment to consider the position of those individuals and companies which employ fewer than ten people because he accepts that one size does not fit all.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Noone referred to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement about wanting to make Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  A number of years ago I visited Panama.  The authorities were also keen to make it the best small country in which to do business.  To that end, they discovered that one of the disincentives in their country was the length of time it took to establish a new business.  They decided that Panama should be the best &mdash; it was competing with Singapore and Hong Kong in this regard &mdash; and they managed to reduce the period in which it takes to complete the necessary paperwork, etc., to establish a business there to seven hours.  That is the type of approach we need to consider and it should certainly be possible to reduce the amount of time it takes to set up a small business.</P>
      <P>Previously, I had no knowledge of the process of fracking.  What would be the outcome if we were to allow the use of fracking in Ireland in order to create both jobs and the potential for billions of euro to be made?  Fracking is a method of extracting natural gas by means of so-called hydraulic fracturing of shale deposits.  IndigoPool, a subsidiary company of oilfield services provider Schlumberger, estimates that there are 9.4 trillion cu. ft. of gas in two of the three reservoirs in the Lough Allen basin.  This equates to approximately 1.5 billion barrels of oil.  The value of the gas, at current oil prices, could exceed &euro;120 billion.  In light of the predicament in which we find ourselves, I urge people to exercise common sense, pragmatism and patriotism when examining this issue.  America has huge shale deposits and the gas from these now comprises 25% of its overall gas supplies.  In 2001, the figure in this regard was 1%.</P>
      <P>The major difficulty with fracking relates to its effect on the environment, particularly in the context of the possible contamination of water supplies.  In that context, I propose that all hydraulic fracturing should be declared legal in this country but with the caveat that drilling companies should put up a bond that would be equal in value to the potential clean-up costs relating to environmental damage.  This would force large players to be much more careful regarding the extraction techniques they employ, particularly in view of the fact that large mistakes would give rise to huge financial losses.  Fracking is very controversial.  However, it could be used to create thousands of jobs and pay off our debts.  In such circumstances, there is a need for a debate in respect of it.  I am afraid that people will reject fracking even before they examine the issues involved.  The Earth has survived for billions of years.  Industry only came into existence just over 200 years ago.  We often pay too much attention to doomsday prophets.  The Earth provides us with all of our resources and we should recognise that fact.</P>
      <Col N="807" />
      <P>Let us give start-up businesses the opportunity to try new things.  It might be worth copying what has been done in Britain in this regard.</P>
      <P>One of the sectors in respect of which quick action can be taken is tourism.  I am a great believer in food tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has indicated that people on holidays spend up to five hours eating, whether it is breakfast, dinner or tea.  Food influences people to a very large extent.  Another aspect of tourism in respect of which action could be taken is that which relates to cycling and walking.  I recently read an article regarding the establishment of a walking tour of Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall in Britain approximately ten or 15 years ago.  This project cost &pound;3 million to put in place but it gave rise to an income of &pound;30 million.</P>
      <P>Another issue in respect of which we might take action is encouraging people to buy local.  In this regard, I do not mean just to buy Irish but rather to buy local.  There is something magical when it comes to buying local, particularly in the context of food.  A recent experience in Drogheda made me aware of the amount of extra business that can be generated by encouraging local restaurants to obtain their food from local producers.</P>
      <P Just="Left">My final point is that the future is bright.  Ireland is the only country in Europe with a rapidly increasing population.  During the next 20 years our population will increase at a much faster rate than that of any other country in Europe.  This represents an opportunity.  Let us cut out the pessimism and recognise the opportunities.  I have lived through and been in business during four recessions.  We should stop thinking in terms of recession and focus instead on the opportunities that lie around the corner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKelly">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of job creation and ideas on how we might turn the economy around, the first thing we need is for Ministers to start listening to us.  Many Senators contributed to the debate on small business which began last week and which was brought to a conclusion earlier today by the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry.  What was said by Senators during that debate was not referred to by the Minister of State during his summation.  It is as if we wasted our time making contributions.  Many of the Senators present invested a great deal of time and effort in the debate on small business but the Minister of State did not respond to the points we made.  That is one the greatest difficulties I have with regard to debates in this House.</P>
      <P>During debates in the Seanad, it is often the case that the Minister or Minister of State who is present will take note of points raised or ideas put forward.  However, he or she will then leave the House at some point and will be replaced by one of his or her colleagues.  As a result, those points put forward early in debates are often not responded to.  These are matters which must be addressed.  I was not in a position earlier to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, what action he is taking in respect of the questions we posed last week.  I was informed that it was not possible to put questions to the Minister of State when he was making his reply.  Ministers must begin to listen to Senators because there is no doubt that we have ideas to offer.  They might not be great ideas but some of them might actually work.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the context of the debate in which the House is currently engaged, there is no magic solution to our problems.  Apart from creating jobs, the one thing we must do immediately is take steps to protect existing jobs.  I have repeatedly informed the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, that there is a need for a national review of rates.  Small businesses cannot afford to pay the rates currently expected of them.  On a previous occasion the Minister of State and I discussed the fact that blue chip companies have the ability to pay these rates but that small businesses do not.  I suggested that a two-tier rate system might be introduced in order that we might retain jobs.  It is ridiculous to shut a business down over a rates bill of &euro;4,000 when it will cost &euro;40,000 to keep people on the dole as a result of it.  We should consider giving rates holidays to new businesses that are proposing to set up in this country, as long as it does not <Col N="808" />lead to displacement and unfair competition.  If the only hotel in a town closes down, we should help that business to re-establish itself in order to create jobs.  The re-opened hotel would not be competing with another hotel in the town.  In such circumstances, we should forgo the rates for three years.  We would be better off allowing the hotel to create 40 jobs, thereby saving the taxpayer &euro;840,000 a year, rather than leaving the hotel closed for the sake of rates of&euro;40,000.</P>
      <P>The section of the report on small business that refers to the local government efficiency review suggests that savings of &euro;511 million could be achieved as a result of the review.  As I said to the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, last week, if it referred to &euro;500 million I would probably say it was made up or rounded it off.  The reference to &euro;511 million is very specific, however.  I have asked where exactly the savings will be made, but I have yet to receive an answer.  We need to find out what will be involved in these savings of &euro;511 million.  Will they be passed on to small businesses through reduced rates, as recommended in the report?</P>
      <P>NAMA is dealing mainly with the property market in the UK.  Some 80% of its business is going on over there.  I know of auctioneers in this country who have done business with NAMA to buy retail units in rural Ireland.  Those deals were done six months ago, in some cases, but the auctioneers are still waiting for NAMA to sign off on them and say they are done.  There are people ready to go into those units and set up in business immediately.  NAMA does not seem to be bothered about this.  Some of these people are walking away and saying &ldquo;To hell with this, we are not hanging about here any longer if they are not willing to do business with us&rdquo; because nothing has happened in the last six months.  I assure the House that retail units in rural Ireland are not likely to appreciate in value.  This is the time to start getting rid of them and creating new business.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We should be expanding the community employment schemes to avail of the massive opportunities provided.  The Minister for Health has withdrawn hundreds of thousands of home help hours.  I suggest we should use community employment schemes to create many jobs in this area.  Each home help hour costs between &euro;14.60 and &euro;18.  If this service were provided in the way I suggest, it would cost the taxpayer &euro;1.70 an hour.  That would be the actual cost.  These people are on social welfare anyway.  They would be given a top-up payment of &euro;34 a week for a 20-hour week.</P>
      <P>I would like to conclude by repeating a proposal I have made previously.  It seems like I will have to say it 20 times before anyone listens to me.  I imagine I have said it eight times already in this House.  I cannot see why people do not accept the logic of it.  If it costs &euro;21,000 a year to keep somebody on social welfare, why are we not offering employers &euro;10,000 to take that person off the dole?  If 100,000 people were employed by tourism and other enterprises using that mechanism, some &euro;1.1 billion per annum would be saved immediately.  By offering &euro;10,000 to employers in each case, we could save &euro;1.1 billion a year on social welfare.  In addition, the employees in question would be paying tax, PRSI, the universal social charge and everything else.  If we were to use our social welfare budget wisely, we could make a difference of &euro;2 billion a year.  Why are we not doing it?  This is the ninth time I have mentioned this proposal.  When I have said it 20 times, somebody might cop on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill">
      <NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">This excellent and non-partisan debate is focusing on one of the key problems this country will have to face if it is to recover, which is the fact that almost 500,000 people are unemployed.  No one came in here to play the blame game.  I commend the Leader of the House for hosting this debate and giving us an opportunity to make constructive criticisms and propose some ideas with regard to the creation of jobs.  There is a wealth of experience in this Chamber.  Many Members of the House, including Senators Quinn and <Col N="809" />White, have experience of creating employment in the State.  We welcome the endeavours of individual Senators outside this House.  Many unemployed people have no hope and cannot see a way of obtaining a job.  Equally, many people are willing to set up businesses but cannot find the resources to do so.  They have the ideas but they cannot obtain the resources.</P>
      
      <P>I was not in the Chamber for the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, but I listened to it from my office.  He pointed out that this country&rsquo;s 200,000 small businesses employ 650,000 people.  Many of those businesses are struggling at present.  I know of a community co-operative in the west of Ireland that has a turnover of &euro;100,000 per week, or &euro;5 million per annum.  It employs 40 people and has been in existence for 40 years.  The co-operative in question has been dealing with the same bank for 40 years.  An overdraft facility of approximately &euro;40,000, or the equivalent in punts, has always been available to it.  The Bank of Ireland has refused point blank to continue this overdraft facility even though the co-operative processes &euro;100,000 through its account each year.  This country&rsquo;s economy will not recover until we grasp the nettle and take on the banks.  If the banks will not play ball with the Government, the Government will have to deal with them by establishing a bank like the Industrial Credit Corporation, which was established in the 1980s to provide currency to those who were creating jobs in the economy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The credit unions are the only institutions that are lending to small businesses.  I know that because I was elected to sit on the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in a voluntary capacity.  We deal with businesses every week that have been approved for State grant aid but cannot get the co-funding that is required from the banks.  It is a disgrace that this country&rsquo;s banks, which have been bailed out by taxpayers, are stifling job creation and economic growth.  The public interest directors on the boards of those banks need to be hauled before the Government and held to account.  If they are not willing to represent the views of the taxpayer, they should be asked to step aside from the boards in order that they can be replaced with people who will actually represent taxpayers and hold the banks to account.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are a number of ways of dealing with the problem of the lack of availability of credit for small or larger businesses.  Very few of the State enterprise organisations &mdash; I refer to the county enterprise boards, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, etc. &mdash; operate a venture capital programme.  I accept that the county enterprise boards operate a scheme whereby money is made available on a loan basis.  At a time when the banks are not lending, such a scheme needs to be rolled out across all the enterprise organs of the State.  We have all heard about how the banks have made &euro;3 billion available last year and this year.  The previous Government was told the same thing.  We used to listen to Ministers from my party talking about this matter.  Quite frankly, I do not believe what we have been hearing from Ministers in the Government and its predecessor, or from the banks.  I do not believe the banks are making money available to businesses.  They are telling blatant lies.  Without making a political point, I think the Government needs to hold them to account.</P>
      <P>The agencies need to be supported.  I know of a State agency &mdash;&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta &mdash; that does not have a chief executive officer at the moment.  When I raised the failure to fill that position on the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the House yesterday, I was told the position will be filled by the end of the month or early next month.  However, I understand that officials from the relevant Department rang &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta late last evening to look for further information.  How can a chief executive be appointed if the necessary information is not available to the Department in question?</P>
      <P>We have to think outside the box.  I agree wholeheartedly with everything Senator Kelly said about the need to create additional jobs through community employment.  Every person who is unemployed costs the State &euro;20,000 per annum.  We need to stimulate the economy and <Col N="810" />create jobs in the community sector by giving people money to do jobs in the community.  For example, they could cut hedges or perform other tasks for community organisations, thereby creating employment in the community.  If small businesses were given the money and freedom to create at least one job each, we could create a couple of hundred thousand jobs.  We must think outside the box and eliminate red tape, bureaucracy, report writing and so forth.  I hope the relevant Ministers will ignore the civil servants who are advising them and take some business decisions.  We can have reports about reports which suggest the problem will be solved in 2014 or 2015 by which time the country may have gone under.  Given that more people will become unemployed by 2014, we must radically change the way in which we help businesses.  I hope some of the Members of the other House, specifically Ministers, listen to this debate and adopt some of the great suggestions being made by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the House has prioritised this debate on job creation.  I will begin by making a few preliminary points on the Government&rsquo;s national reform programme under the 2020 strategy.  Broadly, the report which was submitted to the European Commission on 29 April 2011 deals with employment and research, development and innovation.  It forecasts that the economy will grow by 3% per annum on average in the period from 2013 to 2015.  The plan has been endorsed by the International Monetary Fund and European authorities.</P>
      <P>The most significant challenge for the Government is to nurture jobs growth and sustainable enterprise.  Job creation is clearly central to any recovery strategy.  In the years ahead sustainable growth will be supported by further competitiveness improvements, continued investment in economic and human capital, measures to ensure adequate credit is available &mdash; an issue raised by many Senators &mdash; tax policies that are favourable to entrepreneurship and investment and work policies to support growth in key enterprises and productive sectors.  We must actively and aggressively challenge existing labour market bottlenecks, for example, weak labour market demand.  We must increase access to opportunities for upskilling and target cost-effective activation programmes.</P>
      <P>I have two main contributions to make to job creation.  I will, first, address the subject of renewable energy, specifically wind energy.  As Senators will be aware, Ireland has one of the highest wind speeds in Europe and our ocean currents are among the best in the world for generating renewable energy.  This issue was referred to several times by other speakers.  A number of test sites are located along the west coast and high-tech facilities are being established to test ocean energy potential.  If we are serious about renewable energy projects, we should seek to attract wind turbine construction companies to locate in this country.  This would create hundreds of direct and indirect jobs in manufacturing, construction and transportation.  The erection of wind turbines will necessitate the employment of electricians and other skilled engineers.</P>
      <P>Wind energy is a free and naturally abundant resource, of which we need to take full advantage.  Under the European Union renewable energy directive, Ireland must meet a legally binding target of generating 16% of its energy needs using renewable energy resources by 2020.  The European Union as a whole has a target of achieving a figure of 25% in the Union&rsquo;s energy mix through renewable resources by 2020.</P>
      <P>A recent report compiled by the Irish Wind Energy Association and Deloitte on jobs and investment in the wind energy sector highlighted a number of areas.  It focuses on the ability to create investment and jobs and notes that the construction sector provides the majority of job opportunities available from the wind energy sector.  Offshore wind development requires significant construction inputs to develop the large-scale wind farm projects planned.  The <Col N="811" />report highlights obstacles to creating employment in the wind energy sector, including grid access, shortages of experienced personnel and a lack of awareness about employment opportunities in the sector.  Securing planning permission and objections to planning applications for wind farms are also a serious problem, albeit obstacles that can be overcome.  An ongoing public campaign should be launched to promote opportunities connected with wind energy production.  This would encourage students,  engineers and builders to specialise in the area.</P>
      <P>Denmark is the most successful European Union country in wind energy production.  In 2007, for example, more than 23,000 people were employed in the wind energy sector in Denmark, whereas fewer than 2,000 people were employed in the sector in this country.  As it has been proved that Ireland has higher wind speeds than Denmark, we need to create more jobs in thesector and ensure full grid capacity for renewable energy once it has been generated.</P>
      <P>The European Wind Energy Association has found that wind turbine and component manufacturing provides the majority of employment opportunities in the sector, accounting for 59% of direct employment.  This is another area in which Irish manufacturing entrepreneurs could become involved.  Building and assembling wind turbines would create hundreds of jobs.  The Irish Wind Energy Association will hold its annual conference in March and I look forward with interest to examining its most recent policies on job creation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The second area on which I will briefly focus is the agriculture sector in which many jobs could be created.  Increasing the number of organic farming courses would create employment for those who wish to teach such courses to farmers who wish to specialise in organic farming practices.  We have an excellent example of such a centre in north County Leitrim, where the Organic Centre teaches organic farming practices to hundreds of students each year.</P>
      <P>While the decision to reopen the sea prawn fishing sector for fishermen in Irish waters will create jobs, it is vital that the fish caught in our seas are processed in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney">
      <NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join colleagues on all sides in welcoming the opportunity to feed into the think tank, as it were.  I am pleased the Government has acknowledged that the role of the House is sufficiently important to have a debate on ideas for job creation.  We could have 150,000 ideas, but if only one of them works, the exercise will have been worthwhile.  I will add my tuppence ha&rsquo;penny worth by focusing on one or two issues.</P>
      <P>I am becoming increasingly convinced that we need to refocus and redouble our collective efforts to improve research and development, especially in the sciences.  We heard about the loss of branded drugs in the pharmaceuticals sector in the next couple of years.  Greater research and development are needed to ensure we continue to generate new medications and drugs.  As this is one of Senator John Crown&rsquo;s areas of expertise, I will not dwell on the issue other than to note the need to increase expenditure on research and development across the industrial sector.  In that regard, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has submitted proposals to reduce the taxation burden on business carried out by academic institutions.  This would encourage more businesses to outsource their research and development programmes to academic institutions by ensuring they would not be penalised on the basis of tax.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that a significant number of jobs are available, notwithstanding the fact that 450,000 people are unemployed.  Anyone who attended the briefing provided by the Central Statistics Office yesterday morning will have learned many fascinating statistics pertaining to the past 12 months.  The largest single decline in employment in the past three years was in the construction sector.  This implies that the decline in employment occurred primarily among those who were unskilled or semi-skilled.</P>
      <P>The success of the foreign direct investment policy pursued by successive Administrations for many decades has resulted in a significant number of people finding employment in the <Col N="812" />pharmaceuticals and high-tech sectors in which jobs are still available.  The problem appears to be that graduates leaving our colleges are unable to secure employment in companies in these sectors because they do not have workplace experience.  While I welcome the internship programme introduced last year, I wonder if the Government is engaging with industry.  Is it sending a message that while it is all very well to provide jobs, if vacancies are being filled by non-nationals coming to the country when Irish nationals could fill these jobs, they are not of any great value.  They do not reduce the level of emigration but raise the expectations of young people.  There appears to be a disconnect in this regard as highly educated and motivated graduates are unable to get onto the first step of the ladder.  Instead, they are moving to England and Australia and many will begin to head off to the United States again if proposed concessions are passed by Congress.  There is a brain drain.  Is the Government engaging with companies?  I believe companies should be more proactive in engaging with Departments, particularly the Department of Social Protection which has all the statistics on those who are unemployed.  For example, under the Swedish model, Ericsson, one of the largest companies, has a social responsibility where it engages with the relevant department to retrain and upskill the unemployed.  I am not sure there is a culture of Irish business doing that work or of Government thinking outside the box or engaging with business in terms of what it can do to upskill rather than put the entire burden on to the State agencies.</P>
      <P>I was intrigued, as one always is, by Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution.  While I broadly accept his ideas in terms of the financial benefits to Ireland from the extraction of shale gas, as I am sure my colleagues from Sligo-Leitrim will testify it is a highly controversial issue.  It is an unproven concept which is the subject of several EU reports.  Senator Quinn touched on that briefly in the context of possible damage that might be caused.  There is a real danger that hydraulic fracturing, if practised here as in other countries, particularly in America, would result in untold damage to the water courses and would have a severe environmental impact.  The view of my party is that we are opposed to the concept of hydraulic fracturing as outlined and presented.  Until such time as it is proven to be environmentally safe I would be happy to leave the billions of cubic metres of gas lying below the surface.  If it has lain there for several million years, let it lie there for another few years until technology catches up and it can be safely extracted.  I agree with Deputy Quinn that the benefits to the country would be significant.  If successfully extracted, the north-west shale gas area could supply up to 60% of energy needs and the resulting jobs.  He is absolutely right in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney">
      <NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Mooney and others, I find today&rsquo;s debate informative.  If only one or two suggestions made today are acted on the debate will have been worthwhile.  I congratulate Senator Mullins who proposed it.  I want to speak about removing obstacles that are stifling businesses and job creation.  Up to now, businesses have been a huge factor in financing the services being provided by local government.  Given that the household charge has been implemented and the refuse collection service has been privatised in many counties, it is time to look at the way in which rates are charged on businesses.  Rates are crippling businesses, especially small enterprises.  It is time the rates were recalculated on the turnover of the business and not on the premises out of which they operate.</P>
      <P>The hotel and guest trade is prevalent in the area from which I come.  Many of the hotels are closed for the winter months and when they reopen their business is reduced.  Turnover has decreased dramatically due to the downturn in business.  In the retail business, such as furniture and electrical stores where the storage space required is huge, there is little turnover.  Small retailers who have to pay huge rental costs for their outlets are crippled by rates.  Small retailers endeavour to run the business themselves and not take on staff.  Sometimes they <Col N="813" />work up to 16 hours per day and do all the paper work rather than take on staff due to the extra outlay.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It would be a huge step in job creation if we were to revisit the issue of the way in which rates are evaluated.  Perhaps, then, business people would consider taking on more staff.  As Senator Kelly said, the back to work allowance should be reintroduced.  The Department of Social Protection is paying out the money in jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Therefore, to invest the money for a number of years, at a graduated rate, thereby increasing employment, would be a step in the right direction.  It would help employers for the first year or two, provide a decent wage for the employee, take people off the live register and would allow people to contribute to the economy.  Getting cashflow to small and medium enterprises is essential.  I commend the Government for starting the ball rolling and emphasise the importance of developing this initiative even further.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On a number of occasions, I have raised the issue of the self-employed with the Minister for Social Protection.  Self-employed persons should be given the option of paying the full rate PRSI contribution and if they have a couple of weeks with no work they can draw their social welfare entitlements.  Self-employed people who take on employees pay a generous contribution towards the employee&rsquo;s entitlements, they pay taxes and if they have premises they have to pay rates and, in some cases, rent on their premises, yet during a downturn in the business they have nothing to fall back on.  If there are a few months when there is no business and they cannot access social welfare entitlements, they are inclined to close down the business completely and they have an entitlement.  When the business picks up again, their company is gone and they cannot restart it.  Sometimes what these people need is a little help to tide them over a few weeks or months when things are bad.</P>
      <P>A colleague, the Mayor of Killarney, has an innovative idea.  He stated that all over the country there are closed premises and factories, such as the Pretty Polly premises in Killarney.  He suggested that education will play a vital role in getting the country back on its feet and bringing about economic recovery.  He suggests that these premises, or part thereof, be used for the purpose of education through the medium of satellite.  Obviously there would be a start-up cost but it could be cost neutral as third level grants would no longer be needed if people were to use this medium.  Many students, even with the aid of third level grants, find the cost of education and living away from home very expensive and tend to drop out.  They could stay in their home town and get their education.  This type of education would be an opportunity for rural Ireland to compete for high tech jobs as the skills would be in place.</P>
      <P Just="Left">An issue that has not been mentioned so far is the roll out of broadband.  I am aware the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, is proactive in this area but there are parts of rural Ireland, such as in south Kerry, where people are trying to set up a business in photography, agriculture and so on but broadband is not available and they are crippled.  They cannot run their business without broadband.  Some areas do not have a mobile phone signal, not to mention broadband.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We must utilise our partnerships because they have their finger on the pulse and know the people who have ideas.  The partnerships and the county enterprise boards are the first port of call for any person with an idea to get help and advice.  They would be instrumental in negotiating with the banks for loans for the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinConway">
      <NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I commend Senator Mullins for what has become known as the Mullins initiative.  I applaud the cross-party approach to this topic.  We are responsible to the electorate who put us here, whether Government, Opposition or non-party.  We all have a mandate and a role to play.  Many in this Chamber have created jobs over the years.  I commend all people who create jobs because they are the backbone of the economy.</P>
      <Col N="814" />
      
      <P Just="Left">Much has been said and I will not repeat what has been said.  Repetition is not necessary, but I will comment on a number of areas.  I have spoken before about the tendering process in respect of the Government.  The Government does not directly create jobs, but it certainly has a role to play in making it easier to create jobs and to assist in the elimination of red tape.</P>
      <P>I have often said in this House that we are very compliant Europeans.  Environmental health compliance of the hospitality industry in Italy, France, Spain and elsewhere is not as onerous as it is in Ireland, yet the figure for those who suffer food poisoning in these countries is much lower than Ireland.  One has to wonder about the logic of that.</P>
      <P>Any tenders put out by local government or State agencies that are worth above &euro;50,000 have to go through e-tenders.  That is ridiculous and I do not believe it is reflected throughout Europe.  If the Government multiplies that figure by ten, it would reduce the red tape and the time period, and it would facilitate Irish companies going for reasonable jobs.  A window manufacturer in Kerry recently could not get a contract for a building which was only up the road, and it went to a foreign company.  That window manufacturer was employing 1,200 people in Kerry.  That did not make sense at all.  That is why we must loosen up the red tape.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">For years the agriculture sector was the backbone of the economy.  It will be the backbone of the economic recovery this country will see.  We can export our product and our intellectual property to billions of people.  I was abroad recently and it was great to see Dairygold butter handed up at the breakfast table in an international hotel far away from here.  It is unrealistic to think that we can export beef from Ireland to China, but we certainly can export our knowledge in developing farming which makes our beef so popular internationally.  The Chinese are leaving their traditional food products by the million and embracing European food products, particularly Irish food products.  There is no reason we cannot develop our skill set in the dairy industry and the breeding of beef, lamb and so on.  We can teach people in Asia how to produce our quality product and get a percentage for it.  There is a range of ways to bring our knowledge to other countries.</P>
      
      <P>The English language market is at 10% of its potential here.  We are known traditionally as the land of saints and scholars, so there is no reason we cannot attract thousands of international students over here; not just to learn English, but to learn art, music and culture.  The Burren College of Art is in my area of north Clare and it brings in hundreds of American students every year.  There is no reason every area cannot have similar colleges; not just in the humanities, but in commerces, languages and so on.  The Government needs to introduce initiatives to attract people to learn English as a foreign language here.</P>
      <P>I have spoken several times on the Order of Business about the Seven Wonders of Nature competition, which the Cliffs of Moher did not ultimately win.  However, the number of visitors to the Cliffs of Moher rose by 25% for the second half of 2011.  That is the benefit and it has sustained jobs and will create more casual jobs in the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Tourism, agriculture and education are three key areas, along with the arts and others.  We need to look outside the box.  We need to promote indigenous industry.  It is great to have the likes of Intel coming in here and creating 2,000 jobs, but as we saw with TalkTalk, they can go as well as come.  Indigenous Irish companies will stay forever and create jobs if we get it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe">
      <NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in commending Senator Mullins for this initiative.  I am sure he will not mind if I ask for the idea to be extended so that we might do this on a routine basis, perhaps every two to three months.  Not only do Senators have wonderful entrepreneurial ideas and ideas for making the business of business move more easily, but we <Col N="815" />talk to many people and they are constantly bringing ideas to us.  It would be great if we were to say that the Seanad was a House that fostered that entrepreneurial spirit and fed into the Department as a routine part of our business.  Even though it is not on the Order of Business, I ask the Leader if this can be facilitated.</P>
      
      <P>I would like to start by reading a small extract from a book called <i>Traditional Food Skills for Tomorrow</i>.</P>
      <P LI="1">With regard to the pig&rsquo;s head... there were two options for its use.  Scrubbed clean and boiled for several hours in a pot with onions and cloves, the head was picked over for whatever morsels of meat could be plucked from the skull. A more sophisticated, but less mainstream approach was to make the delicacy &ldquo;brawn&rdquo;. After boiling and salvaging, the meat would be minced and mixed with herbs and spices...</P>
      <P FLI="0">This publication represents much of what I would like to talk about, which is our food heritage.  The book&rsquo;s subtitle is called &ldquo;Food Heritage in Living Memory&rdquo;.  We have an enormous amount of food heritage.  Our grandparents would laugh at this book.  For them, boiling a pig&rsquo;s head and salvaging something from it was poverty food, but now it is considered to be a delicacy.  If that is the case, the world changes and changes again and now we celebrate goose blood fried with mushroom or lobster and egg platter as delicacies, even though this was the food of our poorer ancestors.  Let us seize the moment and say that these are the things that can make an industry into the future.  We must look at those opportunities.</P>
      <P>I know that there are many food festivals in Ireland and that they contribute to tourism and to local business.  We have the S&oacute; Food Festival in Sligo, which managed to put Irish stew at its heart.  This year it will be held in May.  The Waterford Harvest Food Festival this year will run for a full six days and will attract foodies from all over Ireland and the world.  Many organisations in Ireland support traditional food, including Slow Food Ireland, as there are people who go to the bother of preserving individual seeds and the varieties of apples and potatoes.  These are people who care about the very small things which will in future be very valuable to us.</P>
      <P>It is worth acknowledging that the vision of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the food industry in Ireland &mdash; Food Harvest 2020 &mdash; recognises this artisan food sector and acknowledges its growth and its renewed interest for the consumer.  The Department, along with Bord Bia and Teagasc, stated that they will work together to promote and broaden opportunities, including local markets for consumers and visiting tourists to purchase local food.  They will work together to conserve and to promote distinctive local food traditions like the pig&rsquo;s head and so on.  They will do that along with the TASTE Council and Slow Food Ireland.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We have the foods.  We have the traditions.  We have the will.  We have the organisations.  We now need to bundle them together in a much more cohesive fashion and we also need to involve farmers directly.  There is nothing wrong with having a full food artisan sector for the benefits it can bring, but how can we bind that back to farmers?  When I was a child, farmhouse holidays were quite popular.  They are not so attractive any more.  I examined what was happening in other countries, and found that India, a country which has much in common with ours, is praising the value of farming and considers it as having real potential for future tourism.  Some of the reasons match ours directly, such as the nostalgia for our farming roots and the notion of rural recreation, although I must point out that this includes things such as camel riding and bullock cart riding, which I do not quite see happening here.  In India they also talk about the interest that we now have in the natural environment, the disillusionment with overcrowded resorts and cities, the educational value of agri-tourism, the desire for peace and <Col N="816" />tranquility and the demand for cheaper, family-based holidays.  These are all ideas that come from India, but they are true in Ireland also.  In the future, when organisations come together to promote such things as artisan food or food trails such as those in California, South Africa and England, where they pertain to cheese and wine, we should do that too, and to leave the farmer out would be folly.</P>
      <P>This is being promoted not only in India but in Norway, a country we do not hear much about.  The symbol of the rural food and tourism association, the cockerel, demonstrates that Norwegian tourism is linked to nature and rural living.  As other Senators have said, the agriculture industry is the backbone of Ireland &mdash; in fact, it is our front bone as well.  In the future we will go back to being a predominantly agricultural country.  I would like to see us building ideas that would add farms and farmers to the tourism package, so that we can make this a country to which people come to look for farming culture, along with artisan food, and to enjoy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I praise Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s wonderful comments about food and artisan food.  The advantage Ireland has is that we get out of bed in the morning and we do not have to do anything; the whole world thinks we are green.  We are known as the Emerald Isle.  One cannot actually put into words the way the rest of the world looks at us.  We are so fortunate because Norway, India, Finland &mdash; whatever country one thinks of in the world &mdash; had to work so hard to get their reputations for salmon or, in the case of Finland, saunas, but we already have it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I thank Senator Mullins for creating this opportunity for us to have this debate.  I would have loved, although it might not have been appropriate in this beautiful Chamber, to have somebody from the Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School at the top of the room facilitating us with a flipchart and then handing the Seanad the top 50 ideas we came up with this afternoon.  That is probably what the Minister would like.  There are some great ideas coming up here, but next time we might use the word &ldquo;think tank&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;debate&rdquo;.  As Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe said, we are only 60 people, but there are many people feeding us great ideas.  Therefore, if we can be the conduit, the Seanad can become much more relevant in that way.  I know some of the people at the Smurfit Business School and they would be only delighted to help or facilitate us.  That is just a small idea.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Much has been said today &mdash; I could make the excuse that almost everything I was going to say has been said &mdash; but I will run quickly over my worries about the job prevention measures the Government is instituting.  I will not go into any detail because I did so last Wednesday when the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, was here.  Senators all know about the banks, and I am dying to read the report that the Minister of State mentioned we should all read, in which there were to be all these wonderful statistics proving that the banks were lending.  Well, all my friends must be liars.  Senator Moloney&rsquo;s son got a little loan, as have some others, but I am certainly not one of those people.  I am doing fine, but I had to get private loans, and Enterprise Ireland helped me out.  I certainly did not get loans from the bank.  Poor Ulster Bank had to let people go recently; well, hopefully it will not be able to send three or four people to every meeting it has with me when one would suffice.</P>
      <P>I stood up in October to talk about the sick pay scheme that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, presented to us.  We must not let her get that through, because it would destroy a business like mine, which has 100 people, and imagine what it would do to a business with five or six people.  It is unaffordable for the private sector.  Local authority charges are a difficult issue.  I sit on Kildare County Council audit committee, and we are suffering because <Col N="817" />companies are going out of business and we are not collecting charges.  We will have to make a reduction and take the burden off businesses.</P>
      <P Just="Left">With regard to red tape, I had Senators laughing last week about the shop owner in Cavan who needs 70 licences to keep his shop open.  That is a no-brainer.  One of the Senators said earlier that we need to come up with a strategy to quickly get rid of some of the red tape and regulations, so that entrepreneurs can get into business and those already in it can have time to think clearly and come up with innovations.  People should not have to spend their whole lives in the human resources section worrying about labour laws or all the other regulations that exist &mdash; I know of many in the food industry, anyway.  I can only imagine what it takes to run a hospital; I do not know how one could even open the doors.</P>
      <P>I am only touching on a few of the negatives.  Another is the agency workers directive which was transposed before Christmas.  It is another one we just let slip in here from Europe.  I love Europe, but it slipped this one in under the net, as far as I am concerned.  We should not have let it slip in.  I am having a good year so far &mdash; I think I have scored a big American order for the company for August &mdash; but my labour will cost me at least 20% more because of this directive.  I will not go into details; if anyone wants to talk to me about it afterwards, I will bore them to tears.  It is another job prevention scheme that was allowed to slip in.  I am scared to take anyone on now because, as happened in 2008, if something goes wrong that is out of my control &mdash; for example, if the cocoa market goes through the roof or the dollar or sterling goes crazy &mdash; I could have got 65% relief if I made somebody redundant, and now I cannot.  This is a mistake.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Earlier, a Senator &mdash; I think it was Senator Bacik &mdash; talked about another country and the employment subsidy scheme that came in under Fianna F&aacute;il in 2008.  It was only there for a year and then it was gone.  That was for companies, and there are many of us out there that have had to put people on a three-day week.  That should be brought back; it is a no-brainer.  Which Senator talked earlier about &euro;10,000 being given to an employer to take on staff?  That is a no-brainer.  Let us take tourism as an example.</P>
      <P>On tourism, I ask Senator Mullins whether we can have another think tank.  We have a diaspora of 70 million people.  Imagine if we could get 500,000 of us to invite some of those people over here next summer.  Imagine if we could innovate for the Irish tourism sector, in the form of Bord F&aacute;ilte, by thinking up some really fantastic ways to get more tourists in here.</P>
      <P>How can we get NAMA under control?  I love the fact that there are hotel rooms for &euro;69 per night, but some of my friends are suffering because of this.  I know I am not supposed to give names, but let us say that Rathsallagh House is almost closed because there are NAMA hotels all around it.  It cannot operate for &euro;59 per night.  We need to control that.  Here is another interesting thing.  I am in the horse industry on the side.  There is no recession in the horse industry.  In fact, I will tell my fellow Senators this much: there is no drop in the luxury industry.  If one goes over to London and down Bond Street one will see so many multi-millionaires.  Let us keep an eye on the luxury end over here as well; we seem to have lost sight of that, but there is still money in the world and we still want to attract it.</P>
      <P>Our motorways must be a tourist attraction because there is hardly anybody on them.  We must be one of the most fabulous countries in the world to drive around because we have beautiful motorways and there are very few people on them.  My first idea ever in the Seanad was for wooden signs.  If we are going to pay &euro;10,000 to employ a person, could we not look at Adare, Kinsale or Kenmare and make an Ireland that the Americans think still exists?  Can we not take away plastic signs?</P>
      <P>I will make one more point.  I know there are a few credit unions in trouble, but let us face it: the banks are not doing what they say they are doing.  One may go to the small business <Col N="818" />lunches and speeches and there will be a fellow from Allied Irish Banks sponsoring the whole lunch telling us wonderful things but I do not believe them.  The banks are not doing what they say they are doing.  A brilliant idea would be to regulate and think about how we could help the credit unions and stabilise them.  It would not require a great deal of money.  One is not looking for &euro;10 billion but perhaps &euro;1 billion.  We should put in place some brilliant entrepreneur and take it county by county so that the credit unions could give small loans to small businesses.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, tells me he is trialing something like this in Kilkenny.  I think we should follow up on that and see how it goes.  The larger banks send everything to the head offices in Dublin.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Jack &amp; Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation, will the Government please give us children between five and six years to mind and give us some help because we employ 1,017 people but we only mind children up to the age of four years?  We have raised &euro;35 million privately so far.  If one gave me children between five and six years to mind, we would employ another third of that number of people.  If the Jack &amp; Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation did not exist it would cost &euro;47 million per year to nurse these children in hospitals.  It is another no-brainer.  I am sorry, but I am running out of time. I thank Senator Mullins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly">
      <NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">It is rather difficult to follow that contribution but I will try.  Ireland&rsquo;s economy remains adolescent in many ways.  I mean that we do not yet have a fully developed domestic sector that can drive growth independent of the global economy.  I was in University College Cork yesterday, home to the Centre for Co-operative Studies.  I realise other Senators have referred to co-operatives.  This year, 2012, is the international year for co-operatives.  I will focus on co-operatives as a vehicle for job creation in future.  Their potential has not been fully realised or utilised in Ireland especially in respect of the social economy because of the lack of visibility and the lack of understanding of the sector.</P>
      <P>Co-operatives create and maintain employment and provide income.  They are socially conscious, responding to the needs of their members.  They are rooted in their communities.  They offer jobs to local people.  They are more stable employers because their members are in the community where they are located.  They are less likely to relocate to lower wage areas and are likely to find innovative ways to retain employment and remain competitive.  They create wealth within the community and local ownership keeps it there.  Co-operatives provide stability and services in areas deemed not profitable for private enterprise.</P>
      <P>The co-operative model can be applied to any business activity.  Co-operatives exist in traditional economic sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, consumer and financial services, housing and production.  However, they also span a diverse number of sectors including child care, health and social care, schools, tourism, utilities and sport.</P>
      <P>I refer to some global statistics and experiences relating to co-operatives.  More than 800 million people are members of co-operatives.  Some 123 million members of co-operatives own 160,000 co-operative enterprises and give jobs to 5.4 million European citizens.  Co-operatives provide 100 million jobs worldwide, up to 20% more than multinational enterprises.  In 1994, the livelihood of almost 3 billion people was made secure by co-operative enterprise.  A total of 183 co-operative enterprises, some 152,000 co-operative members and 18,869 co-operative employees are currently in Europe.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In Argentina, a country that suffered a huge financial crisis in 2001 with devaluation of the currency and widespread unemployment, there are currently 12,670 co-operative societies with more than 9.3 million members, approximately 23% of the population.  Since 2001, more than 200 failing businesses became occupied by their workers and reopened as worker co-operatives and none of these has gone out of business.  They employ more than 15,000 people.</P>
      <Col N="819" />
      
      <P>The impact of co-operatives in providing income to rural populations creates additional employment through multiplier effects, including enabling other rural enterprises to grow and, in turn, to provide local jobs.  They are a way of bucking the trend of international capitalist development through local action to restructure the economy in the interests of people.  It can be viewed as a grassroots response to changing social and economic consequences associated with the forces of globalisation and policies such as privatisation.</P>
      <P>The International Organisation of Industrial, Artisanal and Service Producers&rsquo; Co-operatives has found that worker and social co-operatives are more resilient in weathering the crisis than conventional enterprises active in the same sector as a result of their co-operative nature.  Employment in co-operatives tends to be more stable because members are located in the community.  Ownership and participation make a real difference because co-operatives are formed in a community to serve its needs and they are less likely to relocate to lower wage jurisdictions.  Under adverse economic conditions when employment opportunities are scarce and incomes are falling, they are better suited to facilitate economic recovery because the conflict of interest between worker and owner is abolished, as is the profit-driven behaviour which facilitates mass unemployment in times of downturn.</P>
      <P>Since 1975, approximately 80% of the worker co-operatives in maritime Canada have been located in rural communities where unemployment rates have tended to be chronically high.  We should consider the example of Canada and what co-operatives could do in such places as Donegal where they have barely seen the tail of the Celtic tiger.  There is vast potential for it.</P>
      <P>I will finish with some points on what we can do to promote the co-operative model in our society and the economy in its current state.  We should explicitly acknowledge the co-operative model in legislation.  This could be achieved by defining co-operatives within certain legislation, as has been done under the European co-operative statute.  This should be brought forward as a matter of priority.  In 2012, the international year of co-operatives, the Government should implement the recommendations of the International Labour Organization, ILO, resolution 193 on the promotion of co-operatives, especially those relating to the establishment of an institutional framework for co-operatives for the purposes of allowing for the registration of co-operatives in as rapid, simple, affordable and efficient a manner as possible; for the purposes of the introduction of support measures for the activities of co-operatives that meet specific social and public policy needs, including tax benefits, loans, grants, access to public works projects and special procurement provisions; and for the purposes of the simplification of administrative procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot believe it.  Chuir m&eacute; mo l&aacute;mh suas ar c&uacute;ig n&oacute;im&eacute;ad tar &eacute;is a d&oacute;.  Anyway, I will do what I can.  Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh.  It is a pity for me but I will instance the case because examples are a great way of demonstrating the point one is trying to make.  We have all referred to indigenous industries.  They represent the future.  Many of these involve people who started in their own kitchens or garages some years ago, perhaps without planning permission in many cases.  However, I would not close them down because of that.  Some involved two people working who wish to take the next step and seek more space.  I do not believe we are providing the next step for these entrepreneurs.  I can instance five small or medium-sized industries in my region which had to go north to get the space they required.  Unfortunately, that was the way of it for the five of them.  The Senator on my left employs many more people but these firms employ in the region of 50 men and women.  I would prefer to have seen these people working in my county or country.</P>
      <P>Enterprise boards have done and continue to do their best.  They do not blow their own trumpets.  They have helped, initiated and encouraged many small industries that I am aware of.  They have made a major contribution to the development of jobs and this is a great thing.</P>
      <Col N="820" />
      <P>I referred to the need for space.  In a county close to me, County Meath, there are two or three examples of what should be in every county in the country.  I will go into that in more detail.  Last week the young scientist of the year was announced.  Examples of entrepreneurship were displayed by Irish teenagers and it is an absolute credit to them.  There is an entrepreneurial vein in each and every one of us.  It has been developed in some of us, which is great to see.</P>
      <P>Like Senator White, I agree that there are major opportunities for small Irish industries overseas in places like Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, South America, Brazil and Paraguay.  I spoke to a young Irish man about a fortnight ago.  He is well educated and was part of the brain drain.  He went to the United States and developed his idea.  He has a small company which manufactures in China and there is a large market in the United States for its product.  He is now in Paraguay and utilises two small Irish companies in the course of his business.  I hope he is helping to sustain jobs in Ireland.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On the need to educate people in Chinese or Japanese, this man&rsquo;s business was based in the United States but has been developed in the Far East.  I concur with Senator White that there is a need for languages.  I asked the man at Christmas if the language issue deterred his business or was an obstacle and was pleasantly surprised to hear it was not.  Any of his employees who travel to China, Japan and Paraguay have no great difficulty because most countries speak English and children learn it in school.  It is not a major issue but I would like to see languages taught in our schools.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn sat beside me and four or five others having lunch fad&oacute;, fad&oacute;&mdash; I was not a Senator at the time &mdash; when a man came in clapping his hands and told him he would not like what he was going to tell him.  It is a pity the Senator is not here to hear the story.  May I name a company in Dundalk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ben Dunne was coming to Dundalk.  Senator Quinn had established his very good business in Dundalk and now heard his opposition was coming to a vibrant town.  I will never forget his attitude.  There was a vacant premises next door to his and his main concern was that Ben Dunne would take it.  That is not the business attitude of today.  I have never forgotten that incident and some of the Senator&rsquo;s ideas today are as meritorious.</P>
      <P>We should have these meetings more often.  I congratulate the Leader on having this session.  I would like to hear more stories about small industries in our area that are doing well.  That will encourage people.</P>
      <P>I refer to import substitution.  I know of a husband and wife with three children at university and it was not easy for them, as one can imagine.  He was a golfer and looked at golfing items coming into the country from England.  He asked his wife how long it would take her to make flags and she said she could make a set per night at half the cost of those being imported.  She started a small business and the husband and son became involved.  They sold flags to most golf clubs in the country.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In our own way we are all entrepreneurs.  We need to get ideas across.  I would like to see more positivity, even in these difficult times.  What is the next step?  I do not want to hear a talking shop.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaitKeane">
      <NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the debate.  I will not repeat today what I said during the last debate.  Like Senator Brennan, I would like to know what the next step will be.  Whoever is co-<Col N="821" />ordinating the two debates should take the spirit of what was said in the previous debate and include it with this debate.</P>
      <P>We have been asked to come up with suggestions.  I mentioned high potential start-ups during the last debate but the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, did not respond today, which I take particular note of.  He said he would revert to me on the issue.  I would like information on high potential start-ups and the criteria used to define same.  Perhaps a second leg could be added to the criteria to make it easier for companies that employ between five and ten people.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As the issue of rates has been talked to death, I will not dwell on it.  I refer to access to public procurement for small businesses.  The Office of Public Works and the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, made some changes recently.  They should be publicised to try to make it easier for small businesses.  We should all be made aware of them and the information should be conveyed to small businesses and enterprise boards.  It has not been publicised and there is much more to do on the issue.</P>
      <P>I had a question and answer session with about five small business owners and asked them if they knew what was announced recently by the Government to help them export into or initiate business in the BRIC countries.  We all know those countries are growing and that is where the money will be.  Not one of the five I asked knew anything about it.  We have a job of publicity to do on the positive things we are doing and on educating the directors of companies.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I was listening to the debate in my office and heard Senator Michael Comiskey mention wind energy.  I  will say no more about it, except that it is a huge area and we must concentrate on it.</P>
      <P>I recently raised the interpretation, scrutiny and implementation of EU legislation by Ireland, compared with other EU countries.  The Leader has said the Seanad is a place where such scrutiny could be carried out.  That is a bigger story.  However, small businesses cannot wait until tomorrow.  Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien mentioned the agency workers directive which should not have been put through, or should have been put through in a different fashion.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien is a social entrepreneur.  She said she could grow her business if it could look after children aged five and six.  I will rephrase what Senator O&rsquo;Brien said in case it might be taken out of context, because Members of the Oireachtas are supposed to declare a conflict of interest.  I would ask the Minister to look at the social entrepreneurs throughout the country, particularly the Jack and Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation which could employ more people if the age limit of the children it looks after were increased to five or six.</P>
      <P Just="Left">No Member has mentioned the elephant in the corner.  The high replacement ratio between social welfare and net pay for employment weakens the incentive to return to the labour force.  There is a major challenge to protect those on low incomes and social welfare benefits while ensuring that incentives to return to the labour market are strengthened and that businesses are incentivised to take on additional staff.  This is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Regulation influences the manner in which the private sector can adjust to market forces.  Therefore, no professional body should be allowed to restrict the number of entrants into its profession, be it legal or medical.  A variety of pro-competition mechanisms should be used instead of the traditional restrictive rules.  Senator Brennan mentioned the attitude of Senator Feargal Quinn, which is most welcome.  Anti-competitive practices keep prices artificially high.  The Government must ensure that competition policy facilitates market operation.  Good competition policy must work in tandem with strong regulation in economic, social and environmental policy.</P>
      <P>Departments should consider and respond in a timely manner to the recommendations in the 2011 report of the National Competitiveness Council, with specific timelines laid down for the consideration and implementation of such recommendations as the Government considers <Col N="822" />appropriate.  The Department of Jobs, Innovation and Enterprise should co-ordinate the responses from the various Departments to the recommendations in the report.  The report contained many good recommendations that would aid competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The State, as one of the largest consumers of legal services in the economy, should ensure that legal services are subject to the same competition as other services procured by the Government.  Services should be procured in accordance with the guidelines set out in the national procurement policy, requiring prospective service providers to compete with one another on the basis of cost and quality.  This morning, we heard of the enormous fees paid for the Mahon tribunal and on free legal aid.  However, the legal profession are not the only people tendering for Government contracts.  This should be looked at.  Competition should be based on cost and quality, and a report on competitiveness is necessary.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Could the Leader provide for a follow-up to this debate?  We would like answers.  There is no point in talking hot air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmBurke">
      <NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently spoke to someone who decided to set up a new business seven months ago but will not be up and running until next week.  One of this person&rsquo;s problems was the lack of co-ordination between State services in facilitating the business being set up.  This is particularly true of local authorities.  Certain types of new business might be dealing with a number of different departments within a local authority.  There needs to be more co-operation within local authorities.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of mentoring within the banking sector.  We all talk about providing mentors and helping people who want to start up new businesses.  When the Agricultural Credit Corporation was set up it employed agricultural advisers to help farmers to grow and expand their businesses.  The banking sector seems to have moved away from that over the past 20 years.  It is now about giving out money, and the next step is to get it back in.  In the meantime, no advice is given to businesses by the banking sector.  I can give a example of this.  A number of years ago a German company had come into Ireland, started working and had spent about &euro;750,000 on a project, to find they had nothing signed in writing.  They had opened a bank account and employed accountants but they had not employed a legal team.  As a solicitor, I was asked to come on board to assist them to get out of their difficulties.  When one has spent that sort of money it is far harder to negotiate with the other side.  I remember collecting a cheque on Christmas Eve of that year for &euro;1 million, because that is what was owed to them.  After Christmas I asked how they had got themselves involved in this.  They said that when they came in to Ireland they were told to take everyone at their word.  It was sad that they could open a bank account and no one in the bank advised them to ensure they had all the t&rsquo;s crossed and the i&rsquo;s dotted before they did anything.  That is what I mean by mentoring.  Banks open accounts and give out money but they do not get involved in giving the advice that many new companies need.  This is something we should try to get the banking sector back into.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins raised a good point last week when she said bank officials need to be trained in how to approach people with large debts and how to deal with debt collection.  Likewise, the banking sector needs to help businesses, not alone in providing funding but in giving back-up support.  It is in a bank&rsquo;s interest that a company would succeed, be profitable and be able to employ people.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In Ireland, we lack co-ordination between third level institutions, research and private enterprise.  When I was Lord Mayor of Cork, I had the privilege of going to China, where various institutions are built alongside each other in order that there is a connection between all three sectors.  That is missing in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Several years ago, an Irish third level institution told me how it was prepared to provide research back-up for companies.  It was not looking for payment but took 10% of the company&rsquo;s <Col N="823" />profit for five a period of five years.  That might seem severe, but there was a plus for everyone.  The company did not have to pay up front for research to be carried out.  There is not enough co-ordination in that area.  We need to bring third level research facilities and companies together.  This needs to be developed if we are to grow jobs.</P>
      <P>An earlier speaker referred to money being available.    There is a good deal of money about, but people are afraid to invest.  Last week I spoke to a person who was considering spending &euro;600,000 on a commercial property.  When I advised this individual to consider investing in job creation, the immediate response was that bricks and mortar were more secure.  I am not sure why that view still holds in this day and age.  Unfortunately, there is a certain perception that investing in job creation is too risky, with too many ifs and buts, and the building sector remains the choice of investment for many.  We need to effect a change of attitude in order to encourage those who have money to invest it in initiatives which will create jobs for the next generation coming out of third level institutions.  One way of doing this is by examining how the business expansion scheme could be developed.  Some years ago there was an enormous take-up of the SSIA savings scheme because of the incentive to participate.  There is no reason we cannot do something similar to encourage investment in job creation.  If we put our heads together, we can come up with innovative ideas in this regard.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader and the Acting Chairman for facilitating this debate and Members for their constructive proposals.  This debate represents a welcome initiative for the House and a useful pointer for how we can focus our efforts on finding ways out of our economic difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to colleagues&rsquo; contributions to this debate.  Senator Terry Brennan hit the nail on the head when he referred to import substitution.  An important step in this regard would be to identify the top 100 items we import in order to see whether some of them could be produced at home.  Perhaps we cannot make cars, but we should certainly be able to produce at least some of the products currently being brought in from other countries.</P>
      <P>I recently put a proposal to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, that we draw up profiles of ten industrialised areas throughout the country.  These might include the Leader&rsquo;s city of Waterford, Cork, Dublin, my own town of Shannon where we have up to 10,000 employees in a variety of industries, Galway and so on.  This work could be undertaken by one or more of the various agencies, of which there is no shortage.  They should examine what is happening in these areas, what they are producing, what their output is, whether it be light industry, heavy industry, agricultural, pharmaceuticals and so on.</P>
      <P>Taking Shannon as an example, there has been a sea change in the industrial estate in the past two years, where a good deal of light industry has moved back in.  Before that, light industry had effectively moved to China and Taiwan.  EI Electronics, for example,  which manufactures smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors, employs up to 300 people and recently recruited an additional 40.  Molex which produces connectors for telephone chargers is an American company employing up to 600 people.  A new company in the estate, Bolger Engineering, manufactures items for Caterpillar machines.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to profile the cost of production in the State.  It has certainly dropped significantly in recent years as wages have declined.  We have a high quality employee in this country who is ready and able for work.  As I said, profiles should be compiled of the ten chosen industrial areas and a report produced within one month.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards all have the capability to compile this information which should be cross-referenced against the top 100 imports in order to see whether there is scope to produce some of these products at home.  What is vital is that we receive an answer in one month; there is no point in talking about this all day if there is no follow up.</P>
      <Col N="824" />
      <P>Another issue I wish to raise is that of food production, in which I was involved back in 1978 when I sought to get into the production of pat&eacute;.  Unfortunately, I took the advice of a guy from Shannon Development at the time which I should not have taken.  I would probably be very well off today if I had not heeded that advice.  I might have the figures wrong, but, as I recall, pat&eacute; imports into the State in 1979 were valued at IR&pound;1.8 million.  Being a chef by trade, I had come up with a very good product.  I was interested in investing in a blister pack machine which produces the plastic packaging in which one sees rashers and sausages today.  However, I was advised that this would be an unwise investment and that the cost of the machine, at more than IR&pound;100,000, was prohibitive.  Within five years pat&eacute; imports into the country were running at IR&pound;7 million and Horgan&rsquo;s Delicatessen Supplies which went on to be a tremendous success story had been set up.  It goes to show that one should persist with a good investment idea, even when one experiences a put-down.  I did eventually open my own business, rightly or wrongly, four years later.</P>
      <P>There is great potential to develop our organic product market.  As I have said to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, we produce the best organic food in the world and can boast some of the best salmon and sea farming.  The follow on should be the development all along the coast of research and development kitchens which are currently operating only in colleges.  My brother trains chefs in one of the institutes of technology and is a member of the Panel of Chefs of Ireland.  There should be an interlinking between the Panel of Chefs of Ireland, the chef training colleges and UCC, with the latter providing the food science backup and doing all the labelling &mdash; the content per 100 millilitres or 100 g, the shelf life of the product and so on.  I have spoken to people who are producing little bottles of sauces or jars of jam but cannot afford to take it to the next step, that is, the food science side, labelling the product and getting it on the shelf.  There must be greater connectivity and co-ordination.  We have the kitchens, the chefs and the products, but we must interlink them.</P>
      <P>We must be honest in acknowledging that many of the agencies got fat and lazy in recent years.  We all got lazy in the last 20 years and relied on the fellow coming off the aeroplane from America to create jobs.  We became accustomed to a situation where 70% of jobs in the State were created through foreign direct investment.  Now, however, we must do more for ourselves and there is no question or doubt in my mind that we can do so.</P>
      <P>It is important that we meet again in one month or six weeks to take this debate to the next step and assess where we are at.  We need to know what people are doing.  There is a notion abroad that all the jobs will be in cloud computing and companies such as Google.  While such jobs are very welcome, it is important to recognise that there is also a great deal of manufacturing going on.  What businesses need is a little assistance and advice to get them to the market.  Enterprise Ireland contacted people last year, when instructed by the Minister to do so, making one call to employers in my area.  However, there is little engagement on the part of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and all the other agencies once they hand over the initial grant.  Unfortunately, in recent years the next call was often to discuss the closure of a business.  That connection must be quickly re-established.  We can grow a great number of indigenous industries by ensuring more effective engagement by the agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>We in this House have been critical on many occasions of the format for the Order of Business, but this debate is the outcome of a good suggestion made by Senator Michael Mullins on the Order of Business that we have a brainstorming session, a <Col N="825" />think tank or whatever one wishes to call it, on the issue of job creation.  We have had wonderful suggestions from Members, but I agree that it should not stop at that.  We must convey these ideas to the Minister and the people involved.  I have already asked the leaders of the various groups to send bullet point suggestions made by the members of their groups to my office.  I am proposing that these suggestions be put together in the form of a book and presented to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry.  That book might then be presented to the Department&rsquo;s advisory committee on job creation, after which we could ask the Minister to come and respond to the suggestions made.</P>
      <P Just="Left">One speaker mentioned the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.  We can only hope officials from Enterprise Ireland visited each of the stands and spoke to the exhibitors about their business ideas.   Tremendous ideas are being put forward by young people, in whose hands the future rests.  I am sure we are already tapping into that resource but if we are not, then we are guilty of a major error.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien stated that initiatives are required in respect of tourism.  A major initiative, The Gathering, is due to be announced in the coming weeks.  A Minister will be coming before the House to discuss that matter.  Initiatives designed to attract more tourists are being put in place.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to make a couple of points.  Animation and graphics is an area in respect of which there is great potential for expansion.  I heard a radio interview with two young people who established a business in Dublin and who recently won a contract to produce an animation series for the Disney Channel.  They were asked whether anyone from Enterprise Ireland or any other agency had contacted them to discover what they did in order to succeed and replied that they had not been contacted.  We must learn from businesses which are succeeding and focus on areas in which there is potential to increase investment and create further employment.  We must listen to those already involved in the area of animation and graphics in order that we might create jobs.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to mariculture, aquaculture and fish farming on the Order of Business some time ago.  There is potential for expansion and job creation in these areas.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is due to come before the House next week.  On a previous occasion on which he addressed the House, he referred to the demand that exists for fish and fish products.  We cannot keep up with that demand and there is a need to expand the level of activity in the areas of fish farming and fish processing.  In many places fish is actually being sold without being processed.  In view of the increased quotas we achieved recently &mdash; following the best negotiating process in which we have engaged in many years &mdash; we should exploit the potential that exists.  In that context, we should not sell all the fish that are caught here immediately but rather they should first be processed.  There are opportunities for development in this area.</P>
      <P>Many Senators referred to food production.  We should shout from the rooftops with regard to the quality and traceability of food produced in this country.  There is tremendous export potential in this area.  Senator Quinn referred to the fact that one in five children in Asia is fed on infant formula milk produced in this country.  When milk quotas are removed, it will be possible to produce more milk and farmers will be in a position to expand their operations.  This is a matter to which we should be giving consideration now rather than when the change is made.  We should engage in an immediate examination of how we might exploit the relevant markets.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is a need, in the context of education, to place greater emphasis on the learning of languages, particularly Chinese and Spanish.  The institutes of technology were established to <Col N="826" />operate as centres of research and development and they have links to industry.  A company operating within Waterford Institute of Technology is actually involved &mdash; and has been quite successful &mdash; in establishing other companies.  Our focus should be on the mantra &ldquo;jobs, jobs, jobs&rdquo;.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">During the earlier debate on small business, I referred to county and city enterprise boards.  These boards are the first port of call for people seeking advice on starting their own businesses.  The enterprise boards are in limbo.  They do not know whether they are going to come under the remit of local government or Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am of the view that the former should be the case and that they should be part of a one-stop-shop model.  The Government must make a decision in this regard in order that the enterprise boards might commence work.  They should be provided with the funding necessary to allow them to create jobs.  Many thousands of jobs were created in the past as a result of the work done by these boards.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As stated, we intend to bring together the various ideas put forward by the members of the various groups and present them to the Minister and the advisory committee on jobs.  Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien stated that this could be done by Smurfit Business School.  I will take her up on that offer if it is possible to do so.  We want movement on this matter and we need a response from the Minister.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, has agreed to come before the House for a debate when the advisory committee has examined all the ideas put forward.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will also come before the House.</P>
      <P>I had wondered whether this debate would last three hours and whether Senators would be present for its entire duration.  I am glad it has done so and that many Senators have made excellent contributions.  That is something which will reflect well on the Seanad.  We must put forward ideas through debates of this nature because doing so is a way to promote the work of the House.  It will be possible to engage in similar debates on many subjects.  However, the need to create jobs is the most crucial issue with which we must deal at present.  It is good that Senators are taking this matter seriously and offering worthy ideas which, I hope, will be acted upon.  I thank all Senators for their contributions.</P>

        <P>This issue relates to the decision by the Minister for Education and Skills on small schools, defined as schools with fewer than 86 pupils.  The decision was taken by the Minister in the budget to try to, as he said, cut down on the expenditure, without even waiting for the efficiency and value for money review, which is being complied by the Department, to be published.  The Minister made a decision to proceed with a policy decision without having first consulted or published the value for money review which was undertaken in consultation with boards of management and principals throughout the country.  Why would the Minister consult principal teachers, gather all of the necessary data and then not take it into account when making a conscious decision to attack small rural schools with fewer than 86 pupils?</P>
        <P>The schools concerned provide excellent educational opportunities to children of primary school age.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Education and Skills proceeded with implementing a cost-cutting exercise on small schools only.  What he is in effect doing is targeting small schools in a blatant way to force them to amalgamate or close by raising the pupil-teacher ratio in such schools only, without affecting larger schools.  This will inevitably result in a loss of teachers, which will mean larger classes, and a greater number of class groupings having to be taught by one teacher.  Taking into consideration all of the paperwork and preparations teachers must do, larger numbers of children with special needs will also be in one classroom with the resulting attendant difficulties which this will inflict on smaller schools.  It is also unfair to children with special needs.  The measure will bring about closures, amalgamations and the loss of teaching posts within schools.</P>
        <P>While the Department is not blatantly saying that it wants to force schools to amalgamate, without question it is doing it by stealth by trying to reduce the number of teachers and make it nearly impossible for small schools to survive, thus forcing them into a situation where they must amalgamate.  This is occurring in the North of Ireland where the Minister of Education, Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd, is forcing schools of fewer than 105 pupils to amalgamate.  Why is the Minister for Education and Skills in this Republic following that protocol before a value for money review is published?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I contacted the Minister for Education and Skills and received numerous letters from him on specific queries relating to my constituency.  In recent days I received a letter from him referring to the fact that &ldquo;the phasing of these measures provides the schools concerned with the time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible&rdquo;.  It is totally ludicrous to ask schools that have invested resources and capital through taxpayers&rsquo; investment to bring schools up to standard only to close them down.  That is unacceptable.  The Department is asking the boards of management to make the decision rather than making the decision itself.  The Minister continued in the letter to state: &ldquo;The existing staffing model also acts as a disincentive for small schools to consider amalgamation&rdquo;.  Of course it does.  That is why we are happy with the existing staffing model.  It may not be perfect but at least it allows small, rural schools the opportunity to remain open.</P>
        <Col N="828" />
        <P>When Fianna F&aacute;il came into government in 1997 one of the first things that was done was that the staffing retention for small schools was reduced from 24 pupils down to 12.  We stand by that.  We cannot allow the Minister to proceed as outlined.  I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, a member of the Fine Gael Party, to exercise pressure on the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, because the implication for small rural schools of this draconian measure which was introduced without consultation will be to close down many parts of rural areas.  That will result in children travelling to schools way beyond their reach.  In addition, it will be almost impossible for many children to avail of school transport next year given the increase in school transport costs.</P>
        <P>There are many reasons for the proposed changes to be reversed.  The Minister should listen to the schools and communities and reverse the decision immediately because the cost saving to be achieved is minimal.  It is not about saving money; it is about seeking to amalgamate schools and to make it easier to streamline the process.  That is not the right way to proceed.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it affords me the opportunity to explain to the House the reasoning behind the changes to the staffingschedule.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are dealing with a very difficult situation in the education sector whereby we have to find savings and control the increase in public sector numbers considering that one third of all public sector employees work in the education sector.  It is important to note that a key aspect of the EU-IMF programme of support and Ireland&rsquo;s overall budgetary strategy is a requirement to reduce the public sector payroll.  This is especially challenging in the education sector because unlike in other countries, our school-going population is rising rapidly.  Places must be provided for the extra 70,000 pupils arriving in schools in the next six years.  Teachers must be appointed to teach them.  The Minister for Education and Skills will ensure every child has a physical place in which to go to school.</P>
        <P>Providing for increased enrolments is a key priority but making some adjustment to teacher numbers is unavoidable given the budgetary constraints and the difficulties of the situation we encountered on arriving into office.  We do not have monetary control of the economy currently.  The net impact on overall teacher numbers in schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P>As part of the budget decisions announced recently, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  The schools concerned are those with four or fewer classroom teachers.  At present the staffing schedule at primary level disproportionately benefits small primary schools.  That is evident when we look at average class size in schools.  Even when all of these phased increases are implemented, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s.</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge the concerns raised by the Senator, the budget measure must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times.  Furthermore, the phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools if they so wish and where it is feasible to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I re-emphasise that no small schools will be forced to close by the Department owing to this budget measure.  If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.  Separately, a value for money review on <Col N="829" />small primary schools has been under way in the Department for the past year.  This is part of the normal review process undertaken annually by all Departments on selected areas of expenditure.  Among the issues being taken into account in the review are questions such as availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, the language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities.  The review will examine the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type.  It will also examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.  The value for money review is simply about ascertaining all the facts to inform future policy in this area.  Work on the review is well advanced and the Minister expects that the report of the review should be available to him shortly.  The Minister will then have to consider its outcomes and proposals.</P>
        <P>I emphasise again that the measure before the House is not about closing small schools.  The changes to staffing schedules alter the current preferential position of small schools over larger ones.  That alone is what is changing in September next with respect to small schools.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, who is from the north west and, I am sure, understands the difficulty this measure is creating.  It is the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who should be answering these questions because it beggars belief that any Cabinet Minister would make a policy decision that would impact on many small schools with fewer than 86 pupils.  To call it an efficiency measure without waiting for the publication of the efficiency report does not make sense.  It is evident that the Minister made a calculated political decision to target smaller schools without having the detailed information available to him.  That is causing a great deal of annoyance among teachers and parents, rightly so, because it is the wrong approach.  I plead with the Minister of State to exert as much pressure as possible on the Minister on this issue because it will impact negatively on all of rural Ireland but especially on education in rural schools and in small communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry">
        <NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">The difficulty is the EU-IMF programme which has set the template in terms of us spending &euro;1.3 billion per month more than we are taking in.  That is the legacy the Government inherited and, unfortunately, actions must be taken which we as a Government would prefer not to have to take but, with careful management and due diligence, we hope to deal with that.  I have no doubt the Minister has some insight into the report, the publication of which is imminent.  This issue is ongoing and was even with the previous Administration.  I have no doubt that every consideration will be given by parents, teachers and the boards of management to ensure the pupil-teacher ratio will be balanced and will reflect the needs of the children.  The reply from the Minister, Deputy Quinn, clearly indicates that no school will be closed.  It is a matter entirely for the boards of management and their capability to decide what is in the best interests of the children.</P>

        <P>I call on the Minister of State to make a statement on the closure of the Diageo Dundalk plant, the former Harp lager plant, and the implications of that for the economy of Dundalk.  The devastating news delivered to the staff last Thursday that the plant is due to close in July 2013 will bring to an end the long tradition of brewing in Dundalk which dates back to the 19th century.</P>
        <P>Dundalk, which was once one of the most industrial towns in the country, has seen the demise of many industries in recent years, including our other local sister brewery, Macardle Moore, which closed in 2001.  The unfortunate closure of the Harp brewery, as it is better known in Dundalk, is yet another blow to the people of Dundalk who have already suffered so much recently with the national economic downturn and the sterling rate due to its close proximity to the Border with Northern Ireland.  The Harp brewery was a major sponsor of <Col N="830" />many projects in our town and the loss of sponsorship for local projects will be sorely felt by all in the town.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask some questions about the decision to relocate all operations to St. James&rsquo;s Gate.  Having spoken to a number of workers from the Dundalk plant in the past week, I have been informed that there are close to 100 staff in the plant, including between 57 and 62 full-time workers, although I stand to be corrected on that, along with contract workers, catering staff and maintenance workers.  When all of those are taken into account and from my reports, there are close to 100 staff in the plant.  The information given to all the staff in the booklet last Thursday clearly states that no further head count will be needed for St. James&rsquo;s Gate, meaning that none of them will be redeployed.</P>
        <P>I ask that every effort be made to ensure these loyal and dedicated workers, some of whose families have worked in that brewery for generations in one of the oldest traditions of their town, are provided with fair and full support, ensuring their skills, loyalty and dedication to Diageo is properly and fairly recognised.</P>
        <P>In its announcement last week, Diageo made much of the provision of the 300 jobs in the construction phase of the new brew house in St. James&rsquo;s Gate, but that is misleading as the proposed construction jobs will be of a temporary nature and will not create new employment when one takes into account the number of jobs that will be lost between both the Dundalk and Kilkenny plants.  I also have serious concerns about where it will get the vast volumes of extra water needed to produce the additional amount of brewing and the way it will be obtained.</P>
        <P>The area around St. James&rsquo;s Gate is residential.  How will this move affect the residents in the area?  How will all the extra traffic caused by delivery trucks, tankers and so on affect the residents in the surrounding areas?  How will the environmental issues, with the increase in production planned after the Dundalk and Kilkenny plants are amalgamated with St. James&rsquo;s Gate, be dealt with?  The steam and the smell from the hops around the Dundalk plant, and around the town, on brewing days is synonymous with the town and is something that will be sorely missed.  If that is trebled, I wonder about the environmental effects that will ensue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State question what will become of the Dundalk site?  It is imperative that this monumental site with its symbol of the harp, which has always been the symbol of Dundalk also, is not allowed to fall into disrepair.  I hope Diageo will release its plan for the site as soon as possible.  It is extremely sad that from July 2013 we will never again see &ldquo;Brewed in Dundalk&rdquo; on our bottles of beer, particularly the harp symbol which is on many things around the town.  I looked at the Diageo website earlier and it describes Harp Lager as being brewed in Dundalk with &ldquo;pure water from the Cooley Mountains&rdquo;.  How will that be possible when the plant moves to St. James&rsquo;s Gate, and does that mean that Harp lager beer will no longer be available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry">
        <NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  The operations of the company referred to by the Senator have been under review for some time.  The decision on its future brewing operations in Ireland was the result of a detailed examination of the company&rsquo;s existing businesses in Ireland.  The investment announced for St. James&rsquo;s Gate last week will consolidate brewing operations and while I welcome the company&rsquo;s announcement of the major new investment that secures the future of brewing in Ireland, I was disappointed to hear that the closure of the Dundalk site, which was announced in 2008, would now materialise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am conscious of the anxiety the proposed closures will create for the workers involved and their families, as well as the local communities in terms of the history of the site and the connection with Dundalk. The State agencies will make every effort to develop new employ<Col N="831" />ment opportunities for Dundalk.  It is vital that a plan of action would be commenced and work begun on that.</P>
        <P>The intention to close the existing brewery in Dundalk in 2013 was announced by the company in 2008.  At the time the company intended to expand part of St. James&rsquo;s Gate and open a greenfield facility in the greater Dublin area.  In early 2009, the company announced that it was reviewing its decision to establish the new brewery.  The brewery in Dundalk has played an important role over the years in the historic success of the company&rsquo;s brands in Ireland and in terms of the promotion of the Cooley Mountains.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the decision on plant closure is a matter for the company, Enterprise Ireland has been, and is, actively engaging with the company on an ongoing basis &mdash; it is the intention of the Government to ensure that engagement is ongoing &mdash; and is seeking investments to protect and grow jobs in Ireland.  A number of investments in research and development programmes in the company&rsquo;s operations have been secured in recent years, including programmes for which Enterprise Ireland approved grant support in June 2008 and in August 2010.  That is an ongoing research and development innovation programme.</P>
        <P>In April, July and December 2011, Enterprise Ireland met the company to discuss the developments in St. James&rsquo;s Gate and plans for Kilkenny and Dundalk.  In October 2011, at the request of the company, the agency made a presentation to the staff at the Dundalk brewery on the future skills needs of the manufacturing sector in Ireland and on the outlook for that sector.  Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work proactively with the company to ensure that it continues to develop its existing brands in Ireland and that the maximum number of jobs are retained here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The full range of State supports will be deployed to support the Dundalk workers at the appropriate time.  The enterprise development agencies will continue to engage proactively with the company to explore future opportunities for staff.  It is very important that there be time for engagement.</P>
        <P>Job creation is at the top of the Government&rsquo;s agenda and we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions that will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.  The jobs initiative, announced last May, focuses our limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation in the domestic economy.  Work is also continuing on the Government&rsquo;s action plan for jobs which will set out a series of clear, actionable measures to support the creation and retention of jobs.  The strategy will focus on areas such as assisting indigenous businesses to grow, supporting indigenous start-ups, attracting inward entrepreneurial start-ups and supporting employment initiatives within the community.</P>
        <P>It is important that the impact of the company&rsquo;s decision on employment in Dundalk be minimised.  The State enterprise agencies and the Louth County Enterprise Board will continue to make every effort to develop new employment opportunities for Dundalk and the surrounding area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through continuing to work with established companies in its portfolio.  The agency is also supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up high-potential start-up companies.  This week, the highest ever level of exports by Enterprise Ireland companies was reached.  CSO figures published yesterday indicated the success of Enterprise Ireland-managed companies.</P>
        <P>The county enterprise boards provide a valuable resource for those starting a business.  Anyone who has been made redundant or who is facing redundancy in Dundalk and who is interested in exploring options for setting up their own business should contact the Louth County Enterprise Board for appropriate advice and assistance.</P>
        <Col N="832" />
        <P Just="Left">IDA Ireland continues to promote the Dundalk area for important new investment in the pharmaceutical, clean technologies, globally traded businesses and financial services sectors.  The agency is actively engaged with the existing client base in the town to encourage its transition to higher value activities and its continued commitment to Ireland.  Dundalk is being promoted and marketed actively by IDA Ireland among potential investors.</P>
        <P>I am confident the measures outlined in the action plan for jobs, together with the activities being pursued by the State agencies in Dundalk, will continue to support enterprise development and provide employment opportunities.  The State agencies will continue to work closely with one another and local interests and communities to support an integrated approach to job creation in Dundalk.</P>
        <P>With regard to the site for Dundalk, the community and agencies should embark on discussions with Diageo with regard to its proposal for the vast site and how it could be utilised to the benefit of the entire region, especially Dundalk.  I have no doubt that this engagement will be part of the negotiations with the vested interests in the region, employers, staff and management, the chamber of commerce and all the development agencies in the town.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran">
        <NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
        <P>I totally agree with the Minister of State that it is vital.  All too often, when companies leave towns, including Dundalk, their premises are allowed to become derelict and havens for anti-social behaviour.  I ask that everything be done to prevent this and that there be sufficient communication.  Dundalk, as the Minister of State said, is in an ideal location.  It is situated on the east coast and is 50 miles from both Belfast and Dublin.  I ask that all these considerations be taken into account in order to maintain the confidence of the workers in Diageo and the graduates from the local college, Dundalk Institute of Technology, which has provided employment for many.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry">
        <NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
        <P>As I stated clearly, the agencies will be working proactively in every possible way to ensure that job losses will be minimised.  There is a timeframe of opportunity with regard to the development at St. James&rsquo;s Gate and the impact of this development.  When one considers the opportunities for alternative investments in Dundalk, one notes the priority is very much to attract investment to the region.  We should bear in mind the history of the region, the potential of the site, perhaps as some form of tourist development, and the added value conferred on it by its proximity to the Cooley Mountains.  I have not been on the site but would imagine that, with its history as a brewing location for generations, its association with the region should be retained in some way.  I have no doubt that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>The Senator should consider the potential in that regard with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  That is not to diminish the role of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in maximising the job potential of the region.  The priority of Mr. O&rsquo;Leary of IDA Ireland will be to attract foreign direct investment and that of Mr. Frank Ryan of Enterprise Ireland will be to ensure that the indigenous economy is supported.  The county enterprise boards will be working proactively and collectively to ensure that we retain and create additional jobs.  I hope we minimise the losses as best we can.</P>
