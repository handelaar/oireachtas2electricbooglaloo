      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach has confirmed the most pressing and important matter for the Government and the Oireachtas is to deal with those in mortgage distress.  Later this week, we will get the exact figures but it is expected that up to 25% of mortgages are in distress with over 10% being 90 days or more in arrears.  I have referred to these figures time and time again since last October.  I am not going to move an amendment to the Order of Business on this matter.  However, will the Leader give a commitment to get the Minister for Finance to attend the House next week?  We need the Minister for Finance on this issue, no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for whom I have immense regard.  Should I not get a response to this request by Wednesday week, I give notice that every successive day I will table amendments to the Order of Business.  I appreciate the House is not sitting next week.  If a date is not set for that debate I will continue to table amendments to the Order of Business.  We need a proper debate in order that we know what is happening in that regard.</P>
        <P>I asked last week and on seven separate occasions in recent months about the publication of the pyrite report.  In a reply last week I was told that the Government was planning to publish the report by the end of the month?  Is that correct?  If so, I look forward to seeing it.  Will the Leader give a commitment to arrange for a debate on the report?  Pyrite potentially affects up to 72,500 houses and apartments predominantly on the east coast, mainly the north east, but including the city and county of Dublin.  We should be afforded sufficient time after publication to allow us consider the report after which it should be debated in the House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Private Members&rsquo; motion on the national lottery which is tabled for debate.</P>
        <P>I call for a further debate on the sale of State assets and what is being proposed.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to come to the House for that debate.</P>
        <P>I noted with grave concern yesterday the case in regard to a double murder in 1988 where a person signed himself back into the Central Mental Hospital having escaped some years ago.  I understand the State will be caught in a bind in respect of this individual and that he will be able to seek release from the Central Mental Hospital on the basis that he was not tried because he was deemed insane.  I am interested to hear the Government&rsquo;s response and, particularly, that of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  This brings me to the issue of justice in general.</P>
        <P>Many colleagues on all sides of the House and I have requested time and again that the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to discuss the Government&rsquo;s stance on policing.  I have given specific examples, including the fact that the Government is planning to close 400 Garda stations in the next three years.  That is contained in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  The Government has closed busy urban stations and rural stations.  As I got no answer last week or the previous week, to my request I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House and address the Government&rsquo;s plans for upholding the safety of citizens and, specifically, its plans for policing and the number of Garda stations it considers optimal in Ireland today.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  What we are getting is a drip-drip feed.  He closed 39 Garda stations last year and proposes to close 40 this year.  The Minister must come to the House to make a clear statement on where the Government stands on policing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was slightly confused.  I was about to note the Senator&rsquo;s calm and measured mood this morning in keeping with the weather outside but at the latter end he proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was unexpected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Whip.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Coghlan have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.  I welcome the announcement from NAMA regarding its proposal to invest &euro;2 billion to cater for the supply and demand side of residential and commercial property which will lead to the creation of 35,000 new jobs.  That is tremendous news.  I look forward to its continuous roll-out of further good news in the coming years.  Demand for commercial and residential property has increased and there is a supply shortage in respect of large offices which, it has said, will be dealt with in this programme.  The creation of 25,000 new jobs in construction and 10,000 in the wider economy as well as its commitment, in line with its brief, to pay its debts by 2020 are welcome.  It suffered criticism, somewhat unjustly.  We are all interested in transparency and look forward to the Bill whenever it is moved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>What Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is further good news to come from that agency which is making a tremendous effort in the national interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Did Senator Norris indicate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I indicate also that I watched a programme on television last night which dealt with the Oireachtas inquiry into RTE&rsquo;s handling of the Fr. Reynold&rsquo;s case which was most instructive, particularly, the very strong behaviour of various Members, including Members of this House who, when RTE is down it is easy to kick it and they put the boot in.  There was a noticeable muting in the House when I raised matters concerning the general media, including the print media.  One issue that escaped the attention of everybody who was there was that without the DNA evidence, Fr. Kevin Reynolds would still be convicted by public opinion.  As far as I know, nobody raised that issue.  That is one critical point and they missed it &mdash; well done, congratulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is an appalling example of timidity that people will only attack what is a great national institution, RTE, when it has made some serious mistakes but do not try to find out if this has happened elsewhere and, if so, where it has happened.  The general media is afraid to take up these cases.  I call again for an inquiry on the lines of the Leveson inquiry.  I was taken by what Mr. Tom Savage said when he said that he understood, as somebody who had been a priest for seven years, how it feels to have one&rsquo;s entire ethical standing impugned.  I know how it feels too.  It would be very good if Members of the House who put themselves forward for public life refused to accept that they can be lied about with impunity.  I would like some courage from my colleagues in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the conduct of the Order of Business, a practice has emerged that Members are not replied to if they are not in the House.  I remained in the House yesterday and I noticed that once again the Government broke its rule as it suited it to do so.  Apparently, it is quite arbitrary and capricious.  That is not appropriate.  I missed a meeting with the Colombian delegation which was here to brief the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in order that I could be in the House but, apparently, I would have been replied to even if I had not been present.  That we do not know where we stand is sloppy management for which I condemn the Government side.  That is regrettable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad, I think partly as a result of my raising the issue, that the question of our approval of the Council decision on the conclusion agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records will be discussed.  It was, apparently, to go through without discussion.  That I raised the issue may have something to do with it.  I ask the Deputy Leader if she will be present to give us the benefit of her knowledge.  She informed the House she had been at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when the issue was discussed and certain issues were raised which were of concern.  It would be helpful if the Deputy Leader with her professional background could let us know these concerns in order that we can decide whether to approve the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien I raised my hand to speak about the Gallagher affair.  I will not speak on the Gallagher case <i>per se</i> because that will be an issue for a review of the prison authorities and I would not presume to infringe on any issue it will decide.  I ask the Minister to make a statement on the actual procedures of the Act.  When the Act was adopted, the verdict was guilty but insane.  In 1963 it was changed to, &ldquo;not guilty by reasons of insanity&rdquo;.  If a person escapes from prison, it is an offence and time is added or a penalty is imposed.  If a person escapes from a mental institution a different law applies and I ask the Minister to review it.   If a person escapes from a mental institution and returns, presuming and claiming to be sane, that person cannot be prosecuted for leaving because of insanity.  One cannot have it both ways.  I ask the Minister to come here to the House because we, as legislators, are being asked questions but we need answers.  I need answers to my questions and an explanation of the difference between escaping by means of insanity and no penalty or <i>vice versa</i> from jail.  Anne Gillespie, her mother, Annie, and the extended Gallagher family need answers too.  I ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Deputy Leader about the U-turn by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on the Smithwick tribunal.  Approximately a year go he put a gun to Mr. Justice Smithwick&rsquo;s head demanding that he complete his work quickly and claimed he was tardy and delayed providing a report on a delicate inquiry.  It now appears that the Minister has made a second U-turn by further extending the time.  What changed the Minister&rsquo;s mind in the past year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Look at the extra witnesses that have appeared on the scene.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>He came into the House.  He brought a bit of it in here to restrict us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Everything is proper, do not worry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan please, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last summer he made a public comment, at his own volition, a most unusual move by a Minister for Justice and Equality.  He basically condemned and slated Mr. Justice Smithwick for the delay but the Minister should have reflected further at that stage.  He should now come in here to explain his position.</P>
        <P>I seek an urgent debate next week on the referendum.  As a supporter of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign I can say that it is faltering day by day.  The display the other night by the T&aacute;naiste on television was extremely poor.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Both Deputy Mary Lou McDonald of Sinn F&eacute;in and Declan Ganley wiped the floor with him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is considering wiping the floor but not saying anything about the treaty then he is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>This House deserves a debate.  I understand and know why Ministers like Deputies Phil Hogan, Alan Shatter and Brendan Howlin have been sidelined and put into the bunker.  It is because they messed up in the last campaign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator trying to leave a sinking ship?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply concerned that the debate has gone flat.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business and request that we sit next Tuesday all day to debate the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the Taoiseach to come here, and he is overdue a visit, to discuss the issue.  I also want the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to attend.  They could each spend three hours here debating such an appropriate matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not an amendment to the Order of Business.  Senators decide tomorrow when to sit next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose, with or without an amendment but I can table one tomorrow, that the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance come here.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Finance made very undiplomatic remarks on feta cheese and the Greek situation.  It is important for this House to hold a debate next week before we vote on the referendum, and it does not matter whether Members support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but we must have a full debate.  There was no proper debate in either House on the issue.  There were just a few spats in the D&aacute;il on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  There has not been a proper debate in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The same old things would be gone over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I demand that we hold a debate next week in order to reflect on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s call for a debate, with the relevant Minister, on the proposed personal insolvency Bill.  The Senator is right that it is a matter of huge public importance.  People are crying out for some support to alleviate their personal indebtedness.  I am not sure but I think it is the Minister for Justice and Equality that will introduce the Bill.  I am concerned about the way it has been drafted and the potential damage it could inflict on the credit union movement.  Everyone here is familiar with the fantastic contribution made by the credit union movement to our society over the past decades.  There are 400 credit unions nationally with &euro;13 billion in assets and 2 million members.  The Tullamore Credit Union, in my own area, is one of the largest in the country with 35,000 members and &euro;61 million of a loan book.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many members of the credit union movement feel that the personal insolvency Bill, which is intended to solve one problem, could cause an even greater problem if it is introduced in its current state.  As Senators will know, most credit union loans are under the &euro;20,000 threshold.  The preferential creditors system and structure proposed in the Bill means that the credit union movement could take a grievous hit even though it has always fostered a culture of saving and responsible lending.  Nearly every person in the country has taken out a credit union loan at some stage of their lives.  I was 17 years old when I took out my first loan from the Monasterevin Credit Union for a motorbike.  Credit unions are very important to every community.  It is important that in trying to solve one problem, the issue of mortgage indebtedness, we do not create an even greater one by completely undermining the foundation and stability of the credit union movement.  A debate here could be fruitful because we could influence how the Bill is drafted and amend it accordingly to allay the genuine and well-founded concerns of the credit union movement.</P>

        <P>I hope that it is not a case of Fianna F&aacute;il getting ready, because they feel that the tide is turning against them, and they are trying to lay the blame for the defeat of the referendum at the feet of the Government.</P>

	<P>A debate would be welcome.  I wish to mention that Africa Day will take place on Friday and congratulate the people for organising it.  Today a very good conference is being held at Trinity College Dublin.  It was organised by the Trinity International Development Initiative and deals with development issues in Africa.  I also welcome the development of the Africa Agrifood Development Fund.  It is a positive move forward.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, not everybody from Africa will be in a position to celebrate in this country.  This week, I received the very disturbing news that the Galway Refugee Support Group will close down due to a lack of funding.  That is a detrimental step backwards.  It is important to have a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on asylum seekers here, particularly on the development of the immigration Bill which has been long-fingered and kicked into touch once more by him.  I talked to people from the Galway Refugee Support Group and people in this country are living in desperate conditions while in direct provision.  Some of them have waited up to ten years to get a case hearing and to resolve the issue.  It is very important that we deal with these people.  We would jump up and down if it happened to one of our citizens anywhere else around the world.  There are huge issues around health, inadequate food, lack of an independent complaints mechanism, right to privacy, right to dignity, etc.  A broad-ranging debate on asylum seekers and the immigration Bill is necessary.  Where is it?  Why can it not be brought forward?  The legislation is extremely important.</P>
        <P>I welcome Africa Day and in true Irish fashion the celebration has been extended to almost a week.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of building standards and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s proposed amendments of the building regulations.  The property boom of the past ten years has resulted in a dramatic fall in the building standard of our properties.  We have all seen the dangers that arise from cases like Priory Hall and I am sure that there are similar cases throughout Ireland.  We have houses that are not properly insulated, sound proofed or structurally sound and the wrong materials were used in construction, including pyrite.  We also have buildings with insufficient fire prevention standards and generally shoddy standards.  The cost of the lax system of building regulation over the past decade is now beginning to show.  We must strengthen building standards to ensure that we are building in a sustainable manner and that we never repeat the mistakes of the past.  I am working with a number of architects on proposals to improve the manner in which we build our homes and buildings.</P>
        <P>I call on the House to debate the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s proposed amendments to the building regulations.  The ramifications of the changes are in the interest of every property owner and I call for a debate.</P>
        <P>When will the Coroners Bill be introduced in the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform &mdash; public service reform is a misnomer &mdash; to come to the House for a debate on jobs for the boys?  I do not only refer to public service retirees on good pensions being re-employed at high salary rates, which is a scandal, but also to the various party hacks who have been employed by Ministers on enhanced salaries.  A bad precedent was set by the Taoiseach when he arranged for at least nine ministerial advisers to be paid salaries in excess of &euro;93,000, which is the designated salary for the post.  He gave the green light for a salary of &euro;127,000 for a former Fine Gael director of communications who had been appointed as special adviser to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Taoiseach appointed two top Fine Gael aides as advisers with a salary of &euro;168,000.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator looking for a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, absolutely.  Not to be outdone, the Labour Party could not keep its snout out of the trough, with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade appointing the party&rsquo;s former director of policy on a salary of &euro;155,000.  My concern is that this contagion has spread to the Office of the President.  An adviser, whose salary was to be designated at &euro;80,000, has had it increased to &euro;103,000.</P>

However, there is no difficulty in dealing promptly with what is an absolute scandal.</P>
        <P>I appeal to Government Members, whom I know share my sentiments, to express their objection and hostility to this.  This arrogance will undermine and do untold damage not only to the country but also to the parties they represent.  I ask for a debate on this issue.</P>

I thought the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade did well.  He articulated a difficult position against a shallow argument from the opposition.  As he said, throwing slogans will not solve problems.  If people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side even for a moment debated the content of the treaty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I refer to NAMA&rsquo;s announcement earlier of a &euro;2 billion investment to create thousands of jobs.  Any measure that stimulates the labour market must be welcomed.  However, the House could do with a debate on the agency.  I would like to know more about the nature of this investment,  the due diligence carried out on it, the multiplier effect of the investment and whether other investment opportunities in the economy could yield a better return.  Will the Deputy Leader organise a debate on NAMA because the House has an important role to play?  If the House in the past had properly done its job and debated medium to long-term policy on issues that were not part of the dominant ideology or discourse of the day, perhaps the country would not be in the mess it is in.  The House has an important role in discussing mid to long-term policy.  NAMA is a perfect example of where we can do productive work.  The Deputy Leader should ask that a representative of the agency appears before the House as well as the Minister for Finance.  Will she facilitate a full and comprehensive debate?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am sure colleagues have read the newspaper reports, particularly in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, about a property on which a loan of &euro;100 million had been secured which was sold for &euro;7 million.

	<P>I seek a debate on banking, including the upcoming personal insolvency Bill.  The most important legislation the House will deal with this year will be the personal insolvency Bill.  It warrants significant debate.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which made significant amendments to the heads of the Bill and made additional proposals.  We worked particularly hard to ensure our input to the Bill would be specific, detailed and relevant.  The House would benefit from a debate on banking prior to the publication of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that Aung San Suu Kyi has been invited to Ireland.  Unfortunately, the invitation has been issued by a group of NGOs and not the Government.  I called some time ago on the Government to invite her to Ireland when she visited London.  However, she is coming here and that is welcome.  Perhaps the Leader might put a proposal to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that she be invited to address the House during her visit to Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  While I applaud Senator Martin Conway&rsquo;s interest in Aung San Suu Kyi, those of us who are here long enough are aware that her name has been mentioned in this House for more than 15 years.  I assume the non-governmental organisation to which the Senator referred is Burma Action Ireland, in which several Members have been involved.  That body is to be commended for its persistent and extraordinary work on this issue, including at a time when its cause was not popular.  It has played an enormous part in informing the general public to the point where people now understand Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s ongoing contribution to the restoration of democracy in Burma.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been media reports in recent days on remarks made by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, indicating her astonishment that people should be critical of hard times, austerity and cutbacks.  The Irish people do not need lectures from Chancellor Merkel about hard times.  Just as we endured a series of hard times in the last 800 years and more, we will also come through our current difficulties.  Instead of lecturing us, Chancellor Merkel should look to the banks in her own country.  Moreover, she would be better occupied in dropping her opposition to the issuing of eurobonds to the European Central Bank, a move which would remove the crippling and unsustainable bank debt that will otherwise bring this country down.  One may call such moves by any name one likes &mdash; debt forgiveness or otherwise &mdash; but unless and until that debt bank is removed we will not overcome our difficulties.  The bottom line is that this debt was generated by German banks which handed out money like confetti to financial institutions throughout Europe, yet the Germans have the temerity to suggest the Irish people should seek not only to bridge the deficit gap in day-to-day spending which is what the Government is attempting to do and what its predecessor also sought to do but, in addition, to take on this burden of bank debt.  This is the one issue that keeps coming up on the doorsteps in the course of my campaigning for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum.  The degree of hostility to the banking sector in this country and Europe generally is a far greater cause for concern regarding the outcome of the treaty than its terms.  That is my message to Chancellor Merkel today.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan and others in calling for the Taoiseach to come to the House for a debate on developments in Europe, following his attendance next month at what will probably be the most important European summit of modern times.  Decisions will be taken over dinner tonight, following today&rsquo;s meeting, which will be formulated at the summit in June.  Other members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and I appreciated the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to this Chamber last week and the speech he made.  Will the Deputy Leader respond specifically to my request that he be invited to the House after the European summit at the end of June to report to us, as he will to the other House, on issues that will greatly impact on the future of the country?</P>

	<P>In 2005, when schools were designated for support under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme, there were a number which, despite meeting the criteria for inclusion, were not awarded that status.  Many of the areas in which these schools are located have been suffering even greater economic and social deprivation since.  The Minister for Education and Skills did the right thing in reversing some of the cuts to the DEIS scheme announced in the budget last December.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>There were no exemptions for rural schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I am concerned that the schools which did not attain DEIS status in 2005, despite meeting all of the criteria, are now being subjected to the same cutbacks as schools which are much less disadvantaged.  The consequence of this is that students who need more support will receive much less.  The Minister must come to the House to discuss what might be done for this cohort of students.  If the matter is simply brushed under the carpet, these areas of deprivation will end up requiring hundreds of millions of euro in support by way of Limerick-style regeneration.  I hope I have the support of the entire House in this regard.  An error was made in 2005 and the schools thereby denied DEIS status have experienced further hardship in the interim.  It would be an absolute shame if the Department imposed additional cuts on these schools.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s reference to grandstanding is nicely in line with the issue I wish to raise, namely, my concern that some of my colleagues have been losing the run of themselves at recent meetings of the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture.  I feel as passionately as anybody about the wrong done to the individuals concerned by RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, but I am very concerned that certain people are missing the point about that documentary and its consequences for RTE.  It is typical of what happens when controversy erupts around institutions in our society that politicians, in particular, are tempted to call for heads and seek headlines.  That is the wrong approach to take because it misses the point about the lessons that must be learned.  It is emphatically the case that the chairman and director general of RTE should not consider resigning.  The issue is what they intend to do to assure public representatives and the wider public, first, that they fully understand and have thoroughly investigated what happened and, second, that they will put things right for the future in a way that will protect investigative journalism but also examine the bias and unprofessionalism within journalism.   The test of the director general and the chairman in the coming months will be the extent to which they continue to maintain the spotlight on RTE&rsquo;s internal operations and learn the full range of lessons arising from this affair, including those relating to the culture which may have underlain the broadcast and how matters relating to it were handled.  I reiterate my concern that some of the people involved have not, to my knowledge, apologised to Fr. Kevin Reynolds for their role in the affair, while others seem to have been moved aside within the organisation.  This is not about resignations but about the taking of responsibility.  As politicians, we must cool it, avoid grandstanding and focus on the issues rather than missing the point.  If we are only going to hyperventilate, shout and scream and demand that heads roll, the public will not take us seriously as people with a genuine and important role to play in establishing the truth about matters of public controversy.</P>

	<P>Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to come to the House in the coming weeks to update us on developments in regard to the jobs plan?  Significant progress has been made in recent months, but it is important that this House have an opportunity to contribute further to the debate on how we should proceed in encouraging job creation.  It is vital that employers are aware of the PRSI savings they can make by taking on eligible employees.  As the summer arrives, we are all hopeful a significant number of jobs will be created in the tourism industry.  It is very much to be welcomed that the PRSI exemptions will be extended to those on the JobBridge scheme.  Many of them are coming to the end of their placements, and employers will be in a position to employ them and avail of the savings in PRSI.</P>
        <P>It is also to be welcomed that a significant reform of the industrial relations machinery of the State is taking place, which will be of benefit to employers and employees.  It is fantastic to see that the backlog for rights commissioner hearings has been eliminated.  The waiting period in 2010 was 142 days.  Significant progress is being made by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  He has a good story to tell, and we need to assist him and to have further debates and discussions here on how to create employment opportunities for our people.</P>

	<P>Litter bins, bottle banks and recycling centres &mdash; we all have them, we all advocated them and we all requested them in our own counties.  Travelling from the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s county recently, I went through a couple of counties that I will not name, and saw bottle banks that were in an absolutely disgraceful condition &mdash; full and unemptied for I do not know how long, with household refuse dumped beside them.  I saw this in several counties, including my own.  I read recently in the newspapers that one of the Dublin councils has withdrawn between 200 and 300 litter bins from streets and estates because of abuse of these bins, such as people dumping household refuse beside them &mdash; people who were obviously not paying the refuse charges.  It is a question of personal responsibility.  I have never used a litter bin because I take my litter home with me.  If an emphasis was put on the need for every Irish man, woman and young kid to bring his or her litter home, we would not need half the litter bins we have, and we would not have to empty them, replace them and maintain them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Could we have a debate with the Minister concerned about this issue?  It is very important.  There are major savings to be made, to say nothing of the impression we want to give to our many visitors, who see household refuse dumped everywhere in the country.</P>

	<P>If we have to wait until after the referendum, when he is brought out of the closet again, I have no difficulty with that.  It is important that he attend the House to discuss the effect of the closure of Garda stations throughout the country on policing, particularly in rural areas.</P>
        <P>On Monday, the Minister signed off on the sale of the former Army barracks in Longford for &euro;450,000.  I ask him to come to the House to discuss the philosophy of robbing Peter to pay Paul that seems to exist within the Department of Defence.  The barracks were sold to Longford County Council for &euro;450,000.  This is taking &euro;450,000 from the county council at a time when the roads in that county and other developments are badly in need of funding.  At the same time, he is going around trying to get State agencies to buy the other barracks he closed earlier in the year.  I call on him to stop trying to find a buyer within the State sector for D&uacute;n U&iacute; Neill Barracks in Cavan, and to reopen the barracks in light of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments in this Chamber to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly last week, in which he stated that dissident paramilitaries posed a real threat not only to the North of Ireland but to this State.  I ask that the Minister &mdash; and the Taoiseach, when he comes to the House &mdash; clarify exactly what they meant by saying that, while at the same time standing over the closure of D&uacute;n U&iacute; Neill Barracks in Cavan.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many parts to it, though.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>They are all linked.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The personal insolvency Bill was mentioned by our leader, Senator O&rsquo;Brien, who spoke about the delays in publishing the Bill and bringing it before the Oireachtas.  There are about 90,000 people in mortgage arrears, as we know, and the banks are putting excruciating pressure on some of those people.  They are calling them at all hours, and they are not adhering to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The Government needs to stop dilly-dallying with this Bill.  A Cabinet sub-committee was established &mdash; the Taoiseach referred to it in the D&aacute;il yesterday &mdash; but it seems to be dilly-dallying with this urgently needed legislation.  I propose to the Deputy Leader that the House sit through the month of August if needs be to debate the Bill.  Every day the Bill is delayed the 90,000 people to whom we referred and their families face the prospect of telephone calls from banks on mortgage arrears.  Some houses are being taken over by the banks, some of which are rented to the individuals living therein.  This is happening at the same time that the Government is, apparently, delaying the legislation.</P>
        <P>I agree totally with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien that we need a debate on this issue today to clear the way for our discussion of the legislation and play our part in informing its drafting.  I am not even sure it is being drafted because it appears from what the Taoiseach said yesterday that the Cabinet sub-committee has not even finalised its recommendations.  This morning a Minister stated the legislation would be published shortly.  There are, therefore, conflicting reports on it.  We have not seen any action and have heard empty promises.  It is time the Government lived up to its pre-election promises in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on what Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and others in the House have said, I want to refer to mortgage arrears.  In three weeks it will be almost one year since we introduced the Family Home Bill in the House.  A number of other Bills were introduced in the D&aacute;il specifically to provide solutions to the mortgage arrears problem.  The Governor of the Central Bank and countless other credible authorities have highlighted the urgent need to tackle this crisis, yet we encounter delay after delay.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, a good operator in the past in this House and elsewhere, had egg on his face when in the House for the most recent debate.  He was effectively apologising for the inaction.  This morning we heard on the national airwaves the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, wondering whether mortgage debt would even be included in the personal insolvency Bill.  The delays, far from being constitutional and in the interests of those suffering throughout the country, seem to be in the interests of the banks and none other.  I support the view that we need urgent action in this regard and would like to see the issue addressed.</P>
        <P>On a separate but related issue in the context of the economy, I join Senator Diarmuid Wilson in asking where the joined-up thinking is in Departments.  The Senator has made the important point that the barracks in Longford are being sold by the Government and bought by a local authority.  In Sligo, my area, the local authority which is some &euro;70 million in debt is buying for almost &euro;500,000 the recently closed Teagasc offices.  We are robbing Peter to pay Paul from individual entities under the authority of the State.  The local authority which is in debt is spending &euro;500,000 of the people&rsquo;s money to buy an office, the need for which is questionable in this day and age when resources are so scarce.  There is an urgent need to deal with the general management of the Government finances when we see these transactions taking place.  There is no issue more urgent than this and I can speak on behalf of both sides of the House.  For some three years we have brought forward legislative proposals.  If the Government&rsquo;s personal insolvency Bill is not ready, it should embrace the real solutions brought forward, either through the Family Home Bill introduced in this House or the Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill introduced in the other House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Deputy Leader responds, I ask the Cathaoirleach for his guidance on a point of order.  Is it appropriate for a Member of the House to defy the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s authority and refuse to withdraw a remark?  I have withdrawn remarks, even when I considered they were appropriate.  There has been a disgraceful abuse of the privilege of this House in smearing a Minister.  I saw the programme in question and noted that the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, had actually taken on the smear when it was made outside the House without the right of privilege.  The journalist bottled it; more power to the Minister.  I ask my friend and colleague, Senator Terry Leyden, to withdraw the remark.  It is a disgrace and brings politics into disrepute.</P>

	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien asked me to ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to come to the House to debate the issue of mortgage arrears.  The Leader is consulting the Minister on framing a full and comprehensive debate in the House on the economy which would cover the issue of mortgage arrears.  This would be welcomed by us all.  As soon as the date is arranged, the House will be informed.  The House is not sitting next week to facilitate our canvassing in the referendum, as the Senator knows.</P>

	<P>Senator Ivana Bacik to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The second issue Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien raised was the pyrite report.  The position remains the same, as I advised the Senator last week.  The expert review group is continuing its work.  The Minister is expecting its report by the end of this month or in early June.  A debate with him on the issue will certainly be requested.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, will be in the House on 6 and 7 June to deal with the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Will we have the report before then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I am told it will be available by the end of the month or in early June.  I certainly hope it will be available in the first week of June.  We will have the Minister in the House to discuss the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in any case on 6 and 7 June.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator also mentioned the sale of State assets.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will be in the House this evening during Private Members&rsquo; business.  We can certainly seek a further debate with him on that issue, although it is relevant to the Private Members&rsquo; motion tonight, as the Senator knows.</P>
        <P>The Senator raised the case of Mr. John Gallagher.  As the Senator may know, it will be dealt with under the reformed law on criminal insanity introduced in 2006 through the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act, under which a board considers the issue of release.</P>
        <P>The Senator sought an amendment to the Order of Business to discuss the issue of policing.  I have already sought a debate on the issue, as the Senator raised it last week.  It is one of the debates I have asked the Leader to facilitate, but I cannot facilitate it today.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, will be in the House to deal with two other issues today, but we will not have time for a debate on policing also.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Coghlan welcomed the &euro;2 billion investment by NAMA, as announced today.  We all very much welcome it, particularly the fact that NAMA anticipates the investment will lead to the creation of 25,000 direct jobs and 10,000 additional jobs.  The investment is in addition to the investment of &euro;17 billion announced for the Government&rsquo;s capital programme.  The announcement by NAMA marks a movement towards a different phase of its operations.  Having completed the acquisition of property-based loans worth &euro;74 billion, NAMA is moving towards managing its portfolio actively and maximising job creation and the return to the taxpayer.  We very much welcome the announcement.  NAMA will work on a number of areas, including the construction sector.</P>
        <P>Senator David Norris asked for a debate on the media.  I have already asked the Leader whether we can facilitate such a debate.  The Senator also asked about Seanad procedure and whether the Leader or Deputy Leader would respond to the remarks of colleagues not present in the House.  This has nothing to do with the Government; I am simply following a practice Senator Maurice Cummins adopted in the House some time ago.  As a courtesy to those Members who remain in the House for the duration of the Order of Business, he responds only to them and those from whom he has received apologies because they must be elsewhere.  That is a very fair procedure and I will have no difficulty in changing it if Senator Maurice Cummins wishes to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is applied very capriciously whenever it suits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fair procedure.  It is a relatively minor obligation on us, as Senators, to be present in the House for the Order of Business.  I have looked around the Chamber and have seen no more than ten to 15 Senators present at any one time.  For a Seanad that will be subject to public scrutiny in the coming months, particularly in the approach to the referendum&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik to continue, without interruption.</P>

	<P>We need to consider our practice, particularly on the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator David Norris asked about the motion on the exchange of data on passenger names.  As justice spokesperson for the Labour Party, I will certainly be present to speak to the motion and raise with the Minister some of the issues I raised previously at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.</P>
        <P>Senator C&aacute;it Keane, whom I know has to be elsewhere, referred to Mr. John Gallagher and asked for the Minister for Justice and Equality to make a statement on the issue.  It would be appropriate for the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to ask the Minister to make a statement on the new procedures under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 that will govern the position of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity.   As the Senator said, the law has changed since the Gallagher case.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised the issue of the Smithwick tribunal.  Of course, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, will be in the House today and Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and myself will be here to address those issues with him.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan also stated he would be seeking an amendment to the Order of Business in order that we would sit for a full-day debate on Tuesday next on the referendum.  We had a debate on Thursday last on the referendum.  In total, 12 Senators spoke on the referendum which demonstrated the level of interest in a debate.  I, for one, would much prefer to be out canvassing next week for the referendum and that is why we will not be sitting next week.  That would be a better use of our time.</P>
        <P>Senator Whelan raised the issue of the insolvency Bill.  That issue was raised by a number of Senators.  To clarify, the heads of the insolvency Bill were published some time ago.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, as Senator Conway stated, conducted a series of oral hearings with interest groups and those working on the front line with those in mortgage arrears and, indeed, with banks, etc.  We had a series of hearings and on foot of those hearings, we published a report which has made various recommendations for change to the heads of the Bill.  Among the recommendations we made was, specifically, that mortgage debt would be included in the Bill.  We also made a recommendation that specific consideration would be given to protection of the family home in contrast with other forms of mortgage debt.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, under whose remit this comes, has committed to publishing the Bill by the end of June.  Work is going into this Bill now across the Departments of Justice and Equality and Finance and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  It is a priority for the Government, as the Taoiseach made clear yesterday, but they want to be careful to get it right.  It is a complex issue but no doubt it is very important.  The Minister has also stated that he intends to introduce the Bill, and I hope very much in the Seanad rather than in the D&aacute;il, by the end of the summer session.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Whelan&rsquo;s point about the credit union movement.  It is something we need to look at in the debate, both in this House and in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of Africa Day or, as it has become, Africa week.  I would share the welcome for that.  He sought a debate on immigration and asylum seekers.  We recently had a debate on this in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Minister for Justice and Equality explained to the committee &mdash; it was reported quite widely &mdash; that he would re-introduce the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 given the large array of amendments, particularly Government amendments, that had been put forward to the last version of it.  As the Senator will be aware, it has gone through a number of different permutations.  We want to ensure it is a strong, watertight and comprehensive Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I would agree.  I would very much hope that it will be initiated in this House.</P>
        <P>I would agree with the Senator about the delay in processing applications.  It is something that we need to see changed.  However, since the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has taken office, it has been well publicised that he has speeded up substantively the dreadful delays in the processing of citizenship applications, which are more straightforward than asylum procedures but in which there were long delays.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P>Senator Gilroy called for a debate on NAMA and welcomed the &euro;2 billion investment that NAMA has announced.  It would be useful to have a debate on NAMA and review it, particularly as it moves into this new phase of operation, the work it is doing, and to review the legislation that established NAMA which was introduced by the previous Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly raised the issue of the NAMA transparency Bill.  We cannot take that Bill today but I would suggest that Senator Daly use his party&rsquo;s next Private Members&rsquo; time for that.  I will look for a debate on NAMA generally in the near future.</P>
        <P>Senator Conway sought a debate on banking in advance, perhaps, of the introduction of the personal insolvency Bill, which I think is a good idea.  He also noted the invitation to Aung San Suu Kyi to come to Dublin, which we all very much welcome.  I think the invitation was issued by Amnesty and other NGOs.  I will certainly ask the Leader.  We might invite her in to address the Seanad while she is here.  That would be an excellent idea.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Mullins raised the issue of the JobBridge scheme and employment opportunities.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will be in this House to discuss four pieces of legislation before the end of the session and there will be ample time to raise these issues and others with him.  He is in the House this morning on the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2012.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden raised the issue of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.  I do not think he asked a question of me.  I would note, as Senator Norris pointed out, that the Cathaoirleach asked Senator Leyden to withdraw certain remarks he made and I certainly did not note that Senator Leyden withdrew them.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>To which remark is Senator Bacik referring?</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Would Senator Bacik clarify to what remark she refers?  She just cannot make a generalisation like that.</P>

	<P>As I stated, it is a matter for the Cathaoirleach.</P>
        <P>Senator Brennan raised the issue of the state of dustbins and waste collection generally.  He made a good point, which we might address with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government or which could be addressed directly with local authorities.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson called for a debate on policing and for the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to come to the House.  As I stated, that is a debate I have sought already.  We hope to have the Minister in on that.  He will be here on other matters today.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of the personal insolvency Bill and I think I have addressed that.  I would take issue with his use of the phrase &ldquo;dilly-dallying&rdquo;.  There is a clear process being gone through.  I found the hearings of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality extremely helpful.  Some of the recommendations in the joint committee&rsquo;s report will require some time for consideration and I very much hope that we will see them incorporated into the text of the Bill when it is published, but there is a process ongoing.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s other point, the insolvency Bill is a separate process.  The drafting of the insolvency Bill is well under way.  The heads have been published and I have already explained the process.  However, there is a separate process with a Cabinet sub-committee on mortgage arrears that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have established because they themselves were frustrated at the lack of progress in dealing with mortgage arrears, and they have said this on a number of occasions.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cabinet sub-committee is dealing with a number of other proposals, including proposals around split mortgages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Other recommendations will be forthcoming.  The personal insolvency Bill is an important part of the issue of resolving the serious, difficult problems with mortgage arrears.</P>
        <P>Finally, in response to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, we can talk with the group leaders about sitting through August.  If necessary, we have no difficulty about that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>

	<P>We would be more than happy to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Finally, Senator MacSharry dealt with the issue of mortgage arrears which I have already dealt with and the issue of barracks closure and policing on which I have sought a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I never mentioned the name of the individual who presented himself to the Central Mental Hospital.  In her response, the Deputy Leader and others did but I did not put his name on the record of the House.  I just want that clarified.</P>

        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to accept the following proposed measure:</P>
        <P LI="2">the Council Decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of Passenger Name Records to the United States Department of Homeland Security,</P>
        <P FLI="0">a copy of which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 6th December, 2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion will enable Ireland to participate in the agreement between the European Union and the United States on the use and transfer of passenger name records, PNR, to the United States Department of Homeland Security which has recently been adopted by the Council of Ministers.  I propose that Ireland exercise the option provided by Article 4 of Protocol No. 21 to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to accept a measure after it has been adopted by the Council.  The prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required to enable Ireland to exercise this option.</P>
        <P>The agreement to which the motion refers replaces the current EU-US PNR agreement which has been in operation since 2007.  That agreement has been renegotiated in order to address concerns raised about proportionality, data protection and data security aspects.  A new agreement was signed in December 2011 to cover the ongoing use and transfer of PNR data to the US authorities.  The European Parliament considered the agreement in detail and approved its terms on 19 April.  The agreement was then concluded by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at its meeting on 26 April.</P>
        <P>PNR data amount to information on passengers&rsquo; travel plans collected and held by air carriers as part of their reservation systems.  The agreement will require airlines to provide a portion of the information they already collect for the US authorities for the purposes of combating terrorism and serious transnational crime.  PNR data are a tool of proven value to law enforcement services in counter-terrorism and serious crime investigations, particularly in cases of trafficking of drugs and persons.  A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, Spain, the United States and Australia, have been using PNR data for these purposes for some years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">PNR data have been of benefit in investigations in a number of significant transnational, organised crime cases involving drug smuggling or the trafficking of human beings.  They can be an essential support in investigating and prosecuting those who would prey on and profit from the misery of others.  Such data were instrumental in the prosecution and conviction of David Headley in respect of his involvement in facilitating the atrocious terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, in November 2008, in which 164 innocent people lost their lives.  By entering details of his first name, a partial travel itinerary and a possible travel window in the PNR database, David Headley&rsquo;s full name, address and passport number were obtained.  He was subsequently arrested and pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges.</P>
        <P>While this measure is an important support in the fight against terrorism and serious crime, I am very conscious of the need to ensure the rights of citizens are not subject to unnecessary or disproportionate intrusion.  It is important to strike an appropriate balance, especially in the protection of personal data, and the agreement does just that.  Although the time constraints dictate that I cannot provide a full description of all of the provisions contained in the agreement, I inform the House that a very full and detailed debate on this proposal took place at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality last week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agreement contains a number of specific safeguards in respect of the use of PNR data.  In particular, the processing of this data is strictly limited to the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorism offences and serious transnational crimes.  The passenger name record, PNR, data will be retained by the US authorities for up to five years in an active database with restrictions on access.  After the first six months the PNR data will be depersonalised, that is to say, fields that could identify an individual will be masked out.  After the initial five-year period, the depersonalised data are transferred to an inactive database with additional access restrictions.  In the case of terrorist offences and related crimes the data may then be retained for up to a further ten years, that is to say, for a total of 15 years overall.  In the case of serious, transnational crimes the data can then be retained for up to a further five years, that is to say, for a total of ten years overall.</P>
        <P>The agreement contains specific, tailored safeguards in respect of privacy, data protection, data security, oversight, accountability, transparency, rights of access to information, the correction of errors and redress.  Senators should note that under the terms of the agreement an individual will have the right to access his or her own data, to have incorrect data corrected and the right to redress for a violation of his or her rights under the agreement.  The agreement provides that the administrative and legal safeguards which are in place in the US for privacy and data protection are available to all individuals, regardless of nationality, country of origin or place of residence.  The agreement also provides for regular, joint review of its operation by the European Union and US authorities and for a joint evaluation of the agreement four years after its entry into force.  The agreement will remain in force for seven years.</P>
        <P>The proposal is one of several measures being taken at EU level in the justice and home affairs field which arise from commitments set out in the 2009 Stockholm programme.  The Government is determined that Ireland will have a full, active and constructive engagement in bringing forward the European justice agenda.  Given the potential value of PNR data in investigations into drug smuggling, human trafficking or international terrorism and the importance of giving a clear demonstration of our continued support and solidarity with the international community in the fight against these activities, I recommend Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this measure.  I hope I will have the Seanad&rsquo;s support in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The party to which I am affiliated supports this particular measure, by and large.  I have only two questions for the Minister.  How does this conform or conflict with our data protection legislation?  I realise we are providing this facility to the United States.  I would appreciate if the Minister could respond to the query, if necessary later, if he has the time.</P>
        <P>I refer to a not totally unrelated matter.  What is the position with regard to Asian travellers coming to Ireland and the Schengen Agreement?  Why are we not affiliated so that people coming from China, India and others countries can come directly?  I understand most European countries are affiliated to the Schengen Agreement but we are not.  Perhaps it is about time we examined the matter.  It may not be the appropriate time today but it is related to travel matters and is a matter of interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the introduction of this necessary legislation.  If we lived in a perfect world, the Minister would not be here to make the announcement he has just made.  If we lived in a perfect world, international disputes would be resolved by ballot rather than bullet.  Democracy rather than dictatorship would reign throughout the world and we would not have the international worldwide terrorism problem that has plagued us for generations.  That is the backdrop.  Unfortunately, due to the conditions throughout the globe in respect of international terrorism, drug trafficking and the trafficking of human persons, this type of order is necessary.  The Minister has given the appropriate assurances which indicate clearly that people who are not out to do harm should have no difficulty with this order and have nothing to fear from it.  I am satisfied with the Minister&rsquo;s assurance in respect of the possibility of checking individual records and correcting them where mistakes have been made.  That is an important safeguard.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, we have no option but to agree with the Minister in respect of the necessity for this measure to be introduced.  We have heard of near misses in respect of airline attacks in recent weeks and we know only too well what has occurred during the past decade or so.  We must continue the international fight against terrorism.  A broad range of measures are necessary, including political as well as security measures.  We must put the human rights aspect at the core.  Tragically, as we speak, throughout the globe people are plotting to kill, maim, bomb, blow up airlines and kill citizens.  We must continue to try to apprehend these people by every possible measure.  This is a small step in that direction.  It is modest but necessary and I fully support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe this would have arisen only I spotted it going through.  There are too many of these instruments going through without debate and I am pleased I forced a debate on it although it is only a small one.  The Minister&rsquo;s speech is a recital of what he has said previously.  He stated the data would be depersonalised and fields that could identify an individual would be masked and so on.  I imagine the Minister has heard of Quantico.  These data can be recovered and what the Minister has stated in this regard is rubbish.  Let us be open and honest for a change about the kind of information being exchanged with the Department of Homeland Security.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note the technique of the Government side is exactly the same as for the fiscal treaty, that is to say, to frighten people.  First, it involves telling them that it is the same, that nothing has changed and that it is only incarnating what has been in place already, while second, it involves terrifying them.  These data will be given about everyone.  They include passenger names, addresses, credit card details, seat numbers and, in exceptional circumstances, sensitive data such as a passenger&rsquo;s ethnic origin, religious beliefs, physical or mental health or sexual orientation.  What justification is there for that?</P>
        <P>I note my good friend Senator Bradford mentioned the war on terror.  That was one of Mr. Bush&rsquo;s phrases.  We are giving all of this back to one of Mr. Bush&rsquo;s organs which is certainly implicated in torture.  I am referring to the Department of Homeland Security as well as the CIA.  I note one phrase used was &ldquo;alleged torture&rdquo;.  There was nothing alleged about it.  If anyone in the House, including the Minister, believes being half-drowned by waterboarding is not torture then they should consult the international authorities on the subject.</P>
        <P>A university study has been published of this new version of the protocol and attacks it for excessively long retention periods, a lack of protections and few improvements over earlier agreements.  The European Commission&rsquo;s lawyers warned against it.  The terms of the agreement are controversial and have been since the beginning.  They have been the subject of adverse opinion issued by the European Data Protection Supervisor.  Not only that, the Dutch MEP, Sophie in&rsquo;t Veld, the chair of the relevant committee, and her committee have opposed it.  One reason was proportionality.  No one wants to see innocent passengers blown up.  I do not believe the other side of the House or the Minister would suggest that people such as I, who have human rights reservations, would want them blown up.</P>
        <P>I call for an explanation of why people&rsquo;s religious beliefs or sexual orientation should be exchanged.  When the lawyers asked about this and were given a response by the European Parliament, they were against it.  Why?  The relevant committee was against it and the European Data Protection Supervisor was against it.  The agreement will result in the transfer of this information to a deeply suspect body.  How would the people in the Visitors Gallery feel if details of their religious persuasions or beliefs, their credit card balances, their bank balances or information on their sexual orientation and other private information was transferred to one of Mr. Bush&rsquo;s organisations?  No, thank you.  I will be calling a vote and I am glad I spotted it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome the opportunity to debate the motion which was not going to be forced through.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was going through without debate until I raised the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It had been referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which is the normal procedure.  We had a full debate at the committee, in which I participated, and I am delighted that we are having a further debate in the House.  The committee scrutinised the motion closely and, as the Minister will recall, I raised two issues with him.  This is about ensuring a balance is struck between the right of citizens to travel freely without fear of harm or terrorist attack and their right not to experience undue interference with their privacy while travelling.  The disclosure and exchange of information by airlines are the key issues.  I raised two issues to ensure the appropriate balance was struck.  I asked the Minister whether he was satisfied there would be sufficient oversight and a review of the exchange of data to ensure the balance was maintained.  I received a good and fair response on the regular review provided for in the framework decision by the EU and US authorities, which was reassuring.</P>
        <P>My second question related to a query raised by Senator David Norris.  It would be relatively rare in the exchange of passenger name records to disclose sensitive data.  The Senator referred to the exchange of these data and disclosing somebody&rsquo;s religious beliefs or ethnic origin or sexual orientation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>How is that a threat to the United States?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to see how this detail would be routinely disclosed during an exchange of passenger name records.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Or ever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Council decision contains specific additional safeguards for the exchange of such data.   Will the Minister set them out?  The issue of concern is that personal sensitive information, rather than just one&rsquo;s name and address, could be disclosed.</P>
        <P>A useful briefing document was made available before the justice committee met.  It would probably be useful if it was made available to Members.  It set out clearly the history of the negotiations on the agreement between the European Union and the United States and addressed the concerns raised in the European Parliament, to which Senator David Norris referred.  This decision will need to be kept under careful review to ensure there are no undue intrusions into people&rsquo;s privacy and a balance is struck between the need for security, on the one hand, and the right to privacy, on the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and support the motion.  While it is welcome that Senator David Norris sought a debate on it and it is a good idea to debate such motions in the House, as Senator Ivana Bacik said, the motion was referred to the justice committee.  I was present when the Minister arrived, although I was unable to participate in the debate.  </P>
        <P>It is strange that people like to invoke what happened during the Bush era as a stick with which to beat the agreement.  If President Bush was still in power, we would be told this was all about a government trying to spread fear in the world.  However, we are in the Obama era&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He has ordered ten times the number of drones President Bush did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and he sees fit to continue the agreement.  That says something about the rhetoric sometimes employed in these debates.</P>
        <P>The bottom line is that we live in a dangerous world and a test of reasonableness, a key principle, must apply.  There are issues surrounding the collection and retention of data about people, but I am comforted by the detail of the agreement.  First, people will have the right to access their data and have incorrect data corrected.  They will also have a right to redress for a violation of their rights under the agreement.  This right does not only apply to individuals in the United States but to all individuals, regardless of nationality or country of origin.</P>
        <P>The second key issue is the possibility of regular joint reviews.  That is how one deals with difficult scenarios when there is an incursion into people&rsquo;s rights.  However, for the sake of the greater good, one must try to ensure injustices are prevented as far as possible, rectified as soon as possible and that the entire system is reviewed to ensure it is working well and not being misused.  We are aware of how people who wish to behave in an evil way, whether they are terrorists or other criminals, are always acquiring new knowledge, strategies, skills and technologies; as such, it would be folly of governments, acting on an initial positive instinct to protect human rights which is essential, to tie their hands in an unreasonable and unnecessary way and, thereby, plunge people into unnecessary danger.  That is what the motion is about.  It is important that we are reasonable and proportionate and take the safeguards built in into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister.  I agree with Senator David Norris that it is appalling that we have only been given 20 minutes to discuss this important motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>That the motion was discussed by the justice committee does not matter.  Many motions are discussed by Oireachtas committees, but they are referred back to the House for proper debate and scrutiny.  This is the forum in which we should have such debates.  The PNR data proposal marks the commencement of a broader scheme of PNR data collection, retention and assessment for regulation at EU level.  It makes people subject to &ldquo;extensive tracking, tracing and screening&rdquo;.  The previous speaker mentioned a test of reasonableness.  For this process to have credibility, the Minister and those who support the agreement must show it is proportionate and necessary.  I do not believe it is.  It is intrusive, particularly in the manner described by Senator David Norris.  The war on terror has again been used as a reason to introduce these rules.  &ldquo;The war on terror&rdquo; is a broad, sweeping expression.  It resulted in a number of illegal wars perpetrated by the very people who are seeking this information.  They were responsible for a number of illegal wars, rendition flights and torture.  This proposal is not necessary or appropriate.  We should safeguard people&rsquo;s rights and entitlements.  The proposal contravenes the Constitution, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as Articles 7 and 52 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.  It flies in the face of many rights established at European level and domestically.  I am not convinced by the reasoning given by the Minister that this is necessary.  I agree with Senator David Norris that the type of information being passed on has no bearing whatsoever on what Senator Paul Bradford said the information would be used for.  I fail to understand why such information would have a bearing on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate, particularly those who support the agreement.  This is a simple arrangement to ensure full co-operation between the European Union and the United States in tackling international crime and terrorism.  A basic human right of every individual is to be able to fly on an aeroplane that has not been turned into a flying bomb pointed at a location in the United States, resulting in the deaths of hundreds or thousands of people.  It is a basic human right to be able to walk down the street where one lives and not to be shot at or blown up by terrorists.  It is also a basic human right to be able to travel safely and not to become a victim of human trafficking.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe I was being hysterical.  I think the Minister should withdraw that remark.  It is the usual slur that people like him use against&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator David Norris is unnecessarily excitable today.  Perhaps he might contain himself.  If he had a major interest in this matter, he was free, like every Member of the House, to attend the meeting of the joint committee at which we teased out the agreement in great detail.  Every question that could have been asked was asked and every response given.</P>
        <P>I can only conclude from the Senator&rsquo;s contribution that he has not read the agreement in full.  His imagination seems to have run riot as to its implications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister specialises in slurs.  He made the same accusations at the committee meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris clearly does not understand the history of the agreement, which was given substantial examination by European justice ministers and within the European Parliament.  The form of the agreement that is before the House is the text as agreed by the Parliament and by the European Council in its justice configuration.  The report to which the Senator referred was rejected by the European Parliament&rsquo;s Libor ROUCEK group.  In fact, he is relying on a report which the majority of Members of the European Parliament did not accept.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The agreement includes a substantial range of provisions necessary to protect the rights of those who travel.  It puts in place an important co-operative architecture between the European Union and the United States which will be to the benefit of tens of millions of people in both jurisdictions.  The Senator seems to consider it an esoteric or theoretical provision.  I have already mentioned the example of its use in the case of David Headley.  Another instance of the use of passenger name records is the case of FaisalShahzad, who attempted a car bombing in Times Square in New York in May 2010.  The FBI, in co-ordination with the Department of Homeland Security, learned of his identity from a mobile telephone number recorded in his PNR data.  Based on the PNR match, the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s travel lookouts alerted law enforcement to his attempted outbound flight.  He confessed and was sentenced to life imprisonment on 21 June 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that happened before this agreement was devised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>PNR data was also used to good effect in apprehending Najibullah Zazi, an al-Qaeda operative who planned to detonate improvised explosive devices on New York city&rsquo;s subway system.  The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI used PNR data to cross-reference the names of Zazi&rsquo;s co-travellers against open counter-terrorism cases inside the United States, resulting in the discovery that the co-travellers were travelling to Pakistani terrorist training camps.  Zazi was arrested in September 2009 and the information from his PNR records was used in his questioning and indictment.  He pleaded guilty in February 2010.</P>
        <P>The unfortunate reality is that we live in a world where the threat of terrorism based on the activities of Islamic fundamentalists is substantial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As is the threat from states.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator wishes to be blind to that reality, it is his choice.  As a member of this Government, however, I cannot be blind to it.  It is in the interests of Europe and the United States that this agreement is implemented and in the interests of this State that we be party to it.  I apologise to Members to whom I have not had time to respond.  I will be happy to accommodate any Senator who would like a copy of the more detailed material on this matter, which documentation, incidentally, was available to every Member who attended the meeting of the joint committee.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the Resolution passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 23 March 2005 and by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 24 March 2005, as amended by the Resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 1 June 2011 and the Resolution passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 16 November 2011 and by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 17 November 2011, pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2004, be further amended in paragraph (IV) by substituting &ldquo;31 October, 2012&rdquo; for &ldquo;31 May, 2012&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion proposes to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into suggestions of collusion by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other employees of the State in the murder by the Provisional IRA of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan in March 1989.  This tribunal was established in 2005 and is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick, former President of the District Court.  The Oireachtas established the Smithwick tribunal arising from the Weston Park talks in 2001 and in light of Judge Peter Cory&rsquo;s subsequent report in a desire to get at the truth of these suggestions of collusion, both in the interest of the families who were bereaved by this dreadful atrocity and in the public interest.  This motion will provide for an extension of the date established for the conclusion of the tribunal&rsquo;s inquiries and the submission of its final report by five months to 31 October 2012.</P>
        <P>On 17 November 2011, Seanad &Eacute;ireann amended the tribunal&rsquo;s terms of reference and established 31 May 2012 as the date by which the tribunal should complete its inquiries and submit its final report to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  On that occasion in November last, I made it clear, as I had done previously, that if for any reason it did not prove possible for the tribunal to meet the timeframe set out, the chairman could report to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il that circumstances had arisen which required the timeframe to be extended in order that the House could consider the matter.  I also assured the House that the Government&rsquo;s response to such an approach from the chairman would be fully cognisant of and consistent with the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.  In November last, the chairman was firmly convinced the tribunal would complete its work and be in a position to publish its report by 31 May 2012, but that has not proved possible.</P>
        <P>On 17 May 2012 the tribunal chairman wrote to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to provide an update on the tribunal&rsquo;s progress and to seek an extension of the deadline for the conclusion of its work.  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il laid the letter before both Houses.  In his letter, the tribunal chairman stated that since his second interim report was provided to the Oireachtas on 8 March 2012, the tribunal had heard evidence from a further 18 witnesses, some of whom had not been foreseen or scheduled at that time.  He indicated that the tribunal had heard evidence from 190 witnesses in total and that he anticipated concluding the public hearings very shortly.  The chairman also referred to the current indisposition through illness of one witness whom he considers to be the tribunal&rsquo;s final substantive witness.  In the circumstances, the taking of evidence from that witness has had to be deferred for the time being.  He also noted that he anticipates taking evidence from a small number of further witnesses who have yet to be scheduled.</P>
        <P>The Government has considered the tribunal chairman&rsquo;s request and proposes that the Seanad resolve to extend to 31 October 2012 the timeframe for the tribunal to conclude its work and present its final report.  This is fully in line with the chairman&rsquo;s request.  The Government hopes the tribunal can fulfil its mandate within the revised timeframe, which is set out in this motion.</P>
        <P>The Government respects fully the independence of the tribunal chairman to carry out his inquiries without fear or favour and is anxious to support the tribunal in doing that.  I am confident the tribunal will fully discharge its responsibilities and this motion will assist in that endeavour.   I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>On principle, this side of the House will support the motion.  It was initiated by the chairman of the tribunal, Judge Smithwick, who wrote formally to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il seeking an extension for the tribunal because of certain outstanding issues.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister tell me, if not today on another date, the cost of the tribunal to date given that it was originally set up in 2005?  I have hang-ups about tribunals which I have recorded in this House and the other House.  Some seem to have outlived their purpose and cost much more than was ever envisaged.  This is a broader issue than the concept of the motion.  As I stated, I am supporting the motion on principle.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that, approximately 12 months ago, the Minister fired a shot across the bow expressing his concern, recorded publicly but perhaps taken out of context, over the delay in the completion of the work of the Smithwick tribunal.  He may have had very good reason for having said so, and I do not deny it.  The matter was raised in the House last November, at which time we agreed unanimously the tribunal would be given an extension of six months.  This extension seems to have been insufficient.  If we agree to a further extension, what will be the timeframe?  Will it be open-ended?  Is a specific date set?  Will this be the final ultimatum to the tribunal and the chairman, based on the view the work must be concluded in the time allocated?  The work of the tribunal is obviously very sensitive and important and I am not in any way denigrating it.  It is most necessary.  I hope some answers required by the public will be in the tribunal&rsquo;s findings when they are eventually published.</P>
        <P>I have a number of queries which I have put to the Minister.  My concerns were expressed on this side of the House far more vehemently by my colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne, who is not present today.  The Minister will be aware of his having done so.  While I have queries and concerns, I believe the request by the chairman of the tribunal to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il cannot be ignored.  It is reasonable.  One of the key witnesses is currently ill and recovery may take some time.  I have no problem granting a short extension to the life of the tribunal provided it will not be open-ended or drag beyond the end of this year.  If it does so, it will be entering its eighth year, which is far too long for any tribunal.</P>
        <P>Too many tribunals lasted far too long and cost the taxpayer huge sums of money.  I have often stated on the record of this House that two tribunals during my lifetime were merited, one of which was the Stardust tribunal, which inquired into considerable loss of life, and the other of which was the Whiddy Island disaster tribunal.  As a young apprentice, I worked for the latter.  The two tribunals were effective and did their work in a short period.  The catalyst for their formation was an immense loss of life.  They did not last five, six or seven years and they did not cost even a fraction of what the most recent tribunals, such as the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals, have cost the State.  The cost of the beef tribunal far outweighed the benefits.  In future, we should be mindful about setting up tribunals and set them up only in extreme circumstances.  A better means of investigation must be found to deal with these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  I do not wish to engage in a lengthy debate about the tribunals but it is fair to concede that many people, both in the House and outside, have expressed concerns about the duration and cost of some of them over the past decade.  The Smithwick tribunal, dealing as it does with the peace process and North-South and east-west relations, must be considered differently.  It stems from the Weston Park accord, which dates from the Good Friday Agreement and, in a sense, the peace process itself.  We are dealing with a tribunal that is also part of the broader process of truth and reconciliation, which is necessary on this island.  We have highlighted on many occasions the necessity of a broad-spectrum debate on truth and reconciliation.  We have not yet reached that phase.  However, in one small way the tribunal is part of that process.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the work of the tribunal has been lengthy.  I presume the tribunal, as with all others, has been expensive, but I believe the allegation it is investigating is serious and worthy of investigation.  Politically on this island, we must be mature enough to accept whatever results stem from the tribunal and to give whatever assistance is required to allow it to conclude its work.  Judge Smithwick is of the opinion that extra time is required, we must respect his wishes in that regard.</P>
        <P>As the Minister outlined, a presumably significant witness is currently unavailable.  I hope that witness will be available in the near future.  Apparently, some other witnesses may also be in a position to give evidence.</P>
        <P>The matter being investigated by the tribunal is obviously a source of ongoing public concern.  Our efforts to bring to a satisfactory conclusion the investigation into collusion on both sides of divide in the tragic Troubles in Northern Ireland, are worthy.  I support the motion and hope we are moving towards the end of the work of the tribunal.  The extra time required by Mr. Justice Smithwick must be granted.  I hope the tribunal&rsquo;s work will become part of the process of truth, reconciliation, understanding and acceptance that is still required as part of the peace process on this island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not so long ago we had a debate in the House on the Smithwick tribunal.  During the course of that debate, the Minister was adamant there needed to be a final report at the end of this month.  This motion seeks to extend the time limit, which is to be welcomed because a view was expressed by number of Senators that it would be wrong to rush the work of the tribunal and that it should be given sufficient time to reach its conclusions.  I welcome the extension of the time limits.  My party welcomed the establishment of the tribunal so there would be an inquiry into alleged collusion by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the killing of senior RUC officers.  My party is fully supportive of the relatives of those who lost their lives over the course of the conflict.  Many of these people still seek answers.</P>
        <P>My party has called for a proper truth and reconciliation process which would be helpful to all victims on all sides.  We have constantly made the point there must not be a hierarchy of victims.  There were people who suffered and died at the hands of republicans.  They, too, deserve answers, just like the family of Pat Finucane and the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We still await inquiries into these matters.  We know the Finucane family has worked very closely with the Taoiseach but it is still awaiting a proper inquiry into the murder of Pat.  There have been several cross-party motions passed in this House urging the British Government to do more in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  A broader truth and recovery process would be beneficial to the people of this State and this island, and I would support it.  My party is also supportive of this motion, which seeks to extend the time limit for this tribunal, which is looking into the killings of two RUC officers whose families also deserve truth and justice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome the opportunity to debate this, although, as others have indicated, there is clear support for this motion across the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to argue with the clear and cogent arguments put forward by the tribunal chair.  As the Minister stated, since his interim report on 8 March of this year, the tribunal has heard evidence from a further 18 witnesses and some reports in the newspapers suggest that they were unforeseen or unscheduled at that time.  The reports suggest that they were witnesses who had previously stated they would not come forward.  Clearly, that was not anticipated and it will require further time.</P>
        <P>The other cogent reason is the indisposition through illness of a substantive witness, somebody the tribunal chair considers to be the tribunal&rsquo;s final substantive witness.  It is unarguable that the tribunal should be given the extension of time sought.</P>
        <P>In listening to colleagues, I am struck by the phrase &ldquo;tribunal fatigue&rdquo;, which may be setting in given how many tribunals there have been and given the lengthy time which some of them have taken in coming to findings, and yet they have done great service as well in terms of the findings that have been made over the years in particular tribunals.</P>
        <P>The case for this was clearly set out in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  It was established in 2005, arising out of the Weston Park talks in 2001.  Clearly, there is great sensitivity attaching to the work the tribunal is doing and it is important that it is publicly facilitated in addressing the serious allegations of collusion that were made, and which gave rise to the tribunal.</P>
        <P>I am delighted there is cross-party support for this.  As Senator Cullinane stated, we all agreed previously it would be wrong to rush the work of the tribunal and we need to give it this extra time.  We look forward to the report on 31 October and to debating it in this House when we have read and digested the findings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House on this issue.  It is reasonable the request of the tribunal chairman and I fully endorse the Minister&rsquo;s confidence in this tribunal.</P>
        <P>The tribunal has made good headway, from what we have read and what has been reported.  As has been stated by Members, there are valid reasons as to why this is being sought.  Apparently, additional witnesses turned up.  It was useful to the work of the tribunal that some of these persons, who came from the North and who had previously refused to give evidence, came around and gave evidence.  I gather there are only a handful left, and one is a substantive witness who may have given evidence already.  It is important that he be heard.  If that person is ill, it is justifiable that this further short time be made available.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome it.  I welcome the fact that we are agreed.  I thought earlier we were not going to agree but I am delighted that the House is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members for their contributions and for supporting the motion that is before the House.</P>
        <P>I cannot help but comment on at least two of those who contributed who stated it would be wrong to rush the work of the tribunal.  It is important the tribunal completes its work, although rushing is a concept I cannot quite reconcile with a tribunal that has been sitting since 2005.  It is regrettable that this tribunal has sat for as long as has occurred.  It is not for me or any Minister in any shape or form to interfere with the work of the tribunal but it is unfortunate that it only commenced its oral hearings in approximately June of last year, having commenced its work in 2005.</P>
        <P>I have seen the same reports as Members of the House.  It is welcome that some witnesses who, apparently, had indicated to the tribunal they would not give evidence, have given evidence and have come forward.  Clearly, that has extended the time spent by the tribunal.</P>
        <P>When this matter came before the House in November last, it came on foot of a motion arising out of a letter from the chairman of the tribunal which indicated the work would be complete and the report available to both Houses by 31 May.  The motion was proposed in good faith in anticipation that that objective would be achieved.</P>
        <P>It is my hope that this tribunal will complete its work and report by 31 October next.  In fairness to the bereaved relations of the two RUC officers who so horribly lost their lives, it is important that some finality is brought to this matter and that whatever information is available is made available and whatever conclusions can be reached by the tribunal are reached.  I am conscious they say that a particular substantive witness is unwell.  We can only hope that that individual ultimately will be well enough to complete the evidence before the tribunal to allow the tribunal to complete its work and furnish its report.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan asked about the cost of the tribunal.  The estimated cost, as of now, as I am advised, is &euro;9.8 million.  It is a substantial and significant sum of money.  It would be my understanding there will be issues of costs relating to representation of individuals before the tribunal that may have to be addressed in the future.  This is a tribunal that is incurring substantial expense which the taxpayers must pick up.  As a tribunal whose work is important, as Senators have said, it is important that we get as close as is possible to the truth of what occurred and that the allegations that have been made that are the subject matter of the tribunal&rsquo;s consideration are fully and properly addressed.</P>
        <P>I thank the Members of the Seanad for their support for this motion.  It is my hope that on the next occasion matters relating to the Smithwick tribunal come before this House, it may be in the context of Members of the House, by way of debate or statements, considering the report of the tribunal.  It is my hope that we will not need to extend the time frame further but I recognise, after so many years have passed with such serious allegations in place, it is important the tribunal completes its work and is enabled to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, subsection (1), lines 22 to 25, to delete paragraph (<i>c</i>).</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment proposes the deletion of section 13(1)(<i>c</i>).  I accept I may be wrong but my rationale for this is that the paragraph appears to be extremely vague.  It refers to &ldquo;such other nourishment having regard to its nature, type, species, breed, development, adaptation, domestication and state of health and to the animal&rsquo;s physiological or behavioural needs&rdquo;.  Is there any way whereby the position in this regard might be better defined?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the terminology that is used in existing legislation and it relates to the type of mineral licks farmers give to cattle, sheep and horses.  The section refers to nourishment that is required by certain species or breeds.  This may involve extra minerals which may be required in the context of their development or growth.  The paragraph adds to what is contained in section 13(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), which refer to &ldquo;a sufficient quantity of wholesome and uncontaminated drinking water&rdquo; and &ldquo;a quantity of suitable and wholesome food sufficient to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the animal&rdquo;, respectively.  Provision is made in paragraph (<i>c</i>) for any extra minerals or additives which may be required by a particular animal.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, subsection (3)(<i>c</i>), to delete line 28.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the prohibition on the abandonment of animals.  Section 14(3)(<i>c</i>)(iii) refers to &ldquo;adequate exercise&rdquo;.  Will the Minister outline the aim of this provision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are trying to ensure that when people leave animals for a period there will be adequate shelter and warmth as well as suitable food and water and that the animal will be provided with adequate exercise.  A practical example would involve someone working during the day who has a dog in a stable, porch or shed.  An effort should be made.  The legislation has the term &ldquo;what is reasonably required by way of&rdquo;.  This is so that people will know there is an obligation to provide an opportunity for an animal to run or move around or, for example, to be taken for a walk in the case of a domestic dog.  In other words, if we are leaving animals for long periods, there should be a requirement, within reason, such that people should take account of the exercise needs of those animals.  That makes sense.  We are not going over the top.  We have deliberately used a phrase which I know the Senator is fond of after yesterday&rsquo;s debate, namely,&ldquo;reasonably required by way of&rdquo;.  This is about ensuring animals are exercising and surviving when people are unable to look after them.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 16, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(6) In this section abandonment does not include&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>a</i>) release into the wild of an animal&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="4" el="5">(i) normally found in a wild state in Ireland, or</P>
        <P LI="4" el="5">(ii) formerly found in a wild state in Ireland, as part of a programme to reintroduce animals of that species,</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">or</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>b</i>) stocking land with game birds, if the animal, having regard to its type, species, breed and development is able to survive and to fulfil its normal needs.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment was a result of a representation made to me and it was drafted following consultation with various groups.  A concern was raised that certain activities might be construed as abandonment.  While I consider that neither the re-introduction of wild animals nor the stocking of game birds constitutes abandonment, it is best to remove any doubt.  The amendment makes it clear that the section on abandonment does not apply to these areas.  We are introducing an add-in after section 14(5) relating to the prohibition on abandonment.  We suggest that abandonment does not include release into the wild of an animal normally found in a wild state in Ireland or formally found in a wild state in Ireland as part of a programme to re-introduce animals of that species.  It also applies to stocking land with game birds or, if one is raising animals, releasing them into the wild.  This could be the case with game birds such as pheasants or if one were trying to implement a restocking programme for certain wild birds or fish which one bred and raised domestically for the purposes of releasing them into the wild.  This will not be deemed abandonment under the legislation.  It makes sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Section 14, as amended, agreed to.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The same issue affecting section 8(4) arises in section 14(5).  Section 14(5) states: &ldquo;Where a person having possession or control of a protected animal contravenes subsection (1) or (2) and that person is not the owner, then the owner of the animal shall also have committed an offence under subsection (4).&rdquo;  I realise the Minister explained his position yesterday.  Anyway, it appears that if I am the owner of an animal and I give it to an animal contract rearing facility, a bed and breakfast facility or to a mart, I remain liable if someone at the cattle mart, the cattle rearing facility or bed and breakfast facility were to carry out something in contravention of the legislation.  Under the paragraph, as drafted, the owner would be committing an offence and this is a cause of concern.</P>

	<P>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Is bre&aacute; an rud deis a fh&aacute;il labhairt ar an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to one particular matter.  The joint policing committee meeting in Galway on Monday was a strange place for something relating to the Animal Health and Welfare Bill to come up.  The question raised was about who owns the horses.  This is a serious problem for Galway City Council at the moment.  The council spent &euro;90,000 last year on abandoned horses.  The council is not allowed to put down the horses but when they are abandoned on the side of the road, the council must take them somewhere.  They are kept in stables in the countryside.   The council has a serious issue.  I welcome what the Minister is doing with the legislation.  How will the legislation address the case in which someone has abandoned a horse or animal in an urban area and the local council must take it on board?  The council is obliged to keep the animal somewhere until the rightful owner comes back.  At the moment this is incurring a cost on the State.  I would welcome any comments of the Minister in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a problem.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s point.  Often at marts one sees animals abandoned or left behind.  I heard of one occasion where a farmer came with his horse box and had two horses in it which did not belong to him.  We will be able to overcome this with the micro-chipping of animals.  When horses and donkeys are micro-chipped they will be traceable back to the owner.  This is where micro-chipping comes into its own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The point raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is in the same category as the two paragraphs we discussed yesterday.  We will examine the matter.  We do not want to prosecute in an unreasonable way owners of animals who have entrusted those animals to either a professional, a family member or a friend for minding in good faith.  In some cases the owners will be paying for it.  Let us suppose one keeps a pony in a livery for one&rsquo;s son or daughter to ride at the weekend.  If the horse is then mistreated or abandoned by someone who the owner has no cause to believe would do so, having taken reasonable account of the likelihood of that occurring, then I do not believe we should prosecute the owner.  There should be some obligation on owners, however, to ensure that if they entrust an animal to someone else, then, at least, they take reasonable measures to ensure the animal will be looked after as opposed to putting it into a field and forgetting about it.  The issue has been raised by several people yesterday and today.  The point has been made that we need to get the balance right with regard to the onus of responsibility.  We will examine it in advance of Report Stage.</P>
        <P>The terminology used yesterday included &ldquo;shall have reason to believe that all necessary measures in the circumstances were taken to comply with&rdquo;.  The idea is that someone should have good reason to believe that his horse, dog, sheep or bullock is looked after and not abandoned.  I will examine it.</P>
        <P>We have undertaken a good deal of work on the broader issue of the abandonment of horses.  We provided part-funding for the Irish Equine Centre to carry out some research into the level of abandonment of horses.  One of the problems of the recession has been that many people during the so-called boom years in Ireland wanted to buy the leg of a horse, whether a sports horse for show jumping or eventing or a race horse.  Subsequently because of dropping incomes loss of jobs and emigration many of these people could no longer afford to keep them, nor could they sell them.  This brought about the problem of abandonment.  We are trying to get a handle of the numbers.   Some people have exaggerated the problem and others are ignoring it.  We are trying to get a balanced position in terms of the problem and the best response to it.  The Senator will be aware that my Department has increased funding for animal welfare organisations, some of which look after abandoned horses and donkeys, as well as dogs, cats and other animals.</P>
        <P>On the Galway issue, I have spoken to the person who is responsible for taking horses from Galway County Council.  Many of those horses are stabled in the midlands, not in Galway.  To be fair, local authority veterinarians and managers are trying to do their best on this, and we need to try to help them in that regard.</P>
        <P>From my perspective, when dealing with an abandoned animal there is always an obligation to try to rehome it if it is possible but also to take responsible decisions, if necessary, to destroy that animal if it is very sick or old.  We must be practical in that respect and, where possible, find homes for animals in Ireland or perhaps in the United Kingdom where there is a sophisticated animal welfare structure around rehoming of both horses and dogs.  We can tap into that but there is a cost implication also that cannot be ignored.  It is about getting the balance right in respect of all of those aspects.  That is the reason we have introduced codes of conduct, which we spoke about yesterday, for animal welfare organisations in return for those animal welfare organisations getting financial support from me.  We must also talk to local authorities to make sure they are getting the support that is reasonable to expect from my Department in terms of issues to do with abandoned horses.</P>
        <P>On the identification of those horses, that is a problem on which we are taking quite a hard line.  If someone has a horse, it needs to be identified.  If someone has a foal they must identify, micro-chip it and get a passport for it within six months of birth.  If not, that horse can never enter the food chain.  In other words, when that horse is put down the owner cannot sell it to the factory for &euro;600 or &euro;800.  In terms of a record of where horses have been and the drugs they have been treated with, we cannot legally allow meat from unidentified horses get into the food chain, and I agree with that.  There is an issue in terms of horses that have been abandoned without identification.  It is very difficult to track down owners.  If we could do that it becomes a much easier problem because we can prosecute under this legislation in terms of abandonment.</P>
        <P>Two issues arise.  First, we need simple and easy to understand legislation on the abandonment of animals, and I believe we have that in this Bill.  Second, we must have a proper and affordable identification mechanism for horses but also for other animals to ensure that if an animal is abandoned we can easily track where it came from, who had responsibility for it and, in the case of horses, the commercial value of that animal at the end of its days in terms of it entering the food chain as opposed to going to the knackery yard.  These are issues we are trying to get on top of, and we have done a good deal in those areas in 12 months.  The horse industry is responding to that.  I am trying to get the balance right in terms of giving it the time and space to do that while at the same time taking a firm position on the need for identification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is spot on as regards the Galway issue.  It is mainly horses that were bought in the boom times, apparently as show horses or for horse racing.</P>
        <P>On the other issue that arises, when the council picks up an abandoned horse it appears to be obliged to keep that horse until the owner turns up to collect it.  If a horse is being kept in the midlands for a number of weeks or months is there a specified timescale following which it is reasonable to assume the owner no longer intends to claim it and therefore the animal can either be sold or disposed of by other means?  One of the issues is the cost of keeping the horses.  I am sure the Minister has addressed that with the councils.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point and it is the reason we need codes of conduct in welfare organisations, not just for horses but for other animals as well.  We must balance the support for well-meaning people who in many cases are looking after abandoned animals at their own expense.  I know a number of them and they are well-meaning animal lovers who are looking to help as many abandoned animals as they can and set up partnerships with welfare organisations in the United Kingdom to have animals rehomed there when it is appropriate to do so.  That is welcome but we must put some regulations in place that are not necessarily legally binding but would be put in place by a code of conduct.  For example, if a horse is abandoned in Galway, picked up by the local authority and taken to a safe location such as stables in the midlands or wherever, we must allow an authorised officer or an veterinarian to make a decision on that animal in terms of its state of health, age and so on, whether it is suitable for rehoming and if it is not, within a reasonable period of time that animal should be put down.</P>
        <P>We cannot have a situation whereby animals are kept for very long periods in the hope an owner might show up.  An agreed period of time must be laid down in codes of conduct that I can change and improve, depending on circumstances, to allow us get on with rehoming animals or put them down in a humane way if it is possible and appropriate to do that.  That is the kind of limbo councils find very frustrating in that they are being asked to care for animals indefinitely while somebody somewhere is making a decision or, in some cases, nobody anywhere is making a decision.  We need to either rehome these animals or make a decision on putting them down and allow an adequate period in which somebody can reclaim the animal if they know it is missing but, unfortunately, most of these animals are abandoned for a reason and the likelihood of them being reclaimed is slim.  The kind of abandonment that requires reclaiming is when someone leaves a gate open or a fence breaks and an animal gets out and it is picked up.  In those type of instances owners will look for their animals and want them back, and they deserve a reasonable period to be able to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for labouring the point but is the Minister saying that is covered by this legislation as long as a code of practice is put in place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  There are codes of practice in place.  There is a long section on codes of practice which we will reach shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there an issue over the transfer of title of the ownership?  For example, if Galway County Council or Galway City Council was to sell a horse within a certain period does an issue of title arise if a person came to the authority and complained that it sold their horse while they were in England or doing something else?  Does a question arise over the legal title in such a scenario or has the Minister examined that issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just been advised that the normal period we would financially support the council in terms of keeping animals is five days.  These are issues we can review if they are not appropriate.  The point of having flexibility around codes of conduct is to be able to extend or reduce them, depending on what is appropriate.  We are trying to get this right, which is why putting a timeframe into a Bill such as this would be wrong.  For example, as people increasingly use social media we can get out messages to them much more quickly and allow them to pick up their animals.  We need the flexibility, through codes of conduct, to be able to change, improve and adapt the length of time horses will be kept.  In terms of the financial support we give to local authorities for looking after abandoned horses, however, my information is that that is based on a period of five days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Galway City Council, for example, is only obliged to keep a horse for five days.  Is the Minister saying it will then be allowed to sell it or give it to a better home if one can be found?  It wants to be sure that it is covered legally in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the responsibility of local authorities in this area.  We play a supervisory role, and we are talking to local authorities about how we can financially support them.  Obviously, we have spoken to local authorities about trying to get this legislation right.  My understanding is that there is an obligation on a local authority to collect and look after horses if they have been abandoned.  When that happens, they get taken to a holding unit of stables, which I think is in the midlands.  The obligation on Galway City Council or Galway County Council would be to look after the horse for a minimum five-day period, which is what we support them for financially.  That agreement is not necessarily laid down in law.  We have an agreement with local authorities on what is reasonable in looking after those horses, but I think there is an obligation during that period to make a judgment call on the horse.  Some of those horses will be kept for a lot longer than five days.  If we have a horse that is clearly suitable for rehoming, there is an onus on us to do that.  If we have a horse that is sick, very old and is unlikely to be rehomed, then I think we can make the responsible decision on destroying that animal.  People have to use their cop-on as well, but the basis of the relationship between Galway city and county councils at the moment is that we fund them to keep the horses for a five-day period on average.  Some of the horses may be very unwell or have an injury that requires them to be put down within hours, but I understand our benchmark is five days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a maximum amount of time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not, as far as I know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a maximum from a funding perspective?  There is not an infinite budget.  That was the councils&rsquo; problem.  They would have spent about &euro;90,000 last year on the issue.  In some of the cases, it was because the horses were quite healthy and they were not sure how long they should be kept in the stables.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a joint responsibility.  Local authorities cannot say that they want all of this to be paid for by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is a also responsibility on local authorities, their veterinary officers and their authorised officers to ensure that horses are not abandoned.  This is a joint approach.  We spent just over &euro;2 million last year supporting local authorities in trying to deal financially with abandoned horses.  That money was spread across many different local authorities and that is where the benchmark period of five days came into play.  The Control of Horses Act goes back to 1996 and it applies to looking after abandoned horses and so on.  This legislation will add to that in respect of the responsibility of owners or keepers of horses, and abandonment.  However, if there is an unidentified horse trotting down the street, then the local authority has to respond to that, pick up the animal, take it to a holding point, make a judgment call on its health, its age, its capacity for rehoming or not, whether it is has a micro-chip and whether it is identified.  We put a fund together last year to help local authorities to deal with this problem, but it is not just my problem.  It is also the problem of the county manager and the vets, so collectively we need to deal with it.</P>
        <P>To be honest, I would like to have more money for this issue, but there is a limit to the budget at the moment.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 15</P>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), line 39, after &ldquo;animal&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, save for normal, necessary farm practices&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The previous amendment is related to the abandonment of horses, and I would like to put on record the excellent work being done by a number of organisations in my own county in caring for animals that have been abandoned.  Unfortunately, due to the current climate, people are getting pets at Christmas or as gifts but financially they cannot take care of them, and the animals are being abandoned.  Therefore, it is important that resources be made available, although we are living in times where it is difficult to provide those resources.  One example of which the Minister is aware is the Donegal Donkey Sanctuary in Raphoe.   Danny Curran, who operates the sanctuary, picked up a donkey just after Christmas which was so mutilated it was an absolute disgrace.  The sanctuary took it into care and brought it back to full health, and this shows us some of the excellent voluntary work that is taking place to which the Minister referred.</P>
        <P>This issue relates to animal fighting.  I welcome section 15.  It is very important because unfortunately, there are people in this country who are involved in animal fighting for financial gain in many cases.  My three amendments in this section are all linked.  Perhaps there may not be a need for them.  I will accept that if I can get an assurance from the Minister that the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; in section 15(1) excludes any farming activities.  I just want to make sure that the section refers exclusively to the disgraceful activities and events in which some people are engaged, such as animal fighting or cock fighting, whether for some kind of fun or for financial reward.  If the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; excludes farming activities, I would be happy to withdraw the three amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We had quite a long conversation about this issue this morning.  I think what the Senator is asking for is not unreasonable.  This section is clearly not about farming, unless somebody is farming animals for fighting.  If that is the case, we are coming after such people.  This is one of the sections about which I feel very strongly.  That is why this section refers to anyone who records, bets on, keeps, breeds, generates income from, provides information, publicity or promotion for any form of dog fighting, cock fighting, animal baiting, wrestling, fighting or struggling with an animal, or throwing or casting ropes on animals.  In other words, human beings should not be entertaining themselves by organising and breeding animals to fight each other.  That is something which we will deal with comprehensively in this Bill.</P>
        <P>If we look at this in a legalistic way, the Senator&rsquo;s concerns are probably not founded, but I would like to put it in as a belt and braces approach to make sure that nobody is under any illusions.  We have said that we would look at a wording on Report Stage that would put this issue beyond doubt.  The beginning of the section states that &ldquo;A person shall not organise or cause or permit to take place any performance involving&rdquo;, and then it lists a series of activities, including &ldquo;riding or attempting to ride an animal which, by the use of any appliance or treatment, is or has been stimulated with the intention of making it buck, or any other activity that may cause unnecessary suffering to an animal and is prohibited by animal health and welfare regulations.&rdquo;  We cover almost everything in this list, but for the avoidance of any doubt, it may be no harm that any normal farm practices should not be included in this category.  We will have a look at the wording.  It probably only means adding one or two extra words.  I take the spirit of the Senator&rsquo;s amendments, and we will try to bring something back on Report Stage to reflect that spirit, so that farmers and farming organisations do not have a concern.  I hope the Senator will withdraw his amendments, on the basis of the commitments I have given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate what the Minister has said with regard to amendments Nos. 18, 19 and 20 and I accept that.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 not moved.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 15 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to over-egg this point.  However, a really good example of lack of animal welfare legislation is seen in the practices of dog fighting, dog baiting and cock fighting and the underground culture that goes with them which is, unfortunately, quite active across the country.  I hope the Bill will send out a strong signal to people who are participating in those activities that they are no longer acceptable, that we will make examples of people who are involved in them and that we will use this legislation to its maximum effect to stamp them out.  Section 15 is all about that.  It is easy to understand.  We are going to great lengths to make it as easy as possible for garda&iacute; to secure convictions against people who are organising this type of activity and even of those who merely turn up to watch.  That should send out a strong signal to those people.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION  16</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 21:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 18, lines 33 to 36, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) Nothing in <i>subsection (1) </i>prevents a registered veterinary practitioner acting as such from performing, in accordance with animal health and welfare regulations (if any), an operation or procedure for therapeutic purposes if the operation or procedure is necessary for the health and welfare of an individual animal.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 16 has given quite a few people cause for concern.  The amendment is brought forward following consultation with the Select Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture.  It brings additional clarity to section 16.  It makes it clear that, irrespective of whether or not an operation is covered by a regulation under subsection 16(1), a veterinary practitioner may perform the operation for therapeutic purposes.</P>
        <P>I think it was Deputy Michael McNamara who raised this issue with my officials.  The amendment replaces subsection 16(2) with a better wording which provides more clarity for veterinary practitioners and others who may undertake therapeutic work with animals.  I am told the new version provides more clarity on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister.  We were a little perplexed as to why it was felt necessary to change the wording of the original subsection.  In essence, the two versions seem to be much the same.  However, we accept the Minster&rsquo;s bona fides in this regard.</P>
        <P>The amendment uses the words, &ldquo;Nothing in subsection (1)&rdquo;.  This allows me to raise the issue of the docking of animals&rsquo; tails.  This arose under a previous section and arises here again.  Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill, like myself, is a nominee of the National Association of Regional Game Councils, which has expressed concern at this aspect of the Bill.  Senator O&rsquo;Neill may have an opinion on this section although, of course, I do not speak for him.  I merely acknowledge the fact that we both represent the same nominating body.</P>
        <P>I would be grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s observations on the briefing we received from the National Association of Regional Game Councils.  The association describes the prohibition of the docking of dogs&rsquo; tails as &ldquo;somewhat controversial&rdquo;.  My reading of the Bill is that it does provide for exceptions.  I seek clarity, either under this amendment or under the section, as to what exactly the Minister intends in this regard.</P>
        <P>The provision is understood not to be clear enough and leaves open the possibility of subjective misinterpretation, depending on who is applying the proposed provision.  I share the view of the National Association of Regional Game Councils that there should be a clear-cut exemption for the docking of the tails of working dogs, similar to that applied by legislation in Westminster, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and, more recently, in Northern Ireland.  I would be grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s observations in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment, in providing clarity, does allow a veterinary practitioner to dock a tail, where he or she believes it necessary.  However, subsection 16(1) states that a person shall not mutilate an animal, &ldquo;including the docking or nicking of the tail of a bovine, canine or equine&rdquo;.  The subsection refers to an exception if the procedure is carried out in accordance with animal health and welfare regulations.  This seems to be the core of what the section is about and may address the concerns of those who feel docking legislation should be clear.  The subsection may allow the Minister to introduce a regulation or statutory instrument to add further clarity to the section.</P>
        <P>I remain to be convinced about this.  When I first read the Bill, banning the docking of tails seemed to me to be a perfectly humane way of going about things.  However, it was pointed out to me that a hunting dog with a long tail can get caught up in brambles and undergrowth.  A dog can suffer as a result of having a long tail and it is, therefore, a humane practice to dock the tails of hunting dogs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Mooney on the way he put this issue.  We received nominations for the Seanad election from the same body.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Mooney, I ask the Minister for clarification.  Will a list of working dogs that are exempt under subsection 16(1) and the new subsection 16(2) be drawn up?  Our nearest neighbours in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland changed their legislation last year to allow the docking of tails and the removal of the dewclaw on pups, which is an unnecessary claw that can be humanely removed from a young pup.  I ask the Minister for clarification on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am looking at the Northern Ireland legislation, which was cited earlier.  Section 6 of the Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 states that a person commits an offence if that person removes the whole or any part of a dog&rsquo;s tail or causes the whole or any part of a dog&rsquo;s tail to be removed by another person.  A person commits an offence if that person is responsible for a dog and another person removes the whole or any part of the dog&rsquo;s tail.  The Act says that a person does not commit an offence if the whole or part of a dog&rsquo;s tail is removed by a veterinary surgeon for the purpose of medical treatment or in order to prevent or remove an immediate danger to the life of the dog in circumstances where it is not reasonably practicable to have the tail, or, as the case may be, any part of the tail, removed by a veterinary surgeon.</P>
        <P>The Northern Ireland Act also tries to get the balance right.  What I am trying to do helps the circumstance raised by Senators Mooney and O&rsquo;Neill.  The difference between what I am now proposing and what is in Bill is in the opening of the subsection.  Subsection 16(1) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A person shall not, except in accordance with animal health and welfare regulations, carry out an operation or procedure to mutilate or cause or permit another person to mutilate an animal, (including the docking or nicking of the tail of a bovine, canine or equine, the removal of horns or antlers from an animal or firing an equine).</P>
        <P FLI="0">I propose to substitute:</P>
        <P LI="1">Nothing in subsection (1) prevents a registered veterinary practitioner acting as such from performing, in accordance with animal health and welfare regulations (if any), an operation or procedure for therapeutic purposes if the operation or procedure is necessary for the health and welfare of an individual animal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have spoken to Veterinary Ireland on this issue.  If a vet deems that it is appropriate to dock a dog&rsquo;s tail, then he or she has the capacity to do it but he or she must do it within the health and welfare regulations and it must be in the interests of the animal that it would be done rather than just convenient for the owner.  This is about trying to get the balance right.  The section we are inserting now is much stronger than the previous section because it says that nothing in subsection (1) prevents a registered vet from docking a tail if that is the issue concerned, whereas it said previously an operation or procedure referred to in subsection (1) may be carried out.  Essentially, we are excluding this section from the decision-making process in a case where a vet makes a decision to operate on a dog, or any other animal for that matter, if it is in the welfare interests of the animal.  That is not an unreasonable balance.  I am not sure how we could improve it but we have put the wording together following consultations with Veterinary Ireland.  If there is a reason to carry out a procedure in terms of the welfare of the animal, then it can happen regardless of section 16(1), which I just read out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not totally reassured by the Minister&rsquo;s reply but I understand where he is coming from.  He said he consulted veterinarians.  Let us suppose in a hypothetical situation a vet is anti-hunting &mdash; he has a visceral hatred of hunting as a concept &mdash; and the people who own the dogs, who are responsible people, say it is a long-standing practice and is in the interests of the health and welfare of the hunting dog but the vet does not agree.  Does the Minister not think, therefore, it would be better and wiser he should retain the right to decide under health and safety regulations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not think so.  I am not a qualified vet.  First, I would like to think vets are professional enough to be able to make decisions on the welfare of animals without being clouded in their judgment by whether they support hunting.  The issue at stake is the welfare of the animal, be it a hound or a horse, just as in the case of farming.  Vets should be able to carry out their work on the basis of the circumstances animals are in or are going to be in, such as in the case of harriers for hunting, for example.  Vets are the people who are best placed to make such decisions rather than a Minister making a decision on a matter without looking at it case by case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said he had consulted Veterinary Ireland.  My understanding is the Department has not consulted regional game councils.  Therefore, the Minister is only getting one part of the equation.  I do not wish in any way to cast aspersions on the professional integrity and objectivity of the veterinary profession.  I raise the point to ensure there is no ambiguity or ambivalence on the matter, as the Minister attempted to do by moving his amendment, within the framework of health and safety and of the amendment, and the long-standing practice, as exercised by responsible hunting people, will not in any way be inhibited because of the law being interpreted in such a way as to prevent it happening by someone saying it is not in the best interests of the health and welfare of the animal.</P>
        <P>I focus specifically on dogs.  On a personal level it seems a horrible practice to dock dogs&rsquo; tails.  I think of my pet at home.  I am trying to put forward a particular argument to ensure that if docking has been working in practice and there are no indications through the Department of it being interpreted in the narrow context in which I debate the issue as being the mutilation of an animal or the animal&rsquo;s health and welfare being compromised, the Minister can ensure through the legislation the practice will continue but with oversight.  I accept there must be a form of oversight.  That was my only reason to suggest it to the Minister.  I did not intend him or whoever holds the office to do it, but that the Minister would have the resources available to him or her to ensure a balanced conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>The regional game councils or people involved in hunting, shooting or hunting by hounds seek reassurance, as Senator Mooney has pointed out, that the law cannot be misinterpreted by either a veterinary surgeon or, if it goes to a court of law, that their sports and hobbies will be taken into account in this regard.  It is in the best interests of certain hunting dogs that their tail is docked due to the fact that it may be a welfare issue.</P>
        <P>What is the position on show dogs of certain breeds that have their tails docked?  One sees dogs on television at Crufts, for example, that have their tails docked.  Could one say it is a welfare issue for a show dog to have its tail docked?  I would welcome a comment from the Minister on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>First, for the record, I have received a submission from the Countryside Alliance.  We have had submissions from many different organisations.  As Members are aware, the Countryside Alliance is a strong supporter of hunting and other such pursuits.</P>
        <P>The first paragraph of section 16 states: &ldquo;A person shall not, except in accordance with animal health and welfare regulations, carry out an operation&rdquo;.  I must put in place regulations that will go with the legislation to clarify the various measures.  The regulation that currently exists refers to excepted operations:</P>
        <P LI="1">The rendering in emergency of first aid for the purpose of saving a life or relieving pain.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The docking of the tail of a dog under one month old.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The amputation of the dew claws of a dog before its eyes are open.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The castration of a male animal specified in the following table before it has reached the age so specified, that is to say:</P>
        <P LI="2">Bull &mdash; six months;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="0">Sheep &mdash; three months;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="0">Goat &mdash; two months;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="0">Pig &mdash; two months;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="0">Cat &mdash; four months.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the current regulation which is now outdated.  We must put a new set of regulations in place that provides clarity on the issue.  What we are trying to do is put into the main Bill a consistent wording that will allow us to put a more detailed regulation in place when we clarify the specifics of what is being said.</P>
        <P>To be honest, I do not know that much about show dogs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither do I.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;although I know a lot about dogs.  My dog is certainly not a show dog.  My understanding is one cannot dock a dog&rsquo;s tail for display purposes.  I am pretty confident about that.  Perhaps I am wrong but if it is taking place, my view is that I do not think we should allow it.  We should not dock a dog&rsquo;s tail to make it look pretty.  If there is a reason to dock a dog&rsquo;s tail in terms of the activities it is involved in such as hunting, if they are likely to get injured or if there is an infection risk that docking a dog&rsquo;s tail would prevent &mdash; that holds true for other animals also &mdash; then there is a reason to do it.</P>
        <P>There may be a reason to dock a dog or another animal&rsquo;s tail, for example, if it is used in hunting, if it is likely to be injured or if there is a risk of infection that can be avoided.  If I am wrong or anyone wants to correct me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>If someone wants to make representations to me on the issue, I will consider it in the context of regulations, but I would need to be convinced that we should be docking dogs&rsquo; tails to make them look like nicer show animals.  I am being patronising.  There are many show breeders and I have no difficulty with that activity.  I am supportive of it.  However, many of the people concerned are animal lovers and most people who keep dogs will not dock animals&rsquo; tails unnecessarily.  The provision should apply to show animals, as it does to hunting animals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>On the amendment and section 16 in general, the Minister has stated the section will enter into force following the publication and signing of the regulations.  This is the crux of the matter and the reason for the industry&rsquo;s confusion.  People are concerned that they do not know what the regulations will be.  It is normal procedure for a Minister and his or her officials to design and sign off on a set of regulations.</P>
        <P>There is docking in the agriculture sector, be it of sheep or lambs.  Such docking is common practice to ensure a lamb&rsquo;s well-being rather than its good looks.  Every farmer has engaged in docking and a registered vet must visit the farm.  This provision is a source of concern for many sheep farmers.  Will the regulations curtail this practice?  Perhaps the Minister&rsquo;s opinion differs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill still wish to provide clarification?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>On the use of modern technology, Senator C&aacute;it Keane mentioned the iPad.  In the United Kingdom it became illegal two years ago to dock the tail of any dog, except a working dog.  People have been asking how dogs with docked tails are still appearing at Crufts, but these animals were bred before the introduction of the ban.  I have not seen many Jack Russells with long tails.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for providing that clarification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reassured more than I was before the Minister&rsquo;s response.  It is not that I doubted his intent, as he is unquestionably operating in the best interests of animals.  He understands the concerns expressed by my colleague in respect of agriculture, as well as the concerns held in the hunting and fishing industries.  Providing greater clarity on the issue is important for the efficient operation of the legislation.  I hope the regulations the Minister is formulating will provide for that clarity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reassure Members.  We will not introduce a statutory instrument with a series of regulations without having engaged in broad consultations.  It is important that we not do anything that would inconvenience people or animals unnecessarily.  The legislation will not have a negative impact on commercial farming where there is good reason to use normal, sensible farming practices in dealing with animals.  There will be no change in that regard.</P>
        <P>The regulations will probably need to bring clarity to the issue of hunting dogs.  I take that point on board and we will try to address it through the regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Section 16, as amended, agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 17</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 17 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The wording used in the section appears to be broad.  Why is there no definition?  For example, the provisions of the section may prohibit common commercial farming activities such as budding or the ringing or lambs, for which the services of a vet to administer an anaesthetic would need to be employed.  Will this issue be covered by the proposed regulations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator reads the section, he will see that it reads, a &ldquo;person shall not, except in accordance with animal health and welfare regulations, [this is where the statutory instrument comes in] perform an operation or procedure (with or without the use of instruments) involving interference with the sensitive tissue&rdquo;.  It is a question of ensuring people do not cut costs and corners by operating on animals without providing appropriate painkillers.  Doing otherwise is not acceptable.  However, the requirement laid down must be within reason.  The statutory instrument will provide for clarity in this regard.  We will discuss the matter with farming organisations, in particular.  People will understand the Bill&rsquo;s overall thrust is to ensure animals are not operated on without the obligation to kill or control their pain being met.  Most Members present know what activities constitute normal farming practices, be they the minding of sheep or cattle.  They will be covered in the statutory instrument.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek clarification in respect of laboratory animals.  Are they covered by this provision, or are they considered to be outside its remit?  Is there a separate regulation for them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been told that the 1876 Act applies.  In fairness, that is not a credible answer for me to give.  The issue raised by the Senator is predominantly the responsibility of the Department of Health, as it is not an agricultural animal issue as such, rather it is a scientific and animal testing issue.  Some are uncomfortable with the activity, but others regard it as a necessary evil.  This section does not encompass it.</P>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 18</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, lines 15 to 17, to delete subsection (1).</P>
        <P FLI="0">There may be another way to deal with this matter.  The word &ldquo;vermin&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill.  There are animals and birds that carry diseases and are a threat to the health and welfare of humans and animals.  Inserting a definition in section 2 might be worthwhile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important section.  In certain circumstances land owners and business people have the right to lay poison to protect their health or that of their animals.  What about the illegal use of poisons in the countryside which poses a greater risk to wildlife than the laying of poisons by farmers?  If a farmer lays poison, it must be registered.  We should consider the illegal use of poisons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am uncertain as to whether I can raise my point under this amendment as opposed to the section.  Like many others, I have an interest in protecting animals from poison.  In particular, I am concerned about raptors that are at risk.  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to a fine article that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday, 13 March, and which relates to section 18.  As we are debating the possible deletion of this, I am not sure whether it comes under the amendment or in the context of section 18(2)(<i>b</i>) which states a person shall not &ldquo;lay poison by a method or in a manner that a protected animal or a prescribed wild bird would have access to the poison&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a discussion about this whole section in the Department before coming into the Seanad today.  There is a problem with this because several Departments and several Acts deal with poison.  They could be the wildlife Acts which come under the responsibility of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, or Department of Health rules and regulations in place around the use of poisons.  There is some ambiguity here with which I am not happy.  We are looking at deleting section 18 in its entirety with a view to relying on the NPWS regulations and providing a legal basis for dealing with poisons, how they can be used, who can use them and so forth.</P>
        <P>While certain protected species, such as raptors, need to be protected from poison, we must allow a farmer to deal with a lodging problem in a crop such as thousands of crows eating a field of barley or wheat.  There is a practical response needed here as well.  We want to re-examine this section and maybe even get rid of it.  The Department should deal with the use of poison on land in its entirety or let some other Department do it.  To have three different Departments with slightly contradictory points on poison will only lead to uncertainty.  I am not happy with this section and the Department wants more time to examine it.  The Senator&rsquo;s amendment sparked off this discussion in the Department.  I am more than happy to come back on Report Stage with an improved or deleted section, if the Senator so wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I know my friend and colleague, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, will deal with the specific amendment and the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  I want to address the wider context of the sustainability of this particular section.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is best placed to deal with these issues rather than the Wildlife Act which has less resources.  I am not in any way taking away from the wardens, inspectors and others doing a wonderful job under the Wildlife Act.</P>
        <P><i>The Irish Times</i> article states, &ldquo;The indiscriminate use of poisons to kill rats or mice has been linked to an alarming decline in some of Ireland&rsquo;s most iconic birds of prey, such as barn owls and kestrels.&rdquo;  The birds under threat include the merlin, the peregrine falcon, the long-eared owl, the red kite, the tree-nesting raptor, the common buzzard, the barn owl, the kestrel, the white-tailed eagle, the hen harrier and the golden eagle.  That is an astonishing list of birds common to our environment.  The article also stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Since 2010, the practice of using poisoned meat baits to control farmland pests such as foxes and crows has been outlawed because of the knock-on effects on other species.</P>
        <P LI="1">However, there are currently no regulations concerning the use of poisons to kill rats or mice.  In Britain, there are restrictions against the use of certain rodenticides in outside areas in order to protect other species, and ornithologists want similar regulations adopted here.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Will the Minister clarify whether it is his Department or the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht that enforces the ban on poisoned meat baits?  The article continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland unfortunately has had a poor record in protecting its native raptor species, arguably the worst in Europe [. . .]</P>
        <P LI="1">Since a ban on DDT was implemented, the peregrine population in Ireland, which had dwindled to little more than 60 pairs in the 1970s, has rebounded significantly, and the birds are now no longer a conservation concern.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That proves when proactive initiatives are introduced in this area, there are real gains not just for the protection but also for the enhancement of bird species.  It is important the Minister sorts this problem out quickly as we are behind the rest of Europe.  It would be a tragedy if we were to lose many of the birds I have mentioned.</P>
        <P>The golden eagle became extinct in Ireland in the 20th century and was recently reintroduced into Donegal.  One of these birds was recently both poisoned and shot.  The long-eared owl, now thought to be more common, is on the wane because of the use of poisons and loss of habitat.  The red kite, a tree-nesting raptor, was reintroduced to Ireland in 2007 after 200 years of absence.  There were 14 breeding pairs of red kites in Wicklow as of last year but they are under threat again.</P>
        <P>We are all singing from the one hymn sheet here.  Does the Minister believe he should take this area under his wing &mdash; excuse the pun &mdash; rather than it being covered by the Wildlife Act?  In whatever little turf war is breaking out over this, the Department should assert its rights in this regard.  I have no monopoly of wisdom in this area and I want to hear other points of view on this.  However, BirdWatch Ireland and John Lusby, who has done extraordinary work in this area, have a real concern and want action to be taken to address the methods of laying down poison.  It is not about the banning of poison but ensuring proper methods are in place.</P>
        <P>The Minister goes some way in addressing that in this Bill.  BirdWatch Ireland is happy about the proposals in section 18 because it believes they go a long way to addressing the void in our legislation.  This is not a popular issue and there are no votes in it.  It would be a considerable loss to the country, however, if these wonderful birds were lost because we could not get the legislation right or get the right Department to decide on it.  Will the Minister be assertive in this regard?  Nothing has happened in this area until now.  That is why this article appeared.  Our neighbours are way ahead of us in this regard.  There is a powerful argument for the Minister to say at Cabinet that this section addresses to a large extent the loss of these species and it will protect and enhance the bird population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My friend, Senator Mooney, was obviously saving that pun all day.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My friend, Senator Comiskey, might possibly outdo the Senator with his recommendation that there be no foul play.  I commend the Fianna F&aacute;il Party&rsquo;s interest in rare birds.  I support Senator Mooney&rsquo;s comments and particularly the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s enormous interest in food, the green island, health and our natural environment.  The Minister has been able to say to the world that our green grass and natural environment has served us well in terms of food production and our food chain.  If he could raise the plight of those birds in this context and if the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was to take the lead, that would surely fit with his vision of what Ireland can do in the food area. Although it does not appear on the face of it as a natural fit, I suggest it might be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue has sparked something of a debate on the whole area.  I am picking up on the points raised by my colleagues, Senator Mooney and Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe, in respect of the wider issues.  For example, the bird species mentioned by Senator Mooney are protected by EU legislation and EU directives with which we have to comply.  Not only do we have to protect the animal species but also we must designate land within the landmass of the State where the corncrake and the barnacle goose can breed.  There are large tracts of land in west Donegal in my area designated for the protection of the corncrake.  They arrive in April and migrate to Africa in September where they are caught in nets and eaten as a delicacy, yet they are being protected here under an EU directive.  They are a beautiful bird species and we should protect them.  However, there is a lack of joined-up thinking in respect of the protection of those birds.</P>
        <P>In other EU states, such as Portugal or Spain, the designation of the lands is carried out following only public consultation and agreement with the landowners.  What happens here is that the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs draws lines on a map and designates an area as a special protection area for the birds.  The area is then designated without public consultation and farmers are invited to make submissions if they wish to object.  Those requests to farmers fall on deaf ears and there are no changes.  We should examine models adopted in other countries.  I agree with Senator Mooney that the Minister&rsquo;s Department should take the lead because it has got the expertise and is better able to deal with landowners.  There is a need for joined-up thinking as there are other issues in regard to bogs in the west, such as in Connemara and other places, where large special protection areas and special areas of conservation are designated as bogland.  This affects turf cutters.</P>
        <P>In my parish in County Donegal, about 5,000 acres is designated as a special protection area because there were corncrakes on the land between 1997 and 2003.  Last year, there was no recording of corncrakes on the lands in question.  However, one corncrake was recorded in that geographical area but it was about half a mile outside the area that has recently been designated.  The figures being used are outdated.  Highly intensive agricultural lands are being designated and farmers will not be allowed cut silage without the permission of the National Parks and Wildlife Service under the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs.  If the Minister&rsquo;s Department took the lead role, there would be much better co-operation from farmers and landowners.  As the majority of landowners are farmers, it would make sense.  The Minister has got the team, the officials and the expertise, and the farmers would buy in and trust the Department.  I am not casting aspersions on the officials in the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs but they do not have the resources to deal with the number of queries.  One official cannot be expected to cover the west in respect of this issue.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;vermin&rdquo; can be as broad as one wishes depending on the disease it brings to a farm.  Farmers should be given the scope and flexibility to lay poison but how that is done should be regulated to ensure children who may wander through fields do not pick it up.  Everyone needs to buy in.  If a code of practice is required anywhere, it is in this area.  We have to absolutely certain that if poison is laid, there is no danger to human health, especially to young children who may wander through fields.  On the other side there must be a mechanism to protect these bird species.  If, from a farming point of view, non-productive land was designated for the protected bird species under EU directives, the need to lay poison may not be as great and there would be buy-in from farmers.</P>
        <P>The case of the golden eagle leaving Glenveagh National Park was mentioned.  The golden eagle flew out of the park.  A farmer in west Donegal had laid poison, not to catch the golden eagle, even though there had been reports in the local media that one of the golden eagles had picked up a small lamb.  However, the golden eagle picked up the poison and died.  This was devastating in terms of the good work being done at Glenveagh National Park.</P>
        <P>There is a need for wider debate and joined-up thinking between a number of Departments.  I suggest the Minister and his officials take the lead role given the expertise in his Department and his relationship with the farming organisations and farmers generally.  We do not want a situation where 300 or 400 landowners in a county may appeal a decision after it has been taken.  That is the wrong way to do business.  That would get farmers&rsquo; backs up and they would cut the silage and end up committing an offence under the terms of the EU directive.  There is a need to do business in a smarter way.  I appreciate the Minister does not have ministerial responsibility for that area but given the Department for which he has responsibility, he should have it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>For what it is worth, my understanding is that the National Parks and Wildlife Service wanted us to ban the laying of all poisons except for rats and mice.  We were trying to put limits on how poison can be used and where it can be used to protect the birds Senators have mentioned.  We all have an obligation to protect wildlife.  There is no reason commercial farming cannot take place at the same time as the protection of vulnerable species.  Certainly, the project in Donegal, where eagles being reintroduced into the wild was heralded as a great success, came to naught because of that unfortunate incident.  The sense I am getting from Members is that they would like us to deal with the issue rather than rely on legislation from another Department.  We will try to do that.  The section is not bad and contains a lot of good stuff.  Our team has done a pretty good job on it.  The problem is that confusion can be created when two or three Departments are dealing with the same issue.  One of the objectives of the legislation is to pull a series of different pieces of legislation, some of them under the remit of different Departments, into one comprehensive animal welfare Bill and I have examined section 18 in that context.  We are trying to reduce the amount of legislation that people need to read in order to understand the rules.  I will examine it again and see if we can provide the clarity that is sought by everyone.     </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that I am speaking for everybody here when I say that we are very grateful to the Minister for his response.  The indications received from all sides of the House and the confidence that we place in him, his officials and his Department, in the context of this amendment and wider section,  should stiffen his resolve around the Cabinet table to ensure that he proceeds with the section.  It might also lead to him absorbing the other legislation into this Bill in order to diminish, and hopefully eliminate, any ambiguity in the area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I withdraw my amendment and thank the Minister for his indulgence, for listening to us and for his response.  Before the legislation reaches Report Stage we are willing to do anything that we can to assist him and his officials in the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Section 18 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 19</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, subsection (1), lines 12 to 29, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo; in line 12 down to and including &ldquo;animal.&rdquo; in line 29 and substitute &ldquo;and its health and welfare needs are being met.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My amendment is on section 19 which deals with the inspection of protected animals and equipment.  I proposed the deletion of lines 12 to 29, inclusive.  My amendment is also linked to sections 19 and 20 because it deals with paperwork.  Section 19 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) A person who has in his or her possession or under his or her control a protected animal shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the animal is regularly inspected and&mdash;</P>
        <P FLI="0">It continues and states three or four different criteria.  Obviously there will be a substantial amount of paperwork necessary for those inspections.  It states as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) in case the animal is being kept in an intensive unit, not less than once a day&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) thoroughly inspect the animal&rsquo;s condition and state of health or cause the condition and state of health of the animal to be so inspected, and (ii) for the purpose of ensuring that the automatic or other technical equipment used in the unit is free from defects, either&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(I) if he or she is competent to do so, thoroughly inspect the equipment, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(II) cause the equipment to be thoroughly inspected by a competent person, or . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">Again, the words &ldquo;competent to do so&rdquo; are used.  The legislation does not state how often the equipment must be inspected or who the &ldquo;competent person&rdquo; would be.  Do I take that to mean a professional farmer?  Is it someone else?</P>
        <P>The criteria for the &ldquo;competent person&rdquo; has not been referred to.  The section continues, &ldquo;(<i>b</i>) in case the animal is not kept in an intensive unit, at intervals sufficient to avoid the animal being caused injury or unnecessary suffering.&rdquo;  I understand where the Minister is coming from on that point.  It appears that section 19, and I will get to section 20 in a minute, will result in burdensome paperwork and confusion over who is meant by the term &ldquo;competent person.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>There are two issues related to the inspection of equipment.  First, the competent person will inspect the equipment and there is duplication in section 19(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii)(I) and (II) which state: &ldquo;(I) if he or she is competent to do so, thoroughly inspect the equipment, or, (II) cause the equipment to be thoroughly inspected by a competent person.&rdquo;  Perhaps there is a rational explanation for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a brief question.  Throughout the legislation emphasis has been placed on agricultural animals.  I am not saying it does so exclusively but the main thrust of the legislation is about agricultural animals.  As the Minister is aware, certain sections relate to who is legally entitled to buy an animal, under or over a particular age, and there are provisions to ensure that the animals are properly maintained.  In the UK there is specific legislation for domestic pets.  It is my understanding, having talked to the Minister&rsquo;s officials, that domestic pets are covered by nearly all of this legislation.  A reference made to &ldquo;protected animals&rdquo; does not mean agricultural animals exclusively.  It also means others, particularly domestic pets.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s clarity in this regard.</P>
        <P>The only reason that I raise the issue is that in the UK, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, pet owners are now legally obliged to care for their pet properly &mdash; and most owners do so &mdash; by providing five basic needs.  They are as follows: somewhere suitable to live; a proper diet, including fresh water; the ability to express normal behaviour; for any need to be housed with, or apart from, other animals; and protection from, and treatment of, illness and injury.  Can the Minister assure us that the Bill will address those five basic needs even though they are not overtly stated?  Is he satisfied that they are?  Can he assure us that the proposed legislation covers domestic pets and the responsibilities placed on their owners?</P>
        <P>In this Bill there is a great deal of talk about cruelty to farm animals that might arise but some private citizens are far more cruel to their pets, even domestic pets.  Some of the siblings of those animals have got out of control in certain parts of the country.  Some people carry out the most obscene and obnoxious cruelty on dogs and cats.  The Minister or any of us in this House have nothing to fear from the farming organisation or industry when it comes to the protection and proper maintenance of animals.  They care for animals because they are closer to the land and understand nature.  I cannot remember any major examples of cruelty among the farming community.  There have been cases of cruelty by people who have purchased horses.  There is the odd exception to the rule.  Perhaps there have been extraneous reasons that animals have not been properly catered for but those are the exception rather than the rule.  That is why I raised the issue of placing obligations on domestic pet owners.  Is the Minister satisfied that they are covered by the legislation?</P>

	<P>That is all right.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</P>
        <P>I will make the opposite case to previous Senators.  The legislation is an example of good co-operation between the North and South because it is in line with the legislation in the North.   I often castigate certain Ministers for having little regard for what is happening in the North but I commend the Minister today because he does, on a regular basis, consult his counterpart in the North, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on these issues.  The legislation is also in line with international best practice.  Section 19 specifically deals with the inspection of protected animals and equipment and my party supports the retention of the section under those conditions.  The legislation brings us more in line with what is happening in the North and keeps us all singing off the same hymn sheet.  As the Minister has often stated, the latter is so important.  The agriculture industry blurs the Border much more than other industries and it is very important that we have good co-operation and that our legislation is brought in line as much as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will clarify a number of things.  The legislation is about all animals and that is the point.  It is about bringing all animals, whether they are domestic pets, companions or used on farms or for sports, under a common standard and set of rules that are required to outline how they should be protected and the responsibility that goes with ownership of an animal.</P>
        <P>The five freedoms referred to by the Senator are guiding lights for legislation such as this.  They are freedom from hunger, thirst and malnutrition; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour; and freedom from fear and distress.  They are international benchmarks in drafting codes of conduct and legislation on the protection of animals.  It is not a coincidence that they can be found on page 3 of the code of practice for the welfare of pigs which was published by the farm animal welfare advisory council which is linked to my Department.  Good work is ongoing in this area and farming organisations are at the heart of it.  Unfortunately, every now and again, we witness examples of malnutrition, cruelty or unacceptable animal husbandry practices on Irish farms, but they are becoming more rare.  The farming organisations have been up-front about trying to address and eradicate such behaviour.  Sometimes, for complex reasons, people are unable to look after their animals and that is when the State needs to step in and take action.  That is what the legislation is about.  If somebody has a pet at home that is being blatantly abused, that needs to be legislated for also.  Most important, when there is deliberate and flagrant abuse of animals, for example, throwing a cat on a bonfire or cutting the tendon of a horse as part of a family feud, there needs to be a legal framework in place to send a strong signal to those who may consider mutilation and so on that they are likely to end up in jail or face a massive fine.</P>
        <P>The section is very much about dealing with intensive farming, predominantly pigs and poultry.  The Senator referred to additional bureaucracy and form filling, but what we are doing is repeating the current legislative provisions in the Bill.  We are, therefore, not introducing anything new.  The section he proposes to delete is contained in the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984, one of many Acts we are trying to amalgamate in this legislation.  We are reinforcing current legislation and not adding anything new, which makes sense.  If somebody keeps pigs or poultry in intensive housing units, he or she has a responsibility to check them once a day to make sure their welfare is monitored.  Under current legislation, he or she also has an obligation to record this in a recording system in the same way as a fisherman has a responsibility to record catches.  There is an obligation on those who intensively farm and have responsibility for thousands of animals, particularly in the poultry industry, to inspect and record the condition of the animals in their care.  Therefore, I am restating what is in place; there is no new additional form filling or bureaucracy.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>The Minister has stated legislation has been in place since 1984.  It seems many records must be kept.  Does the section apply to intensive housing units for cattle and sheep?  It refers to individual records.  Does this mean a record must be kept for each animal?  If there are 5,000 pigs or chickens in an intensive housing unit or 1,000 sheep or bullocks, does a record need to be kept for each of them?  If that has been the case since 1984, I am not sure it has been fully implemented.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>A protected animal is defined as &ldquo; . . . an animal of a kind commonly kept for farming, recreational, domestic or sporting purposes on the island of Ireland . . . when it is in the possession or under the control of a human being, whether permanently or on a temporary basis or not living in a wild state . . .&rdquo;.  In other words, the animal must be in captivity.  An intensive housing unit is defined as &ldquo;a premises on which farm animals are kept under the husbandry system for the purpose of providing for the care of the animal on automatic equipment to such an extent that a failure of that equipment would, if it were not rectified or if some alternative arrangements were not made for the care of the animal contained therein, cause the animal unnecessary suffering&rdquo;.  The inspections ensure the feeding and water systems are working and cover poultry units, intensive piggeries and so on.  Farmers with slatted sheds should not have a concern.  I will examine the issues raised by the Senator, but unless officials got the legislation wrong in 1984, there will not be a problem.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for bringing forward this Bill and all of the officials for the substantial research work that went into it.  As we acknowledged on Second Stage, there has been an immense and time-consuming endeavour in compiling the contents of the legislation.  I have long been an advocate of codifying our legal system, statutes and criminal law system.  Several former Ministers for Justice and Equality, including John O&rsquo;Donoghue, a former colleague of mine at third level, and Dermot Ahern, had a keen interest in upgrading the law.  When we look through the list of obscure items of legislation dating back hundreds of years, we realise what a comprehensive job has been done.  This exercise was of great academic interest to me because of my area of study in college many years ago.  However, there are also significant practical advantages to this codification effort in that it will make the law more accessible to legislators, academics and the general public.  A great deal of time-consuming work has been done behind the scenes and has often gone unnoticed.  On Second Stage the Minister of State referred to the research facilities of the House of Lords and the House of Commons.  It is interesting to hear that there is such co-operation.  The Bill is a positive step in an ongoing process of consolidation that offers significant benefits, both academic and practical.</P>

	<P>I am loath to repeat what has been said, but a body of work of this quantity and displaying such a level of expertise must be acknowledged.  I am sure officials spent many a long, dark and lonely night battling the difficulties presented not only by archaic language but also by archaic print and binding.  The Bill is reflective of an ongoing task of legacy work that requires a great deal of time and effort.  Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan referred to King George III during the Second Stage debate.  Having just read an interesting book on that monarch, I am pleased to inform the Senator that the first Irish republic was the republic of Wexford.</P>

This consolidation effort is something I welcome both as a practising barrister and as a legislator.  As I observed last week, it is one of the largest such reforms that has taken place anywhere in the world.  It is good to see Ireland leading the way in this area.</P>

	<P>I thank colleagues on all sides of the House for their helpful contributions to what was a particularly useful Second Stage debate.  The range of experience in this House was of great benefit in accommodating the passage of the Bill.  It is only when one goes through the list of Acts and Private Bills, retained and repealed, as set out in Schedules 1 and 2, that one can appreciate the amount of work done and the time and resources involved.  Each item of legislation set out in the Schedules, those we are retaining and repealing, required a detailed forensic analysis of whether it had merit today, had prescribed rights and so on.  It is only when one sees all of the Acts together that one gets a sense of the colossal amount of work that has been done within the various Departments.  As I said on Second Stage, this work is ongoing.  After this part of the work, as represented by the Bill, has been brought to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for ratification, we will move on.  </P>
        <P>Members rightly observed last week that a great body of work remained to be done in ascertaining the relevance and applicability of legislation implemented after independence.  I very much take the point that in any regulatory environment legislators have a responsibility, in the first instance, to create good law that is straightforward and easy to understand.</P>
        <P>They also have a responsibility to codify the law and make sure it is in a standard format in order that every citizen and practitioner, whether legal or non-legal, can understand the position on any aspect of Irish life.  This revision lends itself to Ireland improving its position in the world because we are standardising many legislative provisions that have become obsolete and irrelevant in modern Irish life.  I am indebted to the House for once again showing its worth and highlighting the strong cross-party expertise applied when Bills of this nature are discussed.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes the decision of the Government to conduct a competitive process for award of a licence to operate the National Lottery over a 20 year period;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> considers the National Lottery one of the most valued resources owned and funded by the Irish people; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> therefore calls on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to make proposals to Government to reconsider this decision.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister has declared his intention to open to bids the licence to operate the national lottery.  The purchase of the lottery licence for 20 years will deliver money necessary for the children&rsquo;s hospital or maybe other matters, but it surely will deliver a great deal of money.</P>
        <P>The Minister has also assured us that funding for good causes will be ring-fenced.  Some 30.5% of the profits from the national lottery will continue to go to good causes.  This is good news for the country and it is a great story all round, with no cost to anyone.  I am not so sure.</P>
        <P>First, I thank the Minister for coming into the House today.  I want to speak to him with respect to his office, his ability, his talent and his attention.  Unfortunately, I am strongly of the view that his intention to sell the operating licence for the national lottery is unthinking.  I would go so far as to say it is &ldquo;unethical&rdquo; and I will tell him why.</P>
        <P>I respectfully suggest with dignity that the operating licence for the national lottery is not the Minister&rsquo;s to sell.  It is not the Taoiseach&rsquo;s to sell, it is not mine to sell and it is not ours to sell.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The electricity grids may be, aspects of Coillte may be, gas basins may be, electric cables may be but the lottery is not.  Everything about the national lottery is fuelled, furnished, finance, stocked, sourced, owned and possessed by the Irish people.  It is ours.  In every way it can be defined and in every which way we can argue it, it is ours.  It belongs to us, lock, stock and barrel.  It derives from us, it originates from us and it exists because of our individual voluntary pockets and purses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national lottery has done its job well over the past 25 years.  In 2011, &euro;231.9 million was used by the Government for good causes.  In the past 25 years &euro;12 billion has been made in sales, &euro;3.9 billion of which was for good causes.  This is a good thing.</P>
        <P>Online sales are seen as the new big cash cow.  We know this from lotteries all over the world.  How come it is seen as the easy way of delivering huge new profits?  If it was that easy, why has it not been easy for the national lottery in Ireland?  Surely, it cannot be the case that the Government plans to lift all sorts of restrictions around online sales just in time for an international owner to come in and to benefit.</P>
        <P>In 1997, there was a report of the review group on the national lottery.  The group made ten recommendations.  I will not read them out.  One of the recommendations suggested that the most disadvantaged groups within the voluntary and community sector should be given priority in the allocation of lottery funds.  The ESRI backed this up in 2007 because it was the poor, the less educated, the less well-off and the disadvantaged who bought most of the lottery tickets.</P>
        <P>In my first speech in the Seanad, I asked the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, how he was going to alter and change this forever in the distribution of arts and cultural funds and how the disadvantaged could get to the top of the queue, or at least in a parallel queue, when it came to grants.  The benefits are not shared equitably.  It is merely another case of the great transfer con, but I did not get an answer.</P>
        <P>This selling of the national lottery licence is a human equality rights issue and it is preparatory to the core of my argument.  As Irish people, we own and fund the lottery.  All the money from the lottery derives and originates from Ireland.  It is ours entirely, absolutely, directly and voluntarily, and it belongs personally, privately and publicly to each citizen of this country.</P>
        <P>It is now being suggested that we sell the licence for 20 years to anybody who can come up with approximately &euro;500 million for the children&rsquo;s hospital and, of course, to answer Government requirements.  The sale of the licence to operate the lottery will deliver funding of &euro;300 million, &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million.  Those who would put up that kind of money are buyers who expect a significant profit from the licence over the next 20 years.  There is no way anyone pays out such an amount of money for an asset unless he or she expects that asset in time to make a handsome profit.  We know what the lottery makes because it is ours, and I have stated it.</P>
        <P>This is the core of the argument.  Those who will provide this great new operator, portrayed as a kind of a saviour to the Irish people, with that tidy profit will be the Irish people.  It will be mostly the poor, the less educated and the disadvantaged, returning to the ESRI argument and the great con transfer.  Once again, within the lottery, the Irish people will put their hands in their pockets, take out their euro, buy their scratch cards, Lotto and Lotto Millions, and create a lottery pie, only from now on a great big slice of the pie will go straight into the coffers of the licence owner, whose sole reason for being involved is to make money for itself.  It will be, once again, the greatest transfer of wealth from the pockets of the poor to the pursuit of privatisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not make any sense to put the lottery up for sale.  It is our greatest and most valuable worthwhile resource, and why sell it?</P>
        <P>I put it to Senators that we would be better selling the Book of Kells.  If we were to sell the Book of Kells to some museum in Australia, Canada or London for &euro;500 million, we could come home and put that money in our pocket.  We might have fewer Americans around but we would still have the &euro;500 million in our pockets.  If we sell the lottery for &euro;500 million to a person, an organisation, a syndicate, a cash-rich and ready offshore pension fund, a wealthy billionaire or a parallel lottery organisation in some other country which may buy it for &euro;300 million, &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million, that will not be the end of it.  We will give back millions of euro in interest, over and above any lottery profit, and we will do so for 20 years.  We will be paying, out of the pockets of the Irish people, interest on what belongs to us, what we own and what we fund ourselves, and I cannot think of anything more unethical.  We will be giving away our lottery licence to strangers and paying them to take the money out of our pockets.</P>
        <P>It is not in the Minister&rsquo;s gift to sell the lottery to anybody but the Irish to run it.  It is only in his gift to keep the lottery and ensure it is kept and controlled under the umbrella of the Government of the Irish people.</P>
        <P>One of the big moments of his reassurance has been that we need not worry, that the cash for good causes will be ring-fenced.  Some 30.5% of sales will be ring-fenced for good causes.  Is the Minister sure it is that simple?  Is he quite sure that he can slap down that stipulation and not upset the balance of the different games?  Is he quite sure about that calculation?</P>
        <P>The Minister may find a buyer who is sufficiently cash rich and ready to pay up for this licence &mdash; a pension fund in another country prepared to hold out for some time for the great day when the profit comes home.  He may portray all of this as a kind of triumph but no matter how long a potential buyer might have to wait for a big profit, the only reason a buyer will buy this licence is because in time that buyer will get a huge profit.  That profit will come from one place &mdash; the pockets and the dreams of the Irish people.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is incumbent on the Minister to sit down with as many people as he needs, including me, to come up with creative ideas to find the money to build the children&rsquo;s hospital.  I have plenty of ideas as to how he might do that.  I suggest we borrow the money ourselves, and we might start with Mr. Boucher in Bank of Ireland to which we gave &euro;3.75 billion, and whom we have not seen since.  If the Minister wants to ring-fence something, why not ask the Irish people to ring-fence a particular draw on a Wednesday night for the children&rsquo;s hospital and I guarantee he might have the money within six years.  That way he would keep the lottery within the control of the State and the people who own it and its profits.</P>
        <P>My argument is not about transparency, about where the Exchequer begins and lottery gifts end or about the disadvantaged, although they have a huge part to play.  It is about the thoughtlessness of selling the national lottery on the basis of a 20-year contract, without having identified a more creative way to find the money necessary to fund the children&rsquo;s hospital project.  What I am concerned about is Irish people&rsquo;s pockets being pilfered in order to bolster the profits of others.</P>
        <P>The national lottery is the greatest gift the disadvantaged and the poor could give to the State.  It is rather like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral in New York, which was built with the pennies of the poor.  It is a gift to the State and it is in the Government&rsquo;s gift not to sell it.  The Government has the power to ensure that everything it does in respect of the licensing, operation and profits relating to the lottery parallels the gift to which I refer.  The Government also has the power to ensure that the licence remains within the control of the State and that the profits relating to the lottery remain in the pockets of all Irish citizens.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I second the motion.  All I have to say in respect of Senator O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s contribution is &ldquo;Follow that&rdquo;.  I thank the Senator for the work she has done in bringing this motion before the House.  I welcome the Minister and I hope he will be in a position to address our concerns in respect of the proposed sale of the national lottery.</P>
        <P>When times are tough it is all too simple for governments to take the easy option, the one which generates much-needed revenue to cut the gap between what we spend and what we receive and which, at the same time, inflicts little or no pain on the electorate.  It is for this reason that the prospect of selling the family silver always arises in the midst of a recession.  Is this a good time to sell when, in the context of the economy, we are at the bottom of the market?  It is generally accepted that one should buy at the bottom of the market and sell at the top.  The national lottery is a profitable institution and is not draining the State of resources.  What research has been undertaken with regard to the sale of national lotteries in other countries?  How was revenue maximised from such sales?</P>
        <P>Our national lottery is most certainly not at the top of the market at present.  The An Post National Lottery Company&rsquo;s results show that recent sales have decreased by 1.4% in comparison with the figure for 2010.  The company&rsquo;s sales stand at &euro;761 million in what it describes, in light of a 5% decrease in footfall, as a very challenging retail environment.  In the current economic climate, there is a need for the Government &mdash; now more than ever &mdash; to get more for less.  If we are going to sell this national, income-producing lottery, then we must obtain cast-iron assurances that we will get a good price for it.</P>
        <P>The second issue which it is exceptionally important for the Government to address is the impact of the sale of the national lottery on the small news agencies, post offices and convenience stores throughout the country.  We are all only too well aware of the tough economic climate in which small business people are operating at present.  The national lottery machine in local shops acts as a critical driver of footfall and increases the amount of business transacted.  When the national lottery licence is sold to a private bidder and as is the case with any commercial enterprise, an assessment will be carried out in respect of maximising the profitability of the operation of the licence.  As has been indicated, a minimum of 30% of the revenue of the national lottery will be ring-fenced by the Minister in respect of charitable causes.  That is the same amount that was donated to good causes in 2011.  We welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in this regard because it relates to a vital source of community funding and reflects one of the founding principles of the national lottery.</P>
        <P>I understand that the relevant legislation contains a requirement to the effect that a minimum amount of the revenue received from the sale of national lottery products, some 40%, be returned to the purchasers in the form of prizes.  This means that the remaining 30% of revenue is split between meeting the operational costs of the national lottery and paying the profits of the company charged with running it.  Therefore, it stands to reason that the actual impact of the sale of the licence will be on the operational side.  As a result, the operator will seek to reduce the margin which small retailers receive in order to increase its own profits.  This margin, which currently stands at 6%, makes a valuable contribution.  The Minister should bear in mind that in 2010 revenue from lottery sales contributed &euro;48 million to the overall profits of small local newsagents, post offices and shops.  Many of these businesses are already teetering on the precipice of financial sustainability and they have little or no bargaining power when it comes to negotiating margins in respect of the operation of national lottery machines.  I plead with the Minister that if he is going to sell the national lottery to put in place some form of safeguard in order to protect the margins of the local businesses that are the life and soul of our country.</P>
        <P>When embarking on the process of selling the lottery, the Minister should bear in mind that the public&rsquo;s perception of it is that it is something of a slush fund used by politicians to finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;local golf courses, sports clubs, schools, etc.  If members of the public were asked to name a project of national or international importance funded by the national lottery, they would be unable to identify one.  There is no equivalent to Sydney Opera House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the Senator&rsquo;s pardon but I must refer to Wexford Opera House in this regard.  Does that project not qualify?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that and I accept that Wexford Opera House was constructed using lottery funding.  The finest and closest example of how to run a lottery is in the UK, where profits are paid into designated trusts and thereby protected from political interference.  Unfortunately, that is not the position in Ireland.  More often than not, the organisations that regularly receive national lottery funding in this country can be traced back to the constituencies of the holders of ministerial office.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that any of the companies which are likely or possible buyers for the national lottery will be happy to operate in a climate where profits are distributed at the whim of politicians because this will always impede their marketing campaigns to harvest a greater spend by the public at large.  I fully acknowledge that the Government is linking the sale of the national lottery to the funding of the new national&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s hospital.  As someone with a keen and passionate interest in the welfare of children, I accept that there will potentially be an alternative cost if we do not sell the national lottery.  If the choice is between just these two alternatives, then the hospital must be built.  However, like Senator O&rsquo;Donnell, I would like to be in the room with the Minister when this matter is dealt with because we have many ideas in respect of other alternatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Governance is all about the art of making choices.  I firmly believe that there is never a situation in which there are only two choices.  It is for this reason that I would like the Minister to give further considerations to the options available in respect of raising money in order to discover whether there are any which will not have as negative an impact in the overall context as selling the national lottery.  If the plan to sell is to proceed, then I urge him to endeavour to incorporate as many safeguards as possible in the licence in the interests of protecting the margins paid to the local shops and news agents in which national lottery machines are located.  I ask him to examine ways to ensure that local shops, particularly those in rural areas with low population densities, will not be deprived of their lottery machines.  The removal of such machines would, of course, result in lower overall maintenance costs for the operating company.  The businesses to which I refer will serve as low-hanging fruit in the context of driving the profit margins of the purchaser of the national lottery.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to bear in mind that in the context of the charitable and community ethos which has surrounded the national lottery in Ireland since its inception, it can prove all too easy to adopt a numbers-only approach and refer to this as a &ldquo;business-minded approach&rdquo; to government.  In light of the drive towards efficiency and reform, we need to consider the impact of the sale of assets in its totality.  We must take into account not just the immediate monetary impact but also the many and varying ripple effects while will occur as a result of the sale.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply in respect of the issues I have outlined.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is a pleasure to follow Senators Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien and Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell.  I must be honest and state that Senator O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s contribution sounded great but there was really nothing in it.  I am surprised by that fact.  The reality is that the licence to run the national lottery is going to public tender.  This is no different to the position with any other licence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Donnell, please respect the Chair.  You will have the right of reply.  What you have raised is not a point of order.  I call Senator D&rsquo;Arcy.  Did you move the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did.  Why are we here?  We are here as a result of a motion.  The Minister has been clear.  A tender process must be adhered to and it is a matter of law that the process is adhered to.  We are also here as a result of choice.  We have had this discussion in the Chamber previously.  The choice is about whether we are required to move State assets that we can move today, if necessary.  We have held a debate with Senator Barrett on the importance or otherwise of certain assets.  We are not selling a lottery.  We are putting up a licence for tender.  That is an important aspect that we cannot simply ignore.  I agree with some of the points made.  The "slushfundability" of the way the sports capital programme operated was disgraceful and appalling but, if memory serves me correctly, there has not been a sports capital application since 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>What did Senator D&rsquo;Arcy say?  Slush fund what?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Slush fund ability.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien knows what I mean.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not been available since 2008.  Today, the funds or moneys go mainly to the HSE and the Department of Health.  We have a choice to try to build the children&rsquo;s hospital.  This is one funding aspect.  Can we do it?  When the tenders come back we will see within a matter of months how much money is to be returned under the tender and licensing arrangements.  We are not shutting down the RTE concert orchestra or selling the National Gallery.  Reference was made to sales in the area of the arts.  We are not selling the Book of Kells.  No one has mentioned that.  Anyway, I do not imagine the State owns it; it probably belongs to Trinity College.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I never said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>We must make choices.  We have come to the Chamber on many occasions and agreed and disagreed.  If this is how the children&rsquo;s hospital gets built, it is a choice I am prepared to make.  I do not care which licence we put up for tender or who disagrees with it.</P>
        <P>The use of the phrase &ldquo;a great con&rdquo; was ridiculous and over the top.  We must advance this project as quickly as possible.  The children&rsquo;s hospital has been delayed for many reasons.  Many people were shocked and horrified at the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la but we must get on with it.  This is a method of funding the hospital and I fully agree with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to bring some calm to the proceedings.  The Minister is welcome back.  It is always good to see him in the House.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donnell for bringing the motion to House.  It is important we debate properly the issues of whether people agree and whether it is simply the sale of a licence or the sale of the lottery.  This is something I have called for consistently with regard to the sale of State assets.  Far from being ridiculous and far from there being nothing in Senator O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s speech, this Private Members&rsquo; motion affords an opportunity for us to discuss in a calm and collected way the merits or otherwise of selling the lottery licence.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments with regard to the tendering process.  I have, however, weighed up the issues and, as currently structured, the proposal is not how I would go about selling the licence.  There are other options.  It is linked.  There is a big and important carrot, namely, the children&rsquo;s hospital, which we are all keen to see advanced as quickly as possible.  I genuinely wish the Government well in this regard and I hope we move quickly towards selecting a site, getting on with it and building it.  Figures have been bandied about concerning the upfront sale.  Obviously, it has not been put out to tender but I assume the Government will set a minimum reserve on this as well, should it proceed in this way, which I hope the Government does not do.  I have examined the figures.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien raised several interesting points.  At the moment An Post charges approximately 0.5% of turnover, which is substantial.  Last year&rsquo;s figures were in the region of &euro;761 million.  How will any private operator make any money out of it?  People have raised figures suggesting that the handling fee would have to rise to 6%.  If the Government gets an upfront payment of between &euro;300 and &euro;400 million, on the basis of the sales we have seen when they are averaged out, a private operator is likely to receive in the region of &euro;50 million per year.  As far as I am concerned, that is easy money.  If it is a question that the handling charge is 0.5% with An Post at the moment, why does the Government not make a decision to increase it and keep the licence in Government ownership?  The Government should proceed in that way and let people know the fee will be increased from 0.5% to 1% or 2% or whatever.  I am keen to hear a response to that proposal.  Were the Minister to ring-fence some of the lotto games and draws and make clear they were for the children&rsquo;s hospital, people would buy into it.  I realise there would be a downside for the Government.  It would not get a large sum of money upfront which would enable it to build the children&rsquo;s hospital.  However, I do not believe there has been enough discussion of the sale of the lotto and the concerns raised by RGDATA and Tara Buckley about the impact it would have on more than 4,000 small retailers throughout the country.  By the way, no one has mentioned the 100 staff.  While it may appear to be a small number, a total of almost 100 staff work directly in the An Post National Lottery Company.  What will their position be should the licence be sold by the Government?  There are many unanswered questions.</P>
        <P>Senator D&rsquo;Arcy commented on the slush fund ability of the capital sports programme.  That is rather amazing.  I take it from Senator D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s comments that neither he nor any of his Government colleagues will make any representations whatsoever to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, with regard to the next round of the sports capital programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I will assist in this regard by proceeding with a freedom of information request at the right time to determine whether any Government party Members have made any representations for any sports clubs or community groups.  Senator D&rsquo;Arcy should note that there is nothing wrong with this approach.  What if he sees value in a project in County Wexford, for example, one relating to the Wexford Opera House or Wexford Youths Football Club?  In my case, a proposal was made relating to the cricket grounds in Malahide.  Malahide now has the only international ground in Ireland thanks to the sports capital grant.  We will play the first game on it in June this year.  To be serious, a &euro;500,000 capital sports grant means the money would stay within the community and 15,000 people can attend international cricket games in Malahide.  However, there are further knock-on effects of such investments in the community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not my criticism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I have certain concerns in this regard.  The reason I raise the issue is that I am unsure how the Government will ensure, once the licence goes into private ownership, that 30.5% will go to good causes? How will it be monitored in future?  Will there be any Government oversight of the operation or will there be a situation like that involving the HSE whereby the Government cannot answer questions on it because it is not the immediate responsibility of the relevant Minister?  Will a Department pass on any questions to a given lotto regulator which would be the only body in a position to answer any questions?  That would involve setting up such a body at arms length from the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Some valid questions remain to be answered.  I am rather surprised at the response of Senator D&rsquo;Arcy to Senator O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s opening remarks.  They were rather thought provoking, well put together and well meaning.  We should not rush into the sale of any State assets.  I wish to put on the record of the House that the original memorandum of understanding signed by the previous Government made no commitment with regard to figures, sales or the fire sale of any State assets.  The revised memorandum of understanding referred to the sale of non-strategic State assets.  I call on the Minister to consider the hundreds of charities throughout the country.  These charities are strategic in their communities.  Those are the charities and community groups that have been funded by the lotto.</P>
        <P>I remind Members this is not a frivolous motion, although I accept the Minister is not viewing it as such.  It deals with a serious issue that will have a knock-on effect.  If this proceeds and God forbid ten years from now we are not hitting the 30% target for good causes, others in this House and in the other House will ask us why we made this decision to sell on the licence for 20 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be in the House and thank Members for the invitation.  I am always impressed by the passion with which Senator O&rsquo;Donnell presents any case, and tonight&rsquo;s presentation is no less.  I almost always believe she speaks sense.  I disagree with her on this issue and I want to explain the reason.</P>
        <P>There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what is actually for sale.  What is for sale is the licence to run a lotto in Ireland.  It is not the Book of Kells.  It is a licence, in the same way as we sold off mobile telephony licences last year.  It is a licence which we are obliged, under European law, to put out to tender.  We are doing something that has happened since the lotto was instituted, and I remember it.  The last two times it happened, An Post won the competition and it may well win this competition.  It is not going out of State ownership.  It is a licence to broadcast and use mobile telephony and broadband.  These are State assets that are put out to tender under European law in a procurement process that is open to all.</P>
        <P>In terms of what is different about this one, there are two fundamental differences.  The first is that because of the incredibly difficult financial position the State is in, we must have as much upfront payment as we can, first, to meet infrastructural demand such as the national children&rsquo;s hospital that people have talked about since I was in the Department of Health.  We want to merge the children&rsquo;s hospitals, to have one flagship.  Second, we want to get people back to work and stimulate as many construction projects as possible.  This is only one of the stimulus packages I am trying to leverage.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator O&rsquo;Brien, I was in Brussels last week where I met Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn and Commissioner Hahn to discuss a variety of issues.  I also met the principal of the European Investment Bank to leverage more investment into this economy because we want to get as many projects as we can.  I will come back to the House in detail about those projects as soon as they have shaped up.</P>
        <P>In terms of what is at stake here, there is a fundamental misunderstanding.  We are not selling off anything or handing it over from the State.  We are doing what we have always done.  We are putting up for open tendering, as we are obliged to do, to determine who will run the lotto in the best interests of the State and its people.  There are conditions attached to that which I will outline but one of the conditions is that we will set all of this out in law.  I will come back to the House to give Members a line by line analysis of what we need to do, which we will frame in law.  A total of 30.5% of the income of the lotto will be ring-fenced by law to good causes.  It will not be a matter for dispute.  I picked that figure because that was the outturn figure for last year.</P>
        <P>In terms of fears people may have of an impact on retailers, and Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s contribution was passionate in that regard, that is something that must be safeguarded.  People talk about rushing in.  I announced this last November.  We have taken the most careful due diligence in regard to this process.  We met representatives of RGDATA, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents and the Convenience Stores &amp; Newsagents Association, and I understand fully their concerns.  I will now say something to this House that I have not said to them.  I intend to safeguard their margins in the legislation as well.  That is important for them to know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not told them that yet because we have not yet put the shape of the legislation together.  We will safeguard the retailers.  We will promote the lotto.</P>
        <P>I had a private discussion about this with Senator O&rsquo;Donnell <i>en marge</i> of this House.  At the heart of this is a visceral concern about the lotto as a concept.  We had a strong debate on the idea of the State promoting a lotto to fund itself or any part of its own services because it is taking advantage of people&rsquo;s desperation for wealth in some instances, but it is the same as putting a few bob on the horses occasionally, and I do not believe we will outlaw gambling on horses.  Mature citizens are entitled to gamble, and it is better if it is done in a regulated way.  It is better also if, by and large, the proceeds of it go to good causes and to the State.</P>
        <P>The two fundamental differences in this process over what happened in the past are, first, we are looking for an upfront payment because we need it desperately in the terrible times we are in and, second, the duration of the lotto licence will be longer.  The second facilitates the first.  Having a longer-term licence means that we can leverage more money upfront.  Considerable technology is invested in establishing a lotto, and all these things must be renewed.  They have approximately a ten year lifespan and are very expensive.  The longer the lotto is allowed to operate, therefore, the better value it is because less money is gobbled up with technology by handing it over to a new operator.</P>
        <P>I said that on the previous two occasions this was tendered for and An Post won.  I understand from An Post that it will be a tenderer.  I will be impartial in that regard.  It is not my business and I should have no view about who comes out the winner in a fair procurement system but I am aware there were other tenderers on the previous occasion, one of which was the Swiss lotto company.  This is nothing different from what happened previously and I assure the House, particularly those who are passionate about this, that all concerns will be taken into account.  When we shape the legislation I will bring it before the House and if Members can find loopholes or difficulties in it that I or the Government have not seen, I assure them I will have an open ear to their concerns.</P>
        <P>I will deal with some final points.  Senator O&rsquo;Donnell probably has a niggling view of the value of a lotto in supporting State coffers, but that is something about which we might have a separate debate.  Legislation will determine the regime.  The amount we will get for good causes will be ring-fenced.  I will ensure retailers continue to enjoy a fair margin in regard to it.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien should be aware we are not selling off the family silver.  We are doing what we normally do in any tendering process that we are obliged to undertake by European law, and if I was handing it out without a tendering process, I would be in here answering a different set of questions.</P>
        <P>In terms of the use of funds, I mentioned the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  An important but separate issue has been raised, which we might address separately, which is the way those funds, which are a considerable portion of moneys, are distributed and whether it is done in a fair and impartial way.  That is a stand-alone issue that I am willing to determine how we can address separately.  I do not believe political decisions by nature are always somehow biased and wrong and that there is some tribunal or body of people who are above reproach and will always make righteous decisions, but we must have transparency in this regard, and I am happy to come back to that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien referred to the way we will get at the upfront payment.  In truth, the more we ring-fence the other elements of it, the more we squeeze the upfront payment.  As we do in determining the other assets we are bringing to the market, when the State is in such dire straits, we have tested the market to ensure there is a robust interest in anything we put in the market.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien said we should not do it right now.  Unfortunately, the ship needs bailing out.  We cannot wait for it.  The children of Ireland need their hospital.  We cannot postpone that for better times because we do not know when the better times will come.  We must make the best use of the assets we have right now.  There will be no fire sale of any assets, and I am convinced we will get a robust response to this process.  It will be strictly regulated by law, and in terms of legislation I will bring to this House, I will have an open ear to any amendments or suggestions Members might wish to make.  I have asked my departmental officials to deal specifically with the staff of the national lottery.  We have not determined how that will be done, but I do not wish to spell it out yet because it would compromise our negotiations.  The very competent staff of my Department are also exploring in great detail how we can safeguard minors and others from being exploited in any new licensing regime and how we should deal with retailers.</P>
        <P>Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell have kindly offered to come forward with suggestions on how we can raise money.  I have open ears, if anybody has suggestions to make.  The country desperately needs money, not only for the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital but also for other health projects, school projects and all the things we would love to be able to do to drive job creation, growth and development in the economy.  I have an open office to hear ideas Members may have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister and a number of elements of his contribution, particularly his commitment to bring the Bill to this House, the fact that he is open to suggestions from Members of this House and the guarantee of fairness.  I may not always agree with him, but I know that he is both fair-minded and decent.</P>
        <P>The Wexford Opera House was not built, rather it was refurbished.  It was a very good job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was built from scratch.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must come and visit it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have visited it.  I was going to say how impressed I was with how they had remodelled the building.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Remodelled from scratch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister is the local involved, I will not waste too much time on the issue.  I also enjoyed his wonderful mixed metaphors about the ship of State needing to be bailed out and then building a children&rsquo;s hospital on it.  I do not think I would build a children&rsquo;s hospital on a ship that was sinking.</P>
        <P>The Minister has said this is something absolutely routine; why, therefore, do we need new legislation?  Why do we refer to the extraordinarily difficult economic position and use words such as &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; and so on?  Clearly, there is something new.  A linguistic analysis of what the Minister has said will show that there is something new happening.  There is no question or doubt about it.</P>
        <P>The national lottery is a success story, of which I am part because I have contributed to it since it started.  I am a lottery addict.  I have won three times &mdash; &euro;11, &euro;17 and &euro;400 &mdash; and estimate my investment at about &euro;15,000.  I regard it as a form of tax and I am delighted with most of the places to where the money goes, but I do remember analysing on one occasion and discovering that in every single county the largest beneficiary was the GAA.  I was not sure how appropriate that was.  Perhaps it was, but the GAA already has very substantial sources of income and I would prefer to see the money going to organisations which are less well resourced.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell on a brilliant, eloquent and witty speech.  It was superb and a credit to this House.  I do not think her friend, Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, need to feel diffident in seconding it.  She raised another important issue, namely, that of small traders and post offices.  We must put the human element first.  That is what is wrong all over Europe &mdash; we have put the preservation of the system before the general interests of the community.</P>
        <P>This is not about selling the family silver, although I wish to God it was, as we could always buy more silver.  It is much more like selling one of the tractors on a farm that is barely able to keep going.  This is an income generating system and a licence to print money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are getting a measly sum of less than one third from it, which is extraordinary.  If we can make so much money out of it, why does the Government not nationalise it?  Why are we so stupid?  Are we telling the international community that we are lazy, stupid, thick and inefficient; that we cannot even run our own lottery and that if it does it for us, we will give it shovel loads of money?  That is what is behind the thinking.  This is very important because the proceeds from the national lottery are used to fund all kinds of projects.  It funds sports projects, the Arts Council, the national theatre and various other projects.  Therefore, it is something to be treasured.</P>
        <P>I counsel my friends and colleagues on the other side of the House to vote with us.  Their proposal has reasonable qualities, but the amendment tabled by the Government is appalling.  It welcomes the decision to sell the national lottery, recognises its major achievements &mdash; the only part of the amendment with which I agree &mdash; and welcomes the terms laid down of the next licensing agreement.  Should we welcome the fact that we receive less than one third of the proceeds?  I am not going to welcome it.  If the Minister does, shame on him.  He has told us how poor the country is.  He is like an old one saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit me with the baby in me arms.&rdquo;  He is also bringing the children&rsquo;s hospital into it.  He always does this.</P>

	<P>The Minister is right, it is.  Children are always introduced as a defence.  The children&rsquo;s hospital will be built and I do not think selling off the national lottery is a fit excuse for it.  This idea is included in the motion and the Minister&rsquo;s speech.</P>
        <P>The motion should have the support of the House.  There should be a free vote on it.  The national lottery belongs to the people.  I do not believe there is nothing new in the proposal.  It is regrettable that the children&rsquo;s hospital has been dragged into the equation.</P>

	<P>I can take it.  I will start with another great word used by Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, &ldquo;slushfundability&rdquo;, which Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien has difficulty in understanding.  To illustrate what Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy meant by it, I can point to a certain boathouse in the constituency of a former Minister with responsibility for sport that cost so much it would probably have been cheaper to build the ships rather than the boathouse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should look at the sports capital grants allocated to County Mayo this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>There are also anomalies in the proportion of funding allocated to certain counties such as Donegal, Offaly and Kildare.  I must acknowledge a certain former Minister in Waterford who resisted the temptation to do so.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s reference to freedom of information requests has given me an idea to submit some requests covering the last few years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national lottery reached a significant milestone in 2008, when the cumulative funds raised for good causes reached the figure of &euro;3 billion, which increased to &euro;4 billion in 2011.  This is an enormous amount of money and the good done is probably incalculable since the national lottery was established 25 years ago.  Most people are familiar with the benefits accruing in the areas of sport and recreation which come within the remit of the sports capital grants section, but not so many know about the benefits accruing in other areas such as youth, health, welfare, the arts, culture, national heritage and the Irish language.  There is not a single community which has not benefited from the national lottery.  We can all agree that this is a valuable resource for every community and that whatever we do, we must ensure this element of the programme is protected.  I am sure this has been factored in.</P>
        <P>The scale of the operation of the national lottery cannot be underestimated.  In 2011, in the middle of the worst financial crisis ever to hit the country, &euro;761 million was raised by national lottery products, of which &euro;423 million was awarded in prizes.  To put this in perspective, this morning, NAMA announced a stimulus package of &euro;2 billion, yet three quarters of a billion euro is recycled into the economy every year by the national lottery.  This illustrates the public good done by the national lottery.</P>
        <P>We note that the national lottery in the United Kingdom has been run by a private company for the past 17 years.  The licence there comes up for renewal at regular intervals and is put out to tender, subject to the same strict legal requirements proposed for Ireland.  The Government is proposing to put the national lottery out to tender for a longer period than in the United Kingdom.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that.  I wonder why the longer period is deemed more appropriate here.</P>
        <P>I also note that the company running the UK national lottery is specifically charged with maximising returns to society in the most responsible and cost effective way.  National lotteries are seen as good investments, as has been noted by other speakers.  Their benefits are often compared with those of running public utility companies.  This is due to the regular income streams generated by lotteries.  It is interesting to note that the owner of the operating company in the United Kingdom is the Ontario Teachers&rsquo; Pension Plan.  That lottery provides regular steady and not exorbitant profits.  If there were exorbitant profits to be made from lotteries, pension plans would be outbid by hedge funds for the contracts to run them.  The responsible running of the lottery in the UK is seen to be a good thing.</P>
        <P>The figures quoted by Senator O&rsquo;Brien may not be fully correct.  A breakdown of the revenue and cost of the lottery in the UK is as follows.  For every pound collected, 50 pence goes to the prize fund, 28 pence to good causes, compared with 30% in Ireland, 12 pence goes to the UK Government, five pence to the retailer and five pence to the operators, of which four and a half pence goes in operating costs, leaving a profit of half a penny per pound.  That is not an exorbitant profit, but it is being claimed by some speakers that we are proposing to sell the national lottery licence to a gang of multinational speculators who are coming into the country to asset strip the lotto, and perhaps asset strip the country.  That is not the case.  That kind of hyperbole is no more than scaremongering or misunderstanding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been involved in many community projects that received support from the national lottery and I am acutely aware that virtually none of these worthwhile projects, ranging from playing pitches to arts programmes and innovative community health programmes would have gone ahead without the support of the national lottery.</P>
        <P>The proceeds of the sale of the National Lottery licence will go towards the construction of the children&rsquo;s hospital, which is badly needed.  The hospital&rsquo;s building schedule is badly overrun, but let us not open the argument about the siting of the hospital at this time.  It gives a real sense of how the recession is affecting the lives of everyone in the country that we are taking this route.  If we take care, we can achieve the policy objectives of building our national children&rsquo;s hospital and securing the future of the national lottery and the public good that grows from it.  We have seen how our neighbouring island has managed to run an equitable lottery system where public good accrues to the state in the form of supports for good causes and a Government duty.</P>
        <P>The Minister proposes that a front-loaded sum will accrue to the State on the sale of the licence.  In the United Kingdom, there is a 12% accrual each year from the lottery.  Has the Minister factored that into his considerations?  If not, can he explain the logic of not including it?</P>
        <P>I have much more to say on this subject.  I wish the Minister well.  I have every confidence that he will manage the sale well and that it will benefit the country by creating a vital infrastructural project and running a fair, equitable and responsible lottery.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il Senators will, of course, be supporting our independent Seanad colleagues on this issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister has already outlined the history of the national lottery, the funding that comes from it, where that funding goes and the causes it is aimed at.  I smiled wryly when I heard that the money from the sale will go to projects such as the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  It sometimes seems that every taxation measure currently proposed is to fund some worthy cause.  I often wonder where we are getting the money to pay back the banks and the loans from Europe when the reason given for everything, from the sale of the ESB to the sale of the national lottery, is that it will fund worthy causes.</P>
        <P>I am well aware of the issues surrounding the national lottery and the money that has been allocated from its funding.  My colleagues opposite might point towards sports programmes, many in their own constituencies.  Indeed, Kerry was lucky enough to get a good deal of funding.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Kidney Association, for example, benefits from the national lottery to fund its organ donation drive and donor cards.  Such initiatives are rarely alluded to.  People tend to mention other projects that are highlighted in the media.  Worthy projects, such as the kidney donor card, have extraordinary outcomes and a huge effect on people&rsquo;s lives.  I am sure the Minister will take this into account when he is looking at the legislation.  While we do not support his proposal, weight of numbers will ensure that the Minister has his way.</P>
        <P>We have had an enormous amount of success since national lottery funding first became available.  Many communities and organisations have benefited from it.  It is of concern to all in the House that this benefit to the nation should continue.  If the Minister&rsquo;s proposal goes ahead, I am concerned that we will, in time, regret the fact that we took the money upfront and did not take a bigger stake in the ongoing lottery.  I know we will get the money back in 20 years, but that will be a long time in coming.</P>
        <P>I did not hear the conclusion of the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  Has it been decided that the money from the sale will go to the proposed national children&rsquo;s hospital?  Has the funding been ring-fenced and will that ring-fencing be included in the legislation?  The only way to guarantee that the money will go to the new children&rsquo;s hospital is to state as much in the legislation.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say so in a speech to the Seanad.  I suggest to my colleagues who put down this motion, which we are supporting, that they table an amendment to the Bill on this issue and see if Government Senators support the implementation of what the Minister has promised in his speech. The Minister can hardly object to enshrining it in legislation that the money from the sale of the national lottery will be ring-fenced for the new national children&rsquo;s hospital if he has undertaken to do so.</P>
        <P>I must declare an interest.  I was chairman of a club in Kerry that received funding from the national lottery.</P>

	<P>I filled out the application form myself.  I must say I did an excellent job on it.  The Minister may come to Kerry some time and we will allow him to open the sports hall and synthetic grass pitch which we achieved purely because I was chairman of the club.</P>
        <P>Will the legislation include a provision whereby money from the sale of this State asset will be ring-fenced for the new national children&rsquo;s hospital?  Senators on this side of the House supported, I hope, by our colleagues on the other side, would like to see that provision in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonnCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Eamonn Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  This is my first opportunity to say a few words in the Seanad in his presence.  I welcome Senator O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s words and her motion.  However, I am not sure I agree with the motion or support it, in particular having heard the Minister&rsquo;s response that this is not a sale of the national lottery but a tendering process for the licence.  I remember in 1983 or 1984 the then Minister of State, Mr. Donal Creed, with responsibility for schools building and sport, who during the momentous occasion after the World Championships in Helsinki made a presentation to me on behalf of the people of Ireland of a beautiful piece of Waterford crystal.  During the conversation on that day there was a debate about the forthcoming lottery that was being introduced into the country.  At the time, 25 years ago, there were many debates and arguments on whether a lottery should be introduced into this country similar to the debates currently ongoing about whether to allow gambling.</P>
        <P>However, my understanding in 1983 to 1986, before it became law and was formally introduced, was that the lottery would be ring-fenced for sports and arts.  My only disappointment was that I personally did not gain in the same way as contemporary athletes from lottery funding but sports has gained immensely.  While money went to sports and arts, it went beyond that to welfare, health, culture, heritage and the Irish language.  Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien referred to the fact that she is not aware of one single project that she can recall that has benefited from the national lottery.  I somewhat agree with her because the national lottery does not pride itself on promoting properly to the people of this country what the money from the lotto tickets people buy week in and week out has achieved.  I am aware through my work with the Irish Sports Council that the National Aquatic Centre has benefited from it.  We brought the Special Olympics to this country with its help and the Aviva Stadium has benefited from lottery funding.</P>
        <P>It is approximately nine weeks before the Olympic Games take place.  Through the work of the Irish Sports Council, the likes of Katie Taylor, Derval O&rsquo;Rourke and all the athletes participating in the Olympic Games have been funded by the national lottery in recent years.  If I was to estimate the amounts involved, Ms Taylor has probably gained funding to the tune of &euro;250,000 in sponsorship from the national lottery, which is a phenomenal achievement.  Only last week when she won the World Championships, someone asked her whether she would turn professional and she said that she is making more money as an amateur than those involved in the professional ranks.  That is indicative of the support that the national lottery has given Ms Taylor as well as all the other sports people.</P>
        <P>The national lottery has helped to develop local sports partnerships in almost every town in the country.  It has also supported the women in sports campaign.  The national lottery has made a great contribution to Irish life and, in particular, sport.  However, now we are debating whether the licence should be sold or if it should remain in the hands of the Government.  My question to the Minister is whether research has been done on the sale of the lottery to private interests in other countries and, if so, what are the results.  The lottery is going out to tender.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i> there is potential to raise &euro;500 million as a result of a successful bid for the licence.  If An Post is the successful bidder for the licence and the cost to it will be &euro;500 million, where will the money come from?  Will it come from the Government, taxpayers and the people of this country?  I would like to know the answer to that.  However, from an economic and business perspective if it is to come from a private agency from within or outside of this country that will be &euro;500 million extra into the coffers of the Irish people from which we can benefit.  I am in favour of allowing this licence to go to tender in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Members I thank colleagues for tabling the motion.  One of the things we are finding at present, with a view to events next week, is that we have lost a bit of our radicalism and we will have to address the reform agenda.  I do not know what way things will work out next week.  We inherited a situation when we were elected as Members &mdash; 42 of us were new &mdash; that the country had to be rescued by the IMF and is in serious trouble and that we must think of new ways of doing things because the established ways are not working.  That is where we are now &mdash; broke.</P>
        <P>Asset disposal is referred to in the McCarthy report and privatisation is an inevitable part of trying to put the country&rsquo;s finances together again.  Every time we raise one of the ways in which we might secure asset disposal there is always a chorus of objections.  We can reject every individual case but the overall package is that the State in this country is too big to be supported by the revenues and either we will end up looking at the options such as we have today or opt for cuts in the number of special needs assistants or to the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Some kind of shrinkage of the State must be considered.  Selling what in my younger days used to be known as raffle tickets is fairly low down on the list of national priorities.  Competitive tendering is the right way to go about it.  An Post might win again, as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, said.  That would satisfy many people, but by having competitive tendering it would go through every ounce and inch of its cost base and see how much it could bid upfront for the money which would be used for the children&rsquo;s hospital, as we are assured will be the case.</P>
        <P>That kind of competition is good as it tackles cost and promotes innovation.  It is also the worldwide experience.  The economists writing in 2002, Megginson and Netter, indicated that this is a trend worldwide, in particular now that governments are in so much trouble, that they look at assets they can realise.  They say that in the past 20 years &mdash; to 2002 &mdash; the percentage of global GDP takings of state-operated enterprises declined from 10% to less than 6%.  Therefore, it is happening.  According to the McCarthy report, we have approximately &euro;8.5 billion already in privatisation receipts.  Let us imagine the greater difficulties we would be in if we did not have them.  Some of them are spectacular successes such as the Kerry Group, which the Minister, Mr. Mark Clinton, sold to Mr. Denis Brosnan and friends.  It is now a spectacularly successful company.  The B&amp;I line was always in trouble in State ownership and it was sold.  It now operates without assistance.  Other examples include Greencore and Great Southern Hotels.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, mentioned on the previous day when we discussed the matter that in his constituency of Wexford a power station had been sold and now contributes to the national grid and the local economy.  Sometimes we get concerned.  Trees seem to be a particular issue of concern.  We can take a bid for trees now on what they will be worth in 20 years&rsquo; time, in which case they will be cut down and taken away by someone and made into something else or we can sell them now and take a gamble.  I do not think there is any great ideological issue.  Ditto with electricity.  I do not have a difficulty with having some electricity stations sold off and in private hands.  In addition to meeting some of our IMF targets, it is not a major disaster if when one turns on the lights some of it has come from privately run power stations.  There are efficiency gains because Megginson and Netter also say that privatisation works in the sense that divested firms have almost always become more efficient, more profitable, increased their capital spending and become financially healthier.</P>
        <P>The dilemma facing the Cabinet is not the worst possibility.  Other examples come to mind.  Mr. John Teeling bought the industrial alcohol plant on the Cooley Peninsula and developed a major whiskey business, which he sold for a substantial sum.  The State should be more flexible in its asset portfolio.  The priority should be to try to retain money for health, as in this case, and education.  Some of the other functions are not the core functions of government and arise for review in the appalling situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>We will need this debate frequently, although not just on this issue.  I commend my colleagues opposite on tabling the motion.  When the State gets too big for its budget, there must be parliamentary debates on which functions should be dropped and which should be put up for competitive tendering.  I welcome the latter action.  One of the lessons we have learned is that so-called beauty competitions are unsatisfactory and result in vast legal and tribunal costs.</P>
        <P>As we try to pay our way and exit this debt trap, we must consider how to work better.  That involves Members on all sides of the House tabling motions such as this one.  The State must live within its means.  Anything else is a tax on future generations of people who will inherit a vast debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators O&rsquo;Donnell and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien for raising this matter.  When I first read the motion, its wider relevance was not immediately clear to me.  As the debate has progressed, it is clear there are wider issues.  The overall programme of privatisation is an important issue and should be debated regularly.  To some extent, I do not agree with Senator Barrett, as privatisation does not always work.  Across the water in the UK, there are many shining examples of privatisation that have not worked.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to the House.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, made a robust defence of what he has in mind for the national lottery.  I was reassured.  It might be a statement of the obvious, but the national children&rsquo;s hospital is a vital strategic development.  Yesterday saw the announcement of the first phase of development of the national rehabilitation centre in Loughlinstown, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is my constituency.  In the previous 14 years of Fianna F&aacute;il Government, not a single significant public hospital was developed.  The last such development was Tallaght hospital when I was almost a child in short pants.  My colleagues on the other side of the House are laughing, but this is no laughing matter.  The children&rsquo;s hospital is an important strategic development.  Even if I believed the preservation of the national lottery in State hands was more important than it is, I would need to weigh its significance against the importance of building a national children&rsquo;s hospital today and not in five or six years' time when we will have the capacity to raise the necessary funding.</P>
        <P>A number of good points have been made and well answered.  However, some points could be restated.  The Minister has made clear the Government&rsquo;s commitment that jobs in the national lottery will be protected.  There is also a commitment that the margins of the distribution network and individual retailers will be protected, which will in turn protect jobs in the retail sector.  Although such commitments may impact on the envelope the State can expect to receive, it is important, when we sell this or any other asset, we do so with the protection of employees and wider society to the fore.</P>
        <P>A valid point has been made.  If one is to protect retailers and, via the 30.5% floor, good causes, from where will the money come to make bidding for the national lottery profitable?  It will come from the prize fund.  If that fund is not maintained, the person who bids for the lottery will be biting the hand that feeds him or her.  The prize money must be maintained.</P>
        <P>The way forward for the national lottery is growth.  Would it be the end of the world if a company such as Camelot was to bid for it and bring it to Australia, Canada, the US or other countries where there is a significant interest in Irish affairs?  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that we could grow the lottery significantly.  When we put together the request for tender, RFT, we should include growth as an important strategic aim.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien asked when it was a good time to sell an asset.  It is when one needs the money, and we need the money now.  As someone who has had children in the hospital system down the years and whose close friend&rsquo;s child died of leukaemia, I am well aware of the hospital system&rsquo;s inadequacies.  The time to sell is now.  The lottery is not a port, a strategic infrastructural asset or a bog.  Its sale will not impact on the economy&rsquo;s capacity to do its business.  Weighing the balance of what can be achieved by its sale versus what can be achieved by its retention, selling the lottery is a good strategic move if all the interests of the workers, good causes and those who depend on it, including retailers, are protected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not use all of my speaking time.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the motion and oppose the Government amendment.  The motion is set against a particular backdrop.  The Government has been tossing around the idea of selling off the family silver or, as Senator Norris suggested, the farm tractor for a while.  Flogging State assets for a quick buck is not in the public interest.  This is aside from the fact that the prices we are likely to get for such assets are unlikely to be handsome.  The State is required to maintain minimum standards, particularly in certain service areas.</P>
        <P>No one in the State would deny the national children&rsquo;s hospital will be strategic infrastructure or argue against the importance of developing it as soon as possible.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called on the Government to match European Investment Bank funding with moneys from the discretionary portfolio of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and private pension funds to pay for a stimulus package, including infrastructural development projects.  Selling State assets is a failed policy and would work against the public interest.  If we want bang for our buck and are serious about economic recovery, we need to invest in the economy and not flog bits of it.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has stated he intends to use the upfront payment from the new national lottery operator to fund the national children&rsquo;s hospital, but some of the original commitments have been watered down.  For example, just one third of the upfront payment will go towards the hospital project.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, confirm what the Minister intends to do with the balance of the upfront payment and how the remainder of the project will be financed?  The Minister stated the new licence contract would include a good causes clause to ensure current funding levels would be maintained.  According to him, the 2011 level was 30.5%.  As the House has been told, one third of national lottery sales provide funds for good causes.  In 2010, these sales amounted to &euro;244 million.  Never more have those community goods and services needed to rely on that funding stream.  If profits increase, will the good cause moneys increase too?  How will the annual national lottery surplus be dealt with under these proposed arrangements?  Why will this new licence be for 20 years when the last licence period was less than 20 years?  Why such a long period when other opportunities such as online transactions could open up the national lottery?  The Minister stated the lottery is doing more business online and that we need to provide for this.  What regulatory changes will the Bill to amend the National Lottery Act 1986 provide?  We believe this motion should be passed unamended and the Government should reconsider its policy in this area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I commend Senators O&rsquo;Donnell and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien on tabling this motion.  It is an issue everyone will be thinking about because they will want to ensure it is done properly.  People still remember the sick feeling of what happened with the sale of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  It should be remembered the national lottery will not be a sale but a lease.  There is a bad feeling about some privatisation.  Personally, I believe the proposal with the national lottery is a good idea.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, will relate to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the competitive tendering process should be shorter for the same reason of online gaming and gambling.  Up to 30% of lottery sales in the Scandinavian countries are online.  The Minister stated he will have to introduce legislation to deal with the online aspect of the lottery.  This will bring more online investment in the lottery and further proceeds to the company which purchases the licence.  We must ensure this is factored into the tender.</P>
        <P>Safeguards to prevent online gambling should be built into this legislation too.  Gambling is an addiction and a serious issue for some.  While we all want to ensure there is an online part of the lottery, we must ensure also people addicted to gambling are protected.</P>
        <P>The national lottery provides funding to organisations which promote the Irish language.  However, since 2009 funding for the language fund has decreased.  On average, 64% of the overall fund comes through the national lottery.  Irish language organisations want it ensured this funding allocation is protected in the tendering process and the fund will not be depleted in any way by the company that takes over the lottery.  If a company from outside the country wins the tender, the Irish language will not be its priority.  It also would not be categorised as a charity.  It is important this is written down in the initial stages.  With the new online aspect of the lottery, I would prefer if the licence was for ten years rather than 20 years.  I am glad the Minister said moneys for the children&rsquo;s hospital will be ring-fenced, a hospital which we need immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senators O&rsquo;Donnell and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien on tabling this motion.  They made much sense in what they said about the national lottery.  The debate can be divided into two categories &mdash; the public service ethos and the business ethos.  I am not criticising the Minister for it because he comes from a public service background and is advised by people in the public service, but his speech displayed all the elements of the public service ethos.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest about what Senator Barrett had to say about privatisation.  I concur with him in that I would support privatisation in certain selective instances.  There is no doubt that businesses can be more efficiently and effectively operated in the competitive environment of the business sector.  Equally, there are situations where it behoves us not to go that route with certain State assets.  The proposals with the national lottery are not an asset disposal.  The M50 West Link and National Toll Roads contract was a significant public sector and political mistake at the time.  The revenue accrued to that contract was enormous.  I see this proposal in a similar light.  We are looking at capitalising a significant annual income flow.  That is much different from an asset disposal.  That point was badly missed by the Minister in his contribution.</P>
        <P>The motion&rsquo;s proposers are correct.  There will be no bidder for the lottery licence who will not do so out of a clear vision of a very significant profitable return to themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is just speculation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Figures of between &euro;400 and &euro;600 million have been expressed.  Most business people will look for an internal rate of return of between 20% and 30%.  In this case, they may settle for somewhat less than that but there will still be a significant double digit rate of return.  Those sums could be used more prudently by the State.  Selling off that profit to a private operator shows a complete lack of vision.</P>
        <P>If we wanted to go this route, surely we would not leave the lacuna of going online which could see a significant escalation in returns.  I am involved in a small project, the John F. Kennedy trust, in New Ross.  We invested in the famine ship, <i>Dunbrody</i>, a visitor centre and a coffee shop.  The trust&rsquo;s board examined franchising the coffee shop because it was not part of our expertise.  At the time it was recommended not to franchise it out because we were not sure what revenue would accrue from it.  The revenue is now multiples of what we expected.  The centre would have lost out considerably if we had franchised the coffee shop because we would have let it go far more cheaply.  It is the very same in this instance.</P>
        <P>In the first year of the lotto, sales came to &euro;170 million.  In 2011, sales came to &euro;760 million, a four and a half fold increase.  At the end of the new proposed licence in 20 years, lottery sales could be somewhere north of &euro;3 billion per year.  Can one imagine the percentage that will be accrued in profit?  I predict that in the last two years it will recover the quantum.  While there is a time element, that is a factor that has not been taken into account.  Clearly, from a business perspective it does not stack up.  We are taking a capital sum, as the Minister said, but we are sacrificing ongoing annual income to the State, which is a big mistake and will be a major loss.  It will be seen as such in time.  This is the time to stop it.  As the Minister said, he will take up the invitation to meet the proposer and seconder of the motion and I hope he will listen to them.</P>
        <P>The children&rsquo;s hospital has been thrown into the mix.  It is a red herring, as it has nothing to do with the disposal of the licence.  We should find a management company, define what the management fee will be, set out the criteria it must meet and the remaining income should come to the State for the good causes it supports and to fund other projects.  There is a hospital in my town which was established as a community hospital, as Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy will be aware.  That would not have happened without a commitment to meet the ongoing costs of running it.  It has been in place for the past 20 years.</P>
        <P>This will be similar to the levy on pension schemes.  A figure of 0.6% was imposed.  As in the case of the children&rsquo;s hospital, the money was supposed to be used to create jobs.  As soon the funds had come on stream, they were taken into the Exchequer.  Will the money be used to increase the salaries of the advisers, party hacks, being brought on board?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be used to fund such expenditure?  It is symptomatic of the Minister&rsquo;s failure to tackle the structural fiscal problems.  It is like the budget.  We cut capital expenditure which would have resulted in the creation of jobs in the short term and improved infrastructure and increased competitiveness in the long term.  The increased VAT rates have affected the retail trade.  The structural deficiencies in the economy have not been dealt with because they involve difficult decisions.  The Minister has taken the soft policy option.  I am disappointed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  I have acknowledged in the House previously that he has the intellectual capacity to make good decisions and be a good Minister.  Unfortunately, however, he does not have the backbone to follow through on the difficult decisions that need to be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, and the opportunity to debate the motion.  I thank the Independent Senators Marie Louise O&rsquo;Donnell and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien for tabling it.  This has been a lively and enlightening debate which is notable for the emergence of a new word, &ldquo;slushfundability&rdquo;, which will certainly be quoted in the future.  It is notable also because Senator David Norris stood corrected on one important point, the rebuilding of Wexford Opera House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, I was taking the point that it was rude not to listen to a speaker at the beginning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On a more serious note, I take issue with Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s comments about the Minister.  I thought the Minister&rsquo;s response to the motion was superb.  He set out clearly and fairly the position on the tendering process for the licence to operate the national lottery for the period 2013-33.  As Senator C&aacute;it Keane said, this is not about the sale of a State asset, rather it is about a lease or licensing arrangement.  It is about a change to the terms of a licensing arrangement.  An Post holds the licence which was put out to tender in late 2001 under a previous Government and which An Post won following a competition held between 1999 and 2001.  That licence is due to expire at the end of June 2013.  Clearly, it is a matter for the Government to put it out to tender again.  It is in its power to do so and it will remain in its power at the expiry of the next licence.  Therefore, we will retain ownership of it.  Essentially, it is a lease.  It is like a landowner who leases his or her farmland for a period of 20 years for somebody else to work it but on terms and conditions that are suitable and appropriate to the landowner.  These terms can change.  The Minister clearly explained the two changes he proposed would operate in the award of the next licence.   From the end of June 2013, the next term will run for 20 years and there will be an upfront payment.  That is the <i>quid pro quo</i>.  It is welcome that there will be an upfront payment, even though the connection with the children&rsquo;s hospital has been dismissed out of hand as a red herring.  I take serious issue with this.  The Minister has made a clear link and the upfront payment will go towards meeting the building costs of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, a project to which we are deeply committed.  An Post may tender for the next licence and may win it, but we cannot prejudge the outcome.  The Minister has said there were other tenderers on the last occasion and, no doubt, there will be again.</P>
        <P>As legislation will be brought before the House to provide the framework for the award of the next licence, we will have an opportunity to debate the terms of the tendering process and the framework to be put in place.  If the Minister was present, I would say this directly to him, but I say to the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, that I hope the debate on the legislation will commence in this House.  Given that we have had a debate on the issue, it would be appropriate for us to continue it by looking at the terms and the arrangements for the award of the next licence.  The most important condition, apart from the two I have mentioned &mdash; the length of the licensing term and the up-front payment &mdash; is that there will be a fixed percentage of annul turnover of 30.5% for good causes.  That will not change.  That was the percentage allocated for good causes in 2011.  Senator John Gilroy and others have outlined in detail the good causes that have benefited from that financing  and will continue to benefit from it.  There should be no change in that regard.  The ultimate point is that the right to award the licence will remain with the people.  This is a temporary arrangement and a continuation of the process already instituted.  We are coming to the end of the term of the licence held by An Post since 2001.</P>
        <P>The Minister has clearly said he is open to accepting amendments to the Bill, the debate on which I hope will commence in this House.  He is also open to suggestions on additional ways to raise resources.  I think it was Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell who referred to the possibility of holding a specific draw for the children&rsquo;s hospital.  I thought that was an excellent suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That option is open to the State, even if we are awarding a licence to run the national lottery.  Clearly, there is potential to run other more limited or specific sweepstakes with different terms and conditions, for example, on condition that money would be raised to fund specific building projects.  I see this as a constructive suggestion, one I hope the Government will consider seriously.  While this is not about the sale of a State asset, I hope we will have other debates on the sale of such assets.  Senator Aideen Hayden mentioned assets of strategic importance.  It is clear from the programme for Government that there will be specific checks to ensure there is no sale of a strategic asset.  This is not about the sale of an asset, rather it is about putting out to tender a current licence which is due to expire shortly.  In a sensible way, with considered and careful consultation with stakeholders, the licence will be put out to tender again.  I, therefore, support the Government&rsquo;s counter motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is very nice to see the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, in the House.  I have not had the opportunity to speak to him as a young rookie Senator.  Having spent one year in the House I have very broad country shoulders.  I have never before received a swipe such as the one I received from Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy and it hurt because he had taken my words out of context, recontextualised them and threw them back at me.  I thought it was a trifle unfair.</P>

	<P>I mentioned the transfer con idea which was really an idea about privatisation, where the banks privatised losses were put on the backs of the public.</P>
        <P>I want to thank the Minister of State for being here and to thank Deputy Howlin for his presence earlier.  I understand that the licence is for tender but by tender it means that it is for sale for 20 years because if somebody is going to give you some money for it then it is up for some kind of a sale.  My argument was about profit, profit, profit for whoever buys it.  Profit, profit, profit that is likely to go out of the country because we do not have the money.  Hopefully, An Post might have the money but at the moment, as Senator Eamonn Coghlan pointed out, we do not have the money so it is likely that it will go to a foreign bank, a foreign pension fund, a foreign billionaire, a foreign organisation or syndicate to buy it.  We are talking about profit, profit, profit for 20 years.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I want it to stay with the Irish citizen, the Irish State and the Irish Government.  I also consider it a different kind of asset.  I do not consider it a grid or a bog, which I nearly broke my shoulder on last week, or like electricity or pipelines.  I consider it to be personal, private, people and voluntary, and to be euro being taken out of their suits, trousers and purses.  My argument is that we could come up with a better way of funding the children&rsquo;s hospital and we should sit down and try to do that.  I do not agree with the sale.  I have a right as a Senator not to agree with the sale.  I would like to tell Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy that I think long and hard about what I have the privilege to say in the House.  I am against profitability and I am against the profitability going out of the State.   I did not talk about transparency regarding Exchequer or national lottery funding and the disadvantaged.  I talked about profit.  None of the Senators against the argument would argue for that.  It is about a profit of &euro;50 million per year leaving the country when it could be kept here.  We should be very clear about it.  I did not talk about sport, culture, health or youth but I understand that they are the heartbeat of the national lottery even though I do not think its funding distribution is equitable.  I talked about profit over 20 years for whomever comes up with the &euro;500 million and I want it to be us.  I want the person that owns the national lottery to be us.</P>

Mar at&aacute; a fhios ag gach duine, duine de laochra na C&aacute;sca a bh&iacute; ann sa Phiarsach ach duine ild&aacute;nach &eacute; chomh maith, fear dl&iacute;, fear l&eacute;annta, m&uacute;inteoir Gaeilge, oideachas&oacute;ir agus duine na bpr&iacute;omhdhaoine a bh&iacute; bainteach le h&Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach 1916 agus an phlean&aacute;il ar fad a chuaigh isteach ansin.

        <P Just="Left">Mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir, chaith P&aacute;draig Mac Piarais a chuid saoire i rith an tsamhraidh i Ros Muc.  Is cinnte go bhfaigheann cuairteoir&iacute; ar Theach an Phiarsaigh l&eacute;argas ann ar an bPiarsach mar r&eacute;abhl&oacute;id&iacute;.  Ina theannta sin, faigheann siad l&eacute;argas ann ar ghn&eacute;ithe eile den Phiarsach mar oideachas&oacute;ir, mar scr&iacute;bhneoir agus, go m&oacute;r mh&oacute;r, mar ghn&iacute;omha&iacute; paiseanta ar son na Gaeilge.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have a simple question with regard to a stocking issue for those who had horses previously and want to get back into the industry under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I will listen to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Daly.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, who is unable to be here.</P>
        <P>In order to make the necessary savings under the 2012 disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, in view of the reduction in budgeted expenditure from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million, technical adjustments must be made to the scheme&rsquo;s criteria.  These changes will ensure that aid payments are focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows: to ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community; to maintain the countryside; and to maintain and promote sustainable farming systems, taking particular account of environmental protection measures.  However, rather than simply applying an across-the-board cut to the rates payable or reducing the maximum payable area as a means to achieving these savings, the Minister decided that real efforts should be made to focus the scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the scheme.  Making technical adjustments to the scheme criteria ensures that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in less favoured areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Any analysis of the scheme must take into account the impact of the various enterprises on the local economy.  As is clearly evident, the main benefits arise from beef rearing, dairying and sheep breeding enterprises.  There are an increasing number of applicants under the scheme who have discontinued livestock &mdash; that is, cattle or sheep &mdash; farming but continue to benefit from aid under the scheme by grazing some horses on their land.</P>
        <P>It is widely recognised that the disadvantaged areas scheme is a very important one for the country, especially from an economic perspective, as it contributes to the support of in excess of 100,000 farm families.  Therefore, in proposing the changes in question the intention is to better focus the scheme which is to the benefit of the majority of those farming in areas with recognised constraints, while at the same time attempting to cater for those genuinely prevented from achieving the revised minimums.</P>
        <P>With the intention of targeting those farmers farming exclusively in disadvantaged areas, it is suggested farmers whose holdings consist of land situated in both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged areas are in a better farming position than those farming exclusively in disadvantaged areas.  Therefore, it is proposed that where some of an applicant&rsquo;s declared land is disadvantaged and his or her main holding is in a non-disadvantaged area, a digressive rate of aid will be payable under the scheme.  This digressive payment does not affect applicants whose main holding is in a disadvantaged area.  This proposal is regarded as fair in that the greater proportion of less favoured areas land in the holding, the greater the payment.</P>
        <P>In so far as the specific changes concerning the eligibility of horses for inclusion in the stocking density are concerned, while horses in general will no longer be automatically eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation, on the basis of the contribution equine breeding enterprises make to the local economy, horses on such enterprises will continue to be eligible.  In consultation with the relevant stakeholders, equine breeding enterprises have been defined as follows: an applicant must, in the first instance, be an equine breeder and have bred a foal, from a mare registered on the applicant&rsquo;s holding in 2011, in either 2009, 2010 or 2011 which was registered in a stud book approved by my Department and with pedigree recorded; the premises of all who meet this criterion must be registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in accordance with SI 8 of 2012, Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Registration of Horse Premises) Order 2012.</P>
        <P>Where these criteria are met, the following equines will be eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation for the 2012 scheme: all equines aged from one to five years, aged using the date 1 January and registered in the name of the applicant and maintained on his or her holding; breeding mares, registered as having been on the applicant&rsquo;s holding in 2011, that have bred an appropriately registered foal in either 2009, 2010 or 2011.  I am, however, particularly mindful that any proposed change in the scheme&rsquo;s qualifying criteria, regardless of how focused and targeted the aim, will result in anomalies, because of which specific provision will be made for those farmers who may find that their stocking rates are lower than are now required.  Specifically, I have directed that a formal procedure be put in place to cater for all who consider that their inability to meet the proposed revised scheme requirements is due to <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances.  Those affected will be invited to outline such details to my Department and each case will then be considered on its merits.  With specific regard to the proposed stocking provisions, where individuals can show that their inability to meet the revised requirements is due to their participation in a recognised environmental programme, for example, the necessary allowance will be made.  Consideration will also be given to new entrants to farming.</P>
        <P>As the disadvantaged areas scheme is co-funded by the European Union under the rural development programme for the period 2007 to 2013, it is necessary to obtain the agreement of the European Commission to any proposed change.  Departmental officials have been involved in ongoing discussions with Commission officials in this regard and a decision is awaited.  It should be noted that the proposed criteria may be subject to some changes following the conclusion of the discussions with the Commission.  Pending a response from the Commission, it was considered necessary and desirable to advise farmers formally of the proposed changes, given the imminent closing date for applications.  To alert farmers, the terms and conditions were posted on my Department&rsquo;s website, a press notice was published in the farming press and terms and conditions booklets were issued to each landowner whose farm was wholly or partially classified as disadvantaged.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I had hoped the Minister for Defence would be present, but since I was in the Minister of State&rsquo;s position in the past, I welcome him out of courtesy.  He took the trouble to come to the House.  </P>
        <P>Concern has been expressed in Athlone and surrounding areas about the future of the 4th Western Brigade&rsquo;s headquarters located at Custume Barracks.  There is no question about the barracks because it is the headquarters for the troops who came from Longford in Mullingar, but there is concern as the headquarters of the western command has been at that location since the foundation of the State.  It is the headquarters for the engineers, signal, medical corps, ordnance corps, training depot, 4th cavalry squadron, military police and other elements of the Defence Forces.  People are concerned and worried about the future and rumours abound.  The matter was brought to my attention by the former Minister Ms Mary O&rsquo;Rourke and Councillor Aengus O&rsquo;Rourke who are resident in Athlone.  They have been very much associated with the barracks in their careers, as were Ms O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s brother, Brian, and father, Paddy.  There is a very close connection between the O&rsquo;Rourke and Lenihan families and the work of the Irish Army in Athlone.  I ask the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, to allay the fears of people in the area and hope he will do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, as Chief Whip, should consider that, at the launch of the air ambulance service in Custume Barracks in Athlone on Monday, all non-Government-affiliated Members and councillors were excluded.  We have a particular interest in the air ambulance service which is to be used for patients in Roscommon, Portiuncula and Mullingar hospitals and surrounding areas in dealing with emergencies.  It would have been appropriate to invite those who were excluded.  Extending invitations used to be the procedure, as I know having served in three or four Departments.  I would not even have considered not inviting elected public representatives in an area to an event I was hosting.  I am sure the Minister of State is of the same view.  It is appropriate that he bear this in mind.  The boycott of public representatives last Monday was unprecedented and I regret it very much, as do many colleagues of the Minister.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, was present at the event.  I am not sure who sent the invitation, but I understand it came from the Defence Forces and the Minister in charge.  If the Minister for Defence was present, I would be in a position to challenge him directly on this matter and he might have been able to clarify the position.  I know it is not part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s brief because he is dealing specifically with the 4th Western Brigade&rsquo;s headquarters.  It is appropriate that certain protocols be followed.  There is a precedent for the procedures we operated when in government.</P>

	<P>I am glad the Senator has a very good working relationship with the former Senator, Deputy and Minister Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  I understand she has a very good relationship with former Members of this House in her constituency.  It is very important that the Senator maintain his relationship with former Senator Donie Cassidy also.</P>
        <P>I can understand the Senator&rsquo;s fears and will try to allay them.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Defence who is unable to be present as he has another engagement.</P>
        <P>Arising from the comprehensive review of expenditure, the Government decided to maintain the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500.  This represents a reduction in the authorised strength ceiling and will contribute to the delivery of sustainable savings in the coming years.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the Defence Forces will retain the capacity to fulfil all of the assigned roles to the greatest extent possible.  A three-brigade structure was introduced originally in the 1990s when the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force was revised to approximately 11,500 personnel.  It was retained when the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced to 10,500 as part of the White Paper on Defence in 2000.  However, it is no longer viable to retain a three-brigade structure within a revised Permanent Defence Force strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel.  Accordingly, in response to the revised strength ceiling of 9,500, a major reorganisation of the Defence Forces, including the Reserve Defence Force, has been initiated.  It will encompass a reduction in the number of Armybrigades from three to two.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of the reorganisation is to free up the maximum number of military personnel from administrative and support tasks.  This will include a reduction in the number of brigade headquarters from three to two, in line with the reduction in the number of brigades.  In short, the reorganisation is about maintaining operational outputs and capabilities to best effect within a reduced strength ceiling.  I can confirm that the process will not require further barracks closures.  This task is a significant undertaking and there is a range of issues that must be considered.  However, the primary focus will be the maintenance of operational outputs and capabilities.  My colleague, the Minister for Defence, has asked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence to bring forward detailed proposals for his consideration.  They will include proposals regarding territorial areas of responsibility and the location of brigade headquarters.  They will also include proposals relating to the Reserve Defence Force which is currently organised along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force.  This work is under way and the Minister is being kept informed of progress.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there will be differing views on the best way to reorganise the Defence Forces and that this will evoke passionate debate, as the Senator outlined.  I am also aware that there will be differing viewpoints and interests, including those which are concerned about local impacts.  However, as the Senator will appreciate, in advance of the receipt and consideration of the proposals from the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General, the Minister will not be in a position to comment on speculation surrounding the reorganisation.  He does not intend to pre-empt the outcome of the work of the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General and limit their scope in bringing forward recommendations.  I note the Senator has stated there was speculation in the area.  I can assure him that we are at an early stage of the reorganisation and that idle speculation will not do the Defence Forces any good.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces organisation has an enviable track record of reform and modernisation.  During the last decade, when public service expenditure and employment levels increased, defence expenditure declined in real terms, while personnel numbers decreased.  During this period Defence Forces&rsquo; capabilities were also progressively improved and the Defence Forces have become partners of choice in international peace support operations.  The Defence Forces continue to deliver a broad range of operational outputs on a day-to-day basis, many of which are not to the forefront of the public&rsquo;s awareness.</P>
        <P>The level of resources available to the Government in the coming years will present further difficulties and challenges and every part of the public service will have to continue to deliver greater efficiencies.  The preservation of the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel is a clear recognition by the Government of the significant modernisation achieved by the Defence Forces organisation during the past decade.  It is great that there are such high numbers applying to the Permanent Defence Force for entry to the Naval Service, the Air Corps or as cadets.  Thousands have applied and there is a huge job of work to be done by the Defence Forces in recruiting the best possible people to serve in the Army.  However, it is vital that we continue to strive for further improvements.  The reorganisation of the Defence Forces is an integral element of this reform and will ensure the Defence Forces will maximise their operational outputs with a reduced resources envelope.  The Minister looks forward to working closely with the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General in furthering the reorganisation and the broader reform agenda.</P>
        <P>I assure the Senator that there was never an intention to show discourtesy to him personally or any member of the Opposition when the invitations were issued for the event held in Athlone barracks on Monday last.  It is a matter of genuine regret if the Senator thought otherwise.  He is mistaken about the established practice in issuing invitations.  In the past representatives of all parties were invited to a limited number of formal events, but it has become more usual for invitations to attend ministerial events to be issued to Government representatives.  This practice was followed by the Senator&rsquo;s party when he was in government, although perhaps not by him personally.  As an Opposition Deputy, I was often aware of an official ministerial visit to my constituency of Wexford for an event which I did not receive an invitation to attend.  I emphasise that I am not complaining about this.  I am merely pointing out that it was the practice of other parties when in government.  That said, I am glad to have the opportunity to confirm that no personal discourtesy was intended.  I assure the Senator that I will convey his concerns to other Ministers.</P>

	<P>To be forewarned is to be forearmed.  I am sure this will mark the commencement of a major campaign in Athlone and surrounding areas to ensure the 4thBrigade is not removed from Custume Barracks.</P>
