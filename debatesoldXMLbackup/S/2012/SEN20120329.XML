	<P>I have received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">Go dtabharfaidh an tAire Oideachas agus Scileanna m&iacute;ni&uacute; ar an mbun&uacute;s nach bhfuil Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh, Cnoc na Cathrach, Gaillimh san &aacute;ireamh sa gcl&aacute;r infheist&iacute;ochta caipitil a d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair s&eacute; le d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus ar na f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; at&aacute; ann don scoil achomharc a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gcinneadh seo.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 2.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not be opposing the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>On the household charge, I was looking for a quote that might sum up the continuing confusion now descending into farce.  Today the media are reporting yet more examples which are adding to the confusion and which I would like the Leader to address.  It seems that those living above retail outlets who had originally believed because they were paying commercial rates as per the leaflet distributed by the Government that they were exempt from the household charge are not exempt from it.  It seems that those who have been using part of their commercial dwelling as a place of residence will have to pay the &euro;100 charge in addition to the &euro;200 second home charge.  This will place yet another burden on small businesses.  Will the Leader request the Minister &mdash; this is an important weekend for the Fine Gael Party &mdash; to, at least, clarify the position and outline how one can make the payment and also who is liable for the payment?  This would serve the purposes of those of us who support the law of the land.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw the attention of the Leader to an imminent decision by RTE to shut down the LW 252 service which, as Members are aware, has been serving three quarters of the United Kingdom landmass since its inception over 20 years ago.  Wearing my other hat of broadcaster to the Irish Diaspora, I can testify that this service has been essential in maintaining a link, particularly among the elderly who are not tuned in to Internet or high-tech services.  As the Leader is aware, there is a high volume of traffic, both commercial and tourist, between Britain and Ireland who use the service on their travels to keep in touch with what is happening in Ireland.  Notwithstanding the fact that RTE is in serious financial difficulty &mdash; I understand it must bridge a gap of some &euro;20 million this year and that it is in that context that the termination of the service has arisen; I believe a decision is imminent and will be announced in the next few days by the director general Mr. Noel Curran &mdash; I ask the Leader to investigate what role, if any, the Government might play to ensure this service is maintained, particularly given the increased use of the Internet which RTE will use as a justification for terminating the service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated, I was looking for a quote that might describe, to some degree, what was going on in relation to the household charge.  I have found one by Churchill who was always good for a quote that might apply to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, and which was made across the floor of the House of Commons:</P>
        <P LI="1">He is one of those orators, of whom it is well said, &ldquo;Before they get up, they do not know what they are going to say; when they are speaking, they do not know what they are saying; and when they have sat down, they do not know what they have said.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It would be useful if the Minister clarified the exact position on the household charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Churchill was, of course, a noted orator.  As there are many good orators who do not know what they are going to say when they stand up, I am not sure Senator Mooney was right about that.</P>
        <P>With regard to the household charge, as colleagues know, this was introduced as part of the EU-IMF programme.  It is regrettable that it is a flat rate for the first year but the Government has made clear it will be based on an assessment after the first year and will, therefore, be tailored to individual houses and properties after that.  While I regret the fact it is a flat rate, I very much support the principle of a property tax.  It is extraordinary that those on the left politically &mdash; I am not looking at anyone in this House in particular &mdash; appear to be against a property tax in principle.  The alternative is more income taxes or tax in other ways.  A property tax is something we have lacked in this country since the ill-fated abolition of rates many years ago.  It is something we should stand over in principle.</P>
        <P>There have been serious problems with communication and information, which is accepted.  It is a pity An Post was not used.  It set a rather high rate initially but, in retrospect, it would have been the preferable means of payment and of communication to people.  However, it is now clear that, for people who wish to pay by 31 March, there are many different avenues to do so.  In Dublin, the civic offices on Wood Quay will be open from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. to accept payment by cash, cheque, bank draft and postal order.  People can pay online, by phone or by post.  There are quite a range of different means of payment, although I agree people should have been more clearly informed from the outset, as that is when the difficulty arose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call for a debate on prisons in light of a hearing held this morning by the justice committee with the director general of the Irish Prison Service concerning an investigation into the escape from Loughan House open prison of Martin McDermott, the person convicted of the manslaughter of Garda Gary McLoughlin in 2009.  It was a matter of great regret to all of us here and we all expressed sympathy at the time to the family of Garda McLoughlin.  The director general gave a very frank presentation to the committee in which he accepted utterly that the decision to transfer the prisoner from a closed prison to an open centre was wrong.  He said measures have been put in place to ensure the transfer of an unsuitable prisoner who is likely to abscond does not take place in future.  We need to place this in context.  It would be useful to have a debate in this House on the prison estate generally and to note that in Ireland we have an extremely low proportion of prisoners in open centres, less than 6% compared with an average of one third of prisoners in open prisons in Scandinavian countries, which have a much higher rate of rehabilitation as a result.  I ask the Leader for that debate.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I thank all colleagues who contributed to the very lively debate yesterday on the Labour Party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion on supports for small business and the self-employed.  I am very grateful to everyone who put forward constructive suggestions and ideas.  It was great to have a very full Visitors Gallery of stakeholders from small business and members of ISME and the chambers of commerce.  We certainly intend to follow up on the suggestions made.  I will be writing to the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, and the other Ministers involved, Deputies Burton and Bruton in particular, to put forward some of the suggested ideas from our debate yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the Order of Business, I ask that the Leader allow leniency in regard to the 2.30 p.m. time limit on the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011.  There are 141 amendments, of which 90 are proposed by the Minister.  The bodies concerned have not been consulted, even though the Minister said he would consult them when he was in the House last July.  The same Bill reappeared, however, although the Department obviously feels it is seriously flawed and anybody who has read it would think it is seriously flawed.  It may require more time than is available up to 2.30 p.m. today to get through the issues, not least dealing with the Minister&rsquo;s many amendments.</P>
        <P>The other problem we will encounter is that the Minister will not be present.  Therefore, the wisdom we tried to pass on to him last July will have to be communicated again to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, who is standing in for him.  There should have been proper consultation on this and the Bill should have been prepared much more properly than it was.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On another issue, Mr. Carl O&rsquo;Brien writing in yesterday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> stated: &ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners raised serious concerns over the fairness of aspects of [the] tax breaks aimed at luring multinational executives to Ireland [which was] signed into law earlier this year&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance was most concerned about this issue and spent many hours debating these tax expenditures, the way in which they have grown and are not properly analysed and their seriously inequitable effects.  It is disconcerting that so soon after the Finance Act was passed these concerns are raised by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance.  The tax breaks are of substantial benefit to people who earn between &euro;75,000 and &euro;500,000 per year.  The briefing to Mr. Carl O'Brien states: "The introduction of any measure which results in the reduction of tax paid by high earners, even if done for compelling reasons such as attracting economic activity into the State ... will be criticised in the context of an increasing burden on 'ordinary' employees".  This fits into the category the Minister was describing.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I ask that the lobbying that secured this tax break for people earning between &euro;75,000 and &euro;500,000 be placed in the Oireachtas Library for us to consult.  It was obviously an attempt to bypass parliament.  The lobbyists are listed as &ldquo;Citibank, consultants KPMG, PwC and Deloitte ... the American Chamber of Commerce, the IFSC&rsquo;s Tax Strategy Group and the Irish Funds Industry Association&rdquo;.  When we give concessions to these groups, the tax burden on everybody else rises, which is part of the problem with the property tax.  Those groups I have listed can just walk into the Department of Finance and walk away with massive tax concessions for extremely rich people, without analysis.  I ask the Leader to ensure that those briefing documents which were, unfortunately, so successful, will be made available to parliamentarians to consult them and to see how they won the argument.  I thought last week that those of us who think the tax burden should be spread evenly and fairly over the people had won the argument.  This seems to indicate the Revenue Commissioners are seriously unhappy about what happened and they said so yesterday to Mr. Carl O'Brien in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I felt the Seanad cut new ground when we had the conclusion of our first public consultation on older people.  I compliment Senators Zappone and O&rsquo;Keeffe for a very fine piece of work, which was well presented and completed in a very short period of four months, with clear recommendations.  I ask the Leader to consider the same approach in a number of other areas in future.  I know he is considering one immediately in the area of cancer prevention, which is laudable.</P>
        <P>Last weekend, a number of Members had the opportunity to be present at an event called Change Nation, which was about changing our nation for the better.  What we had in Dublin Castle and Farmleigh was 50 innovators and social entrepreneurs from all over the world, including Ireland, who came together to offer solutions to problems we are experiencing in health care, education, the economy and civic participation.  I can only tell the House it was vibrant, positive and solution-focused.  For example, in regard to health care, a consultant from New Mexico &mdash; a gastroenterologist &mdash; said that with the list he had before him, he could only see 4% of his patients and could never see that situation changing.  He then decided to start mentoring GPs through video-conferencing at a distance.  Two hours a week, every week of the year, they brought their cases to him and now the lists are gone.  He has not turned his GPs into doctors but he has made them experts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be very valuable to have a debate in the House on how Change Nation works and the solutions it can bring.  I also ask the Leader to consider a public consultation phase along those lines.  These innovators will be coming back to Ireland and I know they are very keen to contribute.  The Taoiseach last weekend launched a social investment fund to encourage this type of solution.  It is where people are learning to help themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House, not in regard to the household charge, although I am sure he will be before us at some stage in regard to that ongoing debacle, but to discuss the issue of planning permission and how third parties can object to planning applications that are far away from their homes or areas.  In England, people must meet certain criteria before they can object to a planning permission, for example, they must be adversely affected, from the locality or prove they will be at some loss in the event of a planning permission going ahead.  In a recent case in Kerry, a person who lived 20 miles away objected to a planning permission that would bring 35 jobs to my area in Drumquinna, which is as good as a small factory.  This week the other House is discussing the issue of planning.  We all know of cases where people object to planning permissions in the hope of getting paid off, particularly professional objectors.  They know they will bring the person seeking planning permission to the table and if given money, will go away.  That issue can be tackled by ensuring legislation is in place to provide that only people who are affected by a proposed planning in their area and can prove they will be affected can object.  That is done in other jurisdictions.  I propose an amendment to the 2009 planning Act setting out a list of criteria under which objections can be lodged.  I ask the Leader to address the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the contribution from the Senator.  It is interesting that the other House is dealing with the excess of planning permissions and the problems that stem therefrom.  His comments about what could be described as serial objectors is worthy of consideration.  In respect of his point and the matter being debated in the other House there is a need for a substantial debate on the broader planning concepts and how the mix of planning and politics, objections, support and so on can be regulated.  That could be a debate for the next few months.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fidelma Healy Eames in respect of the group to which she referred.  Although there are a number of ideas before the Seanad Public Consultation Committee it is a matter that is worthy of consideration.</P>
        <P>Senator Sean Barrett raised a pertinent matter concerning taxation in general.  We have had a number of commissions on taxation, all of which have done sterling work.  Like many reports on all topics they generally rest wearily and easily in the Oireachtas Library and in various museum type places.  We need a broad debate on taxation and the forms of taxation which will have to be introduced in the coming years.  Perhaps the Oireachtas is the best place for such a debate.  The Members of this and the other House should be the members of any commission on taxation.  It is unrealistic to expect that no new forms of taxation will be introduced but the plea must be to ensure they are fair and representative.  The debate could be kick started here in the coming months on the necessary reforms.  I ask the Leader to consider such a debate as we all know it is necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Ivana Bacik for the success yesterday in respect of the Bill that banned female genital mutilation.  The Bill was created by the Senator two years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Three years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It was a Seanad Bill and became law here yesterday.  I congratulate the Senator on her perseverance.</P>
        <P>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames referred to Change Nation which took place last weekend and was quite an event.  I support her move because it is the sort of thing we could talk about.  There has been a huge development in the past in expecting Governments to solve every problem.  What we learned at Change Nation and at another function, Students in Free Enterprise, SIFE, established yesterday, is that people are getting up and doing it themselves.  I found Change Nation fascinating.  The Senator mentioned one doctor in New Mexico.  Those of us who attended had the opportunity to sit for 45 minutes each with social entrepreneurs from around the world.  These are people who are changing the world and the way of life themselves, some came from Ireland.  One particular person, Mary Nally set up Third Age Foundation to get volunteers to help people who have retired to improve the nation.  She has also set up F&aacute;ilte Isteach the purpose of which is to ensure the newcomers to our country are welcome in their communities.  Much of the work being done is unheralded, unrecognised and unnoticed.  What Change Nation did and what SIFE is doing where it has students from around the world who give up their time to do good for their locality and their people are the issues we should debate here.</P>
        <P>Following on from a point raised by Senator Barrett, there are 141 amendments to a Bill to be debated today, approximately 100 of which are Government amendments.  It is a Seanad Bill and deserves time and attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Bacik said, the Garda Representative Association has described as astonishing the fact that Martin McDermott was transferred to Loughan House, an open prison, having had 91 previous convictions.  The Minister has said it was a mistake and that measures would be put in place to ensure such a occurrence was not repeated.  He was convicted for the manslaughter of a garda.  We expect the Garda to protect us as citizens.  The Garda is special and over and above ordinary citizens.  If we expect them to put their lives on the line for us, as legislators we should ensure their lives are protected in the ordinary line of duty.  What sanctions will be imposed on those who made the mistakes because it is only by sanctions that one learns?  While a system must be in place to ensure there is no recidivism and education facilities, Garda Gary McLoughlin&rsquo;s family cannot visit him, he is dead.  I thought we did treat the Garda as a special category in respect of the prison system.  This is a sad day for the Garda force in that Martin McDermott has been allowed escape.  Not only had he 91 previous convictions but while he was in prison for the manslaughter of Garda Gary McLoughlin he had breached the rules, therefore, he was not entitled to be transferred to Loughan House.  I ask that the matter be investigated even though there is a report on the issue.  I want the report discussed in the House to ensure the Garda we put on the streets are safe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>D&eacute;anaim tagairt do rud ad&uacute;irt an Ceannaire agus an leas-Cheannaire inniu maidir leis an muirear teallaigh.  Yesterday and today, the Leader and Deputy Leader mentioned that the household charge is part of the EU-IMF deal.  I seek clarification on that issue.  Perhaps they will indicate at what page in the memorandum of understanding it is stated.  We have been looking for it but cannot find it.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to a matter I raised yesterday and Tuesday, which the Leader did not address, namely, the debate on the Mahon tribunal.  We have had a report, which has been 15 years in the making, 400 witnesses and which cost hundreds of millions of euro, on corruption in political life and we still have no indication of a date for a debate on it.  Prior to publication the Leader said we would have a comprehensive debate on it.  Members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party have indicated they would like to have a debate on it, therefore, why have we not had the debate?  The other House has had a three-day debate on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the Senator had listened to me on Tuesday he would have got an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In fairness, the Leader said he would come back to us on it on Tuesday.  Where is the urgency on this issue?  When the issue of the prayer that opens our daily proceedings was raised, we had a swift debate, which I welcomed, but we have not had a debate or an indication regarding a debate on the Mahon tribunal report, which has serious ramifications for political life.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we have a debate on the Mahon tribunal today.  I am willing to withdraw the amendment if the debate cannot be facilitated today but can be arranged for next Tuesday or Wednesday.  The report is being debated throughout the country, in the media and in cafeterias and workplaces.  It is being talked about in the D&aacute;il bar and cafeteria.  Why can we not debate it in the House?  The report is being debated for a third day in the D&aacute;il today.  This is a huge issue and people are asking whether the issues highlighted in the report are still going on.  For example, there has been a lack of action on the Moriarty tribunal recommendations.  People were asking why Denis O'Brien was standing on the same podium as the Taoiseach.  There are huge issues around the Mahon tribunal.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have proposed an amendment to the Order of Business that we discuss the report today.  This is a serious amendment.  We should stop beating around the bush and avoiding this issue.  This hugely important issue deserves to be debated in the Upper House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Daly&rsquo;s contention that we need to tighten the process of objecting to planning permissions in the context of who, how and why.  There is significant anecdotal evidence that large sums have been paid by those seeking permission to objectors to facilitate and encourage them to withdraw their objections, which is not acceptable.  We need to examine how best to ensure that if an objection is made to a planning permission, it is legitimate and is not a rogue objection or somebody trying to make a few quid.</P>
        <P>I support the call of previous speakers, including Senator Bacik, for a debate on the Irish Prison Service.  Overall, the service is doing a good job but what happened in the case of Martin McDermott was appalling.  I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and it was refreshing to hear the director general of the Irish Prison Service, Mr. Michael Donnellan, putting his hands up without making excuses or trying to spin what happened.  He made a plain apology.  His staff know they were wrong and they are putting procedures in place to ensure they do not get it wrong again.  It was a sad day for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when a prisoner convicted of the manslaughter of a member of the force was able to escape in this manner.  Thankfully, procedures will be in place to ensure this will not happen again, which is welcome.  I also asked the director general during the meeting how many other prisoners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have had extensive debates on the household charge and it has featured intensively in the media for a long time.  It might be well worth our while to have a discussion on why the campaign against the charge has gathered such momentum.  It has taken us all by surprise.  One of the reasons for it is the perceived anomalies and inequities in the taxation system.  For instance, if somebody is in receipt of perks or concessions, it is not always fully understood why that might be happening, even when there is a valid reason for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have paid the household charge and fully understand and support the Government's position on it because it would be hypocritical to join a campaign or jump on a bandwagon simply to oppose it because of the discontent felt by people.  However, apart from the methodology of presenting this to the people and the threats that were made, which were wrong from the beginning, the fact the same &euro;100 applies to everyone is an issue.  It was not sufficient for us to know it was an interim measure and that a proper household tax will be put in place when the database is put together and appropriate valuations are used.  If one lives in a particular area in a small house and is living on a low income, one must pay &euro;100 but, down the road, a millionaire living in a mansion only has to pay the same amount.  We must examine this perception.</P>
        <P>The same principle applies to the proposal for taxing foreign executives.  There must be another way of dealing with that because it amounts to preferential treatment.  The same could be said of the value of an Irish person&rsquo;s work.  If he or she is giving a service in the community, one could argue on the same premise that he or she should get preferential treatment.  I would like to debate the taxation system because the discontent will not go away.  The minute the household charge database is put together and a new system is introduced, the same opposition will be experienced.</P>
        <P>It was suggested that if 50% of householders paid the tax before the deadline, this would be hailed as a success but it is an admission of failure.  If that same measurement was applied to all other taxes, the Exchequer would have a serious problem.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm.  The success of the trade mission to China has not been recognised because of the household charge and Mahon tribunal report issues.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is doing an excellent good and perhaps some of that is down to pressure Senator Mary White has put on him.  The trade mission has been a great success.  China is a source of foreign direct investment as well as exports.  This is important because 90% of our economic growth is expected to come from outside the EU in the years to come.  As chairman of Dundalk Town Council in 2007, I welcomed the first Chinese manufacturing facility, SATIR, to Ireland.  The company recently announced expansion plans, which will lead to the creation of 200 new jobs.  I hope that is the first of many similar announcements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator D&rsquo;Arcy on his deft linguistic analysis of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s utterances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to focus on one word, namely &ldquo;rehabilitation.&rdquo;  I was present to hear the director general of the Irish Prison Service apologise for what happened when Mr. Martin McDermott absconded from Loughan House.  While it is right that people are annoyed, angry and hurt by what happened, and it is appropriate that the apology was made, I am concerned, as Senator Bacik said, about any possible chilling effect which could take place as a result of appropriate decisions made on rehabilitation, in particular the use of open prisons.  We should bear in mind the statistic mentioned by the Senator, namely, that only 6% of people are incarcerated in open prisons compared with a much higher average in other countries, in particular Nordic countries, and how useful they are from a rehabilitation point of view.  The apology is appropriate but it is also appropriate that we would not lose sight of the bigger picture.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">On rehabilitation and its connection to the Mahon tribunal, one of the problems with the tribunal culture is that we have arrived at a situation where there seems to be very little possibility for redemption or rehabilitation of people.  That leads to people, on the one hand, going into a spiral of denial and, on the other, going into a spiral of condemnation.  Having regard to what the Minister, Deputy Burton, said about Mr. Denis O'Brien in the D&aacute;il, I am worried there is a creeping culture of judgmentalism where people are being inappropriately tarred for all time, even when they have a significant contribution to make to the benefit of the country.  The Minister,  does not seem to have a problem with the Taoiseach sharing a platform with Mr. Wen Jiabao or Mr. Xi Jinping in Beijing.  Just because they have not been found guilty of anything in a tribunal does not mean they do not have very serious questions to answer in terms of human rights.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On a positive note, I welcome the fact there has been a significant increase in the number of people paying the household charge.  I encourage people to continue to make payments in the next couple of days.  The moneys raised are going to provide services in local communities.  I deplore the fact that people who are paid from the public purse has been actively campaigning against the household charge.  Some elements of the media have not covered themselves in glory and have drummed up all sorts of opposition to the charge.  Some have encouraged people not to pay the charge but rather to pay it to a charity.  One journalist has been doing that on a radio show.  Not so long ago Mr. Ray D'Arcy said--</P>

We all welcome the high profile visit of the Taoiseach and Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to China and the wonderful international coverage it is getting.  It would be very appropriate for the Minister to come before the House and I ask the Leader to arrange that at an appropriate date.  We should have an update on the international visits that have taken place in recent months, particularly the activities that took place over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s weekend.  We could get a synopsis from the Minister on the level of contacts made and expected outcomes of the significant visits.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  He mentioned the memorandum of understanding and whether the household charge was in it.  I was one of those who examined the memorandum and saw no reference to the household charge.  Regardless of that, there was reference in the memorandum to the minimum wage, the cut to which was reversed.  There was also a reference to increases in income tax, yet the Government renegotiated that.  It is irrelevant whether the household charge was in the document.</P>
        <P>The previous speaker on the Government side shows the frustration and desperation that is coming through from the Government.  It is evident in the fact it is blaming broadcasters, the media and politicians for the fact it made a complete shambles of the tax.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader about a very serious matter, namely, the sit-in by hundreds of workers who worked for Game.  It is shameful that in 21st century Ireland a company can shut its doors, not pay its workforce and give them no notice whatsoever.  Workers have not received redundancy forms, rather they were sent UK redundancy forms in the post.  They are due holiday and sick pay and other entitlements.  Is this company in breach of employment rights legislation?  How can a company simply shut its doors?  There is a collective agreement of 30 days' notice in place.  Is the company not trading in Ireland?  Has it gone bust?  Has a receiver been appointed?  Why is it allowed to do this?  It is a very serious issue.  We saw what happened with Waterford Crystal, Vita Cortex, La Senza, Lagan Brick and many other companies in the past few months who have shut their doors and not paid workers their entitlements.  It is high time we had a debate in the House on employment rights and the abuse of them in this country.</P>

I refer to Change Nation and Ashoka which organised events last weekend in Farmleigh and the Mansion House.  There are an extraordinary bunch of social entrepreneurs and social innovators from Ms Caroline Casey to Mr. Mick Quinn.  They work in areas such as agriculture, creating jobs, tourism and democracy.  It would be helpful for the Seanad to hear other parts of civil society represented.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I draw the attention of the Leader and Members to a banner headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  Mr. Eoin O&rsquo; Malley, who is billed as a teacher in Irish politics in Dublin City University, has written an article.  Its banner headline proclaims: &ldquo;Mahon just another nail in coffin for dying Fianna F&aacute;il&rdquo;.  The subheading helpfully adds "There is no hope for the once dominant party".  As an interested party and vice president of Fianna F&aacute;il who is committed to the party's renewal, I have read and reread the article to find a context for these funereal conclusions but failed to find these statements in the article.  In searching for a possible explanation I wonder if the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> inadvertently omitted these words from the author's submitted article.</P>

I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Mark Daly that there are people &mdash; I am aware of some in my constituency &mdash; who are merely seeking pay-back by objecting for the sake of it or even in the expectation that a planning applicant might offer them money to drop their objection.  As the Senator observed, they do not necessarily live in the immediate vicinity of the site or property in respect of which the planning application has been lodged.  Will the Leader agree to a debate on the implementation of decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  In some cases, it takes years for rulings to be executed.  In my county, for example, a building constructed without planning permission is still intact after three and a half years, despite proceedings being issued by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for its removal.  We must have a detailed debate in this House on all aspects of planning.</P>

In regard to RTE&rsquo;s LW 252 service, that issue was flagged more than two years ago from the other side of the House.

        <P>Senators Ivana Bacik, C&aacute;it Keane, Martin Conway and others called for a debate on prisons, particularly in the light of the recent escape of a prisoner convicted of the manslaughter of a garda.  It was a very regrettable incident, but I welcome the apology by the director of the Irish Prison Service at a meeting this morning of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, to attend the House for a debate on crime and prisons which I hope will take place after Easter.</P>
        <P>Senators Sean D. Barrett and Feargal Quinn asked that sufficient time be afforded for the debate on the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011.

	<P>Senators Fidelma Healy Eames, Fiach Mac Conghail and Feargal Quinn asked that certain issues be debated by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  The committee published an excellent report yesterday on the rights of older people.  It was unfortunate that, once again, there was no one in attendance from the media.  There is a problem for this House in general in attaining sufficient coverage for the great body of work in which we are engaged in many areas.  I compliment everybody involved with the report which I hope will receive the coverage and action by the Government that it deserves in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In regard to requests that the Seanad Public Consultation Committee discuss issues including Change Nation and social entrepreneurs, these requests may be submitted to the committee which has already agreed to examine a number of issues but others may be tabled for consideration.  I advise Members who have made suggestions in this regard to be specific in their submissions.  If there is too broad a range of issues to discuss, it will not be possible to compile a proper report.  Members might agree on an issue on which we could all focus and I will certainly consider it as a matter for public consultation.</P>
        <P>Several speakers referred to planning regulations and the issue of nuisance objections.  It is unfortunate that some of these issues were not raised with the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning when she was in the Chamber for two hours yesterday.  Nevertheless, we will arrange to have her come to the House again.  She is scheduled to attend after Easter for the debate on the report of the Mahon tribunal.  There may be an opportunity to raise these issues during that debate, or we may have a separate debate on planning issues, if such is deemed necessary.</P>
        <P>Senators Sean D. Barrett and Paul Bradford called for a debate on taxation, with particular reference to the concerns expressed by Revenue regarding the tax breaks introduced by the Minister for Finance.  I am not in a position to provide the information requested by Senator Sean D. Barrett, but I will raise the issue with the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked for a debate on the report of the Mahon tribunal.  I indicated on Tuesday that I would meet the group leaders to arrange a date after Easter for this debate.  That meeting will take place after the Order of Business today.  I also said on Tuesday that I would allow ample time for a considered debate on the report.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (1), between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;&ldquo;recognised within the Framework&rdquo; includes being recognised within, aligned to, included in, or referenced to, the Framework, following adjudication or validation in that regard by the Authority;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The term, &ldquo;recognised within the Framework&rdquo; is used quite a lot within the Bill and obviously is a significant phrase.  In common with other Members, I have been contacted by City &amp; Guilds, which expressed concern about the need for the term, &ldquo;recognised within the Framework&rdquo;, to be defined to facilitate a clearer definition throughout the Bill as to what is meant by the term.  Consequently, the amendment proposes to change the definition to limit it to the allocation of awards that have been subject to a formal process of the authority, such as alignment of awards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The term, &ldquo;recognised within the Framework&rdquo;, arises from the policies and procedures the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, has developed to underpin the national framework of qualifications.  Initially, the focus was on including and recognising the awards of Irish statutory awarding bodies but the focus was broadened under the policies to encompass areas such as professional awards, awards of international awarding bodies such as City &amp; Guilds and even industry awards such as those made by Microsoft.  This open approach is relatively unusual in framework development internationally and would be regarded as quite innovative.  It extends the possibilities offered by the framework to a much broader set of award holders.</P>
        <P>Much of this has been possible because the legislative underpinning for the framework in the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 was simple.  The Act allowed the framework to be elaborated through the policies and procedures of the NQAI and this is being continued in this Bill.  Including this definition in the Bill might limit the capacity of the authority to develop new forms of recognition or adapt to international developments, which take place daily.  The new authority will continue to work with partners to ensure and enhance the inclusive nature of the framework.  That is important.</P>

	<P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on amendment No. 4.  I will speak about the rationale for amendments Nos. 77 and 124.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 77 is concerned with the recognition of awards granted outside the State.  While I accept that section 73 is capable of giving some recognition within the State to international rewards, such recognition does not appear to be as robust as that given within the framework; there seems to be a distinction between the two.  There may be a need, therefore, for specific implementation powers for the authority to receive and adjudicate on applications from awarding bodies outside the State for the recognition of awards within the State.  Such awards should end up with the same status as those which have gone through a similar validation process.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 124, again I appreciate that there is no intention to take away from or diminish the status of international awards already aligned with the framework.  That is clear and the Bill deals with awards already aligned with the framework following a formal process involving the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.  It might be necessary, however, to amend the legislation to confirm in law the continuity of that recognition.</P>
        <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State outlined the reasoning these issues do not appear to have been addressed in the Bill.  Does he consider amendments are needed to ensure clarity and the status of international awards, in particular.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland has used the flexibility offered by the 1999 Act to work with international counterparts.  We have seen a number of examples of this happening.  Section 9(1)(<i>m</i>) sets out as a general function of the authority that there be co-operation with international bodies.  A similar general function in the 1999 Act allowed the authority to develop partnerships and a memorandum of understanding with peer regulators in other jurisdictions.  For example, an agreement has been put in place with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in the United Kingdom to assure the activities of UK awarding bodies operating in Ireland.  This has enabled bodies such as City &amp; Guilds to align awards with our national framework of qualifications.  It is only when this arrangement remains in place that recognition through the framework can take place.  The exercise of this function is most flexibly covered through the policies and procedures of the authority.  On that basis, it would be difficult to support the inclusion of a separate process in the Bill.  The framework as a whole is continued in the Bill and includes all existing awards, including those of international bodies.  Any agreements in place will not be compromised in any way by the provisions of this new Bill.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, line 27, to delete line 24 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(1) The general functions of the Authority, other than in relation to the previously established universities, shall be to--</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) comply with section 14 of the Act of 1997,</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State.  We had a significant debate on this issue in July and I was disappointed that so few of the elements we had discussed were incorporated into the Bill.  The functions in respect of quality assurance in the university sector are best exercised by that sector.  If we are to abolish the Irish Universities Quality Board, as intended in the Bill, in order to transfer its powers to a new super-quango, it will add an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.  With this amendment I am trying to preserve the powers for universities to take responsibility for the courses they provide.  They already have an international trademark and publish research and recruit staff internationally.  They are better known than the Irish quality mark it is proposed to introduce.</P>
        <P>In assessing layers of bureaucracy in the education sector the Government should have given responsibility for the qualifications they award and have been awarding, in our case since 1592, to the institutions.  It is completely unnecessary to have a new layer of bureaucracy inserted in this fashion.  If we wanted to abolish the Irish Universities Quality Board, there should have been consultation.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General considered this issue in his report, he indicated that it had been founded in 2002 as an independent body with a board comprising the nominees of the HEA, employer and trade union bodies, national and international education bodies, with one third of its members being nominated by the universities.  It is funded by subscriptions from seven Irish universities and an annual grant from the HEA.</P>
        <P>The idea that there be one national quango to validate everything from PhDs and post-doctoral work down to short courses in hairdressing, etc. seems to be completely bizarre and ignores the debate we had on the issue.  It also ignores what is happening in Irish universities.  One of the results has been the creation of a layer of bureaucracy in respect of quality assurance, which means nothing to the man or woman giving lectures, as they are evaluated by external examiners and the quality of graduates.  I am delighted to tell the House that at a board meeting yesterday I heard that the level of unemployment among TCD graduates was 5%; therefore, we are three times better than in the economy as a whole, in which the unemployment rate is nearly 15%.  Internationally accredited external examiners validate courses, questions and the marking.  Students who apply to universities across the world may be accepted in the likes of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford and Cambridge universities.  As Ireland has a small home market, research must be published internationally.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>An bord snip nua recommended the abolition of the Higher Education Authority, but now we will also have Qualifications and Quality Assurance Ireland, which will divert money away from education and the lecture hall.  I am proposing that the university sector not be a part of this.  If there is dissatisfaction with the Irish Universities Quality Board, shunting it to another board is not the solution.  We should consider whether we need it and, given that the international standing of Irish universities has been at such a high level for decades or centuries, whether we need a State body in charge.  How will the eight people appointed by the Minister know if somebody is good in the fields of thermodynamics or advanced econometrics?  They will not; they will rely on the university concerned for such information.  Therefore, the exercise is flawed as it is applied to universities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the quality control process is not to validate courses in thermodynamics or PhDs in nanotechnology.  Section 9 sets out specifically that the general functions will not necessarily apply to all providers in the same way.  For example, the authority will not be obliged to validate programmes of education and training in a provider which has its own awarding powers such as a university.  It is not necessary to specify which functions will apply to different providers at this point, as the relevant sections of the Bill set out the precise requirements for the different providers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I concur with Senator Barrett that we have a successful and effective third level sector and structure.  Last year, a survey carried out by EU Finance Ministers concluded that Ireland had the most employable graduates in the European Union.  There is no question that the university sector is performing exceptionally well in this area.  What we are not seeking to do is allow or require the new authority to validate the efficacy of any course in a university.  We seek to ensure that we, as a nation, can stand over the efficacy of the universities&rsquo; own quality assurance process.  That alone is what we are doing.</P>
        <P>Universities will continue to regulate their own affairs and their academic staff will continue to work in an atmosphere of free inquiry as provided for under the Universities Act 1997.  We have proposed amendment No. 39 to make clear that the authority&rsquo;s power of direction is limited to the effectiveness and implementation of quality assurance procedures.  It does not extend further than that.  This would only follow a review of effectiveness which would be undertaken by an external, expert panel in the area of quality assurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State most sincerely for his response, which is good to hear.  As he will be aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General examined all these matters in his resource management study.  What he found was that the funds provided for this purpose were top-sliced from the teaching budget.  Top-slicing is a word I hate and is regarded in golf as ending up in a bunker.  Much of the quality assurance work in universities ended up in a bunker because the Comptroller and Auditor General found that bureaucracy in universities had vastly increased.  One has people watching over those who are giving the lectures and the Minister of State indicated he appreciates this.  I applaud the finding that standards were adhered to but money was being diverted into layers of bureaucracy.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report noted that the &ldquo;quality office&rdquo; supplies information to &ldquo;important strategic enablers&rdquo; and &ldquo;has provided better management information for senior institutional management, and better feedback mechanisms for institutional governance.&rdquo;  Moreover, it notes that &ldquo;significant restructuring&rdquo; has taken place &ldquo;in terms of academic structures and in terms of administration and management structures.&rdquo;  This is all managerialism.  The important issues are whether lecturer X knows enough, has reached the top international standards and communicates this to students.  We have a structure in the universities that measures things that do not count, namely, improving management structures and so forth.  A university is not a managerial institution but a collegial institution based on the Irish tradition of the muinteoir who must communicate with students.  The layers of bureaucracy already associated with this process are taking money away from where it is needed in education.  This is confirmed by my reading of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate the clarification provided by the Minister of State, I wonder whether the exercise is worthwhile.  As he noted, the academic side is not part of the process.  As to the institutional side, why can we not take a lecturer&rsquo;s salary, divide it by a number of students and add a certain amount for overheads.  In 2010, when the Comptroller and Auditor General examined how the accounts were prepared to qualify for quality assurance standards, the most recent accounts he could find for the sector were from 2002.  The legislation will impose an additional burden on the educational budget and take resources from the classroom and lecture hall to perform an administrative exercise which could be done in a much more simple manner.  It may not deliver any return and will divert resources.  Those are my concerns.</P>
        <P>While I welcome amendment No. 39, there is serious concern that quality assurance, as practised in Irish universities, does not measure anything important and results in the waste of large amounts of money on the performance of administrative and managerial tasks that could be done in a much more simple manner.  A university is not a managerial system.  One needs good lecturing and one must attract good students.  One also needs an international reputation and one must keep down costs.  The new quango established in the universities has cost money and created problems, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has found.  What are we measuring and why are we spending money on it when we need this money in the education system, particularly at this time of difficulty with the public finances?  This process is entirely bureaucrat driven and will not improve the standard of poetry, engineering, music or any of the other subjects taught in Irish universities.  On the contrary, it will make life more difficult for those who are trying to teach in the face of such administrative burdens, time wasting and interference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have just returned from a visit to China where I visited nine universities and met the Minister for education who has responsibility for 166 million students.  While I may like to believe this little island on the edge of Europe is foremost in everyone&rsquo;s mind, in China, Singapore, Malaysia and India, that is not the case.  People in the countries I have visited or am about to visit regard Irish education as a brand.  It is a valuable brand internationally.  Ireland&rsquo;s biggest export to China is education.  If we are to stand over this brand internationally, we must have some form of quality assurance process that we can all stand over.  In selling the brand internationally to Chinese, Malaysian and Singaporean students we need to be able to state that, as a nation, we are proud of what we have achieved and can trust the quality assurance process underpinning educational provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Why would the universities have collectively established the Irish Universities Quality Body, IUQB, if they did not see merit in the quality assurance process it provides?  I reiterate that it was never proposed that members of the new quality assurance body would sit in on lectures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant savings will accrue from the amalgamation of the various quality assurance bodies.  In 2008, for example, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, had a combined staffing level of 110.  This figure has since reduced to 88.  It would not have been possible to maintain an acceptable level of service to learners and providers with a 25% reduction in staff had it not been for the pooling of resources and integration of corporate supports underpinning the institutions in question that occurred in preparing for the amalgamation of these institutions.  The annual Exchequer allocation to the various bodies has declined from slightly more then &euro;13.5 million in 2008 to slightly more than &euro;7.5 million in 2012.  This has been achieved with major co-operative efforts between all the bodies in preparation for amalgamation.  The amalgamation will, therefore, deliver significant savings and I hope these savings will be channelled into precisely the areas Senator Barrett suggests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the amendment being pressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I thank the Minister of State for his clarification.  The key issue is that an external examiner from outside the country who is qualified in engineering, economics or whatever in the relevant subject already assesses university courses.  It is the fault of the universities that they do not stress to the Minister and his officials that they already undergo external examinations.  The external examiner is rarely mentioned in such discussions and the more is the pity.  If a course is not good, it will not attract students, its graduates will not be employed or be accepted in the best graduate schools worldwide and the research published by departmental staff will not secure widespread international recognition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I appreciate the context in which this intervention is being made, I would have abolished the Irish Universities Quality Body.  Trinity College Dublin has a reputation in China and has a sizeable number of graduates in Hong Kong who did not need a QQAI rosette stuck on the end of their degree because the quality of their qualification was known.  While it is not attributable to the Minister of State or the Minister, an immense layer of bureaucracy grew up in the past decade which took more and more money out of education.  I would be more radical and return responsibility for quality to those who are best qualified and have the best international contacts.  A mega-quango of the size suggested would be a cost base.  As someone who has been at the coalface lecturing to students, there has been no valued added from the exercise to date and I see little value in transferring this exercise to a body which has such a wide range of responsibilities.  The IUQB staff should be reassigned to other duties and universities made responsible for the work done by these staff.    The Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out to the Committee of Public Accounts that those with the administrative and managerial titles, which are unnecessary in a university, were the ones who went on to earn more than &euro;200,000.  That was three times as much as those doing the work got and those who do the work are delighted to do it and have the contact with the students to meet all the standards the Minister sees as desirable.  To have some kind of nebulous checking of irrelevant detail by people costing three times as much per head seems pointless.  As quangos also develop regulatory creep, they will be back for more as they attempt to extend their powers, which is what happened in this case.  In the case of the universities, the exercise was not necessary.  I thank the Minister for his reassurance in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill has been around for years.  It predates the Minister and probably two or three others given the rate of turnover.  It should have been re-evaluated at even the most basic level.  I cannot see the need for it and in that context I am tabling these amendments.  I am glad I am <i>ad idem</i> with the Minister and I hope public policy in general would recognise that having people supervising people who are already doing an international job and giving out a national qualification is a redundant exercise.  The universities must operate internationally or they will sink.  Setting up a national bureaucracy to supervise international institutions will not work.  It has not worked to date, that is my complaint.  The IUQB has cost too much.  It was a silly exercise to begin with and it has not accomplished anything because the quality of an English department, for instance, in an Irish university depends on those in it and their international reputation.  Someone from the IUQB lurking in the background pretending to understand English literature to a greater extent than those who work in the field does not add any value to what we want to do.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State.  These were my concerns.  This measure was not driven by educational considerations, certainly as far as the universities were concerned.  That was a pity because this kind of measure causes demoralisation of staff, with yet another set of bureaucrats to report to.  The best part of what we do is when we relate to our students and the academic world in other countries.  Relating to bureaucracy simply wastes a lot of time and money.</P>

The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was one of the proponents of this practice.  It would enhance the role of the Seanad.  It is undesirable for so much power to rest with the Minister, to appoint the entire board without representation from the provider bodies.  I would prefer something more representative.  This could be a role for the Seanad that would be important as we try to play a constructive role in the task the Government faces in putting back together a country that had to be rescued by the IMF not that long ago.  That is the purpose.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business this morning I raised a report that appeared in yesterday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> about lobbying that took place for certain measures to be inserted in the Finance Act.  We must stop bypassing parliament in the governance of this country and this is an attempt to change that policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  This House could play a very useful role in approving appointments to governing bodies and State agencies in general.  It is one of the key ways in which the role of the House could be reformed.  I accept that this could occur on the recommendation of the Minister.  For example, the Minister could put a candidate&rsquo;s name before the House and allow Members to discuss it and have the person vetted prior to appointment.  That procedure is followed in other jurisdictions and it appears to work well.  I urge the Minister of State to consider the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill provides that the chief executive officer, CEO, shall be appointed by the authority with the consent of the Minister.  I do not understand the assertion that a ministerial appointment is somehow bypassing the parliamentary process.  A Minister&rsquo;s role is at the heart of the parliamentary process.</P>
        <P>This is a standard provision regarding the appointment of a CEO of a non-commercial State body and I do not support giving this executive power to the Oireachtas.  It is important that CEOs are accountable to the Oireachtas and they must appear before Oireachtas committees.  This is covered in sections 17 and 18.  The subsection that is proposed to be deleted provides for the Minister to designate a person to be appointed a first chief executive of the authority.  This will ensure the chief executive is in place to head the authority from the day of its establishment.  A CEO-designate who was a CEO of the Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB, was recruited in October 2010 and he currently acts as CEO of the NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and the IUQB.  He is a very busy individual.  The CEO-designate is overseeing administrative preparations for the establishment of the authority and the Minister intends that he will serve as its first CEO.  The CEO appointments thereafter will be made by the authority with the consent of the Minister.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, lines 13 to 33, to delete subsections (3) to (5).</P>
        <P FLI="0">Subsection (3), which I am seeking to delete, provides that the chief executive shall not be required to give account before a committee for any matter which has been or may be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State.  It is almost the negative version of what the Minister of State just said, that the chief executive would appear before Oireachtas committees and be answerable to them as an alternative to the chief executive being appointed by the committee.  The Minister of State said that a few minutes ago and I agree with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These subsections inhibit the ability of the person to speak.  They are extremely strange.  This goes back to something the Minister of State and I agreed earlier, that in education there is discussion, dissent and contrary ideas.  That is its lifeblood.  It is not a branch of the Civil Service.  Why can this executive not join in the discussions?  Everybody else does.  Why is he muzzled?  It is very strange.  There are provisions in general law that people cannot speak on proceedings that are taking place in the courts, but we have discussions when the verdicts are handed down.  The Members of the Oireachtas are currently reading the final Mahon tribunal report.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand the motivation for this section and why we would choose somebody to take an important role in education and then tell him he is not allowed to talk.  I understand there were some health provisions which sought to do the same thing, whereby people who were dissatisfied with the health service would not be allowed to speak out.  They were not very desirable either.  However, such provisions are particularly undesirable where education is concerned.  It is not a body of knowledge that is frozen and passed down by order of the Minister, the QQAAI or anybody else.  It is constantly evolving and it evolves better if there is full and frank discussion at all times, with everybody participating.  I cannot imagine an education system operating in any other way.</P>
        <P>I propose that these muzzles be removed from the chief executive.  I am at a loss to figure out why they are there in the first instance.  Education must be open and have plenty of discussion, involving Ministers, Senators and others, as well as this chief executive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment.  Section 18(3) provides that the chief executive shall not be required to give account before a committee for any matter which is, has been or may be the subject of proceedings before a court or a tribunal in the State.  Whatever about a matter that is <i>sub judice</i>, it is extraordinary to rule out discussions afterwards on issues that have been subject to court proceedings or to be able theoretically to rule out anything on the basis that is may later be subject to court proceedings.  It appears to give huge scope for lack of accountability to a committee.  It is entirely unnecessary.  There are already legal protections regarding how committees do their business and if there is a genuine legal problem, there are mechanisms for dealing with that.  However, to remove completely any role for the committee in this respect is entirely disproportionate and unnecessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The subsections proposed for deletion by the amendment are standard provisions found throughout many legislative measures dealing with the accountability of the chief executive to Oireachtas committees other than the Committee of Public Accounts.  The provision exempting CEOs from being required to give account of a matter before a court or a tribunal is important to ensure the integrity of such proceedings is protected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of CEOs expressing views on the merits of Government policy, it is very important that CEOs are only required to account for the performance of their own organisation in carrying out Government policy and the various functions given to it by the Oireachtas.  I agree with Senator Barrett that it is healthy and wise to have ongoing and effective debate, and indeed dissent, as to how we should implement education policy in this country.  However, it is not the role of the CEO to get involved in that process in a public manner.  Perhaps the CEO - I am sure this is the case - will have the opportunity to have internal discussions with the Minister on a regular basis.  The forum and opportunity for that debate and dissent is the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is where that type of discussion should take place.  Once we arrive at a conclusion as to what policy direction we should take, it is the role of the CEO to move his organisation along that path, not to question it any further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  The reply shows that the CEO is regarded as the Minister&rsquo;s preacher and public servant.  That is not what education is about.  Under further provisions in the Bill he is not allowed to discuss the merits of any policy of the Government or of a Minister of the Government.  Imagine what an extension of that into the university sector would do.  It would destroy universities and society.  My predecessor, Dr. Owen Sheehy Skeffington, became a Member of the Seanad at a time when society regarded the beating of children in schools as normal.  He fought against that.  Consider all the things Dr. Mary Robinson challenged as a Member of this House.  She is now chancellor of the university.  Women were not allowed to serve on juries.  Presumably, their brains were too small to understand cases.  One must allow people in education to participate.  What kind of Easter teacher conferences will we have otherwise?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have always abhorred the Nuremberg defence that this was an order.  This provision is an order that one shall avail of the Nuremberg defence and which turns a man or woman into some kind of dumb creature of the Minister who has no views on any Government policy.  He will be the only person in Irish education who has no views.  It leads to things like the banking collapse.  What people in the Central Bank knew what was going on?  It contradicts the whistleblower&rsquo;s charter, which I will be supporting fully when the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague brings it before the House.  I do not want somebody operating this key position in Irish education who will say nothing.  The saying goes, "Whatever you do, say nothing at all", but that is what has a large part of this society the way it is.  To bring it into education confirms to me that this is just another bureaucracy.  This person will be so unrepresentative in Irish education that he will have no views on Government policy.  It is utterly bizarre and totalitarian.  I hope the Minister of State will reconsider this matter on Report Stage and take the muzzle off the man in some way because we need a wide-ranging debate on Irish education.</P>

Stage.  </P><P Just="Left">Who drew up the merits and objectives of this policy, and what kind of Ireland do they envisage?  It is appalling.  The essence of education is that there are differing views and we discuss them.  Nobody has all the wisdom, yet in this case he does not need to answer to anybody or take part in any discussions because he knows he has the power and everybody else can go away, as it were.  It completely contradicts the way in which Ireland projects itself as a country with free debate and free elections.  If we bring in any more of these measures I really worry about the future of Irish democracy.  These people are paid highly from the public purse.  At the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform recently, I supported Deputy Peter Mathews's point that the Central Bank governor is subject to a parliamentary democracy.  He came in and eloquently and brilliantly explained the position.  He had to be summoned but it was good for the country in that he tried to get the &euro;3.1 billion problem solved by the end of the month.  However, it strikes me as bizarre in this day and age to create another post where somebody is not allowed to discuss the merits and objectives of any Government policy.  When a country has to be rescued by the IMF, we have to reform the entire governance and see where the faults are.  People who sing dumb, as required by this legislation, are no asset to the country.  I ask the Minister of State to rethink this matter before Report Stage.  Let us have all the debates we want and take the muzzles off.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid that I cannot support the amendment.  Although it has been a pleasure to listen to Senator Barrett&rsquo;s breadth of knowledge, in this case the CEO would be in the same position as the CEO of a VEC or a county manager.  They implement policies and one must have a separation of powers.  It is not about muzzling anybody.  I have learned a lot from many CEOs and county managers in my time.  There is a separation of functions and powers, however, and it is not an educational matter.  I am sure the CEO can chat about educational matters but he must see that policies are implemented correctly.  In that regard, I will not be supporting this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In his earlier contribution, Senator Barrett mentioned the former President Mary Robinson and how she used this Chamber to inspire debate and significant policy movements in a number of areas across the body politic.  These are the fora where such discussions take place.  Once they have taken place and we decide on the direction, it is the CEO&rsquo;s role to implement that direction.  Can the CEO form part of those discussions?  I would say that he or she most certainly can and should.  If they are involved in the day-to-day running of an organisation which is there to ensure the very highest quality in educational provision, they must engage, and I am sure that the existing CEOs of the former quality awarding bodies already are engaging, regularly with the Minister.  They must have discussions on the direction in which the organisations should be moving.</P>
        <P>I do not think it appropriate, however, that the CEO of such an organisation should comment publicly about his or her support, or lack of support, for a particular policy direction.  That would lead to a lot of disorder and dysfunction in administering the quality awarding authority.  I do not think it is manageable or acceptable and it would not work on a day-to-day basis.  The CEO is there to implement the policy once established, and while that is not to say that the CEO cannot have a role in discussing and formulating that policy, it should not be in the public domain where he or she could appear in the national news media questioning the very <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of such a policy.  I do not think that would be acceptable.  It would lead to a disorderly functioning of that organisation and any other organisation where such a CEO was in place.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not press it for the moment.  We are really intruding at this stage into the way Ireland&rsquo;s education operates.  I thank the Minister of State for his reference to the work of people like Mary Robinson.  She grew up in a system where, for example, the provost of Trinity College would never say he was the CEO and that others should stay quiet and touch the forelock.  That is the nature of education.  In my own case, I never believed in national airlines but that was Government policy.  I would argue against requiring people in education to touch the forelock to Government policy and not use their brains.  Like many others, I do not believe the banks should have been bailed out.  Why can people not express opinions on public policy?  It is too totalitarian for people in education.  We need more ideas around the system.  I appreciate what the Minister of State says about the administrative requirements, but it will make this person a complete administrator and utterly out of touch.  Nobody in the education system can pull rank like that, claiming to be the one who is right and telling others not to criticise public policy because they know it all and the others do not.  The nature of education is that these discussions should take place.  To make it as rigid and regimented as this, with somebody operating in the way that is envisaged in this Bill, is bizarre to my mind.  Maybe the person in question will have to get rid of his television because Government policy is criticised all the time.  That is how we advance towards better policies.  That is what we are trying to do at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is why I opposed national airlines and the rescue of banks, and will continue to do so.  It is the role of education to have that level of questioning.  It is not supposed to be totalitarian as envisaged in this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will see if something can happen on Report Stage.  The Minister of State might consider that.  The president of the University of Limerick has views on everything.  Should we put a muzzle on him?  I do not agree with most of his views but that is what education is about.  It is great and I would hate to see the alternative system.  I do not think anybody in the country wishes to see senior people being muzzled.  To say one is an administrator and does not take part in discussions is not really a good defence in this day and age.  We have gone to the brink of bankruptcy and are trying to rescue the country, so any ideas people have should be welcomed.  People should participate in such debates.  I am delighted previous Members of this House, such as Ken Whitaker, were not bound by those constraints and did a huge amount of good for the country.  This is traditional, but I do not know why it is in place in this day and age.  I will allow the Minister of State to move on and we may discuss the issue at a later stage to see if it is possible to have a more liberal regime.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;the Governing Authority and Academic Council of the&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is in the spirit of consultation about which the Minister of State spoke.  It proposes that the authority should also consult the governing authorities and academic councils of the relevant providers.  There is an unfortunate recent tradition, also manifest in the Bill, of the Department ringing officers in a university to get a yea or nay answer.  Matters are not being discussed and this is adding to the problems.  That system must be circumvented by the proposed amendment.  The provosts and presidents of universities are not chief executive officers to be asked what they think of this or that.  They are required to consult the bodies which elected them.  A university is a collegiate institution, not a managerial one.  I am, therefore, seeking to extend participation rights.  Let matters be brought before governing bodies.  If the Bill had been placed before governing bodies, we might have received many interesting proposals.  I am seeking to extend discussion within the functioning  bodies to include representative interests, elected persons and those directly involved, rather than accepting a yea or nay answer from a narrow administrative elite.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot support the amendment because it would introduce references to structures not shared by all providers.  The authority must consult relevant providers, but the internal bodies through which institutions engage in consultation are the responsibility of each of these bodies.  I expect and hope universities will bring these matters to the attention of their own governing authorities and academic councils, but I do not believe this needs to be specifically provided for in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  The Bill was not placed before internal consultative bodies.  I do not know if such constultation was asked for or if the Department went ahead with the legislation unilaterally.  However, it has become a recent tradition, in some Irish universities more than others, that the opinions of those who actually do the work do not count.  That is why I ask that the Bill insist on indicating that what a provost or president agrees in his or her personal capacity is irrelevant.  He or she, typically, does not give lectures.  There should be consultation with bodies which may have different names in different universities.  The Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, should also be consulted.  Consulting front-line staff, as they are called in other areas of public life, should be a part of legislation.  The culture of managerialism which has been promoted under the 1997 legislation has been to the detriment of education.  One might obtain some good views if one consulted people rather than having a narrow closed circle between the HEA, the Department and the heads of Irish universities.</P>
        <P>The Irish Universities Association is not an association of Irish universities but of the heads of these universities.  It is the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities with a new title.  The vast majority who do the work are not consulted.  In the amendment I am trying to get for them a right of consultation.  Some heads of universities may be more democratic than others.  Some have a strong totalitarian tradition and I do not think they will consult unless the legislation requires them to do so.  If the Minister of State considers he can use other forms of suasion, I will accede.</P>
        <P>The 1997 Act required Trinity College Dublin to remove the seven senior people from the board, people who had talents that would have been recognised on boards anywhere in the world.  However, as it did not suit the administrative system to have them there, they were removed by legislation.  That makes for dictatorial behaviour.  If one is dealing with people who do not like to consult, it may be necessary to enact legislation to compel them to do so, or to oblige them to clarify whether they consulted with themselves or the wider community.  The amendment attempts to have the latter method understood.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to point out that there was a significant consultation process before the legislation was drafted.  Universities, many entities within universities and many other groups and individuals responded during that consultation process.  I agree with the Senator that such consultation should be ongoing.  If there are internal governance institutions within particular institutions in which the opinions and wisdom of front-line staff are not sought or valued, that is an issue for the institution in question.  There is a provision within the legislation for the new authority to develop procedures with institutions to ensure the relevant arms of each body are consulted.  If we are to stand over the quality assurance procedures in each institution, we must ensure those procedures have a strong consultative process built into them.  We will seek to have that consultation with institutions on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not press the amendment, but I am halfway through a four year term as a member of a university board and can assure the Minister of State that the Bill was never discussed.  I previoulsy served a half term on the same board and the Bill was not discussed during that time, which is most regrettable.  However, I thank the Minister of State for his sentiments in that regard.</P>
        <P>We must reinvent Irish universities as places where ideas are discussed, as that is what they are about.  One cannot have people saying they made a deal with the Minister or the chief executive.  The nature of a university is to have some of the finest knowledge in the country at its disposal.  The people in question must have a say on education policy, otherwise they might as well go and work in research institutes.  As we look for the education sector to do so much to develop the country, it is important that people participate and their wisdom is brought to the table.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 22, subsection (4)(<i>a</i>), line 23, to delete &ldquo;, research&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Reference was made to research.  We have heard from the Minister of State that it is not a function which this body can exercise because it does not have the expertise in thermodynamics, nuclear science or whatever other area.  Research is evaluated by the editors of international journals.  The idea that the QQAAI would take on the task raises the problem to which I referred of regulatory creep.  How could the QQAAI evaluate the research that is currently evaluated internationally?  It does not have the competence so to do.</P>
        <P>Research internationally is validated and authenticated by panels of international experts in the world&rsquo;s leading universities.  If an article from an Irish researcher or academic is accepted for publication, that is a cause for celebration.  Whether the QQAAI approved the research is completely irrelevant.  It is not qualified to evaluate the quality of international research when others are there to perform the task.  It would be impossible to implement the measure because, as the Minister of State indicated, the members of the QQAAI will not have qualifications in advanced subjects, and the work is being done already, which is one of the problems I have with the Bill.  It creates an extra layer of bureaucracy to do jobs which are being performed perfectly satisfactorily already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps there is a misunderstanding as to what exactly we mean by research activities.  It does not mean that the QQAAI is going to measure the effectiveness of research in areas of expertise in various faculties.  One might question the propriety of certain international ranking procedures whereby our universities are ranked against others internationally, but they exist and they are used by other jurisdictions to decide on international education policy.  The aim is to ensure the level of research one might require to score well in comparison with other international institutions is being researched.  It is not intended to measure or quantify the quality of the research.  As Senator Barrett indicated, that comes within the remit of the people carrying out the research who have expertise in those particular areas.</P>
        <P>Research is a key function of many education and training providers and, as such, must be subject to quality assurance procedures.  For example, in the area of further education and training, it is critical that we carry out in-depth research of current labour market shortages and future shortages in the next five to ten years in order that we can drive further education and training provision in the right direction.  If such research were not to take place, one would have serious questions about the quality and effectiveness of the training and education being provided.  Senator Barrett and I agree that the QQAAI will not sit in laboratories measuring the quality or effectiveness of in-depth research in particular fields of study, but it is important that all institutions carry out a standard of research that allows them to measure up well internationally against other institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response and reference to the league tables.  Trinity College Dublin, TCD, is 15th in the world in terms of citations of research.  That is the constituency I represent.  I do not denigrate the work carried out anywhere else.  The equation of the decline in the league tables with so-called reputational damage is linked to the collapse of the banks and the public finances and the need for the IMF rescue.  I recognise that the Government is doing its level best to correct the reputational damage.  Reputation is one part and the other part is due to the necessary adjustments in the public finances.  Staff numbers have been cut back, which I support.  Saying that will not make me popular with my colleagues but I recognise the situation this country is in.  The problem is once one does that, as the Minister of State is aware, it is registered in the international tables as a decline in the staff-student ratio.  Other people might say it represents an increase in productivity.  One is caught in that if one does the right thing for the country, one goes down in the international rankings.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is apparent from the college calendar that the research section expands every year.  It is much bigger now than when I first went to TCD.  There is no secret about the research.  It is validated internationally because that is where it is published.  Some research attracts international funding.  If the QQAAI is not set up to evaluate research, one could ask why it would intervene in an area in which it has no expertise.  The responsibility lies with individual academics who work in colleges.  If we had to transfer responsibility to any other bureaucracy, it would be to the Higher Education Authority.  There is no benefit in having an extra layer of bureaucracy outlining that a college was doing research.  We know that; it is widely published internationally.  That is the reason we were high in the rankings and why we are still high in many of the rankings in terms of research.</P>
        <P>The legislation might work given the Minister and his liberal attitude to what we have before us, but it gives the next head of this quango and the next Minister unnecessary powers to meddle where none is needed at a time in this country when my strong view is that money should be invested in primary education.  I am sure that is the view of the Minister as well.  All the evidence is that this is where the important decisions are made.  Research shows that spending in the primary area does not add to inequality.</P>
        <P>The quango is required to ascertain, maintain and improve the quality of education.  I maintain it has had no function in that regard to date.  Reference is also made to training, research and related services provided by the provider, namely, universities.  The body is virtually redundant.  This is an unnecessary function which has no return for the taxpayer.  I will not press the amendment.  However, it is wrong in this country&rsquo;s current circumstances to pass documents around to allow bureaucratic expansion to take place and for people to put functions into legislation which they have no ability to carry out and which there is no need for them to carry out.  Research is carried out and evaluated internationally.  There is no need to have a quango doing it.  I hope that when such Bills go before the Cabinet, the Minister for Finance asks for the justification for spending money on them.  The work is being done already and if in future we get yet more monitoring of research that is already monitored internationally, that is just duplication and triplication, for which much of the Bill provides.  I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>As Senator Barrett is aware, all external reviews are undertaken by expert panels and it is not proposed that they would be undertaken by the authority itself.  The section applies to the quality procedures of universities and ensuring they are of the highest standard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment proposes to remove research activities from the quality assurance provisions of the Bill.  That is not a wise move.  It is not one which I would support.</P>

        <P>Section 27, as amended, agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 28</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 28 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not delay the House further because this is the amendment we have been discussing for much of the time.  Section 28 should be deleted.  It is entirely unnecessary.  There are universities with degrees dating back hundreds of years which are internationally accepted, have high international status, attract international staff and have high rankings for citations, etc.  I was not sure what problem the first Irish Universities Quality Board was attempting to address and I do not know what problem this section is attempting to address either.  There is no problem.</P>
        <P>On what is the quality of lectures, more people apply to get into the courses than we have places.  On whether students did not turn up for lectures, if that were so 500 students would leave the Edmund Burke theatre and one would know immediately.  It all happens satisfactorily.  The external examiners validate it, the international referees of journal articles accept the articles, the employers employ the graduates and the ones who want to go internationally are accepted at Oxford and Cambridge.  One of my colleagues left TCD to go to Oxford recently.  His qualifications were accepted, as they say, <i>ad eundum gradum</i> by Oxford.</P>
        <P>Why is it that, in addition to satisfying Oxford, Cambridge, etc., one must be responsible to a new quango set up by a country which badly needs to spend money on many other matters?  I have spoken to section 28 in the course of the other sections, but it is utterly unnecessary when we need money.  We are closing down small rural schools to implement section 28 and the section is entirely unnecessary because there is no problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some within the sector have talked up a problem so they could expand their own bureaucracies.  In the lecture theatre, in the academic journals and in the way we relate to students, which is an important consideration for Senators, there are people from the United States and from the Erasmus programme in Europe who tell us that the way lecturers in Irish universities relate to students is far superior to what they find in the European mainland.  The quotations the Minister of State gave at the beginning that Irish universities are voted No. 1 in terms of acceptability and recruitment are all cited in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are enough real problems in the country without setting up an agency to deal with matters which are not a problem.  It is somewhat of a slur to those who have done the work up to now to see the Government setting up a quango to confirm what we know is fact.  It makes one wonder why there is disillusionment with government when one gets this kind of unnecessary meddling.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 25, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) In carrying out a review under subsection (1) of a recognised college the Authority shall consult with the University of Dublin.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is slightly different, that the authority &ldquo;shall consult with the University of Dublin&rdquo;.  The previous discussions related to Trinity College.  That is a degree awarding body.  We have referred to the lack of consultation in this.</P>
        <P>As distinct from opinion, I disagree with the Minister that there has been much discussion on this issue.  I am trying to get consultation with my university because the same rights are given to the National University of Ireland under section 5.  My university can also contribute to that discussion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is agreement between the Minister and me, particularly in education, that this process needs to be opened up and involve much more consultation, with ideas going back and forth.  I am attempting to get the TCD or Dublin University section in as the NUI is provided for in section 5.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish the NUI the best of luck.  I do not know why it got the consultation status and my university did not.  I hope it is an oversight that might be looked at on Report Stage.  I will withdraw the amendment subject to consultation with the Minister.  It seems strange that my university is represented here, under the 1937 Constitution, on equal standing with the National University of Ireland but it is not in this legislation.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</P>

	<P>This amendment amends subsection (1) of section 34 to make clear that directions made by the authority should relate to the effectiveness of the procedures for quality assurance established by the provider concerned and the implementation of the procedures by the provider.  This ensures that the authority does not make directions about matters not directly related to the effectiveness of quality assurance procedures and is an important check on the powers of the authority in this area.

	<P>With regard to amendments Nos. 122 and 125 submitted by Senator Barrett, while all other fees in the Bill are paid by providers, there is provision for a fee payable by a learner for the making of an award by the authority and learners already pay fees to HETAC and FETAC for this service.  It is proposed to retain this and I cannot support the amendment on that basis.  It should be noted that there is no provision for tuition fees for learners as that is not a matter for the authority.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 126, the section contains standard legislative provisions relating to the consumer price index.  On that basis, I cannot support the proposed amendment.</P>

	<P>These amendments insert new sections before the existing section 37 and relate to the quality assurance relationship between designated awarding bodies, the universities NUI, DIT and RCSI, and their linked providers.  The new section 37 provides that relevant designated awarding bodies may, having carried out a review of a linked provider, issue directions relating to the effectiveness and implementation of the quality assurance procedures established by the linked provider concerned which the linked provider shall comply with, and the linked provider is required to provide relevant information to the relevant designated awarding body.  This is similar to the power available to the authority in respect of its relevant providers.</P>
        <P>The new section 38 provides for the withdrawal by a relevant designated awarding body of its approval of a linked provider&rsquo;s quality assurance procedures in a similar manner to that which is already set out in section 35, which relates to the authority and its relevant providers other than previously established universities.  Furthermore, it also provides for the notification of the authority by the relevant designated awarding body of a decision to withdraw approval of a linked provider&rsquo;s quality assurance procedures.  Where the authority receives such a notification, it shall, where applicable, withdraw the linked provider&rsquo;s authorisation to use the international mark.  It also provides for the reversal of such a withdrawal where the linked provider successfully appeals against a decision to withdraw approval of its quality assurance procedures.</P>

      </Speaker>
        <P>Government amendment No. 62:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 28, subsection (1), line 15, to delete &ldquo;framework&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;framework of qualifications&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 62 is a minor technical amendment to replace the work &ldquo;framework&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;framework of qualifications&rdquo; for clarification purposes and for consistency with the title of the section.</P>
        <P>I cannot support amendments Nos. 63 and 64.  The Bill requires each awarding body and each provider, including previously established universities, to ensure learners acquire the necessary standard of knowledge, skill or competence associated with the level of the award in the framework.  If a university has an award placed on the framework, it is reasonable to expect it will ensure the relevant learning outcomes and standards have been achieved.  The integrity of the framework would be compromised if the specific learning outcomes in regard to awards are not at the level of general outcomes associated with that relevant level of the framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 38(4) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Each awarding body in the State shall, in respect of each award the body makes that is recognised within the Framework, ensure that a learner acquires the standard of knowledge, skill or competence associated with the level of that award within the Framework before an award is made.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is being done already.  That is the point I have been making since the debate began.  The degrees, the lecturers, the research and the graduates are all internationally recognised.  There is a conflict here.  That is what I am trying to do on behalf of the students and that is what we are accomplishing.  What the Comptroller and Auditor General found the exercise trying to do is completely different.  It is promoting managerialism.  The heads welcome this and want more meddling, more bureaucracy and so on.  It is stated on page 124 of the report that it &ldquo;has resulted in better management information for senior institutional management [The important people are those who teach the courses, not the senior institutional management] and better feedback ... for institutional governance&rdquo;.  No governance is necessary.  One needs a good lecturer and attentive students.  The rest is overhead and gobbles up money because the average pay is two or three times that of those who do the lecturing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report goes on to say: &ldquo;In addition, significant restructuring has taken place in each university both in terms of academic structures and in terms of administration and management structures&rdquo;.  The quality of the lecture and the relationship between the lecturer and the student are not being monitored, and the gobbledygook of managerialism is being promoted instead.  The report states further: &ldquo;As part of this, information from the quality review process is being brought together with other evidence such as that from institutional research offices to ensure these feed into the strategy development and change process&rdquo;.  Managerial gobbledygook has no place in a simple transaction of transmitting knowledge from one person &mdash; we hope the lecturer has more than the people in the class &mdash; to another.  If they are doing that already, there is no need to have people intervening.  Of course, the bureaucrats in the universities want better institutional management and all the things the Comptroller and Auditor General found, but it is a waste of money because it is aside from the exercise.  Are Irish degrees are acceptable worldwide?  Yes is the answer, overwhelmingly so.  Therefore, why not reduce the expenditure on the public purse by accepting the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody involved in education would accept that quality assurance has a role to play in education provision.  The universities collectively would take that view as well.  Each university has a quality office.  The universities saw fit to establish the Irish Universities Quality Board.  Those offices in each institution review each school and faculty on a cyclical basis and examine student involvement, course review, quality of design and delivery of programmes and the alignment of programmes with the learning outcomes associated with the relevant level of that programme and where it is at on the national framework of qualifications.  As a country, if we are to stand over the NFQ as a framework, we must ensure that every course we place on that framework, from level 1 to level 10, satisfies the requirements of that particular level of the framework with which it seeks to align itself.  Once we move away from the NFQ, we begin to compromise on the quality of the framework and its international reputation, and that is not good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State.  We have gone completely the wrong way.  The important part is the lecture hall, not the quality office.  I do not know what the quality office is supposed to do in each place; it is irrelevant.  I heard a description of one of the quality offices recently as a self-licking ice-cream.  It is an m&uacute;inteoir who is the important person here.  That is what counts.  One can have hundreds of bureaucrats counting things outside but what happens in the class is what counts.  Of course, the bureaucrats will recommend more layers of bureaucracy, but this is a blatant waste of money and a straitjacket for the future, that all new courses are to be validated by somebody who will have no expertise in the subject and a quality officer who does not know what it is about.  This was a fad in education which should be dispensed with, like other fads, and we should get back to putting the money into education.  Teachers are being taken out of small schools and also special needs assistants to set up quality offices and this kind of nonsense.  The Minister of State has been very patient and I promise not to engage in any more hyperbole on the issue.  It is unnecessary and dangerous for the future.  We will go on giving the lectures but the bureaucrats will be reading the legislation and extending their powers and meddling more in the actual productive and working part of Irish education.  That is the danger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate where Senator Barrett is coming from in terms of a Trinity College perspective and the fact that the college has good places.  I served on the board of the academic council and know the structures have been improved since.  However, I consider external review of the procedures in place across all the universities to ensure the procedures in place are right and there is some oversight and sharing of expertise at a national level to be a positive thing.  As I understand it, the main function of the authority will be to support self-evaluation.  I do not think it was contemplated by the previous Government or this Government that people from the authority would inspect what is taking place in individual classrooms.  Its concern is to ensure that the quality control process within each institution is up to standard and continually improved.  That is a positive thing because we cannot stand still on these issues.  We should look at everything again in five years&rsquo; time and ensure the authority has a function in disseminating what is being learned elsewhere in the world and constantly checking the processes in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would be concerned if I felt the authority would meddle at the micro level implied by Senator Barrett because I appreciate the need to give people within colleges the tools to do their job instead of constantly worrying about micro-management.  I genuinely do not believe that is what is contemplated.  The Bill has been strongly welcomed by the Union of Students in Ireland for the reason that the processes in some institutions are very good while they could be improved in others.  The authority provides the opportunity for learners to have an input into the national level.  That is positive and it strikes the appropriate balance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>As this body is set up, others will be dissolved.  There could be a saving of money by setting up this body because other awarding bodies will be replaced.  Therefore, the economic argument does not hold up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The universities are outstanding institutions.  I am disappointed that no Irish university ranks in the top 100 but I understand staffing ratios are a factor.  There are other factors such as how one is perceived by one's peers.  External oversight of an award system was referred to, but Senator Power said that universities and other institutions can still be responsible for quality within their institutions.  Even the universities are funded by the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Very definitely so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>While the universities, like other third level institutions, are outstanding, there should be some external validation of the quality of the teaching and learning and the research and other activities that take place inside those institutions.  I acknowledge Senator Sean D. Barrett&rsquo;s fears and he is correct to express them, but they are, in general, unfounded.  I support the Government on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for my late arrival, but I had the pleasure of attending Trinity College Dublin earlier to see my local primary school win the all-Ireland debating competition.  My daughter is in the class and it was amazing to witness the debate.  She was supporting, not debating.</P>
        <P>I recognise how hard Senator Barrett has worked on this proposal on behalf of students to eradicate excessive bureaucracy and agree with him.  My experience of teaching in universities and teacher training college was there were many excellent lecturers but also many poor ones.  One of the key difficulties with the quality of teaching at third level is that while many lecturers are expert in their field, they have not been taught how to teach.  I agree with Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy that external validation of teaching and learning is needed.  This should happen through self-assessment but also through spot checks.  We are all in danger of becoming rusty if we are not subject to external examination.  The external examiner should be up to speed and at the cutting edge, not into micromanaging.  A line needs to be drawn in this regard that examiners should review substantive issues, not micromanagement issues, and ensure this distinction is made.  We must be alert to the quality of teaching at third level.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett is correct to point out that Irish universities have fallen in the world rankings, which is a major concern.  This issue was raised again at the Change Nation conference last weekend in Farmleigh.  Our universities need to improve their ranking and the quality of teaching and learning, as well as the quality of research, will contribute hugely to this.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, a serious and important debate is needed on the balance of teaching and research experience lecturers should be required to have.  Our cutting edge researchers may only teach between two and five hours a week yet they are most up to speed with developments.  When I lectured in Mary Immaculate College, I had just completed a PhD.  I was hot off the press when it came to research, as I had spent five years researching my topic, before securing a post in the college.  However, ten years later, if I took up a post lecturing without having conducted research in the interim, I would not necessarily be in touch, given the changes that have taken place in technology in the education sector.</P>
        <P>Lecturers must also have good communication skills.  People may teach all their lives and never engage in research.  Research can ignite and enthuse an audience, but the delivery of the content is important.  It is crucial that a balance be struck and that teaching be monitored, with guidelines given to third level institutions, to ensure the quality of teaching and the input of research.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to add to the excellent contributions of the Senators who have a deep understanding of the sector.</P>
        <P>To respond to Senator Barrett&rsquo;s comments on small schools, the Department has been challenged to find &euro;350 million in savings between now and 2015.  Part of the process will involve the savings that accrue from the amalgamation of the awarding bodies.  A significant process of amalgamation is under way which has resulted in a budgetary reduction from &euro;13.5 million to &euro;7 million in the past four years, with 25% fewer staff.  I expect the formation of the QQAI will lead to further savings in the sector, which will help us to reach the &euro;350 million target in the next three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and Senators Averil Power, Jim D&rsquo;Arcy and Fidelma Healy Eames.  I agree with the Minister of State that this debate makes the case for the development of the Seanad rather than its abolition.  My degree is from TCD, with some validation by the State.  If some people think they are better at this, why do we not have a QQAI university?  We will take them on any day and will show who has the quality.  I agree utterly with the Minister of State about saving money.  That is why I propose to put the QQAI in the firing line, not a small school.  Is it correct that, procedurally, I must withdraw the amendments?</P>

	<P>Yes, when we reach them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to previously established universities, the courses are up and running.  If somebody says to my good friend, Professor Brendan Kennelly, that the quality board does not think he is good at poetry, he will say, &ldquo;So what? Everybody else thinks I am good.&rdquo;  The lecturing staff I know have to turn down shoals of international invitations to give lectures; therefore, if somebody on the QQAI board thinks they are not good lecturers, they will be in a decided minority because international bodies invite them to speak all the time.  The board is an exercise that has got out of control and is now feverishly searching around for something to do to justify its existence.  It is doing things that have been done splendidly up to now and there is no need for it.  If it was necessary to amalgamate HETAC and FETAC, I bow to the Minister of State&rsquo;s superior knowledge.  However, I find the addition of universities a waste of public money and it adds nothing but cost to education.</P>

In assessing the quality of teaching and learning the feedback of students and peers must also be taken into account because, as he correctly said, if the board was to deem the poetry of Brendan Kennelly and his communication of same to be inadequate, it would not hold water because his record speaks for itself.  The comments of peers and students and the issuance of international invitations to spread the word about Brendan Kennelly or another lecturer of equal repute speak for themselves.  It is important to clarify that there will not be meddling to this extent.  However, feedback from students which is rarely canvassed is critical and should not be underestimated.  Does the Bill envisage the inclusion of such feedback in the assessment of teaching and learning?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the universities, all the authority will set out to do is to assess whether a university&rsquo;s internal quality assurance processes are in place and stand up to scrutiny.  It will be incumbent on every university to ensure its processes provide for student feedback.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State including it in the guidelines?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  For example, between level 1 and level 10 under FETAC and HETAC, there is specific provision for student feedback to form part of the quality assurance process.  It is provided for in section 27.  I assume it would also apply in assessing the quality assurance procedures in universities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Do they also apply at PhD level?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, from level 1 to level 10.  We will ask universities, in preparing their quality assurance procedures, to ensure the provision is in place.  We will not seek to have that interaction within universities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very important point.  Student evaluations, from my professional experience, are subject to caveats.  If one marks a class very lightly, one will score really well in the opinion poll.  Health warnings have to be attached to them.  Certain subjects, such as thermodynamics and econometrics, are incredibly complex and difficult, and not even a saint will get a high mark because they involve hard work.  The old phrase was that people went to university to &ldquo;read&rdquo; economics or medicine.  Learning is not all based on lecturers and the guy with the good jokes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While student input is very important and I support Senator Healy Eames, there are caveats and people in university authorities have to be aware of what they will tell them.  A very entertaining course was given which everybody thought was wonderful but no one employed any of the graduates because they were having a good time for three or four years.</P>
        <P>As a member of the board, Senator Power, who was an elected student officer in TCD, gave student feedback on what courses were working and so on.  If we did not do that, the CAO would record nobody wishing to do course X in institution Y because word would get out that courses did not conform to student expectations and employers&rsquo; needs.  Student feedback is vital and I support the Minister in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The point of the Bill is to ensure the student experience is as positive as it can be.  I understand, from the debate on Second Stage, that it is the intention that standards would be set at national level for student consultation and there would not just be a broad requirement for it.  Best practice should be set out at national level because while some institutions have good standards, there are differences between and within institutions.  Some faculties within institutions have excellent procedures and others do not.</P>
        <P>There are differences in respect of how students are selected to participate and how they are supported.  Sometimes people are given one day&rsquo;s notice and asked to go to a review meeting without any proper documentation.  Some students are hand-picked for that purpose while others are selected through student unions or student councils.  A lot more needs to be done to ensure student feedback is a real process and not a box-ticking exercise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Students should be empowered to make a real contribution.  At the end of the process what comes from student feedback should be implemented.  The end of the quality assurance process from a student point of view should not involve walking out of a review meeting and the results being sent to the Department.  There should be real reporting to students, students' unions and academic councils on the issues identified and steps being taken to address them.</P>
        <P>I accept some of what Senator Barrett said about good procedures.  I appreciate it is a few years since I was a student representative in TCD but I found some areas were better than others.  I understand from my contacts with current student representatives that is still the case.  There are significant differences between universities, and better processes are used in some departments within institutions.</P>
        <P>Improvements can be made and I hope the authority would have a very strong function in promoting best practice and getting to the nuts and bolts of what is being measured and the actions that will be taken within institutions.  There should not just be a general requirement for consultation, rather standards should be set for how consultation takes place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Power.  The standard-setting procedure is provided for in section 27.  An authority, particularly in the case of universities, does not intend to get involved with the day-to-day management of universities or the design and delivery of programmes.  It can ensure quality assurance procedures are in place which provide for a significant and effective level of student consultation.  The Bill provides for the authority to set out exactly what that might look like for students and institutions, and ensures there is equity of access for students to quality assurance procedures.  It also provides for the standards to apply equally and effectively across the system from levels 1 to 10.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 39, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I have a question on the naming of providers.  When we discussed the Bill on Second Stage, I raised the issue of how it would recognise the community and voluntary sector, that is, community education organisations which operate alongside the VECs and statutory education bodies.  As the Minister of State will know, the providers listed in the section can seek validation of their education programmes directly from the authority.  Community education providers are not included in the list, unless it is intended to include them within section 39(7)(<i>g</i>) which states: &ldquo;a recognised school in so far as the school provides adult, continuing or vocational education or training which leads to an award...&rdquo;.  As he may be aware, approximately 22% of FETAC providers are in the community and voluntary sector, which is significant, compared with a figure of 35% for the VECs, 25% for F&Aacute;S and 18% for private providers.  I seek clarification from him that following implementation of the Bill the process of validating programmes will continue for community education organisations, in other words, that they will continue to have their programmes directly validated by the new authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 39 sets out the procedure for how a provider may apply to the authority for validation of a programme of education and training.  This is open to all providers of education.  The list to which the Senator referred is a list of providers which have no option but to apply to the authority for validation.  All other providers, including community-based providers, may apply to the authority for validation of their programmes, but they are not obliged to do so if they do not want to.</P>
        <P>The Senator is correct, the term &ldquo;education and training&rdquo; is broad and encompasses a range of education programmes such as adult, continuing, vocational, higher and community-based education.  The authority will accept applications for validation of all types of education and training programmes, including community-based education programmes.  Programmes being provided in community settings that have already been validated by FETAC will be transferred to the new authority also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that the Minister of State has said an agency or provider seeking to make an award will apply to the quality assurance board.  He gave Bord Iascaigh Mhara as an example if it was looking to offer a primary or post-primary education course.  When would such organisations offer a primary education course?  I am not familiar with F&Aacute;S or Bord Iascaigh Mhara offering such a programme.  Did he mean that they might do so in the future?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I wish to make a brief point.  There have been genuine problems in this area and, in my amendment, I propose more frequent inspection.  I will be guided by the Minister of State, but I would like to hear his observations on some of the language schools.  I think some of these schools were a means of illegal immigration and of people working illegally.  There was evidence of some problems in that sector.  I wonder if more frequent inspection might be appropriate, given what has arisen in the past.  I will defer to the Minister of State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>

He is correct in ensuring we have the very highest standards in place in our English language providers&rsquo; schools and also that these schools secure and win the trust of international students.  That is critical.  This amendment proposes to reduce the period of review from three years to two.  The three-year period that we are proposing is substantially less than the review period of seven years that applied previously.  This is a significant step forward.  There will be an opportunity for the authority to move on an institution immediately where it has specific concerns about the provision within that institution.  In addition to the review process every three years, the authority will have that additional power under the legislation.</P>

For this reason, I have tried to tie my amendment to the university sector.  Seeking someone who is an expert on the authority&rsquo;s functions, not on the merits or demerits of the appeal before the panel, seems inward looking.</P>

There are 42 new Senators and 77 new Deputies.  Involving Parliament would play a part in the State&rsquo;s recovery following our rescue by the IMF.

        <P LI="1">In page 50, subsection (1), line 15, after &ldquo;<i>section 79</i>,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the Irish Universities Quality Board,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The board has been exercising this function.  We could transfer its functions back to the universities.  The amendment is an attempt to keep that option open.  In time, the new body might decide to cede functions that it does not believe it needs to exercise.  If we keep the body in existence, its functions could be seen to be redundant.  It could be abolished instead of exercising a range of functions that many of us believe are unnecessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This section deals with the dissolution of the existing statutory bodies which are being amalgamated.  The Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB, is not a statutory body; therefore, this legislation will have no role in winding it down.  It was established as a company by the universities which I understand intend to wind it up after the authority&rsquo;s establishment, as it will have no further function or role to play in quality assurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  The universities have not asked us whether they want to wind up the IUQB.  There has been a lack of consultation on the issue.  If the Minister of State wants to dissolve the board, he should accept my amendment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This process indicates some of the ways such decisions are made, in that we will pass a law and lean on the universities to abolish the IUQB, or they have nodded and winked in agreement concerning its abolition.  Speaking as a member of a governing body, I can say the universities have not agreed.  The Minister of State may have been misinformed or misled, but the matter has not been discussed in the two and a half years I have been a member of the body.  We are assuming that the universities will voluntarily agree to get rid of the board, but none of the bodies has made that decision.  We are trying to exercise our leverage with them to abolish a body which, to my knowledge, they have not even discussed for good or ill.  If we want to abolish it, we should include this provision.  We should not assume that it will be abolished for us because someone somewhere has nodded or winked about being willing to do it.  The Irish Universities Association, IUA, comprises the universities&rsquo; heads and is not representative of the bodies.  Some may believe the functions should return to the Department &mdash; that is my opinion &mdash; while some may believe the IUQB is a wonderful body which should be retained.  We do not know because of the unsatisfactory way in which this legislation has proceeded.  This is not to reflect on the Minister of State, as others involved seem to be nodding and winking.  They might have personal views, but the issue has not been discussed.</P>

	<P>Would the amendment make a material difference to the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The IUQB is a limited company established under the Companies Act.  Even if we wished to do so, it is not possible for legislation to seek the winding down of a company which was independently established by the universities.  If we were to pass such legislation, there would be nothing to stop them from forming a new company 20 minutes later.  There is no reason to include the amendment.  It is our understanding the universities wish to wind up the IUQB after the authority&rsquo;s establishment.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There is some confusion on my part.  I agree that the authority should recover any amount due and owing to it under the section from the provider, but how could it recover money from the learner?  Perhaps the Minister of State might supply guidance.  The idea of an authority pursuing a student to get money back is bizarre, but perhaps I cannot recognise what is in front of my face.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendment, while all other fees provided for in the Bill are paid by providers provision is already made for a fee payable by a learner in respect of the granting of an award by the authority.  Learners already pay fees, although not substantial, to FETAC and HETAC for this service.  It is proposed to retain this provision.  On that basis, it would be difficult to accept his amendment.  It should be noted that there is no provision in the Bill for tuition fees for learners as this is not a matter for the authority in general.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is the Minister of State saying that we can recoup money from a learner who has fraudulently obtained a qualification?  I do not understand the point he makes.  Why would the authority want to pursue a learner who pays money into the system to get an education, which if unsatisfactory means we might owe him or her money?  The learner might in that regard have engaged with a bad provider.  Why would the authority pursue a student unless he or she made a false statement or attempted to deceive us, which seems unlikely?  I do not understand what is intended.  Perhaps the Minister of State would enlighten me, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no provision for tuition fees in the Bill as that is not a matter for the authority.  In some instances, learners &mdash; I have attended a few award ceremonies at which FETAC and HETAC certificates were awarded &mdash; pay a small fee to partially cover the cost of the awards process.  These would not be described or deemed to be tuition fees.  They are simply fees associated with receipt of an award and the administrative overheads involved in the awards process by the institution from which the learner is acquiring the award.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like a certification process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a graduation fee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Therefore, it relates to a person who received an award but did not pay the relevant fee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not believe the authority will be chasing learners around the country for a fee associated with an award.  In most instances, the fee is paid prior to granting of an award.  I do not believe there will be ongoing policing in this regard.  We are incorporating into the Bill a provision which already applies to FETAC and HETAC certification, which has been the tradition for a number of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>

The amendments also provide for the transition of reviews or validation of programmes by FETAC and HETAC under the 1999 Act and include a technical amendment on the inclusion of references to section 45 of the Bill, the making of an award, the transition of procedures from the 1999 Act for the delegation of the authority to make awards and a slight rewording of subsection (15) which deals with the transition of review and withdrawal of delegation of authority by FETAC and HETAC and the continuity of procedures established by FETAC and HETAC for such reviews.</P>

As stated by the Minister of State the current system appears to be based on whether people were consulted and the chief executive is restricted from commenting on Government policy and education.

	<P>The Government has made significant process in reforming the process whereby people are appointed to State agencies and boards.  A new process has been introduced whereby the relevant Oireachtas committee will have the opportunity to question the proposed chairpersons of State agencies, which is welcome.  We have also introduced a system of open expressions of interest for positions on State boards, and as could be expected, we received some expressions of interest for positions on the authority and they are being examined.

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) The Minister, subject to due process, may at any time remove from office a member of the Authority if it has been proven that&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This was a worry and the Minister of State and other Members have acknowledged that it is a bit draconian for something concerned with education, which is about free flow of ideas.  The current form is &ldquo;The Minister at any time may remove from office a member of the Authority if, in the opinion of the Minister...&rdquo;.  There are various disabilities or faults indicated, including a person falling into ill health, which is all right.  There is also reference to stated misbehaviour, which we can debate presently.  There is reference to removal of a member appearing to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the authority of its functions.  My amendment includes a reference to due process.</P>
        <P>Firing people from boards has proved problematic in the past and people have brought cases to the courts and been reinstated, although that was not in the educational sphere.  I believe it concerned members of the CIE board who at one stage objected to being removed.  There should be some process and the Minister should not be able to act in line with some of the stronger and more totalitarian sections of Bill.  He or she should not be able to say that &ldquo;Mr. Bloggs&rdquo; should not be on the board and it appears to be necessary, for the effective performance of the authority, to fire the individual.  The concern is with the &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; of the Minister.  I wonder if the Minister of State will consider some due process, as a decision may be upheld that a person is unsuitable for the post, but it should not be on a ministerial whim or opinion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not envisage that such a serious move would be undertaken by any Minister on a whim, and this is a standard provision in the establishment of State agencies or authorities where the Minister has the power to remove a member.  I do not expect the current or any future Minister to be overly draconian in the operation of that authority.  The three reasons for removing a person are pretty reasonable, as they refer to a person becoming incapable through ill health, having committed a stated misbehaviour or where the removal would appear to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the authority of its functions.  It would only be after considerable consultation and engagement with such a member that the Minister would arrive at the conclusion that he has no other option but to forcibly remove him or her from the board.  That is a pretty rare occurrence and it will remain as much in future.</P>

	<P>This is an amendment to the Universities Act 1997 dealing with the designation of degrees and other qualifications of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI.  It is proposed that such degrees and other qualifications, where they are approved by the National University of Ireland, NUI, will be designated as degrees and qualifications of NUI for as long as the RCSI remains a recognised college of NUI.  There is already a similar provision in the Universities Act for degrees and qualifications of constituent universities of the NUI.  The RCSI gained the power to award its own degrees and qualifications in 2010 but wishes to continue its relationship with NUI and for its degrees and qualifications also to be degrees and qualifications of NUI.  This is supported by the NUI&rsquo;s four constituent universities.</P>

	<P>Tuigim go bhfuil an Aire St&aacute;it gn&oacute;thach tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  T&aacute; m&eacute; an-bhu&iacute;och gur fhan s&eacute; chun freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist seo, a bhaineann le Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh i gCnoc na Cathrach sa Ghaillimh.  Ceapaim go bhfuil eolas maith ag an Aire St&aacute;it ar an scoil &aacute;irithe seo.  T&aacute; iontas agus d&iacute;om&aacute; ar dalta&iacute; agus bord bainist&iacute;ochta na scoile &mdash; agus ag duine ar bith a bhfuil baint acu le Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh &mdash; nach raibh an scoil san &aacute;ireamh sa chl&aacute;r t&oacute;g&aacute;la caipitil a d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair an tAire, an Teachta Quinn, le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  T&aacute; go leor gealltanais tugtha don scoil.  T&aacute; go leor oibre d&eacute;anta ag muintir na scoile chun scoil nua a fhorbairt in &aacute;it ina bhfuil an daonra ag f&aacute;s go l&aacute;idir.</P>
        <P>Freastala&iacute;onn os cionn 450 dalta ar an scoil in aghaidh na bliana.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin ag tarl&uacute; le sc&oacute;r bliain anuas.

Bh&iacute; an scoil ar an ngearrliosta a bh&iacute; ann maidir le scoileanna nua a th&oacute;g&aacute;il.  Bh&iacute; an-d&iacute;om&aacute; go deo ar &uacute;dar&aacute;is na scoile nuair a chualadar nach raibh an scoil ar an liosta t&oacute;g&aacute;la.  D&rsquo;iarr siad orm an cheist seo a ard&uacute; ar a son.  Mar is eol don Aire St&aacute;it, beidh cruinni&uacute; m&oacute;r poibl&iacute; ar an &aacute;bhar seo i nGaillimh anocht, le feachtas m&oacute;r in &eacute;adan an cinneadh seo a thos&uacute;.  Is ar an mbun&uacute; sin at&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Healy Eames, mar beidh taca&iacute;ocht trasph&aacute;irt&iacute; ag teast&aacute;il leis an scoil seo a bhr&uacute; chun cinn, mar go bhfuil s&eacute; ag teast&aacute;il go g&eacute;ar.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State will know, Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh has been seeking a new school for some time.  It has been in existence for 20 years and caters for in excess of 450 pupils per year.  The school was promised a new school building.  The site is available and the specification and plans have been approved by the Department.  Planning permission was sought and granted in 2011 and the fire certificate is in order.  The school&rsquo;s funding campaign is well advanced and the short list of tenders was completed by the Department in January 2012.  The school is therefore appalled by the decision not to include it in the capital building allocation from the Department.  There will be a huge public meeting tonight and the school is starting a major campaign.  We are seeking cross-party support to have the school reinstated in the programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State explain the reason that Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh was not included in the capital building programme?  There appears to be an increase in the local demographic and there is a demand for the school.  Why was it not included?  Furthermore, what options are available to the school to appeal this decision and to press ahead to get the school it deserves?  The Minister of State will probably give me economic arguments as to why this could not be done but, as he knows from previous discussions with me, I do not accept many of those economic arguments. There are many political decisions being taken.  One of them concerns the &euro;100 million per year that is given to private schools.  Perhaps some of that money should have been put towards the capital programme for school buildings.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  Beidh m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il le ceist a chur ar an Aire St&aacute;it, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, ina dhiaidh seo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh for sharing time with me.  What has happened with Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh is a mystery.  The Department in its five-year plan has given approval for what appears to be a new gaelscoil called Galway city west.  Nobody knows the location, no patron has yet been nominated and there appears to be no evidence that the school is needed.  However, Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh, with more than 450 pupils, has a site and space available since 1998.  The Department of Education and Skills has approved the plans and full planning permission is in place since 2011.  Can the Minister of State justify why that school is not getting its eight prefabs when the Department is planning to put a new school in an area where there is no case for one?  I have contacted the Department and it cannot substantiate its case.  The officials said something about social protection certificates or evidence from the Department of Social Protection, but they have not supplied it.  There are five Irish schools west of the city: Boleybeg, Saint Ignatius College, Bearna, Scoil Fhursa and Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh.  I have visited those schools and there is space in some of them.  Why build a new school that will cost millions?  I am keen to hear the answer to that question.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; as an cheist seo a ard&uacute; mar go dtugann s&eacute; deis dom a l&eacute;iri&uacute; don tSeanad strait&eacute;is an Rialtais i gcomhair infheisti&uacute; chaipitil i dtionscadail oideachais thar na c&uacute;ig bliana amach romhainn agus an sc&eacute;al mar at&aacute; faoi l&aacute;thair a shoil&eacute;iri&uacute; maidir leis an iarratas ar maoini&uacute; m&oacute;r chaipitil a fuarthas &oacute; Ghaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh i gCnoc na Cathrach i nGaillimh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It may be helpful if I set out the context within which the decisions relating to meeting the accommodation needs of schools must be considered in the coming years.  Total enrolment is expected to grow by around 70,000 students between now and 2018, by more than 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary.  Second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.  In the first quarter of last year we had the highest number of births in this country since records began.  To meet the needs of our growing population of schoolgoing children, the Department will need to establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where significant demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department&rsquo;s budget for the coming years.</P>
        <P>The five-year programme which the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, announced recently will provide more than 100,000 permanent school places, of which in excess of 80,000 will be new school places.  The remainder will include the replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation.  The design of the proposed new school building for Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh has been developed based on a brief to construct an eight-classroom, two-storey extension along with a single storey general purpose hall and a na&iacute;onra.  The extension is mainly intended to replace existing temporary accommodation.</P>
        <P>The stage 2B submission &mdash; detailed design and tender documents &mdash; was recently approved by my Department.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible, at this time, to give an indication of the timeframe for the progression to tender and construction of the project for Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh.  Earlier today, officials from my Department met a delegation of principals from Galway city, including Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh, and explained the underlying rationale for the decisions made in respect of the provision of additional primary school accommodation on the western side of Galway city.</P>
        <P>To ensure every child growing up in Ireland has access to a physical school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally, as well as the demands in Galway city, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The five-year programme is primarily focused on meeting those increasing demographic needs.  In that context, it has not been possible to advance all school building projects concurrently.  School building projects, including the project for Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh, will, where possible, continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  I again thank both Senators for giving me the opportunity to outline the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The reply appears to contradict a reply I received last week regarding Clifden community school, in which I was told the reason the school was not getting funding was a drop in the demographic.  There is a demographic increase in the Cnoc na Cathrach area.  The Minister of State said as much in his reply; therefore, the decision does not make much sense.  To build the extension to Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh and use the capacity on the land that is available makes more sense than building a new school.</P>
        <P>However, the other part of my question, which the Minister of State did not refer to, was about the possibility of appeal.  What avenues are open to the school if it wishes to reapply or have the situation addressed or if it wishes to make an appeal on different grounds for being included?  I am sure that is what it will do, and at the meeting tonight that is certainly what the staff, pupils and parents will seek.  An bhfuil an t-Aire St&aacute;it in ann a r&aacute; linn c&eacute;ard iad na deiseanna achomhairc at&aacute; ag an bpobal maidir leis an scoil seo, mar n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go nglacfar leis an bhfreagra at&aacute; tugtha ag an Aire St&aacute;it, i gcead d&oacute;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Where is the evidence for building a new Irish medium school in this area when this school is seeking permanent accommodation?  The children are at that school.  The schools tell me that the same children are being enrolled in many schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>First, to reply to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s question, there is no formal appeals process in place, and there never has been.  However, there is the opportunity, as was evident this morning, to interact with not only the Minister but also the officials in the building unit in Tullamore to continue to make the case for a new school building for Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh.  However, there is no formal appeals process to which the board of management can gain access.</P>
        <P>With regard to evidence, speaking from my knowledge of how this list was drawn up, the building unit of the Department of Education and Skills in Tullamore now has access to Department of Social Protection records for child benefit and it can establish how many children in an area such as Knocknacarra or its immediate environs or even the entire western side of Galway city will need access to a classroom or school in the next few years.  It knows where each child is and when the child was born.  On that basis it has carried out extensive research which led it to conclude that new primary schools will be needed on both the western and eastern sides of the city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">How does it know it will be an Irish medium school?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very good question.  I do not know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not stand up to scrutiny.  I am very concerned about what is happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no provision for supplementary questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is my understanding of how the conclusion was reached that there would be a need for a new school.  I am not aware of how the decision is made as to what the ethos of that new school will be, but I am willing to undertake further investigation to inform Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Healy Eames how it is made.</P>
