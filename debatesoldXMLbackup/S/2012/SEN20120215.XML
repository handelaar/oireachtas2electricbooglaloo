	<P Just="Left">I have received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">Go dtabharfaidh an tAire Dl&iacute; agus Cirt agus Comhionannais soil&eacute;iri&uacute; maidir le iarratas at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag bean &oacute;n bPailist&iacute;n (sonra&iacute; leis seo) chun cead a fh&aacute;il chun cuairt a thabhairt ar Ghr&uacute;pa Taca&iacute;ochta Leana&iacute; Gaillimh &mdash; na Pailist&iacute;ne.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Colm Burke of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline the measures being taken to ensure Irish construction workers will benefit from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, given that the deadline to draw down funds is June 2012.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mark Daly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, in the light of his recent visit to the United States, if he raised the issue of the undocumented Irish and working visas for Irish people in America.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 3 p.m., if not previously concluded.  Private Members&rsquo; business will be No. 17, motion No. 7, to be taken at 4 p.m. and conclude not later than 6 p.m.  There will be a sos between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues.  I ask the Leader to provide time for debates on the jobs plan and the new agreement the Government has signed with the IMF.  The major issue that appears to be taking up the time of the Government, when it should be focusing on job creation, is the closure of the embassy to the Holy See.  The T&aacute;naiste is being completely intransigent in not moving on the decision he took on economic grounds last <Col N="2"/>November, while the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, echo the views of Fine Gael backbenchers in seeking to have the embassy reopened as soon as possible.  There is no clarity on what is happening and there seems to be a huge division among the Government parties.  I, therefore, propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Taoiseach be asked to come to the House to clearly outline the Government&rsquo;s policy on the closure of embassies, with particular reference to the embassy to the Holy See.  </P>
        <P>Ireland should have a foothold in terms of extensive diplomatic representation around the world.  It is not just about economic policy.  When Ireland opened the embassy to the Holy See, it was about securing the freedom and recognition of the existence of the State.  When Mr. Frank Aiken, born 114 years ago last Monday, signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it was not about economic policy.  His objective was to ensure human rights around the globe and that nations would work together for their betterment.  It is incredible, therefore, that the Labour Party would dictate its policy on diplomacy in that way, but its decision is being interpreted in many ways around the country.  However, it was never about money.</P>
        <P>The project in which Fine Gael is engaged to count the number of seals in the west will probably cost the same amount as is involved in the closure of the embassy to the Holy See, as I exposed yesterday.  The Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, are opposed to this decision, but I am sure Labour Party Members, including Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Senator Ivana Bacik, are in favour of it and the T&aacute;naiste will not change his decision.  Even Cuba and Russia have embassies to the Holy See in Rome.  Why does Ireland not have an embassy there, given our history and culture and the diplomatic necessity for such an embassy?  The decision was not thought through properly.  There is confusion as to whether the decision was recommended by departmental officials or as part of the comprehensive spending review.  We are to maintain embassies in Malawi and Lesotho.  Why could the embassy in South Africa not deal with matters in Lesotho?</P>
        <P>The decision is one made by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, not the troika.  It appears we need to invite the Taoiseach to come to the House to explain exactly what is going on between the Government partners, why there is such division and a lack of focus on the job in hand, creating jobs in the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Thomas Byrne accuses the Government of being obsessed with the issue of having an embassy to the Holy See and then proceeds to propose an amendment to the Order of Business at a time when we should, of course, be focusing on job creation.  I agree with him that we should have a debate on the jobs plan, for which many of us called yesterday and I think we will be able to facilitate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has it not been facilitated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has called for a debate on the closure of the embassy to the Holy See even though we have already dealt with the issue in the House with the T&aacute;naiste who gave a very clear response.  It was a decision taken by the Government.  Three missions were closed &mdash; the embassies in Iran, East Timor and the Vatican.  All of the closures are regrettable, but as the T&aacute;naiste made clear, if and when the economic position improves, they can all be reviewed.  Many Members on the other side of the House have been pushing this issue, day after day, to the point of tedium.  As I said, we have had the T&aacute;naiste in the House who has given a very clear response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>There are significant differences between the media and Fine Gael.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ivana Bacik to continue, without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been plenty of public debate on the issue.  Father Peter McVerry, for example, said that the Vatican should not have embassies there at all.  If the Vatican were to relax its own rule and allow embassies in Rome to represent officially in the Vatican, this would be an entirely satisfactory resolution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on waste and waste management in light of the fiasco across Dublin City Council area resulting from the hand-over of the waste collection services to Greyhound, the lack of information to residents, the confusion over collection dates and the insistence by Greyhound on upfront payments, with the result that we may see thousands of households without bin collection services from this week onwards.  The lord mayor, Councillor Andrew Montague, has already been on the radio and he is highly critical of Greyhound.  The hand-over of services has proceeded seamlessly in other areas, notably in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, but in the Dublin City Council area it has been very poorly handled.  It would be worthwhile to have a debate in this House on the more general issue of waste strategy and waste policy to examine whether this should be a function of officials or of elected representatives.  As colleagues know, this was changed relatively recently and clearly there are difficulties with the current procedure where the council had voted against handing over the service to a private operator but the privatisation proceeded with the fiasco that ensued.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on rape law in light of very disturbing reports in the <i>Irish Independent</i> recently about a recent rape case in which certain comments were made by the judge and certain actions were taken against the complainant, the alleged victim, which resulted in a serious trauma being experienced by her.  These are very disturbing reports and without going into the details of that case it requires that we re-examine how best we can reform our rape laws and trial procedures to ensure that complainants are not victimised a second time in the courtroom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>My question to the Leader today relates to the growing levels of child poverty here.  Ireland is near the top of the table for OECD countries as regards percentage of children living in poverty.  Figures for 2011 show that 19% of children live in poverty and 9% of children experience consistent poverty.  The OECD has clearly identified that child poverty rates are significantly higher for jobless families than for families with at least one parent in employment but also lone parent households compared to two-parent households.  Many more children are at risk from poverty due to the cumulative effect of successive budgets.  This means that children in Ireland are living on poor diets, they are missing developmental milestones, they are suffering more ill health, they are struggling at school and they experience increased isolation because they are unable to participate in ordinary childhood activities.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Social Protection to the House to debate how best to tackle growing child poverty and how to reverse this unacceptable trend.</P>
        <P>In this regard I have organised a briefing today at 5.30 p.m. in the audiovisual room and I have brought together four organisations, SPARK, Single Parents Acting for the Rights of our Kids, One Family, OPEN and Treoir.  They will give a joint briefing to Deputies and Senators on the cumulative effects of the budgets.  Child poverty is something of concern to Members on all sides and it is vital that we work together to safeguard the future of our children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat my call for a general discussion on the economy in light of the apparent decision to sell off part of Bord G&aacute;is.  We have been instructed by our economic <Col N="4"/>masters that we have to sell off some of the heirlooms that were carefully built up by various governments and government agencies and utilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government agreed to do that; the IMF did not ask.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter which needs to be discussed in this House.  We are told now that we may be permitted to use some of this money for reinvestment in jobs.  What about the assets?  I will table a motion that we re-adopt the Keating principles.  I hope the Labour Party will support me on this.  The people are entitled to a just proportion of their assets.  There seems to be a complete lack of democracy in the macroeconomic sphere and it is repeated in the microeconomic sphere, as Senator Bacik has indicated with regard to the bin charges.  This used to be done as a public utility and now it has been privatised, despite and against the express wishes and vote of the elected representatives in Dublin City Council.  Again, the people are being neglected and this is utterly wrong.</P>
        <P>I refer to the business of the Vatican embassy.  It is difficult to see it as a purely economic matter.  I find that a little difficult to swallow, the same way as I do not believe the abolition of the Seanad is an economic measure; it does not make sense and the figures are too small.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, it interesting that Father Peter McVerry made a point that I, too, have made previously, that there is a certain spiritual danger in the fiction of a state and a state apparatus being sustained by the Vatican.  It is not a country.  It has accreditation with the United Nations and so on.  If one looks at the interventions at diplomatic and UN level, of the Vatican as a state, they are by no means all positive in terms of what are generally perceived as human rights, in particular, with regard to the reproductive rights of women, contraception, AIDS and gay people.  When one takes into account the question of human rights, one has to be quite nuanced in one&rsquo;s approach to this question and it should not be used as a banner.  I say this, despite the fact that I have recently come across an article where I had said three cheers for Pope John Paul II because of his principled stance on Iraq and the attack on that country.</P>
        <P>I have always objected to the primate of my church, the Church of Ireland, being made a member of the House of Lords.  I applaud that historically the Church of Ireland was disestablished and I wish they would disestablish the Church of England.  The relationship between religion and politics is always toxic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been some very interesting debates in this House recently on the subject of energy and energy supply.  The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was in the House last week and we had a Private Members&rsquo; debate on energy.  This Monday, Shell and its partners in the Corrib gas field announced that it is to spend a further &euro;800 million supporting 700 jobs in the area to bring natural gas on shore and this is to happen by 2014.  Considering that 60% of our electricity supply comes from natural gas I am sure this announcement will contribute towards security of supply.  It will be of interest to the Minister and we should continue to discuss energy policy because of its importance for competitiveness, for job security and for the future of industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If we only had the opportunity to buy it at market rates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is preparing an energy policy in 2012 and I am sure this announcement will feed into that policy, particularly when balanced with the development <Col N="5"/>of renewable energy versus security of supply and the introduction of efficiency into our natural gas energy production.  This is an important step which the House should discuss further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment to the Order of Business.  On a related theme, what has motivated this campaign is the aggressive secularism expressed by some members of the Labour Party.  It is interesting that the president of the British National Secular Society recently called upon the former Fine Gael candidate, Mr. John Colgan, to withdraw his complaint to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to a homily by Bishop Boyce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I ask the Leader for a debate on these issues.  I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality be invited to attend.  What is happening as a consequence is that Garda time is being frivolously wasted.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has sent a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This is a terrible abuse of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue should not be raised on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;considering the number of crimes and organised criminal gangs in Dublin.  People are being murdered almost daily and the time of the Garda and the DPP is being wasted on issues where people of a particular ideological bent are using and abusing the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Senator well knows, the DPP is an independent officer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not complaining about the DPP, as you well know, a Chathaoirligh.  I am complaining about the people who are using the system to promote their own minority ideological views and wasting public services that are charged with much more serious responsibilities than these issues.  I ask that we would have a debate in the House about the management of Garda time and the management of these matters within the public service.</P>

	<P>I could take up where the last speaker finished and talk about a waste of time and the regurgitation we hear in this House, day after day, with the same issues being raised and Members inviting different people in to talk on the Vatican and whatever else.  I would like to see Fr. Peter McVerry come to the House, a man whom I respect greatly for all the work he has done in Ireland.  This House should honour him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do that.  We should also listen to what he said this morning.  I want to ask the Leader about the ongoing review of local government.  It is a serious review which will result in major changes.  We have heard talk of the waste of money in different places.  I would like to see a review of local government and the introduction of regulations on postering.  We see all the money that is being wasted as well as the environment being harmed due to pole postering throughout the country during any type of election, whether local, national or otherwise.

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an infheist&iacute;ocht mh&oacute;r a f&oacute;gra&iacute;odh inn&eacute; in infreastrucht&uacute;r sna S&eacute; Chontae, go h&aacute;irithe insan chinneadh a t&oacute;gadh ag an Fheidhmeannacht &oacute; Thuaidh cr&iacute;och a chur le sc&eacute;im t&oacute;g&aacute;la an A5.  I welcome the massive investment announced yesterday in the A5 infrastructure in the North of Ireland.  We hope the Government here will reconsider its decision on the investment to finish the motorway into the Donegal region so we can get access to all of the regions in our country.</P>
        <P>My specific question to the Minister is one I have raised on a number of occasions.  I have not received a specific answer yet, so I had better ask it very clearly and succinctly.  The question is in regard to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister of the Six Counties and of the Assembly.  We have had some fantastic contributions here from Dr. Mary Robinson and from others who have spoken in this Chamber.  It has been suggested that we extend an invitation to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  I have asked on a number of occasions whether that has happened but I have not received an answer.  I want to be very clear.  Has the Committee on Procedure and Privileges issued an invitation to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to come to speak to the Seanad?  If it has, is there a timeframe for that?  If it has not, is there any particular reason that has not happened and is it the intention of the Leader and the CPP to issue such an invitation?</P>

	<P>Four Senators have referred to jobs.  Before I ask the Leader about another issue, I welcome the announcement today that HCL, a software support company, will provide 200 new jobs in Kilkenny.  This is great news and shows the need for a technological university in the south east.  It proves that if we have well-educated young people in an area, we will get jobs, particularly in the IT sector.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on what I believe is a crisis, namely, the housing issue.  Some 98,000 people are currently on housing waiting lists, including 3,000 in my own county of Kilkenny, 2,000 of whom are in Kilkenny city.  We all went through the Celtic tiger, which was to solve everything.  The housing issue is a failure of the Celtic tiger and is why we are in the situation we are in.  The Part V provision was part of the Celtic tiger and was intended to deal with issues such as social inclusion.  I always felt Part V would never work.  Some councils implemented it in different ways and as housing estates will not be built again in many areas, <Col N="8"/>how will we get people housed?  We should have a brainstorming session and a full debate on the housing issue, which would be useful and might allow ideas to emerge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remember that in the 1970s and 1980s, when this country was also in recession, local authorities had the money to build houses, which provided employment in the trades.  We must examine the situation.  Part V is not working.  There is the rental accommodation scheme and the social leasing scheme but when houses come on the market, councils cannot afford to buy them because they do not have the money.  We must have some lateral thinking on this issue.  A debate on the housing crisis would help.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am a member of a Government party.  It was the continuous Government policies implemented in recent years that pushed the housing issue.  What we have ended up with following the Celtic tiger is ghost estates and unfinished estates in areas where people are not going to live.  To take Kilkenny city, there are only two unfinished estates in the city area and they are unfinished only in regard to roads and the like, and people are living in these estates.  However, in other areas of County Kilkenny, there are ghost estates in areas to which people do not want to move from Kilkenny city, although there are 2,000 in the city on waiting lists.  A debate on housing would be a useful exercise.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On the closure of the Irish Embassy in the Vatican, the intervention by a former Irish ambassador to the United States is exceptional by any standards.  The incisive and supportive editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> brings this issue very much centre stage.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Donlon was one of the foremost and most highly respected members of the diplomatic service.  He served in the United States at a time when relations between Ireland and Britain were at a very low ebb, so he understands the importance and the value of diplomacy.  He knows one cannot sideline this as an insignificant issue because we all know that the diplomatic service embraces all aspects of life in a country and spills over into the image of a country, as well as into the area of employment, investment and all of those issues.</P>
        <P>I support the motion which has been put forward by Senator Thomas Byrne.  I believe at this stage that the quicker we get this issue off the radar, the better for all concerned.  We should not be trying to score personal points and we should not get into theological arguments.  I do not believe for a moment that the economic arguments stand up.  We all know in our hearts that there is now an onus on us, given this issue will not go away.</P>
        <P>It would be very helpful if the Taoiseach came into the House to debate this issue.  I am sure the Leader will endeavour to help us in that regard.  It would be a pity if every second day in this Chamber we have to get up and respond to new revelations which are coming out on this matter.  It is not just the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i>, it is also in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today and in so many other organs as well.  I appeal to the Leader to agree to the request that the Taoiseach would come to the House to find whether this matter can be put to bed once and for all.</P>

	<P>Senators were briefed yesterday on the subject of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, by representatives of Tamboran Resources and others.  However, a great deal of uncertainty remains as to how the process works, how Tamboran Resources and other companies propose to do business, how they are licensed and at what point certain things must be done.  There remains enormous uncertainty, concern and worry surrounding the hydraulic fracturing process itself.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come to the House for a debate on this issue?  There is concern that decisions will be made before all of the information is heard.  This House can contribute to ensuring there is a debate <Col N="9"/>and that this information is put in the public domain.  We must have an opportunity to put those questions to the Minister which are concerning not just citizens but other companies as well.  I am particularly interested in a clarification of the licensing procedure.  The Minister has said he is considering a change in the tax regulations for onshore drilling.  That has raised concern in the sector and among citizens.</P>

	<P>I join Senator C&aacute;it Keane in calling on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House for a debate on reform of local government.  I was present, together with Senators Denis Landy and Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan, at a meeting in Cavan at the weekend where the Minister addressed the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, conference, which was attended by more than 400 delegates.  Although the Minister made an excellent speech, it left us with more questions than answers.  For example, he seemed to indicate that the future of town councils is safe, before going on to elaborate on how he envisages new district councils representing towns.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister come to the House to clarify precisely what he is proposing?  He has said he will outline his blueprint within eight weeks, but it is important that he addresses the issue in this House.  He should also clarify his reported proposal to reduce the number of councillors elected at the next local election.  It is not acceptable for him to bring proposals to Government and then issue a statement to the media before he has addressed both Houses regarding his proposals.  I ask the Leader to facilitate such a discussion without delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal of my constituency colleague, Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe, in regard to hydraulic fracturing.  It is now becoming apparent that not only is there uncertainty and confusion surrounding the licensing process for this new technology, which involves extracting gas from underground rock, but the current regulatory environment, not only as it applies to this country but also across Europe, in regard to onshore drilling of gas is totally inadequate.  It is this concern more than anything else that is exercising the minds of those who are opposed to the concept in its entirety.</P>
        <P>While we as parliamentarians and public representatives will continue to press the point that the process works, I am now of the opinion that it is open to question.  It is a relatively new technology, only some ten to 15 years in operation, and we all heard the horrific stories coming out of the United States.  As such, I support Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s proposal.  Clarity must be brought to this issue without delay.  Among those who braved the elements yesterday to travel from the north west, including from my own county of Leitrim, to protest at the gates of Leinster House, the conclusion was that irrespective of what regulatory regime is introduced, <Col N="10"/>the concept of hydraulic fracturing cannot be adequately monitored in order to ensure there is no injurious environmental impact to the grounds in which the extraction is taking place.  While it has been seen as a regional issue thus far, it is one that will not go away.  Unless the Government takes this in hand now and begins to offer some clarity, we could end up with another Rossport.  That is an outcome no one wants.</P>

	<P>Yesterday I spoke about three people I met at the weekend who intend to emigrate to Australia.  Some 100 young people have departed from the village of Kilmihil in my constituency in recent years.  I assure colleagues on the other side of the House that none of those 100 gives a toss whether we have an embassy in the Vatican.  It is an outrage that all we can talk about in this House, day in and day out, is the closure of that embassy.  It is a further outrage that we have an amendment to the Order of Business on this matter.  What is even worse is that the party leader of the Members concerned is making a huge issue of it in the other House as well.</P>
        <P>We need to grow up.  Our relationship with the Catholic Church has taken a hammering; everyone accepts that.  What we need to do now is to rebuild it.  Having an embassy in the Vatican when there is already an embassy one mile down the road is a complete waste of resources.

	<P>Yes.  All the arguments on this issue have been made at this stage.  The T&aacute;naiste indicated yesterday that when the economic and financial circumstances improve, he will take another look at this.  Almost two months ago I asked the T&aacute;naiste at an Oireachtas committee meeting to consider, as a money saving exercise, the possibility of using the Villa Spada to house the two embassies.  The T&aacute;naiste indicated to me at that stage that he would look at that proposal.  He has recently reiterated that statement.  Rather than raising this issue every morning, Members should allow time and space for review and consideration of the matter.  I agree with other speakers that there are major issues to be confronted in this House.</P>
        <P>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill, for a full debate on housing.  There is a crisis in the local authorities in terms of huge waiting lists.

	<P>While listening to a radio interview the other evening I heard the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, in somewhat of a Freudian slip, refer to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as the Minister for Howlin.  I must admit that I am howling now myself about something that has been brought to my attention.  At a time when we are undergoing a public service embargo, when there are cutbacks in every part of the health service and social services, when there are hiring freezes to replace people who have taken Government incentivised early retirement and there is real danger that critical parts of the lubrication of our social democracy may be gunged up by a shortage of front-line workers, the Public Appointments Service has been for several days advertising for temporary clerical worker positions at a modest salary which is just shy of &euro;20,000 per annum.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to clarify the scale of priorities.   At a time of shortage with regard to doctors, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists, lengthening waiting lists for elective health care procedures, a deliberate policy of restricting access to medical cards by a number of bureaucratic manoeuvres based around complications in the renewal process &mdash; which I know the Minister is addressing &mdash; and when it is generally recognised that we have a super abundance of bureaucratic staff in the HSE and health service who are in their jobs because of a failure to rationalise on the integration of pre-existing health boards into a solitary state bureaucracy, rather than redeploying people to areas where they are clearly needed, these temporary positions are being advertised.</P>
        <P>The average tax take per citizen is &euro;7,650.  This means that the entire income tax of three people will be used to support these new temporary positions.  This is unsatisfactory.  It speaks to a failure to come to grips with the need to reform our public service.  I ask that the Leader bring this matter to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Howlin.</P>

I agree with colleagues opposite that the Vatican issue while important is not more important than the issue of jobs and the jobs plan.  While the Government previously promised a jobs budget, we got a jobs initiative.  The initiative was its raiding of private pensions.  No Minister can tell us how many jobs have been created following that raid on private pensions.</P>

	<P>Yesterday Senator Bacik took issue with me for questioning the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s bad judgment.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to his good judgment on one particular issue.</P>
        <P>I note that, unlike the Taoiseach, it is likely he will raise human rights issues when he meets the Chinese Vice President, Mr. Xi Jinping, this weekend.  However, I regret to learn that there is no provision for questions from the media to the Chinese leader.  This man will become President of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China next year and I regret to learn that the Taoiseach has no intention of raising such issues.  At a time when we are economically vulnerable, it would be easy to give in to arguments that we should pipe down and simply take whatever economic friendship is being offered.  However, Ireland must not lose its soul when it comes to <Col N="14"/>being a courageous voice for human rights and human dignity.  The T&aacute;naiste should take a leaf from the book of the actor, Christian Bale, who recently tried to visit Chen Guangcheng, a man who is blind but who sees more than most.  He helped to expose the practice of forced abortion in parts of rural China and for his courage was imprisoned.  Moreover, he and his wife were reportedly beaten recently when human rights groups released videos showing intense police surveillance of his home.  This is part of the daily reality for many in China.  It is important, therefore, that Ireland as a small country maintain its voice.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, standing up for people in the developing world and human rights is an issue on which there has been constructive co-operation with the Holy See during the years.  While I understand the Government&rsquo;s embarrassment on the issue, I seek an assurance from the T&aacute;naiste that he is raising with the Vatican the possibility of the co-location of embassies.  Has he formally raised this issue and, if not, when will he so do?  This is a useful specific question that should be asked and he need not come into the House to answer it, as Members would gladly receive a report from the Leader or Deputy Leader.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Members are probably not fully aware of or do not fully realise the significance of the visit to Ireland this weekend by the Chinese Vice President, Mr. Xi Jinping.  I look forward to meeting him on Monday in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, at the China Investment Forum.  Moreover, I hope a bilateral investment agreement will be signed this weekend between our two countries to attract foreign direct investment from China.  This mechanism is in place in countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France which are benefiting hugely from it.  Trade and investment between our two countries does matter.  In response to Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, this is the ideal way to build relations on a human rights front also.  One achieves nothing unless one is in a relationship which is the way forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I welcome the visit by the Chinese delegation to Ireland, which is extremely important.  As lord mayor of Cork, I had the privilege of visiting Shanghai in 2003 or 2004, but I was criticised for so doing, in the same way that Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen has now raised the issue.  One figure people forget to mention is that in the past ten years 150 million people have been raised above the poverty line in China.  No other country has achieved this feat.  While I agree that human rights issues should not be ignored, one should also consider the positive achievements within that country.  </P>
        <P>It might be appropriate, when Members debate the jobs issue, to consider how we can strengthen further Ireland&rsquo;s contacts with China.  I had the privilege of setting up and being involved in the establishment of contacts between University College Cork and two universities in Shanghai, on foot of which there is an exchange of students between the two colleges.  Irish students travel to Shanghai to study for 12 months, in the process becoming familiar with what is required to work and set up a business in China.  Chinese students come here to ascertain what it is like to work in Ireland.  This initiative started six or seven years ago and is now bearing fruit.  Such long-term planning is needed in Ireland.  One measure being taken is to ensure such contacts in China can grow.  It is a huge and growing market, of which in the next few years Ireland must receive a bigger slice to create jobs here.  It would be appropriate to include such a consideration in any debate in the House on the jobs plan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe held a highly interesting and highly educational session in the audiovisual room on hydraulic fracturing or fracking.  I found it fascinating and support her call today for a debate on the subject.  Perhaps the Leader might be willing to include the issue of nuclear power in such a debate, as these are subjects that are never or seldom discussed.  Those with any logic who had been opposed to hydraulic fracturing were able to seek a balance.  I do not state I am in favour of it but that I found the session to be educational and suggest a debate on the subject in this Chamber would be worthwhile.</P><Col N="16"/>
        <P>On my way to Leinster House today I saw a man on a bicycle who was wearing a mask on his face.  I realised he probably wore it to protect himself from fumes and then realised we do not encounter fumes on the road anymore, which I assume is due to the work of the national car testing, NCT, system, which has been hugely successful.  This serves as a reminder that we can do things, whether through measures such as the introduction of the NCT or something else.  Although carbon monoxide poses a danger, it is a problem that is capable of being solved.  In recent years there have been some serious incidents in homes involving carbon monoxide, including deaths.  Members should, therefore, encourage or demand or institute legislation to ensure the future installation of carbon monoxide detectors in all homes.</P>

	<P>Senator Thomas Byrne, acting Leader of the Opposition, mentioned the jobs plan.  As I indicated yesterday, I will endeavour to have the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, come to the House to discuss it.  The Senator also mentioned the fiscal compact.  It has been agreed to have a debate for a number of hours in the House to enable Members to make a contribution on it.  There will be a presentation by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service beforehand to inform Members on all aspects of the fiscal compact and the treaty.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Members have engaged a number of times in comprehensive discussions in the Chamber on the Irish Embassy to the Holy See, including the occasion on which the T&aacute;naiste attended.  To respond to the question asked by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and others, the Holy See has clear requirements in respect of the separation of embassies to the Holy See from those to Italy.  According to these requirements, the same person is not permitted to be simultaneously accredited as ambassador to the Holy See and Italy.  Neither can any member of the staff of the embassy to the Holy See be accredited to Italy at the same time.  The Holy See insists on an ambassador to the Holy See maintaining a separate residence from that of his or her country&rsquo;s ambassador to Italy.  Embassy offices must operate from separate buildings and addresses but some flexibility is developing in respect of their proximity.  All such possibilities will be fully explored in the context of the ongoing review of the diplomatic network.  That is the position as matters stand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our ambassador designate to the Holy See, Mr. Cooney, has travelled to Rome on at least two occasions since his nomination in order to attend meetings with Vatican officials.  In the context of the fact that representatives from other countries are having meetings in the Vatican, our ambassador will be accredited in May.  He will represent the State at the consistory of cardinals on Saturday next.  On his previous visit he attended the ordination of the incoming papal nuncio to Ireland, Archbishop Charles Brown.  There is ongoing contact between our ambassador designate and the Holy See.  The Government will continue to review Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network, particularly as the financial position improves.</P>

The Taoiseach is in the D&aacute;il, as is the case every Wednesday, and when he leaves it he will be departing on a very well publicised trip to the United States in order that he might promote investment in and tourism to Ireland.  He will also be delivering the message that this country is open for business and investment.  That is what he should be doing.</P>

	<P>Senator Bacik referred to waste management.  We will try to arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come before the House to address that matter.  The specific issue to which the Senator refers relates to Greyhound, the private operator, and Dublin City Council, the local authority.  That issue should be dealt with by the latter, as has been the case in almost every other local authority area throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Senator also referred to the law on rape.  I will endeavour to arrange for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come before the House for a debate on that matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator van Turnhout requested a debate on child poverty.  We will certainly endeavour to arrange for the Minister for Social Protection to become before the House to discuss that matter.  The Minister has appeared in the Seanad on a number of occasions to deal with social welfare legislation.  I am sure a number of issues relating to child poverty were addressed on such occasions.  However, I am also sure the Minister would be quite willing to come before us again.  On 7 March we are due to engage in a debate with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, on a wide range of topics relating to children and their interests.  There may be an opportunity for the Senator to raise the issue of child poverty with the Minister on that date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keane referred to a ban on the placing of posters on poles.  As the Cathaoirleach stated, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will be coming to the House to take Committee Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 immediately after the Order of Business.  Perhaps the Senator might take the opportunity to discuss the matter to which she refers with the Minister at that point.</P>
        <P>Senator Clune referred to energy supplies and policy and Senators O&rsquo;Keeffe, Mooney and Quinn raised the issue of fracking in Leitrim and other areas.  The Minister addressed that matter in the House on two previous occasions.  If, however, Members believe it is necessary to engage in a further debate on it, I will ask the Minister to come before us again.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the A5 and the &pound;300 million in funding which the British Government has invested in the project.  We would love to be in a position to invest a similar amount.  When money becomes available, I am sure that the necessary works will be carried out on the part of the A5 which is located on this side of the Border.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Invitations have not been issued to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland to address the Seanad.  However, consideration will certainly be given to this matter.  A meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges took place yesterday and there is a list of ten people whom Members would like to be invited to address the House.  The matter is under review.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Neill and Mullins referred to housing policy and housing waiting lists.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, <Col N="18"/>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, is due to come before the House for a wide-ranging debate on housing and housing policy on 28 March next.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Wilson requested a debate on local government reform.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, came before us in the past two weeks to discuss the issue of local government.  He will be presenting proposals on the matter to the Cabinet and I presume these will be the subject of an immediate debate in the Seanad when they have been published.  I will endeavour to have the Minister present in the House for that debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Conway referred to jobs and the need to address the rural dimension of the jobs strategy.  That matter certainly will be addressed when the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, comes before the House, I hope in the next week or two.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown sought clarity in respect of the hiring of temporary clerical assistants at a time when there are so many other vacancies in the system.  I will raise that matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and then revert to the Senator in respect of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Moloney referred to boy racers.  I understand the Garda has many powers in respect of this issue and also with regard to noise pollution.  In that context, the matter should be addressed with the force.  The Minister for Justice and Equality who came before the House just last week is a regular visitor here and on the next occasion on which he appears, the Senator may address to him her questions on the matter to which she refers.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly referred to jobs.  Some 6,500 jobs were created in the hospitality and tourism sector on foot of the jobs initiative.  The Senator requested a specific figure and I have provided it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Sheahan referred to the proposed personal insolvency Bill and requested clarification in respect of the qualifications those to be appointed as insolvency trustees will be expected to possess.  I will raise that matter with the relevant Minister and obtain the information the Senator is seeking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Mullen, Healy Eames and Colm Burke referred to the visit of the Vice President of China.  As is the case with other countries, our trade with and the investment from China are extremely important.  As Senator Colm Burke stated, we should acknowledge the positive developments which have taken place in China.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has indicated that he will raise the question of human rights with the Vice President during his visit.  It is wonderful that the Vice President is visiting Ireland and, as Senator Healy Eames indicated, it is important that we do our best to promote trade and investment between our two countries.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the putting in place of carbon monoxide detectors in people&rsquo;s homes.  That is an important matter and perhaps it could be dealt with in the context of our debate on housing with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1 in the names of Senators Mac Conghail, van Turnhout, Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, O&rsquo;Donnell, McAleese and Zappone is outside the scope of the Bill.  Therefore it is not acceptable and cannot be moved.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment No. 1 not moved.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the amendment has been ruled out of order.  In speaking to the section, it would be good if the Minister would review the amendment in light of the loophole which exists regarding the leader&rsquo;s allowance.  Originally we made this proposal with regard to the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices)(Amendment) Act 2001, which refers to the Electoral Act.  I understand what the Cathaoirleach stated in his letter to me this morning, but as the 2001 Act refers to the Electoral Acts of 1992 to 1999, there is cross-referencing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister consider reviewing this issue on Report Stage because there is a gap and taxpayers&rsquo; money is exposed?  Since 25 February 2011, &euro;656,000 has been paid to Independent Senators and Deputies.  From the point of view of the taxpayer, Senators and Deputies, this money should be vouched.  This is why I would like to Minister to consider the amendment.  While this and a second amendment have been ruled out of order, another amendment, amendment No. 29, has been retained and it deals with the notion of qualifying parties.  Perhaps the Cathaoirleach missed amendment No. 29 with regard to ruling it out of order.  It proposes Independent and nominated Senators and Independent Deputies should be subject to the same regulations and be included as qualifying parties.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue on Report Stage as it is in the scope of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I also contend the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2001 should be included in section 2 and should be in the scope of the Bill.  We will deal with it later when discussing amendment No. 29 to section 26.  The Standards in Public Office Commission should oversee the expenditure of leaders&rsquo; allowances which should all be fully vouched.  The Bill is an opportunity for us to deal with this matter.  We need to be more accountable to the public in how we choose to spend our allowances, and there should be full transparency with regard to how public money is spent.  We are transforming our electoral process with the Bill and it is an opportunity to deal with this matter.  Will the Minister reconsider this prior to Report Stage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what has been said by Senators Mac Conghail and van Turnhout.  Anyone who is honest about it would say that despite adjustments made in the system of paying expenses and allowances, and changes were made in recent years, we still <Col N="20"/>have not arrived at a properly transparent system.  Quite frankly, politicians are faced with a choice between the hassle of maintaining receipts for the purposes of claiming vouched expenses, in which case they are entitled to claim a larger amount of money, or an unvouched system which they quite understandably choose because it avoids hassle.  If one is trying to create a properly transparent system, one must go by way of vouching all receipts and allowances.</P>
        <P>While supporting what Senators van Turnhout and Mac Conghail have said, we need to widen this debate.  I am contemplating tabling amendments on Report Stage to deal with the issue of the public funding of politics generally.  It has often been said the reason for public funding of politics is to prevent vested interests from unduly influencing the political system.  I wonder how much transparency there is in how political parties spend the public money they receive and to what extent this money is really used to advance their case for the following general election.</P>
        <P>Public resources should be made available for the purpose of assisting elected Members to do their job.  If one were to add up the amount of public money being spent on political parties one could probably, at a very rough estimate, hire an additional researcher for every elected Member of both Houses.  This would be a much better way to use the money.  We do not really know what is happening with regard to how political parties disburse the public money they receive and to what extent it contributes to their legislative efforts as opposed to their election efforts.</P>
        <P>I welcome what has been said but certainly we need to widen the discussion to consider the public funding of politics.  I will consider tabling amendments on this on Report Stage and I look forward to engaging with the Minister then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.  If this is ruled out of order it is not that I oppose it.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response.  The item is ruled out of order, although not in regard to this section or this Bill.  However, it may be looked at and I recommend that the Minister do this.</P>
        <P>I agree with everything stated by Senator Mac Conghail about transparency and funding for Independent Senators.  I listened to the debate that took place on this point in the committee rooms and many seasoned Senators and Deputies were unaware of leaders&rsquo; allowances and all these different facets.  There must be more transparency.  Perhaps, as Senator Mac Conghail and other Independent Senators noted, we might consider this under section 26.  However, it has been ruled out of order now and for that reason I cannot support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to stay with the amendment but a number of speakers raised the issue of transparency in regard to allowances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately it has been ruled out of order but the Senator can speak on the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one brief point which is important.  There are two issues involved.  The leaders&rsquo; allowance should be vouched.  The practice of Independent Deputies receiving more than &euro;40,000 in unvouched expenses must end.  The Minister indicated that there may be changes and stated one of his colleagues is looking at this.  It should change. <Col N="21"/> There is no reason an Independent Deputy should get such an amount, unvouched.  If that means leaders&rsquo; allowances must be vouched across the board, that is the way it should be.</P>
        <P>In regard to the representational allowances we receive, on which Senator Mullen touched, there are two options available, vouched and unvouched.  My problem is that although one is paid both kinds, the vouched allowance is paid on a monthly basis, regardless of whether one spends it, and one must make a return at the end of the year.  For example, if one opted for the vouched allowance of &euro;15,000 and spent only &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000, one must give the balance back at the end of the year.  It would make much more sense to consider what local authorities do with conference allowances.  One only claims when there is an allowance to claim.  Rather than having those of us who choose the vouched option receive a monthly allowance and having to return most of it at the end of the year, there could be the option of when one incurs an expense, in advertising or in holding a meeting, or whatever, one would submit the expense or invoice to the one-stop shop and one would be reimbursed within a certain timeframe, be it a couple of weeks or a month.  The practice of getting paid on a monthly basis, as if it were part of one&rsquo;s wages, and having to return part of it at the end of the year, must change.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen is right to state that because of this set-up Senators are choosing the unvouched system.  It is a lesser amount but it may be better for some people because although they get less money they do not have to return it at the end of the year.  The Minister and the Government should examine this because it is not the best way to administer an expense system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I realise the amendment has been ruled out of order as it does not come under this Bill.  I do not wish to address that issue.  However, in their Second Stage contributions a number of Senators addressed this matter.  At the time I indicated that responsibility for dealing with the matter raised is covered by the Electoral Act.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is actively considering these matters in regard to the income and expenditure of political parties, how these are accounted for and that they be published.  In this legislation we will publish not only income but expenditure.  The Independent Members have made a case in terms of transparency and the arrangements they have for funding.  At present they do not submit an audited statement in respect of funding.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will be anxious to ensure everybody is on the same level playing pitch in this regard.</P>
        <P>I refer to Senator Mullen&rsquo;s point.  God forbid that political people such as he would not seek re-election or self-promotion for the purpose of being re-elected.  It would be a very pure action on the part of the Trinity College, National University of Ireland or Independent Senators if they did not seek that.</P>

	<P>I draw Members&rsquo; attention to section 18 of the Electoral Act 1997, which states that payment of the fund to political parties is for the general administration of the party but also for research, education, training and policy formulation.  To draw down that funding the payment must cover, as widely as possible, research facilities, in addition to the communications and education facility.  That is scrutinised by the Standards in Public Office Commission and political parties must report accordingly in order to comply with the Act.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" Just="Left">5.&mdash;Section 22(2) of the Act of 1997 is amended&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) in paragraph (<i>a</i>) (amended by section 4 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002)&mdash;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">which makes a donation, and for the purpose of this definition a body corporate and any subsidiary thereof shall be deemed to be one person;&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 2 will have the effect of deleting section 5 and replacing it with new text.  Section 5 provides for the amendment of section 22(2) of the Act of 1997, namely, the interpretation section for Part 4 of that Act which deals with the disclosure of donations.</P>
        <P>The original provisions in section 5 are restated in paragraph<i> (b)</i> of the new section 5.  Definitions for the terms &ldquo;company&rdquo; and &ldquo;corporate donor&rdquo; are being inserted by that paragraph.  Because these terms are being introduced into this part of the Act of 1997 by the Bill, it is necessary to include definitions in section 22(2).</P>
        <P>The provisions of paragraph<i> (a) </i>of the new section 5 did not appear in the Bill as published and debated on Second Stage and are being introduced now.  Paragraph <i>(a)</i> of the new section <Col N="23"/>5 provides that membership fees paid to a political party will, for the purposes of the Act of 1997, be treated as donations.  This provision is necessary to eliminate the scope for membership fees to be used as a means to circumvent the new restrictions on corporate donors and donations in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Membership fees paid to political parties are not explicitly mentioned in the Electoral Act 1997.  Heretofore, the Standards in Public Office Commission, in applying the provisions of the 1997 Act, has not regarded membership fees as falling within the definition of a donation under the Act.  A concern was identified in drafting the Bill that this could represent a potential loophole which would allow corporate type bodies to provide funding to political parties by way of membership fees.  A new category of membership, namely, corporate membership, could be created and fees paid that would be exempt from the donation limits and the restrictions and the declaration provisions.  It is therefore necessary to take action.  Ignoring the loophole identified is not an option.  The Bill before the House is introducing significant restrictions and transparency measures on corporate donors and all corporate funding of political parties must be covered thereby.  The most effective way of dealing with this matter is to provide that in the case of a registered political party the definition of donation is taken to include a membership fee, whether paid by an individual or a group.  The effect of adopting this approach will be to apply the same restrictions on group or corporate membership fees that are to apply to corporate donations.</P>
        <P>I stress that membership fees paid by individual members of political parties will not be subject to any registration requirement and this provision will not place any additional responsibilities on members of a political party.  Arrangements will continue as they have done before.  Where the Electoral Act 1997 legislates for the disclosure of donations given for political purposes and the regulation of spending on D&aacute;il, Seanad, European Parliament and Presidential elections, the equivalent provisions in respect of local elections are set out in the Local Elections Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure Act 1999.</P>
        <P>For the amendment of section 5 of the Bill to apply at local government level it is necessary to insert a separate albeit identical paragraph into section 2 of the Act of 1999, namely, the interpretation section of that Act.  This is amendment No. 19, which will have the effect of inserting a new section into the Bill that will become section 18.  The new section 18 is being inserted into Part 3 of the Bill which deals with amendments to the Act of 1999.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not have any difficulty with section 6 but it allows me to raise one point.  In this section the Minister reduces the donations that can be accepted by political parties and politicians in general.  He is responding to concerns expressed by the public and by some politicians in recent years.  We will never get this perfect because we do not live in a perfect world.  Somebody has to fund politics.  Democracy is worth funding and if it is not funded privately it must be funded by the taxpayer.  I do not believe we are ready yet to take that major step.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">We are dealing here with one side of the coin, the funding of politics.  The other side is expenditure by political parties and politicians and on this matter I seek the initial views of the Minister.  I have no set view.  As long as the Minister is a politician there will be a limit on the donations I can receive.  On the other side of the equation, there is no limit on how I spend my money as a politician, or how I can attempt to buy popularity by sponsoring clubs or <Col N="24"/>associations, or by having the biggest advertisement in the biggest newspaper and promoting myself in that regard.  Privately wealthy people who practise politics can use their own money to get a competitive or political advantage over a candidate who does not have the same ability to sponsor the local soccer team or place big advertisements in the newspaper, and so on.  In the future should we consider limiting what politicians can spend, by way of so-called donations or in advertising?  This is basically a vote-seeking effort.  I do not suggest that we should be prohibited absolutely from buying tickets, or whatever, but it is the other side of the equation.  We are being obliged by law to accept only modest donations while people who are privately wealthy can use their money to buy sponsorship or advertising.  It becomes a way of buying votes.  This is probably something we should consider.</P>
        <P>The public might decide that all politicians, who are believed to be so wealthy, have become so mean they will not even buy a ticket at the local GAA draw but we must find that balance.  The Minister might have a view on this for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On this section, we must be honest about legislation concerning disclosure of donations in recent years.  It has done a certain amount of good, perhaps even a great deal of good.  The requirement to comply with the Standards in Public Office Commission requirements produces, and is conducive to, a culture of transparency and compliance among politicians.   We must also admit that there has been a certain amount of fuzzy, if not cynical thinking about the relationship between money and politics.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">On Second Stage, another Senator and I referred to the fact that I had received a certain large amount of donations when I was running for election in 2007 and these were required to be disclosed under the legislation.  That is true but it struck me at the time as amazing, and still does, that a politician can receive &euro;100,000 in political donations but provided he or she receives them in denominations or amounts of less than &euro;635 per donor on aggregate &mdash; one must aggregate the donations from any individual donor in any one year &mdash; he or she would not have to declare a penny.  As a first-time politician, I  went around in a transparent way and asked people who would like to see me get elected if they would make a large donation so that I would not have to spend the year fund-raising.  I said I would disclose the donation because it would be in excess of &euro;635 and I would therefore have to declare the donor&rsquo;s name.  I had no problem with disclosing those donations but I have a major problem with the fact that a person could accumulate an unreal amount of money in donations and never have to declare a penny of it, simply because it was received in amounts of less than &euro;635 per person.  It is interesting that this legislation does not propose to change this situation very much.  If I am not mistaken, it simply proposes to bring the permitted figure down to &euro;600.  It will be at that point that one must declare a donation.  Why is the figure not less?  If we are really interested in transparency why is there not to be disclosure of any significant amount of money?</P>
        
        <P>It seems there are three kinds of ways in which money can flow to politicians and this is relevant to section 6.  There can be public funding which I believe to be dubious because much of the time it does not go towards fulfilment of the Member&rsquo;s duties but towards his or her electoral effort and electability over the longer term.  It skews the system.  There are corporate donations which are problematic because companies were not set up for this in the first place.  Companies are set up, with limited liability and all suchlike provided for, to allow people to take risks and go into business and build up the economy.   It was not the original intention that companies could influence politics by using their financial and economic muscle.  There is a serious problem with that.</P><Col N="25"/>
        <P>The least problematic area is that of non-corporate donations to politicians, provided there is transparency.  I say that as one with a vested interest, as one who has declared donations.  Speakers referred on Second Stage to my donations yet all but one that I declared were non-corporate.  There was one corporate donation which was duly declared.  A person who might not be the best speaker or politician in the world but who has done well in life might wish to put his or her personal resources at the disposal of a particular politician or political party whose ideals and aims and policies he or she admires and supports.  That is an entirely legitimate enterprise provided there is full transparency.</P>
        <P>Were it not for the fact that I would be accused of having a vested interest I would question more strongly the reduction in the amount of permitted donations, from &pound;2,000 to &euro;1,000.  I would not lose any sleep over it &mdash; &euro;1,000 is still a substantial amount of money &mdash; but this method seems the least egregious kind of donation.  I speak of the non-corporate personal donation, provided there is transparency.  However, we must do a great deal more than this Bill does in terms of transparency.  I cite the example I gave earlier, of the reduction in the threshold only to &euro;600.  One can still receive anything up to that amount in any one year from any one source and one does not have to declare a penny of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Bradford&rsquo;s point about buying votes, the more money one has or can give or can throw around.  Presumably the aim of giving money to various people is to help the cause but there are other objectives too, asking for help to get re-elected, or whatever.  Senator Bradford is right that this should be looked at.  Even now, with so many cutbacks, various community organisations are writing to various political people for donations for this, that or the other.  People would find it difficult to refuse community organisations that are doing good work on the ground but which may not be funded nationally.  Everybody would feel obliged to contribute something.  This must all be examined because it will disenfranchise people who are not well off from participating in politics.  If one does not have the money to give to each organisation, however worthy the cause, one will be disenfranchised.  There must be a serious examination of this.</P>
        <P>I raised a matter on the Order of Business concerning the review of local government.  The Leader told me to raise it again under this section even though it does not pertain precisely to it.  It applies to the funding of politics.  I do not ask the Minister for a response now on the review of local government but I wish to raise it in connection with this section because it, too, concerns funding and the application of funding.  I asked that pole postering by all political parties should be banned.  If we banned that practice there would not be the need to raise half the money needed for politics and everybody would be on a level playing pitch.   With all the different means of communication available, a board could be established in each community funded communally, which could advertise all the politicians, and the sending of the litir um thoghc&aacute;in centrally on behalf of every candidate by political parties could be banned.</P>

	<P Just="Left">How much would that save?  Less money would have to be raised for the political system if things were done more smartly.  We are in the information age and many advances are being made to ensure every community is IT friendly.  I do not seek a reply from the Minister now but I ask him to examine this issue in the local government review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il accepts that the Bill is a major step forward and is an improvement on the current position.  It provides for lower donation limits and increased transparency but it does not go far enough.  We would like corporate donations banned completely but we accept there may be constitutional issues which must <Col N="26"/>be examined.  That is why in the Bill we tabled last year, we provided for such low limits and restrictive practices that it all but got rid of them.  We have tabled amendments to provide for an even more restrictive scheme than that provided for and to improve the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree strongly with Senator Bradford that in looking only at one side of the equation, we are missing the point because people can be independently wealthy and spend as much as they like on their campaign.  The current regime provides for limits on expenditure only during campaigns.  Candidates can spend as much as they like and they can rent out every bus shelter in the constituency in the week up to announcement of polling day.  That issue also needs to be considered and I encourage the Minister to consider it.</P>
        <P>I agree to some extent with Senator Keane in respect of posters.  However, postering is important for new candidates who do not have a profile and who have not run previously because they need to increase awareness of their campaign.  However, the number of posters used in elections is crazy.  Candidates compete with each other for space and the posters cancel each other out when there are ten or more on a pole.  I doubt anybody sees any of them.  A small limit should be put on the number of posters that can be used.  I encourage the Minister to examine the expenditure and postering issues.  Legislation could be brought forward to address them, given that we are only examining one half of the problem today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Bradford.  Significant money is wasted on election campaigns and expenditure should also be examined.  I am prepared to do that and I will publish legislation later this year entitled the electoral (amendment) (referendum spending and miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  It is an unwieldy title but it will do what the Senator wants.  That will give us an opportunity to tease out expenditure matters in respect of all elections, including referenda.  There is currently no requirement on groups campaigning in a referendum to declare what they have spent or the sources of their income.  Referenda campaigns involve decisions on matters that have significant and far reaching effects on the country and, therefore, it is important that citizens know how much is being spent on campaigns and where it is coming from.</P>
        <P>Currently, the spending limits for elections apply only to the period up to polling day and in the past I and others have expressed legitimate concerns about how candidates get around the limits by spending significant amounts before the clock starts to tick in a campaign.  This is an issue of concern and it will be addressed in the legislation later this year.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane referred to banning posters but a freedom of expression requirement is enshrined in the Constitution.  People have a human right to express themselves in a certain form.  We might have a discussion about how that is best expressed without the waste that is experienced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One can pick any figure one wishes for the donation limit, as the correct figure is subjective, but it must be picked for practical reasons in order that an individual or a political party is tied up with the administrative bureaucracy associated with reporting to the SIPO.  The responsibilities are onerous and if one does not comply 100% with them, one will find oneself in the public eye for not declaring.  A penalty is built in through the publicity candidates generate by not complying with the SIPO request relating to compliance.  The limit of &euro;600 is reasonable.  I am reducing the limit for corporate donations to political parties to &euro;200 and that is a substantial reduction.  I gave a commitment to do that in the election campaign and I am following through on that.  I am sure Senator Power will not disagree that Fianna F&aacute;il had 14 years to do this and did not do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The party introduced a Bill prior to leaving government.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="27"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was unconstitutional.  This has been acknowledged by the party since.  The issues raised by the Senator can be included as part of the constitutional convention, which will be announced by the Taoiseach in the next few weeks.  People will have an opportunity to make submissions about an outright ban on corporate donations.</P>
        <P>A balance must be struck between political funding from the public purse and private sources.  I do not want to go back to the days of cheque book politics with professional and political elites swanning in and out of both Houses when they had their day&rsquo;s work done in the Law Library or elsewhere.  That day is, hopefully, gone and people on modest incomes and none will have the same opportunity as wealthy individuals to be elected to the Oireachtas.  That is why public expenditure is important and there must be controls on the income and expenditure side.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  How that money is best spent can be teased out in the debate on the legislation to which I referred earlier.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has a watchful eye on all expenditure matters and he also has concerns about these issues.</P>
        <P>The thresholds provided for in the Bill are reasonable and they provide balance in the context of the limits we want to enshrine in legislation.  The litir um thoghch&aacute;in issue can also be examined in the context of whether it is necessary to maintain it in its current form.  It costs significant money for the parties to distribute it.  Perhaps there is a better way of communicating to the electorate than sending a letter at the expense of taxpayer on behalf of political parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his enlightening comments.  He said he does not like cheque book politics and I am sure everyone agrees with him.  Politics should not be about swanning in from the Law Library,  the Blackrock Clinic or Trinity College Dublin to do a spot of legislating while the poor man stands at the gate.  If that is the problem the Minister is trying to address, the public funding of political parties will do little to prevent that.  One gets the reward once one is elected.  To promote access to politics, first-time candidates need assistance.  I acknowledge funding is available if a candidate attracts a certain number of votes in an election but if the Minister was trying to promote access to politics and to make sure it did not become the preserve of the rich, he would not target non-corporate donations; he would just require transparency.  The way the person who is not rich can access politics and run a good campaign is by approaching people who share his or her ideas and asking whether they will donate and be publicly associated with his or her political platform.  I speak from experience.  There is something appropriate about that.  The issue is transparency. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister's stated motivation is laudable in terms of making sure the Oireachtas is not the preserve of the rich but public funding of political parties does not do much to address that possible mischief.  I take his point regarding the bureaucracy surrounding the amounts for disclosure but I do not see the reduction of the limit from &euro;635 to &euro;600 as a significant achievement.  One could go much lower than that, and that is before we even talk about the phenomenon of people turning up to race nights.  It probably happened more often during the days of the Celtic tiger when the builders had cash in their pockets and would buy any amount of tickets at a race night, none of which would ever have to be declared.  We have a flawed system and a donation in excess of &euro;100 is something one should be capable of noting down at the time one receives it &mdash; name and address of donor.  It is not excessively onerous.  I might rattle up an amendment on that for Report Stage and I look forward to debating it with the Minister.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response to our debate and look forward to the publication of the new Bill.  A balance must be struck in this regard, and it is difficult.  We are engaging in theoretical politics here but it is different in the real world.</P>
        <P>On this section, regarding the private little groupings that seem to be funding the American presidential election, which were set up to circumvent whatever expenditure rules are in place in the United States &mdash; I think they are called super packs &mdash; and where private individuals can come together, not overtly to sell a candidate but to sell a concept and an ideology, do we need to ensure that such activities are regulated in our laws?  The Minister is putting in place limits for corporate donations to individuals or political parties but is there a loophole under which a group of people trying to push an agenda or ideology can work outside the law?  I do not expect the Minister to have an immediate answer but it is something we might need to examine because apparently the big thing in the United States currently is not what the political parties or the candidates are spending but the private groups which are clearly supporting a candidate or a party and circumventing the law by declaring themselves as interest or pressure groups.  It is something the Minister&rsquo;s new Bill later in the year should address.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Bradford that this needs to be addressed.  I have indicated already that we must know from where campaign groups with a particular view of such matters get their money.

	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that he will bring forward a Bill to address the expenditure side.  That is a huge part of the issue and is part of the problem Senator Mullen is alluding to, namely, they spend as much as they wish.  I disagree with Senator Mullen in respect of having an upper limit for personal donations because that means that people with wealthy friends they can collect as much as they wish.  The best way to deal with that is on the expenditure side to ensure that whether one is spending one&rsquo;s own money, that of one&rsquo;s friends or corporate donations, which we would prefer were not allowed, everybody is brought down to the lowest possible limit.  That is where the real change is needed.</P>
        <P>On the broader issue and before we deal with specific amendments, the Minister will be aware that our party has proposed legislation on lobbying.  As part of the broader debate we are having here on transparency I hope the Minister would reflect on that because it is another important issue in terms of transparency and trust in politics.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate what Senator Power said.  The opportunity to discuss this Bill in the Seanad behoves well for the level of debate that takes place in this Chamber.  It has been a great discussion.</P>
        <P>A good deal of exposure was rightly given on Second Stage to the gender quotas but these sections are fundamentally important also in terms of building trust in the future politics of the Republic, and between politicians and citizens, and also encouraging more citizens to become involved in politics.  The more trust we have and the more the ground rules are clear for all of us in terms of accessibility and ability, the more level the pitch.</P>
        <P>Our amendment is the nub of the issue.  It is the nub of the Moriarty tribunal findings and, I presume, it will be the nub of the Mahon tribunal findings in terms of the banning of corporate donations.  The Minister mentioned on Second Stage that there might have been constitutional reasons Fine Gael or the programme for Government could not move on the banning of all corporate donations.  If there is such advice the Minister might share that with us to ensure we can understand and debate that, although I know what the Minister&rsquo;s argument will be.  We intend to move an amendment to ban all corporate donations.  The Minister will come back to us and say his advice is that we cannot do that but we would like to see that advice.  That will make this a more productive debate and there will not be any gamesmanship.  I know that is not the Minister&rsquo;s intention but it is something we might seek with a view to having a better debate on that issue.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>While the ban on corporate donations was not recommended in the Moriarty tribunal report on the basis that it was a matter for Government, the report intimated that only a complete ban on private funding would provide a cast iron guarantee against corruption.  It stated that the only cast iron guarantee against corruption and abuses in the political system and against the risk of distortions in the democratic process that may arise from the private funding of political parties and political representatives would be to provide for a complete ban on private political funding and, as in some other European countries, to fund political parties entirely from the public purse.  I stated on Second Stage that I would encourage private donations by citizens.  Donating as part of a democratic political process is an important piece of activism on behalf of the citizen.  However, I have yet to come across substantial reasons corporate donations cannot be banned as opposed to meddling with the cap of &euro;100 and suddenly there is an enormous amount of paper work involved as well, never mind the fact that we are being ambiguous about and prevaricating on the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; issue.  This is a clear and simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; scenario, and putting limits on it will allow people to get around.  It would be difficult to limit contributions and it does not stop family members, for instance, who also happen to be directors of corporations giving funding individually.  Under the current Act a donation from a private business and a donation from directors of that private business which is made in a private capacity are regarded as separate donations.  That would remain the case if this Bill is passed as all individuals must have equal rights to donate to a political party, regardless of where she or he works.</P>
        <P>The proposed legislation provides for a cap of &euro;2,500 on donations to political parties.  That is the legal position.  That does not prevent six like-minded individuals who are connected to a corporation from donating &euro;2,500.  Therefore, the Bill proposes to cap donations to parties by any donor at &euro;2,500.  With donations capped at &euro;2,500, individual donations from, for instance, six directors, could be &euro;1,500 and with those added to a donation from a corporate donor, the maximum that could be legally donated would be &euro;17,500 in one calendar year.  That compares with &euro;44,000 under the current Acts and is 39% of what can be legally donated under the current legislation.  I seek the Minister&rsquo;s advice as to why corporate donations cannot be banned entirely.</P>
        <P>The real test of the reduction in caps proposed in the Bill in achieving the stated policy objective is whether it reduces the probability that political parties rely heavily on financial donations from particular corporate donors or individuals who are associated with the interest of such corporate donors.  By reducing the cap, the Bill addresses a weaknesses in the current statutory framework, which may have allowed substantial sums of money to be legally donated to politicals parties and candidates.  It could therefore reduce the reliance of political parties on large donations from corporate donors.  However, as the position I outlined also demonstrates, as I explained in the case of six directors, it will remain possible under this Bill for a group of individuals to collectively make a decision to each individually donate money to a political party while lower sums of money, in aggregate, could be considerable.</P>
        <P>We should get rid of the ambiguity, ban donations entirely and build a trust between the citizen and the politician without it being mediated by big business or a sense of a limit which could be got around, as would be possible under the Bill, by bundling, whereby individuals could come together and circumvent the current proposal.  In this amendment, together with my fellow Senators, I propose the banning of corporate donators entirely.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment and concur fully with what Senator Mac Conghail said.  Our group has put forward this amendment.  As the Minister said, the Bill presents an opportunity to increase transparency.  When he launched the Bill he spoke about <Col N="31"/>addressing the question of unhealthy relationships and corporate donations are part of such unhealthy relationships.  The Minister said that we have moved away from chequebook politics but I contend that corporate donations should be banned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of amendments are being taken in this grouping.  Our amendment No. 4 also proposes the banning of corporate donations.  The Independent Senators&rsquo; amendment No. 3 goes further than ours.  It proposes to delete lines 11 to 41, while our amendment proposes to delete lines 11 to 37.  There is a reason for what we propose in our amendment and I want to explain it because we cannot support amendment No. 3.  If the Independent Senators take on board what I say, they may withdraw their amendment and support amendment No. 4.</P>
        <P>I support a ban on corporate donations.  We have to grit our teeth when we hear representatives from Fianna F&aacute;il talk about banning corporate donations when one considers the Galway tent and that many people distrust politics and their view of it is based on what happened over many years under the term of that party, in particular, in office.  That party must take responsibility for the fact that the brown envelope culture came from a certain political party and while it echoed across other parties as well, it was mainly associated with one political party.  That must be said in the context of this debate and it would be foolish for us not to do so.  That is not to say that Senators in Fianna F&aacute;il or members of that party do not want to have a changed system in the future but we are where we are because of abuses in the system which came from a certain political party.  Therefore, I support a ban on corporate donations.</P>
        <P>As Senator Mac Conghail said, some people may be able to get around the system.  Some positive changes have been proposed with the proposals to reduce the maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation by a political party from &euro;6,348.69 to &euro;2,500 and the maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation from an individual from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000, and to reduce the threshold at which donations must be declared to &euro;1,500 for parties and to &euro;600 for individuals.  A previous speaker made the argument that if one gets 20 donations under &euro;600, even if one of those donations is &euro;599, one does not have to declare them.  That is part of the problem in that there are still loopholes in the system.  There are ways in which people can get around these limits.  While I accept what Senator Bradford said about the need for balance in a general sense, we must also be conscious that people look for loopholes in all of this.  The best way to ensure there is no association between big business, corporations or businesses generally with politics is to ban corporate donations.</P>
        <P>I have stood for a number of general elections and I have always received over the 25% threshold in terms of getting a return back from the Standards in Public Office Commission.  It is around &euro;6,500 for a general election, which would fund a general election campaign.  None of my campaigns was over that amount by much and, if they were, it was only by a few hundred euro or perhaps &euro;1,000.  If we were to examine that, we could say to political parties that is what they should spend on elections.  We know that some candidates spend &euro;20,000 to &euro;60,000 on their campaigns.  Senator Keane made the point that posters should be banned.  I do not know whether my party would support that but such a move would save money and it would limit the amount of money that is spent.  Some of the returns from some candidates in terms of what they spend is amazing.</P>
        <P>I support a complete ban on corporate donations.  I support the broad thrust of the amendment tabled by the Independent Senators.  They propose the deletion of lines 11 to 41 but there is a number of reasons we cannot go as far as what they propose.  One relates to college societies.  On Second Stage the Minister said:</P><Col N="32"/>
        <P LI="1">An exemption from the new registration requirements is given to a provider of a programme of education and training or a students&rsquo; union where such a body makes a payment to a student society or club.  This will allow colleges or students&rsquo; unions to continue to provide financial support to student groups that promote political participation without being obliged to comply with the new corporate donor requirements.  I am sure Members will agree that these grants to student societies can hardly be regarded as the sort of corporate donations which need to be restricted and that this exemption does not contradict our objective of enhancing the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I agree with that because there is a world of difference between a student society getting a payment from a third level institute to fund a political society and what we are talking about here in terms of corporate donations.  The position in terms of a students&rsquo; society is no different from that of a GAA club, an Irish language society, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender society, or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Student unions should not be subject to this.  That is one of the reasons I cannot support the amendment tabled by the Independent Senators.</P>
        <P>As proposed in our amendment No. 11, we want lines 23 to 32 retained, which cover a donee having to return a donation to the Standards in Public Office Commission if the money is lodged in his or her account.  That is important because if one has a donations account and somebody anonymously puts money into it, or one does not know that money has been lodged in it, or from where an amount lodged has come, sections of the Bill require the donee to give that money to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Such money has to be returned.  That is important.  It would be wrong to remove that provision.  Amendment No. 12 deals with this also.  Lines 38 and 40 require the money to be returned and the use of that money would come under the remit of the Minister for Finance.  For those reasons, because of amendments Nos. 8, 11 and 12, which retain some of the requirements in terms of the Standards in Public Office Commission, the donations made and how all that plays out, the lines which we propose should be retained should remain in the Bill.  However, the substance of amendment No. 3 in terms of proposing a complete ban on corporate donations is dealt with in amendment  No. 4.  It proposes to delete lines 11 to 37 and its wording, &ldquo;shall directly or through any intermediary accept any corporate donations&rdquo; is the same as that proposed in amendment No. 3.   I hope the Senators will support that amendment and accept my reasons for not accepting amendment No. 3.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also tabled amendments Nos. 22 to 25, which are essentially the same but deal with local government.  If amendment No. 4 falls we will not be pressing amendments Nos. 8, 11, 12, 13 or 21, because if there are to be corporate donations we do want to see a proper database registration system and so on.  That would make sense.  We do not want anyone to misrepresent our position &mdash; not that the Minister would.  Similarly, if amendment No. 22 falls, we will not move amendments Nos. 23 to 25, because there will need to be a database and checks and balances will be required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>There probably is not one of us, as politicians, who would not like to see all types of political donation banned, if this were possible.  The first thing we have to do when we get rid of one source of funding is to identify a second source of funding.  That is the reason for the Moriarty tribunal.  We should look at how things are funded in other countries, sometimes from the national purse.  If we are going to ban all types of funding for politics &mdash; and I agree with this totally &mdash; it would make life so much easier for every politician if there was a central purse to draw on, but how do we obtain that central purse?  We would have to <Col N="33"/>go out and ask the people to fund politics.  I do not know how many people out there would be ready to fund politicians.  I suspect it would be very few.</P>
        <P>The other question is what would happen if we banned corporate donations totally.  This debate has been around for a long time, and it has been said &mdash; I do not know how true it is, and I would not attribute it to anybody &mdash; that people will always find a way around it.  The best thing is to have regulations, such as those the Minister has introduced, to ensure that corporate donations are as transparent as can be provided for and that any money provided outside those regulations is illegal.  Unless there is some type of regulation for corporate funding, we could end up with a free-for-all.  Banning is one thing, but there are people out there who are ready and able and willing every day to try to circumvent any type of legislation that is brought in.  The Minister has tried his best.  The substantial reduction in donations that is provided for in this Bill must be acknowledged, as well as the substantial reduction in the moneys that must be disclosed.  We will have to crawl before we walk.  I would like to see a full ban, but I have come to recognise that if we ban donations, there will be no regulations.  This is a better way to do it.  As I said, it would make it an awful lot easier for politicians if donations were totally banned.</P>
        <P>In these amendments, we have one Senator saying corporate donations should come down to &euro;1 and another saying they should come down to &euro;100, while a third says they should be banned.  There is not total agreement on how it should be done, which shows there is some debate on the matter.  However, this is the best way to go at the moment.  We will have regulations for corporate donations, which involve a substantial reduction in the amounts that can be given.  I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am interested in the distinction between the different types of amendment that have been offered from different parts of the House.  Listening to Senator Cullinane, I find myself in agreement with a lot of what he is saying.  As a former student union official, I wondered as I was listening to the Senator whether it was appropriate that we create an exception for donations provided to a political party organised at college, for example.  It is often the case in colleges that funding is made available to clubs and societies for the purpose of allowing them to carry out their activities, which is a good thing, and it seems that political parties starting up in colleges should not be excluded from that.  That said, political parties in third level colleges are a bit like banks &mdash; it is all about catching people early so they can have them for life.  With that in mind, perhaps the culture of resistance to corporate donations should also be inculcated; people could be introduced to that allergy to corporate donations from an early age.  I am sure it has never happened that a member of the Sinn F&eacute;in cumann got elected to the presidency of the student union and there were donations to the Sinn F&eacute;in society concerned.  I could say the same for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  One would not like to think a student union would show preferential treatment to any political party on campus.  On balance, I accept what Senator Cullinane is saying.  That exclusion should be made.  However, in every other respect I like what I am hearing from Senator Mac Conghail.</P>
        <P>I would like to address a point made by Senator Mac Conghail and, to some extent, by the Minister.  If it is the case that the Minister intends to make some kind of constitutional argument against an outright ban on corporate donations, I look forward to hearing it.  It seems to me that once one goes down the road of restricting the amount of money that either private or corporate donors can give, one is already interfering in whatever kind of freedom that the Constitution might claim to protect.  I would look with a sceptical eye at constitutional arguments against an outright ban of corporate donations, but I approach the issue with an open mind.</P><Col N="34"/>
        <P>The Minister does not rate my skills at the Ballinasloe horse fair, but what I am proposing here is that we reduce the permitted amount of corporate donations to &euro;100, and that in any situation in which more than &euro;1 is given, the corporate donor must register as the Bill provides.  What I am trying to do is to create a situation in which corporate donations are not banned, but it becomes extremely onerous to either give or receive them.  If it is the case that the main plank of the Minister&rsquo;s argument against what Senators Cullinane and Mac Conghail are proposing is a constitutional argument, he will have to find some other grounds on which to disagree with my proposal, because I am proposing that we legislate corporate donations out of existence by reducing the permitted amount to an insignificant sum and that we impose onerous requirements on corporate donors from the get-go.  I do not think the village shopkeeper has anything to worry about if he or she is a sole trader; I am sure that will count as a personal donation.  The principle is that we should allow maximum freedom to individuals who are willing to take the personal hit to contribute from their own resources &mdash; I do not care whether they are rich or poor &mdash; to politicians or parties.  That can be a good thing, provided there is full transparency.  However, we certainly need to close down corporate donations.  That is where the potential for corruption really arises.</P>
        <P>With regard to Senator Mac Conghail&rsquo;s proposal &mdash; he may speak again on this &mdash; is he suggesting that if his amendments are accepted, the six individual persons whose companies donated would retain their freedom to make individual personal donations?  I presume this is the case.  That is something with which I would agree.  As long as people are seen to donate, the requirement for transparency is achieved and we can minimise corruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.</P>
        <P>On balance, we should ban politics altogether, and then we would not have any of these difficulties.  I would love to be able to say &ldquo;Let us ban corporate donations&rdquo;.  It is the easiest and simplest solution.  However, I do not think it would work in practice.  That is the problem we face.  With our urge for transparency pushing us towards an approach of zero corporate donations, we will end up, ironically, with less transparency, because corporations, as we know, work very hard to achieve something if they are determined to achieve it.  They employ accountants and lawyers to manoeuvre themselves around corporate law and all kinds of other things so that they can do what they wish to do.  Business is business.  In this case, if a corporation is determined to make some type of donation to an individual or a party, it will find a way if we ban all donations.  Having a small donation of &euro;200 makes it more transparent.  One is seen to give the &euro;200 and one is limited to that amount.  Given the way humanity is, my fear is that if we are not allowed to do something, we will find another route to do it.  We all know what happened during Prohibition.  Ironically, there will be more transparency if we reduce the amount and acknowledge that one is allowed to give that amount.  There will still be the squirming and re-routing of support for a person or a party but that will be reduced if one is allowed to make a small donation.  I realise this is one of those turning logic on its head moments but, having thought about it for a long time, I believe a total ban will cause more harm.</P>

	<P>While breaches of ethics have been associated with most parties, and the Moriarty report does not concern ours, I accept that our party has been associated with some of the worst of them.  As a young member of the party, it is something of which I am deeply ashamed, and I have been vocal about that on many occasions outside the House.  That is the reason I would prefer an absolute ban.  From a party political perspective, Fianna F&aacute;il will never win back people&rsquo;s trust and support until we can establish that we have put that behind us and that we have set the highest standards, beyond those of anybody else.  We have more to prove, which is why I believe there should be an outright ban.</P>
        <P>I received one unsolicited corporate donation of &euro;500 during my local election campaign and I sent it back straight away.  I have never taken a corporate donation, but I accept that my party and other parties accept them.  That should change.  The amendments we have put down will ensure disclosure of amounts over &euro;100.  The reason I support them is that I have been told an outright ban is unconstitutional.  I would prefer if it was constitutional but we must listen to legal advice.  Senators van Turnhout and Mac Conghail called for the legal advice to be published.  That would be very positive.</P>
        <P>We are all on the same page on this matter.  Everybody who has spoken has said they would prefer corporate donations to abolished.  It would be a positive development if the Minister published that advice so we can all be equally well informed.  Listening to other Members, I believe there would be agreement.  If a ban cannot be constitutional and we would set up a system that would be struck down by the courts, Members should support the idea of disclosure of amounts over &euro;100 and having absolute transparency.  I hope the Minister will publish that advice before Report Stage.</P>

        <P>If we intend to be realistic and not hypocritical, can the Minister outline the position with all those politicians who appear to live on very high moral ground and claim they do not accept their salaries, but live on the minimum wage and transfer tens of thousands of euro per annum to their political parties?  What is the legal situation of a Deputy transferring &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000 of their salary to their political party?  I believe it is illegal.  The politicians who claim that they do not take their full salary should enter into a covenant or arrangement with the Department of Finance whereby the balance of their salaries is returned to the taxpayer.  They are committing an illegal act in transferring &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 per annum to their political parties, as they claim to be doing.  If they can live without that money, they should return it to the taxpayer for the general good of the economy rather than use it for political purposes.</P>

        <P>Senators Keane and O&rsquo;Keeffe summed up our difficulty.  We would love to live in a perfect world, but we do not and will not.  Later this year the constitutional committee will examine the electoral system.  That might be a little removed from this debate but in one sense it is central to it.  Most countries in Europe do not have a facility for private funding of political parties, so the taxpayer funds those parties.  However, those countries have a different type of politics with list systems and party headquarters dominating the show.  People are not funding individuals because they do not vote for individuals but for political parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If there was a list system here, in which the electorate did not vote for a candidate but for a political party, it would then be much easier to suggest State funding of political parties.  However, at present people who might support or even be members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party might well decide to fund their local Fine Gael candidate with whom they have a personal friendship.  We have that type of complicated thing here because of our electoral system.  That is a debate for another day, perhaps, but it is one of the reasons it is not so easy and neat to simply ban all types of personal and corporate funding and to move to taxpayer funding.  We do not have the politics or the electoral system which would make it an easier option.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane&rsquo;s response to the amendments is quite balanced.  In our innocent days, we all would love to have seen all types of private and corporate funding removed, but I do not see any marches on the street by taxpayers demanding to fund politics.  Most taxpayers are of the opinion that they are paying enough tax already and have no wish to fund political party activity.  It is either one way or the other, that is, either private, corporate or controlled funding or taxpayer funding.  That is a debate that will not be concluded today but it is not as simple as banning all corporate funding, as the amendment suggests.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In our current electoral system our type of politics is often more competitive within the parties than between the parties.  We generally do not have a competition of political ideas at elections but a competition of individuals.  That is why it is so expensive and why there are so many posters, leaflets and so much advertising.  That is the type of politics we have.  It is not a national debate on ideology or ideas, but generally a local, hurling match-type of politics.  That is the reason politics is so expensive and the reason it is difficult to control expenditure and funding.  I hope the constitutional committee will look at that big picture, although it is a debate for another day.</P><Col N="37"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has got it as right as possible in the Bill.  We are, in a way, trying to square a circle.  We will not come up with a perfect answer but at least we are making things much better than they were.  I hope the Minister will respond to the point I made earlier.  I do not believe a word from the mouths of the politicians who claim to be living on the average industrial wage.  That is hypocritical cant, but we need to challenge it.  If these people are handing over tranches of money to their respective political parties it is illegal, under current electoral law.  That money should be returned to the taxpayer. </P>

	<P>I also welcome the Minister to the House.  The Bill represents a reality.  When we look for change we must see it as a continuum and not something to be achieved overnight.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned about the definition of &ldquo;corporate&rdquo;, in the context of corporate donations.  We seem to have taken a view that all corporate donations are wrong and evil.  We need to take a step back from this.  In the definition, corporate includes a trust.  There are many trusts with charitable purposes or engaged with poor communities, marginalised groups, immigrants or women to encourage these marginalised groups to engage in politics.  An unintended consequence of the Bill would be to outlaw the Women&rsquo;s Political Association, which was a key mover in the 1990s and early 2000s in encouraging the activation of women in politics.  What are we talking about when we talk about banning corporate donations, trusts or unincorporated bodies of persons?  We need to be careful when we talk about banning such &ldquo;corporate donations&rdquo; that we do not end up removing access to political engagement from disenfranchised groups in our society.</P>
        <P>I am also somewhat concerned at the way the debate has gone.  I took Senator Fiach Mac Conghail&rsquo;s point about the Moriarty report and corporate donations.  The Moriarty report also said the removal of corporate donations from the political system had to be balanced by more public funding for the political system.  Senator Ron&aacute;n Mullen and others mentioned that a way around this rebalancing would be to have more private donations from individual citizens to support the political system.  We have enough activation of the contented in our society without adding to that difficulty.  More than 400,000 people are unemployed and 100,000 face the loss of their homes.  If we move to a political system that is funded more by the individual and less by corporations the inevitable consequence will be that the funding of politics will come from people who have the most money and the best education, the middle class, white, middle income workers who have a particular agenda and tend not to want change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to be careful when we tamper with the political system that we do not end up with a system that disenfranchises more of our citizens than are disenfranchised currently.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate and I agree very much with what Senator Hayden has said.  It is important that we encourage all of society to be represented at political levels.  We do not want to go in the direction of the United States of America, where one has to be a millionaire to get into any kind of politics, and certainly to run for the Presidency, although, as the Minister will know, it is getting rather like that in presidential elections here.  It is odd that the number of us who ran as independent candidates in the presidential election found that even though we got more than 100,000 votes from Irish citizens we did not get a single cent in support from the taxpayer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad my good friend and colleague, Senator Cullinane, is here because I would not have liked to make this criticism in his absence.  I do not agree with what I heard him say on the monitor earlier.  It is against the principle of independence.  He suggested that the funding of Independent Members and groups should be further restricted and that there should be stricter vouching and scrutinisation.  The Minister agreed with alacrity and said he would be delighted <Col N="38"/>to take up what was being said about the Independents and that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would do this, that and the other.  The Minister should not think this opinion is universally held.  He knows, because he is a canny operator, that the entire political system is skewed against the participation of individuals and independents in the system.  Every single party has been involved in this, including Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I usually agree with Sinn F&eacute;in Members, because they are rather to the left and we need a leftie perspective in the country.  The claim that they take the average industrial wage is hogwash.  I do not care if they took nothing, because the taxpayer pays the full whack.  They should not think they are fooling the taxpayers when they say they take only the average industrial wage.  The people who pay should have a say.  Sinn F&eacute;in squeezes them for the same amount of money as everyone else.</P>
        <P>It is exceptionally difficult for any group, particularly marginalised groups, to be represented.  It is an extraordinary thing to say, as Senator Hayden said, that women are a marginalised group.  They are the only numerical majority that is seen as a minority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;and have been treated as a marginalised minority.  We have had to introduce special legislation to encourage them to get into politics.  I am not standing over imposing any further financial hardship on people who have the guts to get up, get involved and get engaged in politics.  We need to encourage it.  It should not be penalised from a position of hypocrisy by a party that takes every single grant it possibly can, including from Westminster where it never even put a bum on a seat.  Although good relations have been established on a personal basis between us, I will not take hogwash and I do not want the Minister to take from this debate that every Independent Member kowtows to the kind of things that may be in the pipeline.  I know the country is in a difficult financial situation.  However, if we want the political system to work we must encourage independent voices and stop this skewing of financial and other supports. </P>
     
	<P>Candidates who have the support of a political party are at an enormous advantage.  The financial arrangements for elections are subtly and deliberately skewed in the direction of parties, and have been since the foundation of the State.  We must have parties to have efficient government, but we also need  canaries in the mine; those people who, because they are not subject to the Whip, will be prepared to say the things that are for the others unsayable and to stand out and consistently follow a line of principle.</P>
        <P>I was not here for the early part of the debate because I was with a young gentleman who is writing a thesis on Palestine and Gaza.  I told him to take the principle wherever it led him.  It may lead into dangerous areas and one may be accused of certain things but one has to follow that principle.  One does not become an advocate of Palestinian rights, Jewish rights, Israeli rights, women&rsquo;s rights or gay rights.  One must be an advocate of human rights.  We must protect the individual voice through this legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>May I clarify a point I made earlier about students&rsquo; unions?  I was referring to the funding of student societies, whether political, sporting or cultural by students&rsquo; unions.  I was not talking about corporate donations.  Students&rsquo; unions have their own mechanisms and controls for how the money is administered and there is fairness and equity for the various groups.  That is what this is about, and not corporate donations to student bodies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I must have touched a nerve when I referred to expenses for Independent Senators and Deputies, given the response from Senator Norris.  My point was that Independent Deputies <Col N="39"/>receive the leader&rsquo;s allowance of &euro;45,000, and some of them are giving the money to charity.    One Independent Deputy in my constituency gives the money to charity.  That is not right.  That is a way of buying votes, to be frank about it.  I call for vouched expenses.  If there is to be a leader&rsquo;s allowance for Independent Deputies, then it should be vouched.  If Senator Norris is saying that should not be the case, that those allowances should not be vouched and that Independent Senators can spend this money on whatever they like, that is a matter for him.  It is not something I support.</P>
        <P>In respect of Senator Norris&rsquo;s point on what he called the hogwash about the average industrial wage &mdash; Senator Bradford also made this point &mdash; I am proud that I take the average industrial wage.  Our party put down an amendment to the Finance Bill to reduce the pay of politicians.  That is what we should do, but that amendment was defeated.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have responded to two rants in this House from people who obviously do not believe in transparency.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I compliment Senator Cullinane because he has done very well in fighting off his detractors.  I have a little rant coming up, but I would like to add to what has been said.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford has rightly opened up an important question.  What happens when people receive income and claim not to take all of it themselves, but do not return it to the State or to a recognised charity?  Political parties are not charities and their activities are not charitable activities, so contrary to what Senator Cullinane says, it would be better to give the money to a charity than to plough it back into the activities of a political party or an organisation.  While Senator Cullinane gave a good response, he cannot have it both ways.  As Senator Norris has pointed out, he does not represent a geographical constituency.  He is either giving the money back to his political party, which is improper, or he is spending it disproportionately on the Waterford constituency, where he may intend to be elected at some time&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but for which it was not given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I think the Senator is straying from the amendment as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already said that expenses and allowances should be vouched, and it is correct to say that if political parties receive public funding and they do not have to present vouchers, then the requirement should be that any public funding has to be vouched.  In other words, independent politicians should be treated the same as political parties.  Sauce for the flock of geese must be sauce for the individual gander.  Senator Norris is right in that respect.</P>
        <P>Let us not be distracted from the point raised by Senator Bradford.  If people are taking money as a salary from the State and are giving it disproportionately back to their political parties, there may be an impropriety, unless it is as Senator Cullinane described.  For the avoidance of doubt, perhaps the Minister may want to nail down the issue with an amendment on Report Stage to make it clear that any such funding back to a political party would be inappropriate and unlawful.  A political party is not a recognised charity and an elected politician should not use public money received as a salary any differently than a corporate or private donor should use it.  It should be subject to the same limits of donation.  That applies whether <Col N="41"/>what the politician is giving is in kind, by way of funding a political office, or whether the politician is handing over cash or making out a cheque from a proportion of his or her salary.</P>
        <P>A very interesting issue has been raised by Senator Bradford.  He clearly has been ruminating on these issues for a long time.  I will not make that joke.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an Irish variant of a certain mental condition where people forget everything except the grudges.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Senator Bradford in one respect.  He seeks to contrast public funding of parties and individuals on the one hand and private or corporate donations on the other hand.  He is wrong in lumping in private and corporate donations.  Notwithstanding what Senator Hayden has said, it is appropriate, provided there is transparency, that people put their hands into their own pockets and support individuals and causes in which they believe.   That should be encouraged, although subject to certain limits as it is.  I have not argued here today for unlimited private donation or the possibility of unlimited private donations.  Private donations of that kind are a horse of a different colour from corporate donations.</P>
        <P>Senator Hayden mentioned the Women&rsquo;s Political Association.  There are many fine causes.  I presume she is talking about a situation where the association might want to donate money to female candidates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>It did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  There are examples of this in Britain and in America, some of which I would regard as quite controversial, such as EMILY&rsquo;s List, which stands for Early Money Is Like Yeast.  This is where certain women politicians were induced to take up pro-abortion political positions in exchange for certain donations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what EMILY&rsquo;s List does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot prohibit people from making donations if it is lawful, but transparency is important in that instance.  I am on record as supporting the closing down of such corporate donations.  If the Women&rsquo;s Political Association rightly wants to see more women in politics, it should have the capacity to approach individuals and ask them to donate to female candidates in different constituencies, if they agree with its aims.  We need to build up the connection between the politician and the party on the one hand, and the personal sacrifice by the voter on the other hand.</P>
        <P>We will never be able to avoid a situation where richer people will be able to donate more.  We deal with that by putting in an overall limit, but it is a healthy thing to promote the idea of individuals funding parties and individuals whose ideas they support, provided it is done in a transparent fashion.  That is how to promote political engagement.  The rot sets in when the taxpayer is indirectly funding people&rsquo;s next election attempt through the public funding system, or when corporate entities fund people and compromise them in what they do and say in politics, and do so in ways that are not transparent.  We must not mix the issues.</P><Col N="42"/>
        <P>It is important to separate the notion of private donation from corporate donation.  In 2010, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United <i>v </i>Federal Election Commission that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections could not be limited, pursuant to the right of those entities to free speech.  Senator Bradford raised this earlier.  This shows how wrong America can get it sometimes on certain issues.  That case was the latest in a series of decisions which deeply misunderstood the concept of corporate personhood which, as indicated earlier, is essentially a legal tool to give a corporation personality to undertake contracts, purchase land and so on.  The corporation is not a person and should not be seen as a person in the sense of being a citizen.  It does not have democratic rights such as the vote or the ability to stand for election.  That is why we should see corporations as completely different from personal donations because corporations have a different purpose.  They may have legal personality and may be able to do business but since they do not have the right to vote and the ability to stand for election they should not have the ability to donate either.  They are self-interested bodies, I do not mean in any pejorative sense, designed to ensure profit for their shareholders and company members, and should not be allowed to influence democratic political decisions made by citizens.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I agree with what Senator Hayden has said in that a trust does not have those selfish commercial or self-interested motives from the point of view of commerce but nonetheless a trust gathers money for the accomplishment of a particular purpose.  In the same way that I have opposed the hijacking of the system of public funding of politics for the purpose of securing the laudable objective of increasing the number of women in politics, I do not think the Parliament and the business of elections should be skewed around such issues.  Neither should trusts be in the business of directly funding political parties or individuals.  If the job of those trusts is to create public awareness about the causes and to encourage their subscribing members, <i>qua</i> individual supporters, to fund politicians parties, that is much cleaner and much healthier.</P>

	<P>On a more serious level, it is important to have a debate about corporate donations but it is always a case of trying to balance the freedom of expression of individuals and organisations to make contributions to causes in which they believe, as Senator Hayden has pointed out.  It is a complex issue but while corporate donations <i>per se</i> are viewed as being bad for politics, and clearly a restriction on corporate donations as set out in the Bill is important and supported by everyone, at the same time we must look at other entities.  I take issue with Senator Mullen&rsquo;s comment about EMILY&rsquo;s List, about which he was very pejorative.  EMILY&rsquo;s List is a well established organisation in the US which supports women candidates who have a pro-choice position and is entitled to do that.  There are plenty of organisations and individuals supporting candidates in America and here who have an anti-choice position so I do not think there is any issue with that.</P>

I do not join in the rants that many others have had against Sinn F&eacute;in, much as I might feel the need to do so but that is going off the point.  When debating issues about the incomes of Senators and Deputies, we must be careful not to descend to a lowest common denominator.  There is a point at which people can no longer afford to go into politics if they cannot obtain a decent salary.  One has to be mindful of that.  There is also the point, as others have said, that Senators do not have geographical constituencies.</P>

He has an extraordinary portfolio given that it includes local government reform, the Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill 2011 and I hope will include vouched expenses for Independent Senators and Deputies before the end of the debate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for reminding me.  The Bill also includes the notion of corporate donations.  I respond to Senators Keane, O&rsquo;Keeffe and Hayden who made very good arguments in respect of corporate donations.  However, they forgot to mention there is a balance in the Bill in terms of regulation, responsibility and disclosure that the Standards in Public Office Commission would enforce.  It is not that we are banning corporate donations and letting everything fly around and hope there might be, as Deputy Keane suggested, a circumvention.  There would not be a circumvention because we would empower <Col N="44"/>the Standards in Public Office Commission to monitor that.  The Minister mentioned a Bill he will introduce on expenditure.  The whole notion is that political expenditure and private donations would all be accounted for publicly.  Later we will propose another amendment on disclosure.  The notion that banning corporate donations will create another problem is to ignore the instruments in the Bill that will allow that balance to occur.  If we take a holistic approach &mdash; this is where the Minister comes in, particularly in local government reform &mdash; our job and that of the Government is to encourage increased political participation and change political culture.  Banning corporate donations is only one small part of that.  To answer Senator Mullen&rsquo;s question, I am not suggesting that private donations should be banned or discouraged.  Citizens&rsquo; donations will encourage activism, increase freedom of speech and participation.  As happened with President Obama&rsquo;s last election, a smaller amount of donations encourages a greater sense of collectivity, activism and a shared voice.  Banning corporate donations levels the playing pitch.  In terms of Senator Hayden&rsquo;s view, we should look to the future.  Local government reform which will allow for increased local participation will politicise men and women and encourage a more transparent level playing pitch.  Banning corporate donations should be a part of that and remind Senators that the <i>quid pro quo</i> is that the Standards in Public Office Commission will require teeth to ensure expenditure is accounted for, including not only our salaries but the leader&rsquo;s allowance.</P>

We can do research in our offices with the library facilities here.  We would do the Seanad a service if we banned them because Senators are different from constituency politicians and we have to recognise that.  We would be doing ourselves a service if we looked at that.</P>
        <P>There should also be some transparency as to who is providing the funding to political associations, whether women&rsquo;s political associations or men&rsquo;s political associations.  If the funding is going to women in politics, then they should fund all women in politics.  When the Council for the Status of Women was established it became the council for the women of status.  We do not want a situation where some women are funded while others are not, be they members of whatever organisation.  We have to be careful.  Transparency at all costs is necessary.</P>

	<P>On the amendment, please, Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;on the question of corporate donations and the nuanced nature of the Bill as reflected in some of these amendments.  It is very important that there be transparency, and the role of the Standards in Public Office Commission is a crucial one.  We have seen in America how the political system can be corrupted by massive corporations.  Just look at the tobacco industry and the criminal activities in which it has been involved such as lobbying directly against the public interest.  This Bill and these sections are welcome and the amendments will help to improve it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the very interesting legal precedent put before the House by Senator Mullen on the question of whether corporations have a personality, which has a direct bearing on these issues, there was a very interesting argument during the Defamation Bill during which the then Minister argued that in fact they do indeed have a personality to the extent that they are allowed to take action for libel.  I thought that was a very dangerous precedent at the time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to EMILY&rsquo;s List, I would agree with him if it were bribery and saying as a corporation that it was giving the person money if he or she changed his view and voted corruptly.  That is not what I understand, however.  I understand it is supporting people who already have that point of view.  Otherwise it would be wrong.  I have no difficulty with it, as I have no difficulty with people supporting the groups calling themselves pro-life.  I think that is all right.</P>
        <P>We are in a curious situation.  Of course the Minister is happy, smiling and indulgent.  Why would he not be?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are quite a few amendments, a total of 19, in case Members had not noticed.  They all deal with amendments to the key provisions in the Bill relating to the restriction of corporate donations and the registration of corporate donors.  Before dealing with the substantive points raised by the amendments, I wish to address briefly the provisions contained in the sections identified for amendment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 7 effects a ban on the acceptance from a corporate donor of a donation in a particular year, the value of which exceeds &euro;200, unless the corporate donor is registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission and the donation is accompanied by a statement confirming that the donation has been properly approved by the donor.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for the registration with the Standards in Public Office Commission of a corporate donor intending to make a donation for political purposes of more than &euro;200 in a given year.  Section 10 extends the scope of the existing offences and penalties provisions in the Act to take account of the additional requirements being introduced by the Bill relating to the acceptance of corporate donations and the registration of corporate donors.  Section 11 provides for a reduction from &euro;5,078.95 or &pound;4,000, as it was when the Act was originally introduced, to <Col N="47"/>&euro;200 in the amount above which donations made by companies, trade unions, societies and building societies must be reported in the respective annual reports or returns.</P>
        <P>Section 19 inserts new definitions into the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999, arising from the new corporate donations provisions.  Section 21 provides for the restriction on the acceptance of corporate donations to apply at local government level, and section 24 extends the scope of the existing offences and penalties provisions under the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 to take account of the additional requirements being introduced by the Bill in relation to the acceptance of corporate donations and the registration of corporate donors.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 from Senator Mac Conghail and the Independent Senators proposes an outright ban on corporate donations, and the purpose of the combined Sinn F&eacute;in amendments is similar and would effectively delete most of the provisions dealing with corporate donations from the Bill.  The approach is not legally sound and I will deal with that aspect in a moment.</P>
        <P>I welcome the acknowledgment implicit in the amendments from Sinn F&eacute;in that an exemption should be made for payments to student societies when restrictions on corporate donations are being introduced by the Bill.  The relevant provisions are not being deleted by the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  In opposing the amendments from the Independent Senators and Sinn F&eacute;in, the objective of the Government is to restrict the influence of corporate donations on politics in Ireland and to enhance the openness and transparency of the whole system of political funding.  Notwithstanding that we are talking about money and contributions,  it is impossible to stop people from being corrupt.  If wealthy individuals want to exercise undue influence, they will continue to be able to do so, but we want to have restrictions on the financial element of it so that money will not buy influence, undue influence or anything like that.  Again, this will not stop people and there will always be occasions when people will try to exercise undue influence by means other than by contributions to the political process.  The Bill will do what it can to ensure openness and transparency in the system of political funding.  The Government will do this to the maximum extent possible and in a way which will not create an undue administrative burden and that is constitutionally permissible.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 5 from Senator Mullen proposes a reduction from &euro;200 to &euro;1 in the amount above which a donation could not be accepted from a corporate donor unless the donor was registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission and that the donation was approved in the prescribed manner by the corporate donor.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 17 contain related provisions.  I have already mentioned this would cause an administrative nightmare.  I know why the Senator has tabled this amendment, having heard his contribution.  I can understand the concept of what he is trying to achieve but I think it would raise a lot of issues regarding the administration of that scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 6 from the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators proposes a reduction from &euro;200 to &euro;100.  The sum of &euro;200 is based on practical considerations about implementation.  Placing the additional disclosure and approval conditions on relatively small donations of under &euro;200 from businesses or organisations would not be fair or practical.  For example, if there was no lower limit, a local business placing a poster in a shop window in support of a candidate could be regarded as having a corporate donation by way of benefit-in-kind.</P>
        <P>A shop owner who buys a raffle ticket or offers a small spot prize for a local function would generally be regarded as giving a corporate donation.  Senator Mullen&rsquo;s proposal would bring these types of activity within the scope of the new provisions.  I believe that is unreasonable and, therefore, I oppose it on that basis.</P>
        <P>I hope the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators in proposing &euro;100 are acknowledging the appropriateness of the principle of the Bill.  I believe Senator Power was quite satisfied with the principle.  While <Col N="48"/>one can pick a figure of &euro;100 or &euro;200 to deal with some of the practical administrative issues I am speaking about, I do not want to be in a position where people as corporate entities, or the local shopkeeper in a small town who wants to donate a sum for political purposes, would in any way have to be registered or tied up in the administration of this legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Mac Conghail was anxious to have the legislation published.  The Attorney General does not publish legislation but, as a Government, we take advice and, obviously, the best possible advice we can get as a Government is from the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>An outright ban on corporate donations raises particular questions with reference to the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution relating to freedom of expression and freedom of association.  Even if it was feasible in the context of the Constitution to ban corporate donations, one would then have to get over the hurdles in regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  We must have regard to the compatibility of an outright ban on corporate donations with those legal and constitutional commitments.  As I said earlier, these are issues that can be rightly addressed by the constitutional convention where, if it is a proposal that ultimately comes through that convention that a constitutional amendment can be proposed and brought forward, it can be considered at that stage.  However, in terms of the practical, legal advice I have received in regard to dealing with matters under the European Convention on Human Rights, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 40 of the Constitution in regard to freedom of expression and freedom of association, I am legally advised it is not appropriate or possible to do it in this legislation.  The measures in the Bill will restrict corporate donations substantially, having regard to compatibility with the Constitution and our commitments to international and European law.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford raised a point on the clarification of salaries.  If he wants to make a submission to the Standards in Public Office Commission to get clarification on that, he is free to do so.  I am not able to say today what the position is.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mullen suggested there was some contamination of students in regard to entering or joining a political party in colleges.  He seemed to have some difficulty about political parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, my point was much more benign than the Minister thinks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;offering money or support to student societies, which would include a political party, and that it would be in some way suspect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I came down in favour of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, on balance.  On the other hand, the Senator had a problem earlier about support from the public purse, so how are we to fund the political system?</P>
        <P>The Bill to come later in the year, relating to the expenditure side, might help us in this regard.  A lot of money is wasted across the board in supporting candidates at election time.  We should have a detailed look at the appropriate level of spending and the arrangements in the litter Acts for postering and other issues in order that there would be a level playing pitch that would allow ordinary people who want to get involved in politics to do so without being involved in the chequebook-style politics for professional people with a lot of money.  They can stand for election because they have independent sources of income, while someone with a low income or no income is not at the races in terms of the support they might receive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Money means a lot at election time.  It has been proved repeatedly that the more money one spends, the better prospects one has in promoting a message, buying necessary advertising space, leafleting and all the associated advertising that goes with it.  This does have an impact <Col N="49"/>in terms of name identification.  Whatever system we come up with in terms of dealing with these matters, we need to ensure everyone is treated the same.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to families being able to continue to donate.  That will be part of the Bill and is acknowledged.  There is a substantial reduction from &euro;44,000 in the case that was mentioned to &euro;17,000.  The thresholds that are now being introduced will have a big impact.  As a Senator said, I do not see a queue in the streets of people looking to fund the political process or politicians.  However, the restrictions and the reduction in the donation limits and declaration thresholds will have a major influence.  There will be a massive reduction in the level of income parties can receive in comparison with the current situation.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the whole objective of the Bill is to provide greater openness and transparency in the manner in which political funding and donations operate.  The Bill is designed to provide a level playing pitch for all bodies that are not individual persons.  It is in that spirt that I am dealing with the amendments before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to ask for clarification from the Minister in regard to the banning of corporate donations, which he said would be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  How, then, can France ban all donations from private and public sector companies, as happened in 1995?  In Portugal, donations by corporations are banned by Article 8 of a 2003 law.  Is there some special exception for Ireland which means we cannot ban corporate donations when Portugal and France can do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a constitutional requirement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to three aspects.  One is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and another is the Constitution.  All of those issues taken together are interrelated in regard to how they affect our Constitution and what we can apply under freedom of expression.  We do not look at just one piece of legislation; we must look at all of them in the round, in particular how they affect the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a reason we cannot see the advice from the Attorney General just on this particular issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ministers do not publish the advice.  I assure the Senator that the Attorney General gets external senior counsel advice and legal opinion on matters that are very important, such as these.  I am assured that will happen in this case and that there is a robust legal requirement for me to deal with the legislation in this fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems Senator van Turnhout has done us a great service in drawing attention to the situation in other EU countries.  While the Minister talks about dealing with these issues in the round, if the law of the European Union and the convention, which does not refer specifically to the Union, cannot place an obstacle to Portugal or France having such bans, it cannot be invoked as an argument in the Irish context.  It is just out of the equation.  It seems the Minister&rsquo;s argument can only rest on the Constitution and the Minister cannot cite EU law or the convention jurisprudence in any way because, were it to impact in any way on our law, by definition it would have to impact on the law of other EU states.  Therefore, the only argument the Minister can possibly make is on a constitutional ground.</P>
        <P>The Minister cited Article 40.  While I do not have the Constitution to hand, I believe Article 40 relates to personal rights, not to the rights of corporates.  I am even more intrigued having heard what Senator van Turnhout had to say and having heard the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I am <Col N="50"/>more sceptical now about the idea that there could be any constitutional obstacle to a ban on corporate donations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot subscribe to the proposition being put forward by Senator Mullen.  I am not going to go through case law in the various countries of the European Union.  What I am saying is that my legal advice is that we have a constitutional prohibition at present on an outright ban on corporate donations.  If it was otherwise, I would bring in different legislation.  I will certainly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  The Minister is entitled to his opinion.  However, he sought to reassure us there was some kind of legal advice to the effect that this would not be possible.  Senator van Turnhout has shown, by illustrating the fact there are other EU states that have laws of a similar kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A ban on corporate donations either is or is not possible under EU or convention law.  The bottom line, as Senator van Turnhout observed, is that there is no obstacle in European law.  The question is whether there is an obstacle under the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I have said, subject to a closer examination of the matter, that Article 40, to which the Minister referred, relates to personal rights.  He has not cited any case law.  Rather, he is asking us to take his word for it that he has been advised legally that this would not fly from the point of view of the Constitution.  I am not asking him to introduce a constitutional amendment, but in the absence of any case law or any indication that the courts have ever suggested this, the appropriate course is for the Minister to indicate his preference in terms of policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If it is his preference that corporate donations be banned then the appropriate route is to legislate for that.  If it is not, I will respect that and we will argue the toss; I am not seeking to undercut his opinion or claim I am automatically right.  If he secures the support of the Houses in legislating for a ban, it will be a matter then for Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann to take counsel from the Council of State and to decide whether to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution.  The alternative, where the Minister&rsquo;s legal advice is unseen by us and he is telling us there is some type of legal or constitutional argument, is entirely unsatis<Col N="51"/>factory.  We have just shown that there cannot be any European law-based argument against the provision, although the Minister suggested there was.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I do not want to prolong the discussion unnecessarily.  It is a debate that has already taken place.  With respect to Senator Mullen, it is my understanding &mdash; obviously, I am not privy to the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice &mdash; that we have not been able to enact an outright ban on corporate donations because of certain provisions of the Constitution.  This was explored by parties in opposition before ever there was a change of Government last February.  I recall extensive debate on this issue in the course of which we were all told, in different parties and by many different legal advisers, that an outright ban was not possible because freedom of expression was not confined to individual human persons.  I do not have the case law in front of me but my recollection is that cases like that involving Quinn&rsquo;s Supermarket have established that freedom of expression, association rights and so on can be enforced before the courts by entities which are corporate personalities.  That is my recollection of it.  As such, I do not accept, with respect, that the Senator is correct in his point about Article 40.  The reason we cannot introduce an outright ban is rooted in our constitutional jurisprudence.  That was always my understanding &mdash; not that it was rooted in other treaties.  There may be other issues arising from the European Convention on Human Rights and so on, but I have not looked into those.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik seems to be contending that I may be right on one point and wrong on the other.  I recall the Quinn&rsquo;s Supermarket case and she may well be correct on that point.  However, I must ask her whether a different principle applies here.  If it is possible to curtail the amounts that may be donated, it seems that the principle that one may restrict donations has already been conceded.  It would be very difficult to argue, in light of this, that an absolute ban would be repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>Come on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, we are all in favour of restricting corporate donations as far as possible and practicable.  There has been no dissent from any side of the House on that principle.  However, there is clearly a substantive difference between an outright ban and a restriction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are being asked to accept that it would not be repugnant to the Constitution to restrict corporate donations to, say, 1 cent, &euro;1 or &euro;10 but that a complete ban, on the other hand, would somehow be constitutionally repugnant.  No case law has been cited.  We all know that Governments are very good at claiming to have legal advice to back up their position.  Notwithstanding Senator Bacik&rsquo;s very valid point regarding the Quinn&rsquo;s Supermarket case &mdash; it may well be true that corporate entities have rights under those Articles of the Constitution &mdash; my point is that it is stretching credibility to say that one may restrict corporate donations to an unlimited degree and not fall foul of the Constitution but it is not possible to go the whole hog and restrict them completely.</P><Col N="52"/>
        <P>My amendments sought not to restrict such donations completely but effectively to legislate them out of existence.  However, my fundamental point remains, that in the absence of any jurisprudence being cited or any legal advice being shown to us, the appropriate course is for the Minister to indicate his policy preference.  If it is his preference to ban such donations, we should legislate for that and see what the President and the Supreme Court do should a reference be made under Article 26.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I asked the Minister to provide some clarification on a matter and he advised me to seek that clarification from the SIPO.  However, there needs to be some political direction in relation to the ability or otherwise of politicians to make significant donations to their parties or general political work.  Many politicians have claimed that they live on the minimum wage, with the remainder of their salaries being spent on political purposes.  We all do that.  What is the legal position in this regard?  Are politicians entitled to donate these large sums to their political parties?  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take the Minister&rsquo;s point in relation to the SIPO but I wonder if there is also political information available on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If a Member of the Oireachtas is paying money for his or her own purposes, such as in respect of a constituency office, he or she is paying for services that apply to himself or herself.  Therefore, there is no requirement to disclose that.  It is not a donation.  I will have to seek legal clarification on the Senator&rsquo;s question in regard to donations being paid to third parties for other purposes.  The Standards in Public Office Commission ultimately adjudicates on these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would appreciate the Minister obtaining that clarification for me.  Every politician in the Oireachtas uses virtually all of his or her income from politics for political purposes.  We need to ensure the public is not misled into believing that a particular category of politicians is working on a reduced salary.  As far as I am aware, every one of us is taking the entire salary and spending it on political purposes.  There have been many declarations by people that they are working on the minimum wage.  However, they are not returning the balance to the taxpayer, they are spending it on political purposes, including offices, telephones and secretaries.  From 1987 until 2002 I paid my secretary every week, including her tax and PRSI payments.  I saw that as part of my political duty.  The public needs to be advised that there are not two classes of politicians and that people are using their salaries for political purposes, which I am sure is fine.  Some people have said they hand the money over to their parties.  I presume that is not legal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

	<P>They do not have to draw down the full amount of their entitlement by way of party leader allowance, in terms of disbursements which they get from the public purse.  If they choose to do so, that is fine.  It would result in a saving for the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be helpful if the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, were to write to each Member of the Oireachtas to inquire of them whether they want to draw down their full salary.  It would be helpful to the public to know what would be the response if all Members were asked whether they wanted to draw down a full or reduced salary.</P>

	<P>Senator Bradford&rsquo;s interest in this issue is interesting.  If he showed as much interest in the issue of bonuses paid to special advisers to the Government and so on his time would be better spent.  It sounds as though he does not give much credence to the work of SIPO in terms of auditing our accounts and how we spend our money.  It is obviously a moot point with other parties that Sinn F&eacute;in have a policy of taking the average industrial wage.

	<P>Senator Bradford is correct in respect of the point raised by him this afternoon.  I am aware of a former Minister who did not take his severance allowance but wished to donate it to his political party.  However, when he inquired of the Department of Finance as to whether he could do so, he was told he could not do it, that it was illegal.  This is the position in this regard.

	<P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, before section 9, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;9.&mdash;Full disclosure on all donations must be declared to the Standards in Public Office Commission.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="55"/>
        <P FLI="0">This is the nub of an important section of the Bill that relates to full disclosure.  The amendment seeks to provide that full disclosure of all donations be made to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The Minister should indicate the reason the key recommendation made in the Moriarty report concerning maximum disclosure was not taken on board.  The Bill fails to take on board the detailed recommendation made in the final report of the tribunal of inquiry known as the Moriarty tribunal which focused on maximum disclosure of all income of political parties, including commercial earnings, gifted income and all donations, including, where necessary, loans.  This is an effort to address one of the fundamental areas in which the current legislation falls down.  Strict and comprehensive disclosure requirements are necessary to make the origins of political finance more transparent.  Disclosure helps to prevent inappropriate influence and favouritism which can be linked with political donations and dilutes the perception of corruption linked with political finance.  Full disclosure by political parties of their funding sources is a widely recognised precaution against improper patronage or influence exerted by wealthy donors.  Disclosure allows citizens to be aware of the origins of donations in order that they have the opportunity to analyse the motivations for the donations.  Comprehensive and reliable disclosure of income by political parties and individual candidates is a fundamental element of a regulatory framework aimed at increasing the transparency and openness of political financing.</P>
        <P>The Moriarty tribunal report contains many other recommendations and the concern of the Independent Senators which we also mention in respect of elections is to ensure there would be a mechanism by which immediate disclosure could occur in a way that informed citizens.  We are not against private donations and at this stage must accept there will be some limited corporate donations and that will be encouraged.  However, as the Moriarty tribunal report provides the backbone for some of the Bill, one should encourage such donations to be disclosed immediately to allow for a greater sense of transparency, after which there would be no ambiguity in this regard.</P>
        <P>A further recommendation made in the Moriarty tribunal report was that the Standards in Public Office Commission should have greater support.  Certainly, on Second Stage the Minister mentioned that the report by the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption, GRECO, had made recommendations that we consider providing the Standards in Public Office Commission with greater investigative and sanctioning powers, as well as for increased sanctions for breaches of the rule.  Certainly, the Minister should indicate the reason the Bill does not opt for full and immediate disclosure of donations.  In addition, he should consider how, particularly during general elections, donations might be disclosed immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak to amendment No. 15.  While I welcome the reduction in the threshold to &euro;1,500, I ask the Minister to consider reducing it further to &euro;1,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments address the provisions in the Bill dealing with the disclosure of political donations and political funding and relate to sections 9, 18 and 26 of the Bill.  Section 9 provides for a significant lowering of the thresholds at which donations must be declared and the threshold for disclosure by a political party to the Standards in Public Office Commission is being reduced from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500.  The declaration threshold for a Member of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament or a candidate at a D&aacute;il, Seanad or European Parliament election has been reduced from &euro;634.87 to &euro;600.  There has also been a reduction in the threshold for donors other than companies, trade unions, societies or building societies in reporting donations to the Standards in Public Office Commission from &euro;5078.95 to &euro;1,500.</P><Col N="56"/>
        <P>Section 10 deals with the donations declaration thresholds at a local election, while section 26 contains the provisions that will require the preparation and publication of political party accounts.  Amendment No. 14 in the name of the Independent Senators proposes the insertion of a new section before section 9, stating all donations would have to be declared to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  There is an equivalent amendment, namely, amendment No. 20, to section 18 in respect of political donations at local government level.  Amendment No. 28, also in the name of the Independent Senators, proposes that there be immediate disclosure of all corporate and personal donations during an election campaign.</P>
        <P>While I agree political donations must be declared to the Standards in Public Office Commission, in the interests of fairness and to ensure the effectiveness of such provisions, a threshold should continue to apply.  I do not believe the approach proposed in the amendments is feasible.  First, the proposals might be somewhat administratively impractical.  For example, I cannot imagine what public good would be served by reporting the name of each person who donates &euro;1 or &euro;2 to an annual political party church gate collection.  Similarly, the amendments as framed could be taken to include low level activities such as the selling of raffle tickets.  It would not be reasonable to require that all transactions be reported to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The proposal would have serious negative consequences for the operation of politics and the smooth operation of a robust regulatory regime.  The Bill provides for the publication of party accounts and in this way donations received by political parties will be open to scrutiny, as will their expenditure.  I am going further than the Moriarty tribunal recommendations in this regard and consider this approach to be more effective.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 15, tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il, proposes that the declaration threshold be reduced to &euro;1,000 from &euro;1,500.  While one can pick any figure one wishes, reducing the amount by 70% constitutes a good start.  The Government is doing what it stated it would do in respect of commitments it gave.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>A reduction in the declaration thresholds is a highly significant measure.  It can be seen as part of a range of measures included in the Bill that will have the cumulative effect of providing for a more open and transparent system of political funding in Ireland and a severe limitation on the scope for corporate influence on politics arising from funding and contributions made from that sector to political parties or candidates.  The problems in the system have been evident for years and are now being addressed.</P><Col N="57"/>
        <P>On the Moriarty tribunal report, in developing the Bill the Government has had particular regard to the recommendations made in the report which was published in March 2011.  The provisions in the Bill for the publication of political party accounts will address the recommendation that all income of political parties be disclosed.  As I noted previously, the Government is going further than this by providing that expenditure of parties also be reported and opened to political scrutiny.  The tribunal recommended that all political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be disclosed.  It did not recommend that corporate donations be banned outright because I am sure Mr. Justice Moriarty would have been aware of the legal limitations in so doing.  The reductions we are introducing in respect of the donation thresholds are substantial and significant and they address the recommendations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that clarification.  In my confusion, I neglected to focus on amendment No. 29 to any great extent.  One of the recommendations in the Moriarty tribunal&rsquo;s report is that appropriate measures should be adopted to ensure the equivalent obligations will be applied to Independent or non-party candidates.  To facilitate this, we have tabled amendment No. 29.  The question that arises is how I, an Independent Senator nominated by the Taoiseach who is being paid a salary and receiving State funding in the form of the party leaders&rsquo; allowance, can be accountable to and make my affairs transparent to both the House and the taxpayer.  I wanted to make provision in this regard under section 2 but I was prevented from doing so.  If amendment No. 29 is accepted, we should reconsider the position with regard to section 2 in the context of the amendment tabled by Senators van Turnhout, Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, O&rsquo;Donnell, McAleese, Zappone and me.</P>
        <P>I am not questioning whether we should receive the party leaders&rsquo; allowance.  I will not be giving my allowance to charity or using it in respect of political favours.  Rather, it will be used for the purposes for which it is intended under the principal Act.  The latter is quite clear with regard to the uses to which the allowance can be put.  In that context, I would like the allowance to be subject to scrutiny by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  That would be both fair and reasonable.  Independent Members of the Oireachtas are treated separately and have, in effect, been cut loose.  Since February, &euro;486,472 has been paid to Independent Deputies.  Up to the end of last year, Independent Senators such as myself were paid &euro;169,176.  In total, therefore, Independent Members of the Oireachtas have been paid in excess of &euro;656,000.  That is an extraordinary amount of money and there is no transparency or accountability in respect of it.  I and the other members of the group which tabled amendment No. 29 will obviously make voluntary disclosures in respect of the leaders&rsquo; allowances we receive.  However, there is no legislation under which we are held accountable for what we do with that money.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that the party leaders&rsquo; allowance facilitates us in the context of funding our research and other work.  That will continue to be the case.  It is in the context of this aspect that we have tabled amendment No. 29.  We are not considered to be qualified parties under the existing legislation and it is on that basis that we have tabled the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing a group of amendments, of which amendments No. 29 is one.  I am of the view that all allowances should be fully vouched.  This is the first occasion on which I have been obliged to deal with different people in the context of different aspects of my income.  In a normal job, one is given a contract of employment and <Col N="58"/>one deals with a single entity such as a salaries section or whatever.  As a Senator, however, I am obliged to deal with the one-stop-shop here in the Oireachtas and also with the Department of Finance, which is unusual.  We tabled amendment No. 29 because we are of the view that all the allowances we receive should be vouched.  We should be obliged to be accountable in respect of these allowances.  When I sought guidance on the allowance, I discovered that the only form available relates to political parties.  I decided to follow that guidance and, for the record, I have returned to the Minister for Finance, in the form of a cheque I wrote at the end of January, the unspent portion of the party leaders&rsquo; allowance I received in 2011.  I am transparent when it comes to my work and the amendment does not suggest doing anything which I would not be prepared to do myself.  The amendment provides the opportunity to address the anomaly that exists and I am of the view we should receive the support of all Senators in respect of it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There should be transparency in respect of all funding.  As stated previously, such transparency should apply to Independent Senators.  The Minister provided the answer in respect of this matter in his earlier contribution when he stated that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility in this area.  He indicated that he will discuss the matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and communicate further with Senators on it.  I am of the view that we are engaging in a degree of duplication in respect of these amendments.</P>

	<P>I agree with the principle but we are discussing the matter at the wrong time, particularly as a different Minister has responsibility in this area.  In the interests of efficiency, we should accept what the Minister, Deputy Hogan, stated in this regard and should not ask him to repeat himself.</P>
        <P>I had hoped to comment on amendment No. 28 but given that we are only discussing amendment No. 14, I will not do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can refer to amendment No. 28 now because it is one of a group of amendments under discussion.  However, the amendment cannot be moved at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 28 states: &ldquo;There shall be immediate disclosure of all corporate and personal donations during an election campaign.&rdquo;  That cannot be legal because the term &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; has not been defined.  Does it refer to now, within the next hour or during the next week or the coming month?  There would be a need to define the term &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; before the amendment could be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinMcAleese"><NameTxt>Senator Martin McAleese</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 29 essentially relates to the application of Part IX to Independent and non-party Members of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There should be no such thing as unvouched expenses or allowances.  All such expenses and allowances should be fully vouched and justified.  Allowances should only be expended for the purposes for which they are intended or in the course of the work of those who receive them.  This is a fundamental principle and it should apply to all parliamentary allowances, without exception.  Some categor<Col N="59"/>ies of allowances and expenses are already administered on a vouched or verified basis.  Any category which is unvouched should be subject to the same requirements, that is, all receipts and supporting documentation should be retained for five years and should be subject to audit.  I can think of no other sector in which unvouched expenses are allowed.  The sooner both Houses of the Oireachtas move towards a system of fully vouched expenses with absolutely no exceptions, the sooner they will enjoy greater credibility in the eyes of both taxpayers and members of the public at large.</P>

	<P>During the debate on section 2, I dealt with many of the points that have been raised by Senators Mac Conghail, McAleese and others.  I have taken on board the matters to which they refer.  I indicated on Second Stage and reiterated the point earlier that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will be addressing these matters and that he has them under active consideration.  I do not know what the term &ldquo;active consideration&rdquo; means but I believe it indicates a degree of urgency.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> the average person throws out almost 300 kg of &lsquo;black bin rubbish&rsquo; every year, and about one third of this waste is food waste.  This is the equivalent of 3,750 apples;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> immediately ensure &lsquo;&lsquo;verifiable country of origin&rsquo;&rsquo; labelling on all farm produce sold by retailers to ensure that consumers are not confused and undermine local producers by passing off imports as Irish as is the case currently (e.g. through the use of tricolours, shamrocks, green labels and so on) &mdash; especially as the EU debate about country of origin labelling has effectively been postponed;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> ensure that terms like &lsquo;&lsquo;Irish food&rsquo;&rsquo; can only be used after specific criteria are satisfied &mdash; by doing so, it will help to stimulate growth in the economy by allowing consumers to buy produce verifiably produced in Ireland;</P>

        <P FLI="0">to consider additional measures to reduce waste, including, but not limited to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> introducing a proper system for distributing leftover food to those most in need and to the appropriate charities; including ensuring that any catering procured by the State will be required to redistribute that food to vulnerable groups;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> encouraging producers and retailers to reduce packaging including the introduction of biodegradable packaging and packaging that keeps fresh produce edible for longer in addition to making packaging easier to open for the elderly or disabled.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney and am delighted he has come to the House.  I have been in the food business all my life and have been interested in making sure that those who have a responsibility in the food business are able to do something useful.  One of my heroes was Mr. Norman Borlaug, the 1970 Nobel Prize winner, who died two years ago.  He was the man who fed the world, or that is how he was known.  He recognised that there was a problem of people dying of starvation and he perfected a form of wheat that was able to save a million lives.  It is said that over his lifetime he saved 1 billion lives, which gives some idea of what a person can do if that person is determined and says &ldquo;I can achieve a lot&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>When I look at the problems in the world and wonder to what extent we can do something about them, I realise is there is huge waste in Ireland, in particular waste of food, and that there are things we can do about it.  I would love to see us do something about those things because the number of people dying in the world because they do not get enough to eat is a scandal.</P>
        <P>An article in <i>The Guardian</i> today is headlined &ldquo;Hunger crisis kills 2.6m children a year&rdquo;.  That figure is far higher than I had thought.  The article states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Malnutrition is the root cause of the deaths of 2.6 million children each year, and the bodies and brains of 450 million more will fail to develop properly due to inadequate diet over the next 15 years unless immediate action is taken, according to a survey published on Wednesday by a leading international charity.  The survey of developing countries ... produced by Save the Children, estimates one in four children are already stunted because of malnutrition.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The chief executive of Save the Children said:</P>
        <P LI="1">This is a hidden hunger crisis that could destroy the lives of nearly half a billion children unless world leaders act to stop it.  Every hour of every day 300 children die from malnutrition-related causes simply because they don&rsquo;t get to eat the basic, nutritious foods that we take for granted in the [West].  Yet solutions are clear, cheap and necessary.  Not only will tackling hunger save children&rsquo;s lives but, at a time of economic meltdown, it will help reboot the global economy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Ireland has set the standard in taking action on other issues.  We were the first to ban smoking in public places and the first to take steps to discourage the use of plastic bags.  Others have followed where we led.  Likewise, there are actions we can take to reduce food wastage, but <Col N="64"/>success in this regard will require commitment, encouragement and support from the Minister.  In tabling this motion my objective is to draw attention to what we in Ireland can do.  When I saw that the Government had proposed an amendment, I expected the gist of it to be that I had not gone far enough in my proposals and that there was much more that could be done.  I am extremely disappointed that this is not the case.  I hope the Minister will not press the amendment because it does not add to the proposal.  Rather, it seems to suggest we are already doing enough.  I hope, therefore, the Minister will reconsider it.</P>
        <P>A massive amount of food is wasted in the State every year while people are dying of starvation elsewhere in the world.  Almost 1 billion people in developing countries go hungry every day owing to food shortages.  World food prices, as tracked by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, reached their highest ever level in February 2011, while food riots erupted in Haiti to Egypt.  Here in the West, on the other hand, obesity is a major disease.  How can we go on throwing out one third of the food we buy, while people in other countries starve?  In addition, this level of waste imposes a huge cost on the State through waste disposal and is a massive contributor to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  Changes in behaviour will require a combination of legislation, information and encouragement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While an EU regulation on food information and nutrition labelling will come into force in the coming years, there are several vital issues that must be addressed immediately.  Part of the reason food is thrown out is that  labelling is unclear and there is a lack of information for the consumer.  There is real confusion about what the various dates on products actually mean and this is not helped by instructions such as &ldquo;display until&rdquo;, &ldquo;sell by&rdquo;, &ldquo;use by&rdquo;, &ldquo;consume by&rdquo; and &ldquo;best before&rdquo;.  As somebody who was involved in the business for many years, I am well aware that these labels are for the benefit of the retailer, not the customer.  People see these labels and assume it is unsafe to consume a product after the specified date, even though this is often not the case.  I recall a customer complaining that the potatoes for sale in our supermarket were out of date.  I was incredulous that potatoes could be out of date.  They had come into the store on a Monday and the best before date was the following Friday.  Our potato supplier had labelled them thus because, being new potatoes, they would be at their most delicious if eaten within three or four days.  In other words, there was nothing wrong with them two weeks later, but they were more delicious if eaten immediately.  However, customers made the mistake of assuming they were unsafe to eat after the specified date.</P>
        <P>It is clear that most products featuring the &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; and &ldquo;best before&rdquo; labels are capable of being eaten after the date printed on the label, although they may no longer have the flavour the producer would like.  Should we simply throw out fruit and vegetables that have lost some colour or gone a little soft?  I read an article in recent days about a German pensioner who had discovered in his home a tin of American lard which he had received in an aid package after the war.  Upon tasting it, he discovered that, 64 years later, it was still edible.  I am not advising Members to follow his example, but it is remarkable to consider.  A German food expert observed that the test results on the lard might make consumers think twice before discarding food immediately after the expiry date.</P>
        <P>It may be time to move towards a simplification of food labelling.  In the United Kingdom, instead of marking foods as best before a certain date, it is proposed that in future producers use labels giving details of the health risks associated with individual foods that remain on the shelves or in the fridge for a lengthy period.  This type of change does not require legislation.  All that is needed is to encourage companies to participate.  Natural competitiveness will work to our benefit and probably provide a better solution than if we, as legislators or civil servants, were to impose specific requirements on producers.  We can achieve a great deal on that basis.</P><Col N="65"/>
        <P>Research shows that Irish consumers throw out 1 million tonnes of food every year, which is approximately 30% of all food purchased.  The average person disposes of 300 kg of black bin rubbish every year, some one third of which is food waste.  The average cost per household of disposing of this waste is &euro;1,000 per annum.  We can do a great deal to reduce that level of wastage.  In the retail trade we often offer incentives to customers in the form of two for the price of one or buy two and get one free offers.  In order to discourage waste, retailers might instead offer a buy two and get a voucher for a third incentive.  If it is a fresh food product, most people do not need a third.  I am not proposing that this type of system be imposed on retailers, but it is the type of suggestion we should encourage.</P>
        <P>I hope the Government amendment which adds nothing to my proposals will be withdrawn.  I have no problem in accepting the Sinn F&eacute;in Party amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion which includes a suggestion that the label &ldquo;Irish food&rdquo; be permitted only where specific criteria are satisfied.  We are all aware that buying Irish benefits the economy and safeguards Irish jobs.  If Irish consumers choose Irish-made products over foreign imports, it gives indigenous companies a significant and welcome boost.  Our superb and ongoing record in export growth has proved that we are extremely competitive in the agrifood sector.  If we can find a way to label our food products as made and packed in this country in order that consumers can identify them as such in a split second, we will be taking a huge step in assisting the local economy towards recovery.</P>
        <P>Among the 1.5 million Irish households, the average spend on Guaranteed Irish products is &euro;16 a week.  Increasing this to &euro;20 a week would create 6,000 new jobs based on the turnover per employee of existing Guaranteed Irish members.  In this respect, current practices by certain producers and retailers are harming local produce, in particular, the mislabelling of products as Irish.  According to Am&aacute;rach Research, 83% of consumers believe it is more important to buy locally produced goods and services now than it was five years ago, while almost two thirds say buying Guaranteed Irish products helps them to feel they are supporting Ireland.  However, the problem for consumers is that we have only one second to make up our mind in the supermarket.  We are all busy these days and it is difficult enough to navigate the aisles of large supermarkets without having to work out whether the products one is purchasing are Irish.  A good example is the difference between smoked Irish salmon and Irish smoked salmon.  It is difficult to tell which is Irish salmon and which was farmed in Norway and merely smoked in Ireland.  It comes down to a problem with food labelling.  Another example is chicken produced in Thailand but coated in Ireland.  In some cases, the smoked salmon has only been processed here.  For years I believed fish sold under the Donegal Catch label was produced in and around County Donegal, but that is not the case.  It is possible it is farmed in Norway or Greece and sold under the Donegal Catch label.</P>
        <P>At the Irish Ploughing Championships last year I came across a superb new company, Truly Irish, which produces pork and bacon from the farm to the table.  It is receiving huge support from Irish consumers.  I wish I had thought of calling Lily O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Truly Irish Lily O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s in order that everyone would know it was made in Newbridge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a related note, it was stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> last September that people associated Jacob&rsquo;s Fig Rolls with Ireland.  It has been said they have been Ireland&rsquo;s favourite for over 100 years.  Sadly, they are now made in Malta.  Si&uacute;cra which many regard as a purely Irish product imports sugar from elsewhere in Europe, frequently Germany, to be repacked here.</P>
        <P>The economist I listen to most is Mr. Jim Power who fronts the Love Irish Food campaign.  We need to sort out the labelling issue.  As I stated, I do not want people to stop buying Jacob&rsquo;s Fig Rolls or Mikado, but I do want consumers to know for certain that what they are buying in supermarkets are Irish products, allowing them to truly support Irish food products.  My <Col N="66"/>business recently lost two fairly large contracts, one in the USA and the other in England.  The American company, a rather large blue chip company, stated that while it loved the company and that we had done a great job for six years, President Obama wanted it to support the domestic economy and American companies.  It was for that reason that it had decided to switch from an Irish supplier, with which it was delighted, to an American one.  I know there is EU legislation in this regard.  However, we need to move towards what is being done by the Americans and the English.</P>
        <P>The final part of the motion states the European Union believes that by 2020 there will be a 40% increase in the food waste generated.  We must address this issue through involving producers, retailers and consumers.  Proper labelling and education will also help us to address it.  Young people have helped to educate us on issues such as recycling and waste, so much so that we are all recycling properly.  Imagine what could be achieved if they were to explain to us what &ldquo;best before&rdquo; or &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; meant.  Last week Sainsbury&rsquo;s informed its consumers by way of an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> that it was to change its label &ldquo;freeze on day of purchase&rdquo; to &ldquo;freeze up to two days after sell-by date&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This is a wide-ranging and interesting debate.  If the Minister is serious about dealing with the issues of Irish agricultural food waste, obesity and Irish jobs, he should move to make real changes as regards how we look at Irish food and food labelling.</P>

        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009, on commercial food waste, introduced by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, include a requirement that from 1 July 2010 the commercial sector has the food waste it generates segregated and collected separately and also imposes obligations on the major sources of food waste such as hot food outlets and institutions;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> the Waste Management (Landfill Levy) Regulations 2011 provide for an increase in the landfill levy to &euro;50 per tonne from 1 September 2011 and that there is a commitment to further increases;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> the general food labelling Directive 200/13/EC (S.I. 483/2002) requires indication of the place of origin where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree and EU food information regulations will provide additional information for the consumer;</P>

        <P FLI="0">considers that these measures will improve Ireland&rsquo;s performance in relation to food waste, and in particular;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes the launch by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government of the green public procurement action plan in January 2012, which <Col N="67"/>aims to implement green public procurement in favour of more resource efficient, less polluting goods services and works;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> highlights that food and catering services are a priority area for green procurement and that contracting parties will be required to deal with food waste in compliance with the national composting standard;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> emphasises that the sustainability of the agrifood sector in Ireland provides consumers in Ireland and further afield with environmental assurance, and welcomes in this regard schemes such as the Bord Bia beef and lamb quality assurance scheme, developed in partnership with Teagasc and the Carbon Trust, which includes traceability back to the farm and carbon measurement on the farm, as well as an indication of origin;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> remarks that country of origin labelling is currently mandatory for beef, fish, honey, olive oil and fresh fruit and vegetables and for other products when its absence might mislead the consumer; that this is being extended to other meats and that the European Commission will carry out a feasibility study of the possibility of extending country of origin labelling requirements to other foods, including ingredients that represent more than 50% of a food;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is supporting research into anaerobic digestion, utilisation of by-products of processing and fruit and vegetable waste in particular and considers that it is important that the findings of such research are commercialised and used on a wide scale;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> encourages more schools to take up the EU school milk scheme;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that the Food Dude-EU school fruit scheme, managed by Bord Bia and funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has now been rolled out to over half of primary school children and that evaluations of the scheme have consistently shown increased consumption of fruit and vegetables;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recommends wider publicity of the stop food waste programme (<i>StopFoodWaste.ie</i>), <i>foodwaste.ie</i> and the EPA publication Less Food Waste &mdash; More Profit which provides advice for consumers and operators on buying, storage and low waste cookery tips such as buying what is required, taking note of existing stock, checking &ldquo;use by&rdquo; dates and understanding the differences between &ldquo;use by&rdquo;, &ldquo;best before&rdquo; and &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; dates, and how to compost any residual food waste, as easy access to information and advice could have a substantial impact on individual consumer decisions and national patterns of consumer and operator behaviour&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I am delighted he is with us for this debate.  I also welcome the content of the Private Members&rsquo; motion and acknowledge the work done in its drafting.</P>
        <P>The minimisation and management of food waste are being adequately dealt with in accordance with the national waste prevention programme which covers 2012.  The Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009 on commercial food waste introduced in July 2010 impose strict requirements and conditions on the commercial food sector.  The labelling of food products sold in Ireland is regulated by the general food labelling directive which requires indication of the place of origin where a failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree.</P><Col N="68"/>
        <P>I welcome implementation by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, of the green public procurement action plan launched last month.  This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring greener public procurement in favour of more resource efficient and less pollutant goods and services and works.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood sector is second to none.  The Irish meat and livestock sector expanded by 9% in 2010, with the value of exports increasing to &euro;2.44 billion.  An increase in the value of beef, pigmeat, poultry, sheep meat and live exports was evident.</P>
        <P Just="Left">S.I. No. 435 of 2000, as amended by S.I. No.  485 of 2002, requires mandatory traceability and origin labelling for beef from the slaughterhouse to the point of sale to consumers.  Bord Bia has an excellent beef and lamb quality assurance scheme in place, developed in conjunction with Teagasc and the Carbon Trust.  The scheme demands traceability back to the farm and carbon measurement on all farms, including indications of origin.  Being a farmer, I have first-hand knowledge of this, like every other farmer.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment emphasises that country of origin labelling is mandatory for beef, fish, honey, olive oil, fresh fruit, fresh vegetables and other produce, where its absence might mislead the consumer.  This is reassuring for all Irish consumers.  We can rest assured that our food products are adequately labelled.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe increased publicity of the stop food waste programme would be useful in increasing public awareness of the level of food waste in the home and society.  The EPA report, Less Food Waste &mdash; More Profit, provides excellent advice for consumers and operators and tips such as buying only what one requires.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In response to some of the points raised in the motion in regard to nutritional labelling on food products, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has recently written to all food chain outlets in Ireland asking them to introduce calorie indicators on their menus.  He has given a commitment that if this is not done, he will introduce legislation to ensure food chain outlets are mandatorily obliged to print and display calorie indicators on all food produce sold to consumers.  A consultation process was recently launched by the Minister which presents an opportunity for consumers and the food industry to give their views on how a policy of having calorie indicators on menus can be implemented in Ireland.  All interested parties are invited to comment and to facilitate maximum participation in the consultation process which involves the completion of a short on-line questionnaire.  The consultation process will close at the end of February.  This is the first step in altering lifestyles in Ireland, for young and older people.  By the same token, parents will be able to make more informed choices  and purchase healthier food for their children when they go shopping for groceries.</P>
        <P>On education for schoolchildren on food labelling, <i>safe</i>food has previously stated choosing the right foods to suit one&rsquo;s diet is an important skill for all ages.  Healthy eating is not just about knowing about nutrients, it is also about choosing good quality food which one can afford, ensuring it is rich in nutrients and safe to eat.  <i>safe</i>food has designed educational lessons on food labelling for primary school students in second and third class.  It has designed, in consultation with teachers, three lessons that have a variety of suggested activities and that teachers can extend to a fourth session should they wish to spend longer looking at labels and studying them.  Issues such as whether all fats are bad and food intolerance are some of the relevant topics.  These lessons are a resource for the curricular modules on physical health, communication skills and influences and decisions.  As part of the curriculum, these lessons are designed to enable students to put labels in the context of a typical diet, thereby promoting the concept of self-management.  This resource will provide students with the skills necessary to make healthy and safe food choices in addition to making them sensible food shoppers and <Col N="69"/>handlers.  I agree that one always was taught about the importance of not wasting food.  I thank the Minister for his attendance and for his contribution to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend Senator Quinn for tabling this Private Members&rsquo; motion on a topic that has been discussed in this Chamber in recent months, not least regarding the subject of obesity and childhood obesity at the instigation of Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  In addition, Members had a debate recently on the issue of food safety standards.  This issue deserves some time and attention and Senator Quinn, who comes from a background of food service provision in the retail sector, certainly can speak with some authority on the subject.  Fianna F&aacute;il is delighted to be able to support his motion, which is very sensible, particularly when one considers how it has been laid out.  The Senator touches on the obesity issue and the food waste issue.  As Senator Quinn outlined, given that 1 billion people go hungry each night in the Third World despite so much food being wasted in our world and country, governments must take control and take stock of the issue of food waste.  While regulation or legislation may be a step too far, codes of practice can be brought into the industry that could ameliorate the issue of food waste and the manner in which it takes place in Ireland.  In addition, the introduction of education programmes in primary schools to educate pupils certainly would be an important step in that process.</P>
        <P>Approximately 90 million tonnes of food go to waste each year within the European Union alone, of which approximately 1 million tonnes of food go to waste in Ireland.  That is a great deal of food and if one stacked up 1 million tonnes of food on O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin, one can imagine the amount of food one physically could see.  When one takes buildings into consideration, O&rsquo;Connell Street probably could not contain such a quantity of food, which represents the wastage that occurs within the food industry each year in Ireland.  The food industry comprises a number of sectors, including the manufacturing sector, within which much of the food wastage probably is unavoidable.  I refer to materials such as bones and carcases in the context of meat products, as well as technical malfunctions in which there may be overproduction or misshapen products.  For example, Senator O&rsquo;Brien has a background in chocolate manufacturing and some chocolate companies sell on misshapen chocolates, which is the correct thing to do, and one sees them in supermarkets.</P>
        <P>As for householders, this is where education from a young age comes in because at present, there is a lack of awareness regarding the quantity of food waste being generated individually, the environmental problems food waste causes and the environmental costs to the Exchequer in dealing with that waste, as well as the manner in which householders purchase food in general and the lack of knowledge on how to be efficient in respect of food consumption.  This latter point also pertains to the retail sector because when supermarkets make special offers, people probably will purchase additional food they may not necessarily require at that point.  Such food then goes off or the &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date thereon expires and suddenly one&rsquo;s fridge contains food that is out of date, inedible or potentially unsafe to eat.  This generates part of the problem.  I refer to attitudes, preferences and planning issues in respect of the home.  In addition, Senator Quinn referred to labelling issues and there is misinterpretation of and confusion over date labels.  In particular, there is confusion regarding recognition of the meaning of the &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date in terms of food being safe to use.  One often sees this in one&rsquo;s own home, where the &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date of food that is stored in the fridge at a correct temperature can be surpassed and the food is safe to use.  However, people are not generally aware of this.  Perhaps there should be &ldquo;best before&rdquo; and &ldquo;use before&rdquo; dates but this also comes down to education.</P>
        <P>The wholesale and retail sectors also must play a part, as must the food service sector and in particular the large restaurant chains people use.  In such restaurants, Fianna F&aacute;il believes <Col N="70"/>there should be a calorie count on the menus so that people would know the calorie count, the quantity of protein and carbohydrates and the make-up of the food on their plates.  This is something with which Members should concern themselves, particularly when one notes the incidence of obesity, which is growing in Ireland and globally.  At present, 22 million children under the age of five are classified as being obese and 327,000 Irish children are classified as being either obese or overweight.  This is a major issue and while I do not make a political point in this regard, it goes back to a fundamental lack of education and a lacuna in the primary school curriculum in respect of healthy eating, sports and fitness, recreation and calorie consumption.  As someone who has studied food science, I am aware that children can pick this up very quickly.  While it would take a cross-departmental approach to review the educational curriculum, unless one starts at that level, it will be extremely difficult to tackle.  Although one can continue to pump money into the health system to deal with obesity, the fundamental problem lies with the consumption of those foods people choose to consume.  Marketing also is a major problem in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment and thank the Minister for returning to the House, where it always is good to discuss food issues.  I believe there is good architecture in place and that between the national waste prevention programme, the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009, the landfill levy, the food labelling directive and the Stop Food Waste programme, the Government has put in place good architecture to cope with the enormous difficulties that I acknowledge arise.  While Senator Quinn is right and it is good that Members are discussing these problems, I support the amendment because this architecture is in place.  The Government will take the time and the care to build on that architecture, to take advice where it can and to change where it must, to ensure the problem of food waste does not grow out of proportion and become something about which no care is taken.  However, I believe the Government is taking care of this problem and I look forward to the coming years to ascertain how this can be built upon and improved.</P>
        <P>I will address my opening remarks to healthy eating and children in particular.  The Food Dudes project is welcome and has worked.  As a consequence, I have seen my children eat us out of house and home with those 4,600 apples mentioned by Senator Quinn.  However, it would be worthwhile to ascertain whether the Food Dudes project can be extended to more schools more frequently.  I have spoken to its organisers and this year, it is operating in 386 primary schools, which is great news.  However, given the manner in which it rolls around different schools, some schools may not get it back again for a while or perhaps cannot afford to engage with it.  Children must be reminded as they are only in a learning curve and if they learn something for six weeks they may forget it and must be reminded again.  Although this may be the minor flaw in the programme, it is a great project that has proved to be successful in Wales where it originally was launched, elsewhere in the United Kingdom and in the United States.</P>
        <P>The issue of school milk arises in the context of healthy eating.  As a dairy and food scientist, I always support the drinking of milk.  I would like to see a good deal more excitement being generated in respect of the consumption of milk.  The advent of the Olympics in the UK this summer has prompted the launch of the &ldquo;make mine milk&rdquo; campaign.  All of the UK&rsquo;s top athletes are currently appearing in advertisements in which they proclaim that skill, self-discipline and semi-skimmed milk will help them to win at the Olympics.  This is a fun campaign, a part of which is a great interactive website which really reaches out to children and informs them that milk can be good for them.  The athletes to whom I refer are pictured on the website sporting &ldquo;milk &lsquo;taches&rdquo;.  The latter are milk moustaches people often get when they drink milk. <Col N="71"/> Individuals such as Gordon Ramsay, a chef, and Kelly Rowland, from &ldquo;The X Factor&rdquo;, are also assisting in creating the kind of excitement to which I refer.</P>
        <P>Children have far more available to them now than was the case when I was young.  At that time, milk was both the only and the cheapest option and parents relied upon it for their children.  This reflected the post-war view that if babies were given milk they would grow strong.  We have moved so far away from that outlook that we have forgotten how things used to be.  We could do a great deal to change people&rsquo;s perceptions.  The Irish Dairy Board has done much to promote our food and dairy industry across the globe.  That industry had a turnover of &euro;1.9 billion last year.  Perhaps we might engage the Irish Dairy Board to promote milk in a more exciting way in order that we might develop the healthy eating process further.  Everyone is aware of the need to promote healthy eating, a matter which has been discussed in the House on numerous occasions.  We must continue our efforts in respect of this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Anaerobic digestion is not something which many of us might wish to discuss very often.  This is a technology which uses micro-organisms to break down biodegradable material.  I would like our efforts in respect of delivering on the commitment the Government has given in respect of this matter to be driven by the Minister and his colleagues, the Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs, Innovation and Enterprise, Deputy Sherlock, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  I am aware of two projects relating to anaerobic digestion which are currently ongoing at Sligo Institute of Technology.  One of these is being carried out in partnership with South West College, Omagh, and involves trying to take small-scale waste from farms and converting it to energy to be used locally.  This is because it is not possible to transport biohazardous waste to large sites and then try to convert it to energy.  The small project to which I refer and which is still at the research stage involves dealing with waste and energy conversion at the same time.  What is being attempted in this instance is good and I would like anaerobic digestion to become &mdash; as is the case with the fiscal compact &mdash; an issue which everyone would discuss.</P>
        <P>Sligo Institute of Technology is also carrying out research with the Scottish Association for Marine Science in order to discover how to produce energy from marine algae.  Again, this work involves anaerobic digestion.  However, it is not so much driven by the need to deal with waste as it is by seeking to develop alternative ways to produce energy in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a major problem in the context of food waste.  Even with the architecture to which I refer being in place, I do not believe the Minister could or would ignore the fact that such a problem exists.  In the US, some 110 kg of food per person per year is wasted.  In sub-Saharan Africa, the figure is 5 kg per person.  If one does not have any food, one does not have anything to waste.  I agree that there are enormous difficulties in the context of waste food.  Such food cannot just be dumped in landfill because it is dangerous and leads to the production of methane, etc.  As is the case with the FareShare charity in the UK, I would like to see a similar charity here given support in respect of collecting food that is going to go to waste from supermarkets.  Superquinn had a recent initiative in this regard.  This is something which should be done on a nationwide basis in order to ensure that food which is safe to eat today can be eaten tomorrow and not placed in landfill.</P>
        <P>What procedures are in place to deal with the fats, oil and grease, FOG, which are the by-products of food preparation within the catering industry?  There is a major problem in respect of this matter in the US, with billions of gallons of untreated wastewater being allowed to flow into local waterways.  I am not sure what is the position in Ireland in this regard.</P>
        <P>Food labelling is a vexed question.  Like many other people, I become confused when confronted with Irish smoked salmon and smoked Irish salmon.  I welcome the fact that the EU has taken action in respect of this matter and that legislation is pending.  In light of the difficulties to <Col N="72"/>which so many other Senators referred, I ask the Minister to urge the relevant authorities to bring the process in this regard to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  The concept of substantial transformation remains a problem.  I refer, for example, to chickens which have been produced elsewhere but which, because they were substantially transformed and repackaged here, are labelled as Irish.  We must move past that.  I am aware that this matter is regulated by the EU and I welcome the fact that legislation is soon to come into place.  I hope the EU legislation to which I refer will be transposed into Irish law in the near future and I look forward to further debates on this matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  It is appropriate and helpful that he is present because he is a highly competent individual who is well on top of his brief.  The Minister has authority to do certain things and I am going to suggest one further action he might take.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There does not appear to be any conflict between what Senators Quinn and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien have proposed and what is contained in the Government amendment, which, I presume, was drafted by some helpful officials in the Department.  No confrontational language is used in the motion.  The Government is not condemned but is instead encouraged, helped, persuaded, etc.  To use a clich&eacute; which one of my colleagues at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade continually employs &mdash; I am not sure whether he has any particular religious beliefs &mdash; we are all singing from the same hymn sheet on this matter.  Even though it would make for a very lengthy text, would it be possible to combine the motion and the amendment?  I have consulted Senator Quinn and he has no difficulty with amendment No. 2, which was tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in.  In the context of that amendment and as Senator Quinn indicated, Irish produce is viewed on an all-island basis in any event.  There is no partitionism in this regard at all.</P>
        <P>Would it be possible to produce a combined text in order that we might avoid a vote on this matter?  I will be prepared to partake in such a vote, if necessary, but would it not be possible for us to display a degree of unity?  There is no conflict between the various texts with which we have been presented.  I accept that a unified text would be extremely long and would include terms such as &ldquo;anaerobic digestion&rdquo;, with which I have become familiar, and &ldquo;composting&rdquo;, which is a useful process and which I employ in my garden.  That is my first practical suggestion.  The Seanad is not partisan and we are extremely lucky to count among our number people such as Senator Quinn, who has extensive experience at the highest level in the retail grocery business, and Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, who has an extremely good reputation in the area of food production.  I can vouch for the latter because I ate a couple of her products earlier today.  I would welcome it if the Minister would consider accepting a large, ungainly but composite motion in the interests of having everyone move in the same direction, particularly because it appears we are all heading in that direction in any event.</P>
        <P>Senator Comiskey referred to the production of olive oil.  I am not sure whether he was referring to its production in Ireland and I am certainly not aware of that latter happening.  If olive oil is being produced here, then that is a most interesting phenomenon and development.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn addressed the question of food waste.  I was not aware that we actually throw away 1 million tonnes of food every year.  That is shocking, particularly when one considers that 2.6 million children across the globe die of hunger each year.  The contrast between our affluence and our happy abandon with regard to food is striking.  When I was young, matters were different.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe referred to the post-war years.  I remember those very well.  I recall that a man used to travel around Dublin 4 collecting swill.  I have just read Bob Quinn&rsquo;s wonderful novel about life in the working-class area near Dundrum.  One of Mr. Quinn&rsquo;s relatives also used to go around collecting swill, which was then recycled and reused.  One of the <Col N="73"/>things I admire so much about the mountain community in Cyprus in which I live on a part-time basis is the fact that everything from the vines there &mdash; leaves, wood, grapes, etc. &mdash; is used and nothing is allowed to go to waste.  In Ireland, however, we throw so much out.  For example, restaurants dispose of millions of euro worth of food.</P>
        <P>The second part of the motion tabled by Senators Quinn and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien relates to their colleagues in the retail trade and the food production industry.  I am not sure whether Government direction is required in respect of this matter.  I understand some businesses, particularly large retailers, already give leftover food to charities such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for distribution to the less well off.  What Senator Quinn had to say in respect of expiry dates, best before dates and use by dates was extremely interesting.  Perfectly good food is being dumped because such dates have been passed.  Such food should be capable of being used to feed those who are hungry.</P>
        <P>I will end with the idea of cross-party consensus.  Some years ago I was involved with &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo; and I was determined that the politicians would win it because we needed a good news story, and we did.  It was a cross-party effort.  I said later to my colleagues from all parties and none that we should remain together as a little group because we had learned a certain amount and I thought we should stay in touch with the team.  We did so and we had meetings and sent information to the Minister about calorie labelling in food outlets and restaurants which has been successful in the United States.  The Minister agreed with it but the Government fell.  I hope this will continue because we have the fattest kids in Europe and this is an extraordinary change since my day when we did not have much to eat after the war.  This is a good example of cross-party co-operation and it is what the Seanad is for.  In light of the fact there is no confrontational language and we all seem to agree, perhaps we can avoid a vote, do something positive and support the Minister in his excellent work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I compliment Senators Quinn and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien for tabling the motion.  We all know the line &ldquo;food, glorious food&rdquo; from &ldquo;Oliver!&rdquo;, and as Napoleon said an army marches on its stomach, so it is important we have a proper discussion on food.  Food is the most important thing in the world.  We cannot live without bread and water.  Many of the points I was going to make have already been raised by other Senators.</P>
        <P>The Government has tabled an amendment to the motion, which I second, but I agree with Senator Norris that we should try to come to a consensus on this because it is all for the good of the nation and the people.  Good food produces good health.  Senator Norris mentioned how we lived after the Second World War.  Many cookery programmes on television are aimed at the high end of the market.  I watch with interest programmes broadcast on the Discovery Channel and the History Channel on how the English coped during the Second World War and how leftovers were used properly.  Part of the motion concerns how to deal properly with leftover food.  Perhaps the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland or a Department should offer grants to people who produce a programme on creating proper meals from leftovers.  It is shocking to see that 300 kg of black bin rubbish go out every year and that this is equivalent to 3,750 apples.  This is a lot of apples and we would not need a doctor if we were eating that many.  We should try to inform people on how important food is.  People are starving throughout the world so we should not waste it.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe mentioned only 5 kg of food is wasted in Africa.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien mentioned the difference between Irish smoked salmon and smoked Irish salmon.  I do not eat smoked salmon so I do not know which is which; I am not in the smoked salmon brigade.  This country should be very careful with regard to sanctions on other countries because we rely on exporting 80% of our products and we do not want another <Col N="74"/>economic war.  This country can pride itself on our food security and the food safety we have established through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia, and it is important that we continue to press home these issues.</P>
        <P>Labelling is important and I thoroughly disagree with the fact that if one sticks a breadcrumb on something one can label it as Irish.  The EU is changing its regulations on this and the amendment states ingredients will have to represent more than 50% of a food for it to be claimed by a country of origin.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe mentioned anaerobic digesters but I think people are afraid of them because of the name.  They feel they are dangerous, like a crocodile in the river.  This House has debated energy on many occasions and we see how the cost of energy is increasing.  If food is wasted and it cannot be recycled the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and planning offices should make it easier to build anaerobic digesters in local areas.  The Campile community in Callan has an anaerobic digester and the people provide their own energy.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn mentioned best before and sell before dates and I welcome the Government amendment recommending wider publicity for the stop food waste programme.  Websites exist but the issue needs to be highlighted.  At home we have often used a carton of milk after it is out of date.  Such milk is often perfectly good and the way to judge it is on its taste.  It is the same with regard to ham, and I see my young lads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am not mean; I am practical.  Ham can be perfectly good after the date shown.</P>
        <P>The EU school milk scheme was mentioned and it should be encouraged.  I also welcome the fruit scheme in schools and the food dude.  It is a great measure.  Many speakers mentioned obesity and fruit is the healthiest thing one can eat.  We must import the majority of our fruit but it is still important to include it in school diets and get young people used to eating it.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s comments and I hope agreement can be reached on this motion.  Food is the most important thing in the world and we must keep food security and food labelling on the agenda.  I thank the Independent Senators for tabling the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>As a Cavan woman I can say we definitely would not throw out perfectly good food; we would make sure to eat as much of it as we can.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I thank Senators Quinn and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien for tabling the motion.  I have a keen interest in the area of food labelling having been a researcher on a report commissioned by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment from 2009 to 2010.  Arthur Morgan was the rapporteur of the committee at the time and I spent much time researching food labelling.  I will focus my comments specifically on country of origin labelling, substantial transformation and use of the term &ldquo;Irish food&rdquo;.  When I read the motion I was very excited and quite nerdish.</P>
        <P>One of the recommendations adopted by the report, which was supported by all parties in the committee, was on the use of the term &ldquo;Irish food&rdquo;.  We stated a set of guidelines should be established so such terms could be used only after specific criteria were satisfied.</P>
        <P>Senators mentioned the rule on substantial transformation, which holds a product originates in the country where it last underwent a substantial working or processing resulting in the creation of a new and different article of commerce having a name, character or use different to its constituent materials.  This terminology originates in a World Trade Organisation codex <Col N="75"/>and EU legislation governing the EU custom code and therefore it can be amended only at EU level.  As it stands, the tariff nomenclature does not distinguish agri-food products which are subject to substantial transformation.  Because of this it is not possible to distinguish between goods wholly made in one country and those transformed in the tariff codes under the current international system.</P>
        <P>Once the good meets the requirement for substantial transformation under EU rules of origin, it qualifies as a good originating in the country in which the substantial transformation has taken place.  It is treated in the same way as a good wholly made in the same country for the process of applying or suspending tariffs.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Government&rsquo;s amendment, will the Minister provide the House with further details of the feasibility study of the possibility of extending country of origin labelling requirements to other foods?  Will he or the Minister for Health inform the process or make submissions or will consultation take place?  What interaction has his Department or the Department of Health had with the Codex Alimentarius Commission and the national codex committee in Ireland on the issue of substantial transformation, given that it is a critically important?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I refer to the use of terms such as &ldquo;Irish food&rdquo;.  State aid rules are restrictive and, therefore, the Government cannot intervene.  The importance of marketing and promotion by the industry and other stakeholders cannot be underestimated in the light of this.  Campaigns such as Bord Bia&rsquo;s Ireland &mdash; the Food Island have capitalised on the excellent image of Irish food abroad, but I would add a caveat.  Market-led food campaigns are at risk of being exploited by companies operating and manufacturing outside the jurisdiction and, because of the state aid rules, consumers have become wholly reliant on industry-led campaigns such as Love Irish Food for the indication of country of origin.  The problems that can arise which are beyond the scope of Government intervention are that consumers can be misled by the use of the term &ldquo;Irish food&rdquo; in a campaign where the producer does not always use Irish raw materials and must only ensure 80% of the manufacturing process takes place in Ireland.  While the campaign supports Irish businesses, the food may not be completely Irish.  For that reason, it is necessary to put ethics regulations and guidelines in place in order that the term &ldquo;Irish food&rdquo; can only be used when specific criteria are satisfied.  In that way, the Government would not contravene state aid rules <i>per se</i> and would prevent exploitation of consumers by the industry.</P>
        <P>The ramifications of state aid rules for Government intervention leave a large vacuum for industry to exploit consumers because there is a financial imperative behind making consumers think a product is more Irish than might be the case.  Many examples have been highlighted in the debate.  For example, how many Irish cream liqueurs are made in Ireland?  It is only when there is complete transparency that we will be able to tackle food issues such as the level of obesity.  That is why I ask the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to work together to examine this issue in serious detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators concerned for tabling the motion.  While I will circulate my script, I will depart from it to respond to the questions raised.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn commented on the tragic irony of there being an obesity problem and gross waste of food in some parts of the world, while in others 300 children an hour die from malnutrition.  There is a great deal we can do in this regard, but we are doing significant work also.  Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme makes a significant impact in the programme countries in which we operate.  I was anxious to link my Department to the programme and <Col N="76"/>we have developed a new policy with the development aid section in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which has not yet been announced to put finance in place to support Irish food companies which want to invest in developing food production systems in the developing world.  This will help developing countries from a financial point of view.  We could make a significant impact in many countries, particularly in Africa, in building capacity to promote the growth, processing and preparation for consumption of protein-based foods, particularly in dairy and meat production.  I can forward the details to the Senator.</P>
        <P>We are examining other issues which have not received the attention they should receive for various commercial reasons such as the level of discards in the fishing industry.  The quota around our coast is approximately 1 million tonnes and this year approximately 400,000 tonnes of fish will be dumped back into the sea because the quota under the Common Fisheries Policy will have been exceeded or the fish are too small to be landed for market.  That figure is probably higher, but, conservatively, 40% of the fish caught are dumped, with up to 70% of some species being dumped.  There is, therefore, gross wastage of viable food which could and perhaps should feed people who cannot afford to buy it.  However, because of the system we have bought into for environmental reasons in the case of the CFP to protect fish stocks, that facility is not allowed, which is ironic.  We are trying to address this issue in a genuine way under the CFP.  Only last week, for example, I went out on a fishing trawler on the Irish Sea to be shown new technology to separate cod from prawns.  We have plenty of healthy prawn stocks, while the cod stock is under severe pressure in the Irish Sea, but fishermen now have the capacity to separate their catch which will I hope lead to the conservation of cod while viable prawn stocks are landed.  Mechanisms such as this are needed across a series of sectors.</P>
        <P>We also have a crazy milk quota policy which will be in place until April 2015.  Ireland has the capacity to dramatically increase the volume of milk it produces, but if we exceed our milk quota, we will be subject to superlevy fines.  There is huge demand for the dairy products we have the capacity to process and export.  EU and international policies have been put in place for domestic commercial reasons to deliberately limit supply to drive demand and maintain high prices or, in the case of fisheries, in an attempt to conserve stock, but the side effect is to force the industry to dump significant volumes of adult marketable fish which could feed hungry people.  We are working on a series of initiatives in the areas referred to by the Senator to reduce waste and focus our policy on using our natural resources more effectively to feed more people.  The island of Ireland has a population of 6 million, but we produce enough food for 36 million.  By 2020, we will produce enough food for 50 million and, if I have my way, it will be closer to 60 million.  I am hugely ambitious for the food industry in producing more for less in a safe, sustainable way that is in sympathy with the environment and the climate.  I will refer to this later in discussing our carbon footprint.</P>
        <P>We are modernising agriculture and primary food production in Ireland in an impressive way.  It is industry-led and strongly supported by the Government.  That will have a commercial return but it will also make a significant contribution in terms of our contribution towards feeding populations outside Ireland.</P>
        <P>A point I repeatedly make at Council level in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy is that issues globally have changed.  We can no longer look at the European Union in a protectionist way to try to create an artificial market for food to keep prices high.  Most commodity food prices outside the European Union have caught up because of significant increases in food commodity prices in the past two years due to a shortage of supply.  Europe must concentrate on feeding itself and making a contribution to feeding the world as part of the Common Agricultural Policy as opposed to the opposite, which has been the case in the past.</P><Col N="77"/>
        <P>On the motion, I would like to think I am a constructive politician.  I do not try to find division unless it is necessary.  There are some proposals in the motion I know I cannot deliver.  I cannot vote for something to try to keep everyone happy knowing there are some proposals in the motion that legally I cannot deliver, particularly around labelling.  I will read the section of my speech on labelling that has been prepared for me because I want to put a number of points on the record but I have bought into the spirit of what the Senator is proposing in terms of trying to address more effectively the issue of food waste.</P>
        <P>We have a series of proposals and projects, whether they be in primary schools, through local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency website or driven by the Department of the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, on trying to reduce waste levels in food and also in energy.  Some of them are working reasonably well but much more can be done.  This motion seeks to drive forward that agenda and force new thinking on finding ways of reducing the almost one third of food that is not consumed and is dumped.  This occurs despite all the standards we impose in terms of food production and the mechanisms and structures we have in place across the European Union, not just in Ireland, although we do it better here than any other country in the European Union, to ensure food safety and so on.  It is a bit like the crazy statistic on water that indicates we spend &euro;1.2 billion a year treating water for human consumption and nearly half of it leaks through the pipes before it gets to its destination.  We have the same problem with food, although the problem is nearly worse because consumers get the product and then throw it away because they leave it in the fridge too long, they do not consume it or whatever.  A series of sectors are responsible for that, and the retail sector is part of the chain that is responsible for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator makes a good point about the two for one or the five for four offer.  The only exception to that is alcohol in that people probably consume all of it because it does not go off.  My household is like any other.  We have two young daughters.  We try to bring a lot of fruit and vegetables into the house and we end up throwing many of them away as a result of not getting the volumes of shopping right.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has set up a website to help people to measure and target what they should be purchasing each week in a more accurate way to reduce waste and so on, but it has had limited effect.</P>
        <P>In terms of the motion, I am happy to sit down with anyone from this House who wants to talk to me about the individual bullet points they propose should be considered.  I will take them on board and try to implement them where possible, but my Department is not solely responsible for all these areas.  Some of them come under the Department of Health and others under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Other elements might involve taxation measures that encourage certain behaviour, which comes under the Department of Finance.  Some may relate to my Department but I am happy to work with this House in terms of trying to achieve the goals the Senator is proposing.  What I will not do, however, is support a motion when I know it contains specifics that are well-meaning but that I cannot deliver, particularly around the labelling elements.</P>
        <P>I refer to some of the issues on labelling.  Members are aware that responsibility for the enforcement of general food labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI.  The EU general labelling directive sets out mandatory information that must appear on the packaging of pre-packed food or on an attached label.  Last September, the EU adopted new legislation on food information.  That sets down additional labelling requirements to help consumers make healthier and better informed choices.  The new rules aim to streamline the legislation to ensure better compliance with greater clarity for stakeholders, which is what people have been calling for.</P><Col N="78"/>
        <P>The general labelling directive requires the place of origin of foodstuffs in circulation in the EU to be declared only where failure to provide it would be likely to mislead the consumer.  I will refer to that again shortly.  Specific country of origin labelling for beef and veal was introduced under Regulation EC No. 1760/2000 originating with the need for traceability arising from BSE.  Some other products such as honey, fruit, vegetables and olive oil also require origin labelling under EU legislation.</P>
        <P>Ireland has long favoured the extension of mandatory origin labelling to meats other than beef, including where such meats are ingredients in processed products, and has pressed for this at a European level for a number of years.  Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and Council extends the current provisions which apply to beef to other meats, namely, pork, poultry, sheep and goat meat.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Country of origin labelling is about providing the consumer with information on the country or countries where food was grown, produced, manufactured or packed.  Some product specific legislation requires that country of origin be indicated on the label and the criteria for determining origin are set out in the relevant legislation.  For example, the legislation for beef and beef products requires that the country where the animal was born, raised and slaughtered must be indicated.</P>
        <P>Origin labelling was also required under marketing standards regulations for unprocessed poultry meat imported from third countries, that is, outside the European Union.  That legislation does not include the detailed traceability requirements provided for beef.  For the purposes of international trade, origin is deemed to be the place where the product last underwent a substantial transformation, which is what a number of people have raised and have concerns about in this debate.</P>
        <P>Impact assessments will be prepared over the next two years in respect of pig, poultry, sheep and goat meat and other products such as milk and unprocessed foods.  These reports will examine issues such as the need for the consumer to be informed, the feasibility of providing the mandatory indication of the country of origin and the potential impact on international trade.  Following these impact assessments, the Commission will adopt implementing Acts regarding pork, poultry, sheep and goat meat, and the new requirements will apply from December 2014.  Enforcement will be the responsibility of the FSAI.</P>
        <P>The European legislative wheels are moving on this issue.  The principal decision has been made by the Parliament and the Council to extend country of origin labelling to other meats, including pork and poultry.  We are also looking at dairy products, but there must be an assessment of the impact of that decision on the Common Market and on international trade, but it will happen, although it is frustrating that it takes as long as it takes to get it done.</P>
        <P>I want to issue a note of caution on one aspect.  There is a great deal of talk in Ireland, and rightly so, about encouraging consumers here to buy Irish products.  While I support that, we must be careful that we do not promote at EU level the adoption by countries of a protectionist approach towards their own producers, because 85% of all the food we produce has to find a purchaser, a home and a consumer outside of Ireland.  We export nearly &euro;3 billion worth of food to the UK each year.  If the UK decided to deliberately target Irish food and encourage its consumers not to buy it, it would have a devastating impact on our food industry.  Ireland more than any other country in the European Union relies on a common market that is functioning.  The approach I take on this is to say to consumers that they have a right to know from where the food comes and that the best quality of food they can buy is likely to come from Ireland because I can stand over the systems we implement here at a farm and processing level and so on.  I encourage consumers to buy Irish because of the quality, safety and sustainability <Col N="79"/>that is part of the Irish tag or label, but I do not say buy Irish because we do not like the French or the Belgians and they are also food producers.  We need to ensure we do not take a protectionist US approach towards keeping out beef exports in terms of the European Union.  Our food industry is based on markets outside of Ireland.  Practically all the growth we are aspiring to deliver in terms of the Food Harvest 2020 business plan is based on finding markets, and premium markets at that, for our produce outside Ireland.</P>
        <P>That brings me on to an issue I am glad the Senators raised around carbon-footprinting.  Sweden is doing some interesting work on carbon-footprinting but it cannot match what Ireland is doing.  We are the only country in the world that can put a label on most of our beef to show the consumer the carbon &mdash; or methane &mdash; footprint associated with that beef production.  Some 500 farms a week are being carbon-footprinted through the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme.  We have approximately 28,000 beef farms in Ireland that can measure the carbon footprint or emissions that come from their herds while they are growing their beef.  We are the first country in the world to do that and we are about to extend it into the dairy area.  Within the next 18 months or probably prior to that we will see an equally proactive rollout of carbon footprinting in the dairy area.</P>
        <P>We are doing a good deal on carbon-footprinting and for good reason.  At a European level the climate change policy being pursued by the European Union is fundamentally at odds with the food security policy being pursued by it &mdash; they do not make sense.  In essence, our emissions problem in terms of the target we have set ourselves by 2020 means that 40% of our emissions problem comes from the agriculture sector.  When the traded sector &mdash; the top 106 emitters in Ireland which trade between each other at a European level &mdash; is taken out of the equation, 40% of our emissions problem comes from agricultural, from the front and back end of cattle predominantly.  There are also emissions from machinery, ploughing of land and so on.</P>
        <P>The idea that EU policy would encourage a country like Ireland to reduce its herd size to meet climate change targets when we produce beef at one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world makes no sense when this is a global problem because we would simply transport the problem to somewhere else.  In other words, for the EU to meet its targets from an emissions point of view as regards agriculture, we would import from other parts of the world where the carbon footprint is not measured and simply displace the problem.  If the European Union was serious about linking food security and food production with climate change, it would encourage countries like Ireland and other countries that can measure the carbon footprint, and know that we represent best practice in terms of reducing emissions from food production, to produce more food and to displace food production from other parts of the world that are not as efficient at doing it.  That is the big advantage of Ireland because we have a grass-based system for beef and dairy, which is much more sustainable and is becoming much more price competitive as the cost of meal &mdash; which most cattle are fed in most parts of the world both for milk and for beef &mdash; has increased; and as grain has got more scarce, the price has gone up by nearly 50%  in two years.  We are in a competitive place from the point of view of climate change labelling, sustainability, animal husbandry and safety, but we need to do a great deal more work in regard to the waste that happens in the supply chain between the retail sector and the consumer, predominantly in people&rsquo;s homes and businesses, hotels, restaurants and so on.  I am happy to work with anyone in this House who would like to meet me on this to try to make an impact.</P>
        <P>On the labelling issue, we cannot unilaterally decide that we will change labelling standards in Ireland and expect there to be no consequences from doing that.  We operate in a common market, which is essential for Ireland in terms of our growth.  Some 41% of our exports go to the UK and 34% of them go to the rest of the European Union.  If Members add those two figures they will realise that the vast majority of the food we export goes either to the European <Col N="80"/>Union or to the UK.  We need common standards on labelling, standards, controls and enforcement across the Common Market, which has half a billion consumers, to ensure we play on the same pitch as everybody else.  If we start changing the rules for ourselves, others will follow, and it is not in our interests to do that.  We need to continue to lobby and push aggressively at a European level to get the country of origin labelling result that we want, which is already on the way but is frustratingly slow in coming.  We need to raise other standards by getting agreement at an EU level to get a common platform for trade and import and export of food and so that consumers associate buying Irish food with everything that we want them to associate it with around sustainability, quality, safety, animal husbandry, carbon-footprinting issues and so on, whether they buy it in Germany or in Glanmire.</P>

	<P>I appeal to Senator Quinn not put this motion to a vote as I would rather not have a vote on this issue.  I do not know if the procedure is available for us to have a sos to see if we could change some of the wording in the motion and amalgamate it with some of the wording in ours to try to get agreement on that or whether the motion can be withdrawn on the assurance I have given during the debate that I will take on board the issues the Senator has raised, but that is an issue for the House.  As the motion stands, I cannot support the current wording of it because I know I cannot deliver on it and I do not want to mislead people.  I can deliver much of it but not all of it, particularly on the labelling side.  Any motion we agree on this should recognise the good work being done around beef and lamb quality assurance schemes and the school education programmes that are working.  There is a generational mind set change on these issues, particularly around climate concerns.  Any motion should be broad enough to recognise the good work done by previous Governments and being continued by this Government and I would be happy to accept it should also include a statement that there is much more to do particularly around the waste issue that has been raised by the promoters of this motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte romhat, a Aire.  I commend him for the work he has done since his appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  On a personal level, I have been most impressed by his work in regard to fish quotas.  His proactivity in that area has been felt very strongly in my constituency in north Dublin and along the east coast.  I commend him on the work to date in that regard and wish him the best for the future.  I hope there can be agreement on the motion, as the House should not divide on it.  My group will be following Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s lead.</P>
        <P>With regard to food labelling, there are points to be made on child obesity.  We are all aware this is an issue, just as we are aware of the level of food waste.  The Harvest 2020 document, produced under the former Minister, Brendan Smith, and enhanced by the Minister, details the importance of the agrifood sector and how it will assist in getting us through these difficult times.  There is massive potential.  In my area of north Dublin there is a predominance of growers on the horticultural side, some of whom are doing well, others not so well, particularly in the potato sector in which things have been difficult.</P><Col N="81"/>
        <P>With regard to research, there are a couple of areas about which I have specific concerns that are not particularly local but apply at a national level and also fit in with the motion.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to deal with them.  One is the operation of Teagasc and how we are investing &mdash; or not, as the case may be &mdash; in further research on the horticultural side, in particular.  The Minister mentioned the dairy and beef industries which are very important, and also grain production.  However, on the fresh food side, I have seen many micro-industries set up in recent years.  Only last week I was made aware of a beekeeper who had come out of nowhere two years ago and began producing high quality honey in Skerries.  This business was set up by an individual with no Government support.  There a lot of potential at that level.</P>
        <P>There are some areas in which we are now a major producer.  If we go back 25 years, we were nowhere in mushroom production and now look where we are.  Peppers production is another example.  All of these items can be produced under glass.  These are areas in which we are successful and can be even more so.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about Teagasc&rsquo;s plan to close the only horticultural research centre in the country, which is located in Kinsealy, as the Minister is aware.  There is a proposal &mdash; I have written to the board of Teagasc about this a number of times &mdash; to close the centre and amalgamate it with the one in Ashtown, Dublin 15, which deals predominantly with beef and dairy research.  It does not have the required amount of land and a &euro;5 million investment by Teagasc will be required to bring the facilities up to date, even though we already have the facilities required in Kinsealy.  In fact, Teagasc which owns more than 2,000 acres of land and has nearly 200 acres in Kinsealy is seeking to rent land in Ashtown.  I am not raising this as a constituency issue, as it affects a number of constituencies in Leinster.</P>
        <P>There is grave concern that within many of the large agricultural sectors, horticulture seems to play second fiddle.  The closure of the only research centre for horticulture would be a backwards step, particularly as Teagasc seems to be proceeding with the closure, despite the fact that it has conducted no cost-benefit analysis, as it has confirmed to me.  As part of its figures it proposed to sell the Kinsealy site for &euro;2.64 million; it would not get 15% of that figure now, and even at the time it was unlikely.  I know the Minister has no direct operational control over Teagasc.  I have written to Professor Gerry Boyle about the matter on a number of occasions and raised it at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have grave concerns about the effect the move will have on the horticulture sector.  That area of the country is effectively our bread basket, as 60% of our horticultural produce is produced in it.  To move a centre which has done such fantastic work for 20 or 25 years would be a backwards step.</P>
        <P>I commend Senators Feargal Quinn and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien for tabling the motion.  Many Members have spoken about the issue of food waste and labelling.  The Minister has said that if he had his way, we would be producing enough food for 60 million people by 2020.  He is hugely ambitious about this and I agree with him.  We must consider how we could do this by examining the proportion of what we produce that is being wasted and trying to reduce it.  I support the Minister in his efforts in this regard.</P>
        <P>I understand there are a couple of elements within the motion that the Minister cannot support on the basis that he does not have control of them.  There should be an opportunity for the Government parties and the two Senators who have tabled the motion to come to some agreement.  The Minister&rsquo;s engagement with the House so far has been excellent.  He has accepted points that were made, for which I commend him.  Research is a key element in all sectors, but in the food sector it is absolutely crucial.  Closing a horticultural research centre and trying to shoehorn it into a much smaller centre that is shared with those involved in dairy and beef research makes no sense.  I ask the Minister to examine the issue.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="82"/>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, commend the Minister for his work to date.  I was awestruck by his knowledge of his brief and ability to relay statistics to us.  </P>
        <P>I support Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien on the issue of horticulture.  I come from south Tipperary, but literally in the next parish is Iverk Produce, probably the biggest vegetable producer in the country.  I know from talking to many of the staff that they are extremely concerned about the Teagasc research centre, to which the Senator referred to.  The company is at the cutting edge of fruit and vegetable production, particularly vegetable production.  We need a centre such as the Teagasc centre which is carrying out dynamic research.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue seriously.</P>
        <P>Every one of us is concerned and dismayed when we see the coverage on national television of fish being returned to the sea in the interests of preserving fish stocks.  It is ironic.  I know the Minister is doing some work on this issue, but perhaps he might relay his current views to us before the debate finishes.  This practice is unsustainable.  We see nets being hauled and, in some cases, more than half of what is caught being thrown back.  I am interested to hear that some work is being done in this regard and that there is new technology available for separating fish, but I would like to know what the position is at EU level.  Can we not convince the European Union that throwing dead fish back into the sea will not sustain or improve fish stocks?  What we are being forced to do is ludicrous.</P>
        <P>The problem of obesity is mentioned in both the motion and the amendment.  There is an effort to require all food outlets to display the calorie count of the food they are selling.  This has been championed on the programme &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo; by Professor Donal O&rsquo;Shea.  Is there any intention to introduce legislation in this regard?  This issue is of great importance.  Such systems are in place elsewhere, particularly in New York, and they do make people more conscious of what they are eating.</P>
        <P>Composting was mentioned in the original motion.  Home composting, the first point of engagement in reducing waste, has not been promoted to a great extent, although some local authorities are endeavouring to provide composting units and information.  In my own town I was involved in promoting the use of home composting kits.  However, it is hit and miss.  One may say there are brown bins, but they not are provided in some parts of the country.  Where a person has a choice between putting food into a composter in the garden and putting it into a bin to be taken to a landfill site, if he or she is not encouraged to take the first option, he or she will not do it.  I ask the Minister to comment on this issue, although it is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government more so than the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</P>
        <P>The other issue about which I am concerned and which is dealt with in the motion is the condition of food in retail outlets, particularly fruit and vegetables.  There are two problems.  First, the quantities being sold discriminate against elderly people living alone.  They are forced to buy, for example, six tomatoes in a pack, but as they will not use them in two weeks, they will have to throw out half of them.  The second is the condition of packaged fruit and vegetables and practically all of them are packaged.  Even though there is a &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; or &ldquo;use by&rdquo; date on them, when one opens the packet, much of the product is damaged and unusable.  This is something the local health inspectors are supposed to regulate by carrying out spot checks, but that is not happening.  The multiples and large stores are the main culprits in that regard.</P>
        <P>There are many successful local markets in rural areas.  I am the son of a former greengrocer as my mother ran a greengrocer shop for about 25 years.  The consumer wants fresh vegetables straight from the soil, but, unfortunately, we are regulating this out of existence.  We should look at the matter again, as there is scope for this.  People who have stalls in markets are finding it extremely difficult to operate because of regulations.  On the one hand, there must <Col N="83"/>be regulation, but, on the other, we must find a way to allow fresh fruit and vegetables to be sold.  That means the carrots will still have the dirt on them, once they are traceable.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am sorry if it sometimes seems like I am trying to make very profound statements from these poor, Independent, academic benches, but the Minister and his ministerial colleagues who have responsibility for energy and water policy have the most important Departments.  Long after the penny drops that our future as a species is not wrapped up in things like the embassy to the Vatican, 1916 Rising commemorations, NAMA and real estate prices, it will be realised that our failure or success will depend on whether we can feed and water ourselves and have sufficient energy to carry out our activities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What about septic tanks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I was going to mention them, but as they probably intersect with the supply of water, I decided not to leave myself open on that issue.  That was my first ministerial heckle; my mother will be very proud.</P>
        <P>Worldwide, the trend is towards food shortages.  As has been mentioned, we have the ability to feed ourselves many times over, as well as a sizeable number of our neighbours.  That puts us in the unique position of having a strategic asset which we must protect very carefully.  I support my colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s motion and hope the Government side manages to reach a compromise on it.</P>
        <P>As part of our strategic vision for the future it is essential that we be specific that it will be a case of thus far and no further in terms of the incursion of development on agricultural land.  We have learned from the colossal mistakes of the real estate bubble that we used much of the land very unwisely.  We succumbed to the temptations of short-term gains not only in terms of profits but also in terms of the wise stewardship of the land we have been given, which is an unrenewable resource.  It is critical that we have a long-term view on how it should be used.</P>
        <P>For that reason the Minister, together with his colleagues in the other Departments responsible for housing, urban development and so forth, must have a definite view on the agricultural land we have available.  The default position must be that we keep it.  What is certain is that the world&rsquo;s population, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s, is increasing significantly.  The demand for food domestically will increase and, more importantly, food will become one of the few tangible bargaining chips we will have in a future in which we might need to import energy supplies and other raw materials which we cannot provide for ourselves.</P>
        <P>The catch in all of this is that while we really wish to encourage the rest of the world to buy and eat our food, we must have policies to decrease our food consumption, as many of my colleagues have mentioned in this and other debates.  That is the reality.  We want to decrease the level of food wastage, but we also wish to decrease food consumption.  Undoubtedly, other than giving up smoking and decreasing our alcohol consumption, the single best thing we could do to decrease the risk posed by many health issues that are likely to trouble us is decrease our calorie intake.  We are at or near the top in calorie consumption per head of population in world league tables.  As a result, we are at or near the top in the incidence worldwide for diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and a number of cancers.  For several years we have seen evidence that cancer of the bowel, breast and pancreas, three common cancers, is related to obesity and excessive food intake.</P>
        <P>We must achieve a fine balance in this regard.  We are not trying to put our food producers out of business, as we must keep them producing food.  At the same time &mdash; we have not exactly acknowledged this, although we are beginning to do so in the case of alcohol &mdash; we <Col N="84"/>must set the goal of reducing the number of calories we consume per head of population.  It is not as simple as a small number of people overdoing it.  The problem of excess eating is pervasive and no longer confined to a minority.  Most people in Ireland will satisfy either a definition of obesity or of being above average weight.  The only way to tackle this is by having explicit policies to reduce it.  This will be a responsibility of the Minister as well as the Minister for Health.</P>
        <P>I support the idea that all restaurant foods be calorie labelled.  They should also be weight labelled.  People should understand exactly how many grammes of food they will eat with every portion they order, in addition to understanding how many calories they are consuming.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister the very best as he approaches the end of his first year in what I hope will be a long tenure in office.  As it will probably be coterminous with the duration of this Chamber, we probably have a vested interest in wishing him well.</P>
        <P>It is critically important that we give a high priority to protecting the quantity of our agricultural land, by decreasing further systematic encroachment on it, and to protecting the quality of that land.  There are profound market forces which will tend to drive farmers and food producers in the direction of over-farming land and not being careful about renewing the supplements which need to be put back into it.  I thank the Minister for his attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the Minister.  It is a great compliment to a Minister when a leading farmer comments, as one did to me recently, that the biggest worry in the farming industry is that Deputy Simon Coveney will be promoted to some other Department and the industry will lose him.  Apparently, the Minister spoke for an hour and a half, without notes, at a dairy producers&rsquo; conference in Cork.  He won the hearts and minds of everyone present.  It was most impressive.  He is obviously taking to his office very well.  Certainly, farmers in Ireland are extremely receptive.  It is an important Ministry; it is one of the key Ministries for driving our economic recovery.  One hears talk about green shoots in the economy, but we have seen them already in farming.  There has been a transformation in the last couple of years through a combination of education, better means of production and greater awareness of waste and what can potentially be achieved.  It is great that average farm income is improving, although it still has a long way to go.</P>
        
        <P>There are a couple of areas in which I have a particular interest.  The first is the retail food sector.  Senator John Crown referred to calorie labelling of food, for which we have a moral and ethical responsibility to provide.  It should not be an issue for debate, rather it should simply be done.</P>
        <P>With regard to the sale of food, we generally adhere to a very high standard in food quality, both in the food purchased in supermarkets and the food served in restaurants.  The facilities in Irish restaurants are far ahead of what one would find in Italy, although Italian food is also good.  We seem to have over-regulated the food industry.  One can easily get a bowl of pasta in a caf&eacute; bar in Italy, but people in the food industry in this country say the environmental health requirements are completely over the top and are not conducive to the cost-efficient production and sale of food.  Some of the requirements are off the wall.  Safe food is extremely important.  The majority of people in the food business produce safe food but they find that red tape causes them difficulty. I am not sure if this is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility, but I know the Government is working to ensure that overall policy is proper, fair and reasonable.</P>
        <P>I spoke about the quality of farming.  I remind the House of one area of which I know the Minister is aware.  In the Burren, in County Clare, the Farming for Conservation project involves farmers who are producing extremely high quality food in an environmentally friendly way.  They are ambassadors for tourism as well as being in the food production business.  They <Col N="85"/>are earning their living from the land but preserving it for future generations.  They are respecting the flora and fauna that has made the Burren famous and are acting as real-life tour guides.  The agritourism business has huge potential.</P>
        <P>I would consider our unique farming methods and the expertise we have developed as intellectual property which we could sell to the Asian markets, including China.  We will never be in a position to supply the food requirements of China.  If the whole of Ireland was producing at 100% capacity, we would not supply a suburb of a major city in China.  However, we could teach the Chinese how we do it here, and do that on a long-term basis.  There are many ways of reaping an economic benefit from what we do and from the knowledge we could pass on.</P>
        <P>It is a shame to see the amount of food that is thrown out every day.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope Senator Conway understands the banter in the House.  I am simply concerned about the few minutes that are left.  I meant no reflection on his contribution which was excellent, as always.</P>
        <P>Media reports suggest that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, intends to introduce legislation on calorie counting on labelling.  While this is not within the mandate of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, the two cross over.  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to an article in yesterday&rsquo;s health supplement to <i>The Irish Times</i>, which raises questions about the efficacy of calorie counting and questions whether it reduces obesity or increases people&rsquo;s awareness of what and how much they should be eating.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We throw away approximately one third of all the food we buy.  The main foods wasted are potatoes, bread, apples, meat and fish.  Half of all salads, one third of all bread and one quarter of all fruit bought is thrown out.  Does the Minister agree that this is an issue of public awareness?  For example, confusion and misinterpretation of date labelling is widely recognised as contributing to the generation of household food waste, leading to the discard of still edible food.  It is now common practice to label the sell-by date and the best-before date, which is confusing labelling.  This is done by all food manufacturers.  As food is perishable, people stick rigidly to the labelling information.  The Minister is probably aware that manufacturers tend to err on the side of caution and give dates that are sooner than strictly necessary.</P>
        <P>The practice of taking leftovers home from restaurants is not universally accepted across Europe.  It is a cultural thing in the United States where there is no difficulty in diners asking <Col N="86"/>to have uneaten food wrapped to take home in a doggy bag.  There is a strong potential to reduce waste of restaurant food.</P>
        <P>Awareness of food waste is currently low but it is rising with environmental awareness.  I compliment Senator Quinn and others on tabling this motion.  I thank the Minister and I hope Senator Conway and I will remain good friends.</P>

I have been impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s knowledge and his ability to control his brief and to tell us what he has done.  He has educated me to a very large extent.  I was unaware of much of what he told us.  He kept us hanging on every word he said.  It was a pity the Leas-Chathaoirleach had to interrupt him when his time had concluded.</P>
        <P>I went to great pains, with the help of Senator O&rsquo;Brien, to ensure that anything I put down could be accepted so that we would not have to vote on the motion.  If I slipped up, I apologise.  I tried to use words like &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, &ldquo;consider&rdquo;, and &ldquo;urge&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;determine&rdquo;, particularly in the area of labelling.  I realise that one or two of the proposals ask, rather than encourage, the Minister to do something.  The concept was there as well as the ability to achieve it.  I was hoping there would be agreement and that the debate would bring attention to the challenge that faces us.  I think we have done that.

	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  I know that on 4 October 2011 he answered questions on this issue raised by Deputy Naughten.  Things have since moved on.  The T&aacute;naiste had several meetings on the issue of the new visa programme and the E-3, the most critical of which was with Senator Brown of the US Senate.  The Australians have an E-3 visa programme and we are looking for an Irish E-3 programme, but what will be the educational requirements?  The Schumer Bill is being brought in to the US Senate along with a high tech visa Bill.  If that happens, I fear that tradesmen who are currently unemployed in Ireland will not be able to apply for visas to go to the US.</P>
        <P>What sense is the T&aacute;naiste getting from US Republican Party leaders such as Mr. Mitch McConnell about their view on this?  Will they insist on a higher threshold than the Schumer Bill, which also had a waiver provision?  I know the Republican Party will not support any legislation with a waiver provision for currently undocumented people.  In his discussions with the State Department and the embassy, does the T&aacute;naiste feel there is a possibility that down the line, we could receive an administrative waiver similar to that which the Mexicans have achieved for their nationals?  I understand that last year, 48,000 administrative waivers were given to Mexicans for their visa programme with the US.</P><Col N="87"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Politics is local.  It is interesting to note that Senator Brown is fighting for a seat in Massachusetts, luckily enough for us I suppose, and it is a very tight race.  He might be able to convince the Republican Party leadership that if he was seen to deliver for the Irish, it would serve him well in the election.  Perhaps I am being too political at this stage.  I am sure the best of intentions will be on all sides.  However, I am concerned that we will have another visa Bill with a very high education threshold and which will not be of any benefit to the current number of unemployed tradespeople in Ireland.  While I accept that we are unlikely to get any waiver in this legislation if the Schumer Bill is merged into the Brown Bill, will we pursue administrative waivers with the Obama Administration?  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response on the number of meetings he had while he was in Washington.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I am aware of his longstanding interest in this issue.</P>
        <P>Addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States remain important priorities for the Government in its relationship with the US Administration and US Congress.  The Taoiseach and I discussed immigration issues with President Obama when we met with him on 23 May last year in Dublin.  I have also had exchanges during the course of 2011 with the Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton and Senator Patrick Leahy, Chair of the Senate judiciary committee.</P>
        <P>Enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 temporary US work visas has been a particular focus of the Government&rsquo;s efforts in the context of our overall ongoing exchanges with the US Administration and Congress on immigration related issues.  E-3 visas are non-immigrant worker visas and renewable every two years.</P>
        <P>Senators Schumer, Leahy and Durbin and Senators Brown and Kirk had tabled draft Bills which would enable the provision of E-3 visas to Irish applicants.  Both Bills have since been referred for examination by the US Senate&rsquo;s judiciary committee and I am pleased that progress is being made towards securing the bipartisan consensus that will be required if a good overall result is to be achieved.  During my recent visits to Washington DC and New York, I had further separate contacts with Deputy Secretary Bill Burns of the US State Department and with Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer and members of the &ldquo;Friends of Ireland&rdquo; group in the House of Representatives.  I thanked the Senators and the &ldquo;Friends of Ireland&rdquo; group for their ongoing efforts in this regard and encouraged them to persist towards reaching a positive outcome.  I also assured them of the Government&rsquo;s continuing close interest and support in this connection.</P>
        <P>Our embassy is in turn working closely with key stakeholder groups from throughout the Irish-American community.  The Taoiseach met last week in New York with representatives from several of these groups, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres.  He acknowledged and thanked all these groups and others from within Irish America for their vital help in rallying support behind our collective efforts.</P>
        <P>While the advances made so far are heartening, I am conscious that the current US domestic political climate on immigration issues and the presidential elections taking place there later this year mean that nothing can be taken for granted.  Therefore, the Taoiseach and I will continue to take every opportunity over the coming weeks and through the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period to maintain momentum behind these efforts.</P>
        <P>While E-3 visas address future flows between Ireland and the US, we need to continue to seek comprehensive reform to address the issue of the undocumented.  The Government will therefore continue to engage closely through the embassy with key players in the US Congress <Col N="88"/>over the period ahead, with a view to further advancing our Irish E-3 visa objectives and those of the undocumented.</P>

	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his response.  It is a difficult area, with so many competing elements in Washington.  I would like to impress on him that at some stage in the negotiations at committee level in the US Senate, we will be given an E-3 visa at the Australian entry level, which is degree level.  We should with all our diplomatic might to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that.  We can give way on the waivers because we understand that the Republican Party cannot support that, but we require the leaving certificate as the educational requirement.  I fear that in the horse trading that will take place, we could end up with a very high education threshold, which is not good for many tradesman who want to work legally in the US.  It will also stop us down the line using our good contacts with the Clintons in the State Department to look for administrative waivers.  Most of the undocumented in the US do not have the education requirements of the Australian E-3 visa.  If that requirement is the threshold for the US E-3 visa, it will be of very little use to anybody going for an administrative waiver.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Schumer Bill and the Brown Bill both pitch the education requirement at the leaving certificate level or thereabouts.  This is an election year in the United States.  Like anywhere else, an election year presents the most difficult set of circumstances, politically, in which to make progress on an issue like this.  The Government wants to make progress here.  There are broadly similar Bills from both sides of the aisle in the United States Senate.  We want to make it clear to Senators Brown and Schumer that we will work with them and support them in every way we can and maintain contact with them on that front.  In doing that, we must be mindful not to add to their difficulties in persuading their colleagues to support the Bills they have drafted and brought before the Senate.  </P>
        <P>We are continuing with the discussions.  It is important for us to bear in mind that this is an election year in the United States.  The Taoiseach and I have plans to maintain contacts with key figures in Washington to set out our support and to make it clear that we are anxious to see progress made on this matter.  We will continue that over the coming weeks.  Senators Brown and Schumer were positive in the meetings we had.  Senator Leahy, when I spoke to him, was positive.  We will work on the positive approach and response we got and help in every way we can to make progress on this issue.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This issue relates to the European Globalisation Fund, EGF, and the need to ensure we draw down all the funds available to us. Some &euro;35.7 million was to be made available to us under this fund and I understand that the companies and the names of the people entitled to draw these funds were submitted with the applications over the past 12 months but that the take-up of the fund has not been as expected.  It is important we avail of this opportunity to provide retraining for people who have been involved in the construction industry and who are now unemployed as a result of the downturn.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of issues arise, the first of which is the reason for the slow take-up of the fund.  I understand that more than 8,700 letters were sent in December but fewer than 1,000 responses were received.  I was informed there were only 452 responses to the 8,779 letters.  Why were these letters sent out so late when, as I understand, we have only a five-month period in which to draw down this funding?  What type of retraining was offered in those letters?</P>
        <P>I raise this matter because one of our national newspapers last weekend raised an issue concerning VEC courses.  Over that weekend a number of employers contacted me and advised me that they would not take on people who had done a particular VEC course because the course was so outdated and the training the person would receive would not provide the skills necessary for the job available.  While we are talking about upskilling people who have lost jobs, we should also take a look at upskilling or updating the training courses.  If there is such a low take-up of retraining, this raises serious questions as to what is on offer.  I am aware we must provide funding from the Exchequer for this training, but we have a significant opportunity to access this EGF funding and should avail of it.</P>
        <P>In 2009 when the Dell closure was announced, I was involved then in approaching the European Commissioner and seeking amendments to the rules in order that we could accommodate the Dell workers to qualify for retraining grants.  The Department and its officials have done a lot of work in achieving further amendments to accommodate the people who have lost their jobs in the construction industry.</P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>We appear to be in a situation where we may not be able to draw down a huge proportion of this funding, anything up to &euro;20 million, as I understand it.  Will the Minister of State clarify the current situation and set out exactly what we propose to do in the next two months to improve the situation in order to maximise the drawdown?  Is it worth taking on a major advertising programme to encourage people to enter the training process?  I ask that this be clarified.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  In June 2010 the Department submitted an application to the EU for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund,  co-financed assistance for almost 9,000 redundant construction workers.  The workers were made redundant between 1 July 2009 and 31 March 2010 and were individually identified as is required to meet the conditions of the fund.  This was done through either official data held on redundancy payments or from F&Aacute;S apprenticeship records.  The EU subsequently required this application to be divided into three separate applications covering specific industry sub-sectors.  This exercise, which involved a huge and complex exercise in data collation across a number of external bodies such as the Central Statistics Office and F&Aacute;S, resulted in the submission of three revised applications in February 2011.</P>
        <P>As the Senator knows, the EGF approval process is a lengthy one involving the EU budgetary authorities at Commission, Council and Parliament levels.  This resulted in the Irish applications not being finally approved until November 2011.  This left only six months for the completion of the EGF programme.  As I pointed out to Commissioner L&aacute;szl&oacute; Andor when he visited Ireland recently, a feature of the EGF process that is often criticised by member states is that the finite implementation period of 24 months commences upon submission of the application rather than upon its subsequent approval, when the member state finally can be assured that the EU money will be made available.</P>
        <P>This was a significant factor in these construction cases where very large amounts of money were at stake that would have otherwise fallen to the Irish Exchequer to cover had it ultimately been decided that the EU money would not be made available.  However, it is important to stress that Irish interventions have been taking place in support of EGF-eligible construction workers as far back as the first redundancies in July 2009.  Until the receipt of EU funding last December, these measures were funded exclusively through national resources.</P>
        <P>Since taking office, I have ensured that preparations to implement supports for these workers were accelerated and supports were ready to be provided as soon as possible after the EU decision was made.  My Department chaired an interdepartmental and agency steering group to speed up this process and put in place a dedicated EGF construction contact centre and technical support group to facilitate the redundant workers in accessing supports.  This dedicated contact centre is based in Limerick and mostly comprises staff who were involved in the delivery of the EGF programme for Dell workers.  Measures will continue to be delivered right up until the closure of the three EGF programmes on 9 June 2012.  These measures include career guidance, further education and training courses, apprenticeship progression, third level education programmes and enterprise supports.</P>
        <P>EGF funds of &euro;35.7 million were received by the Government on 29 December 2011.  My Department estimates that over &euro;20 million worth of nationally funded EGF interventions have already been provided for the commencement of at least 4,500 interventions in the areas of guidance, training, apprenticeship progression and third level courses.  Following the EU approval, letters of notification of a number of additional EGF services issued to 8,779 redundant construction workers on 19 December 2011.  These new services included tailored VEC career planning courses and EGF training grants, enabling the widest choice of non-State funded training and education opportunities to be availed of by the redundant workers, thus <Col N="93"/>giving the workers a huge degree of autonomy in using dedicated training grants to access training that they deemed necessary for their own careers advancement.</P>
        <P>Since this notification and up until 27 January 2012, the latest available data indicates, as Senator Burke pointed out, that an additional 452 eligible individuals accessed the services of the new EGF construction contact centre, which provides telephone and online information and supports access to professional career and occupational guidance.  A dedicated EGF website, <i>egf.ie</i>, also went live in December and provides further information on the EGF construction programmes as well as an online application process for the EGF training grant scheme.  By 27 January, it is estimated that some 275 persons had accessed or were in the process of accessing these new interventions.  The Irish authorities continue to encourage eligible redundant construction workers to avail of the wide array of EGF-related services available to them.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out the aim is not to simply maximise EU co-financing but to provide appropriate and tailored interventions to this cohort of redundant workers so as to maximise their re-employability.  I also want to point out that, since I assumed this ministry, I have initiated a review of our previous EGF applications across the Dell group, the SR Technics group and the Waterford Crystal group to find where we succeeded and, in areas where we certainly did not succeed, how we can best benefit from this EGF programme.  That review will be concluded shortly and we will use the information gleaned from it, and also from communicating with worker representatives across those three entities and trying to extract from them their experiences, both positive and negative, of how the funds have in the past been administered, to guide us in making future applications.  It is important to note that the first application under this Government will be for the TalkTalk workers in Waterford.  I hope the standard of that application and the level of research carried out before lodging the application will be such that it will make the guidance and training delivered much more meaningful and helpful for those seeking to access it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator also noted there was a need across the further education and training sectors to upskill or update the training courses we provide.  I concur wholeheartedly with that opinion.  That is exactly what we are setting out to do with Solas, which will ensure the training we are providing is up to the minute, responds to the needs of learners and trainees and also, perhaps more importantly, responds to the needs of the labour market and to industry in general.  We are and will be carrying out extensive research both nationally and at regional level as to where job opportunities and labour market shortages will arise.  We will be reorienting training and further education opportunities in order that they can respond in a meaningful manner to those labour market shortages and to the needs of the learners accessing both training and further education opportunities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.  As I understand it, he is suggesting that people can go outside the State-funded training organisations, such as the VEC, for courses, which I very much welcome.  In regard to the application that was made for the &euro;37.5 million, what is the total number of those who have completed training or are in training?  What is the likely level of funding we will have to refund and does this take into account the current figures?  The other issue I raised concerned whether there is a need for further highlighting of the programme in order that the maximum number of people can get on board.  The programme is related to people who were employed in companies.  What about the self-employed who no longer have work, such as sub-contractors?  Can they come under the programme?</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the Senator last question is that, no, unfortunately, they cannot.  The application was made for a very specific cohort of workers who were made redundant from a company and had a redundancy notice applied to them.  We could not have made an application on their behalf if we did not have that redundancy notice.</P><Col N="94"/>
        <P>Anybody who was previously involved in the construction sector continues to have the opportunity to access what are generally excellent upskilling and training programmes.  This will allow them to take their existing skills and reorient them somewhat in order to avail of opportunities arising in such areas as green energy, wind energy, the retrofitting of houses to make them more environmentally sustainable and so on.  Any former construction workers, irrespective of whether they are out of work for some time or have only recently been made redundant, can access these training programmes.</P>
        <P>We will not have the final figures for the numbers of interventions until we submit the final accounts for the scheme to the Commission, probably at the end of June.  In respect of any employee who was made redundant from this cohort of 9,000 people, we can claim back 65% of the cost of any intervention we provided for them in the past two years, since 2009.  This is because they are deemed to be applicants in the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund process.  Any interventions we provided for them can be funded from the &euro;35.7 million allocation.  The Department estimates that some &euro;20 million of this spend has already been allocated across this cohort.</P>
        <P>One of the greatest challenges facing apprentices made redundant from the construction sector in the past two years is that many of them had not achieved their final qualification.  Some were four fifths or five sixths of the way along the process, others even less.  We have allocated considerable resources to engaging with them in order to give them the opportunity to complete their apprenticeships and attain a formal qualification.  This will allow them to further their career in the State or perhaps seek work abroad.  We will not know the final figures for the numbers of interventions or the amount we have spent until the final accounts and administration work are completed in the summer.</P>
