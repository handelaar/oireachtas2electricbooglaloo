	<P>I have received notice from Senator Marie Moloney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to carry out works on Cullavaw River, Rathmore, County Kerry, to alleviate the ongoing flooding problem in the area and to advise on whether these works would be suitable to be carried out under the minor works scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jim Walsh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to make a statement on the need for Camp Liberty in Iraq to be recognised as a refugee camp under the United Nations flag and his willingness to pursue at EU level the resettlement of refugees from Camp Ashraf in Iraq to EU countries.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Whelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to clarify when her Department&rsquo;s review of the funding and operation of community employment schemes will be concluded and published.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to outline the reason it is currently not possible to extend six-month JobsBridge internships to nine-month placements which are provided for under the scheme in the case of public sector internships where there are further learning and project opportunities available to the intern.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Marie Moloney, Jim Walsh, John Whelan and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 2.30 p.m., No. 2, statements on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 4.30 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all Senators not to exceed six minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 4.20 p.m., No. 3, European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 4.30 p.m.; and No. 21, motion No. 10, Private Members&rsquo; business, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday Mr. Michael Cush, SC, commented on behalf of the Government that it had agreed there should be no ratification of the European Stability Mechanism Bill in the Houses until a judgment was made in Pringle <i>v</i>. Government of Ireland and Others.  The House will take Committee and Remaining Stages today.  Will the Leader ascertain when we will finalise the Bill or deal with motion for earlier signature?  On foot of Mr. Michael Cush&rsquo;s comments yesterday, I assume we will not be able to finalise it.  It would be greatly appreciated if the Leader would check what is the position.  While the Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the Bill, I would like to find out how the Houses are to proceed.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader request that Ministers provide copies of their speeches when they come before the House?  Yesterday, two Ministers failed to provide copies of their contributions.  As always, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, was good but he was more than halfway through his speech before copies were circulated.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste also arrived without copies of his contribution.  It is crucial that Senators are able to read Ministers&rsquo; speeches.  While I am not claiming Ministers are being discourteous, it shows courtesy to the House to provide Senators with a written document.  Ministers and their officials should be better prepared and copies of speeches should be circulated to all Senators in attendance.</P>
        <P>Yesterday was remarkable in that a press conference was held to announce another press conference.  This is a first for the Government, although it has many firsts in other areas.  On legislation as important as the personal insolvency Bill, the only information we could elicit from the T&aacute;naiste was that it was a &ldquo;mammoth&rdquo; Bill and the Taoiseach said nothing more than that the text was 200 pages long.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a woolly mammoth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Most people will agree that the press conference was about trying to show the Government is solid, together and apparently speaking with one voice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>It is speaking with one voice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should note I used the word &ldquo;apparently&rdquo;.  The T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach did not say anything about the personal insolvency Bill.  On Friday, a troika of Ministers will appear at a second press conference at which they will detail to the world and its mother the contents of the Bill.  Yesterday&rsquo;s press conference was a stunt and a waste of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s and T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s time.  More important, when this crucial Bill is published, I ask the Leader to arrange, through his good offices, a briefing for all Senators similar to that which was provided prior to the referendum.  I suggest it be held in the audiovisual room.  Having not seen the Bill, I hope it will do what the Government promised it will do.  Senator will need time to study the text, and in that regard, I reiterate the commitment I gave yesterday.  This is urgent legislation and if that means we must facilitate sitting beyond 19 July to pass it, my party will do so.  I am a little concerned at remarks indicating that the Bill will not be dealt with until October.  We cannot wait that long.  I ask the Leader to be constructive in this regard by ascertaining whether the Library and Research Service will arrange a briefing at an appropriate time in order that Senators can find out what is in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the imminent publication of the personal insolvency Bill on which it would be a good idea to receive a briefing.  If a briefing is provided for Senators, I ask that we are circulated a copy of the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the personal insolvency legislation.  The report made a number of recommendations and includes a full transcript of our hearings with stakeholders and interested parties.  It would inform our debate on the Bill.</P>
        <P>I welcome the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to cover children detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  Senator van Turnhout raised this matter yesterday.  This is a welcome and long overdue development for which the Irish Penal Reform Trust and international children&rsquo;s rights bodies have called for some years.  I also welcome the Government&rsquo;s announcement, which was also long overdue, that it will end the imprisonment of children in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a specific debate with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the regulation of advertising.  I have raised previously the difficulty with making complaints about advertising on Facebook and other social media, in particular, concerning various nightclubs in Dublin which have placed grossly offensive and sexist advertisements.  While Facebook has removed these advertisements on most occasions that it has been requested to do so, those seeking to complain to the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, ASAI, were informed that social media are outside the remit of the ASAI.  I have asked that the Minister come before the House to address this issue and I have also communicated with him directly on the issue.</P>
        <P>The need for a debate has become more pressing, however, as a result of a billboard campaign being run by Youth Defence, an organisation to which I am loath to give publicity.  I, and I am sure other Senators, have received numerous complaints about the campaign from individuals who believe the advertisements in question are offensive, misleading and amount to false advertising.  The advertisements concern abortion and feature a caption which reads &ldquo;Abortion tears her life apart&rdquo;.  They depict a foetus at more than 18 weeks, although 89% of abortions take place before 13 weeks.  The advertisements are grossly offensive and Senator Mullen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an advertising standards authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator would allow me to finish, I agree with Senator Mullen&rsquo;s comment yesterday that abortion is a difficult and sensitive issue.  It is not an appropriate subject for billboard campaigns.  When complaints are made about the campaign to the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, complainants are informed that the issue is outside its remit because the organisation behind the advertisements is non-commercial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the end of the matter then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Similarly, the National Consumer Agency and ComReg have indicated the matter is outside their remit.  I ask for a debate on the role of the ASAI, the route for making complaints about advertising of this nature and advertising on social media.  We must consider extending the remit of the ASAI to provide an accessible forum to which citizens may make complaints about advertisements of the nature I have described.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw Senators&rsquo; attention to the lengthy Private Members&rsquo; motion on the national cultural institutions to be moved this evening by a group of Independent Senators and to which the Government has drafted a lengthy amendment.  While I have no doubt the debate will be robust, Independent Senators are still seeking cross-party support for the motion.</P>
        <P>This week, the capital will celebrate the annual Dublin LGBTQ Pride Festival, a celebration of pride in one&rsquo;s human identity that will culminate in a parade through the city.  This time, the parade will make its way past the gates of Leinster House, having always passed City Hall on previous occasions.  Passing Leinster House is a big deal for members of the community and all Senators are welcome to join us.  Last year, the parade was attended by more than 25,000 people and watched by more than 100,000 people, making it second only in size to the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade.</P>
        <P>I have a couple of questions to the Leader in this regard.  Transgender people and their families will take part in this week&rsquo;s celebrations, yet their identities are still not legally recognised by the State.  Dr. Lydia Foy started her legal case to have her gender recognised 15 years ago and is still waiting for recognition.  Ten years ago, the European Court of Human Rights made clear in a case against Britain that transgender people have a legal right to be recognised and it is nearly five years since the High Court held that Lydia Foy&rsquo;s rights under the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated.  The Government announced some months ago that it will pay compensation to Dr. Foy.  This will be the first compensation claim to be made under the European Convention of Human Rights Act passed in 2003.  Will the Leader investigate whether progress has been made in advancing this claim?</P>
        <P>The gender recognition advisory group, which was established more than one year ago to advise the Government on legislating for gender recognition, produced recommendations almost a year ago.  We are still waiting for the heads of a Bill to be produced on foot of these recommendations, which include a particularly contestable recommendation that refers to the forcing of married transgender people to divorce before they can have their legal gender recognised.  I met two such couples recently who want to stay together as families.  Why should a loving couple be forced to divorce?  Does a State, which was constitutionally opposed to divorce until 1996, want to legislate for forced divorce for a minority group which experiences ongoing discrimination in many other ways?  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Social Protection come before the House for a debate on the progress of gender recognition legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question which crosses two Departments.  On the revaluation of rates, the introduction of a property tax next year will ensure local authorities have a larger rate base and allow them to share the rates burden among everybody.  I ask that the revaluation of business premises commence immediately.  While several local authorities in the Dublin area have completed revaluation exercises, they are needed nationwide because the valuation of properties is wrong in some cases.  This must be fast-tracked and I believe it may be the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  </P>
        <P>My next request may fall within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  It is that legislation be introduced to the Oireachtas to give county managers and elected representatives of local authorities greater discretion in respect of rates.  In a case in which a business venture goes out of business and a rates bill for the premises is owed to the local authority, were someone else to take over the premises, the bill would remain to be paid, which is unfair.  These are unprecedented times in which so many people are unemployed and any assistance that could be provided towards job creation should be considered.  If the renting of a property would help to create one job, that should be done.  This is an immediate measure that must be put in place through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  County managers and elected representatives should be given powers to change the law on rates because it is not right that they remain to be paid on a premises even where a venture has gone out of business.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, I remind rural Members present that the septic tank legislation has been passed and they should not forget to register by 28 September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Delighted to hear it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to have back the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should note I was only reminding rural Members.  In addition, however&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this a question or a lecture for Members on the other side?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien mentioned the wasting of the time of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to have back the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  I do not know where he was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s time is up and he should, please, conclude.  There should be no interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  I was being interrupted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the Senator was inviting interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I note three Ministers will speak next week about the insolvency Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>He has gone fishing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>At least, the Government is transparent about coming out to meet the people.  Members on this side remember the famous incident in which two Ministers stated no IMF or ECB representatives were coming into the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Senator has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is letting people know what the message is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his statement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Members have learned today how the Government has breached the official pay level it set last year for the starting salary of the chief executive of VHI and has done so dramatically.  They also have learned that very few civil servants have forgone increments and they spoke yesterday about what the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, had had to say on the subject of increments.  At the same time, I found in my post box today a piece in the <i>Northside People</i> about my local special school, St. Ciaran&rsquo;s, Ballygall, which must cater for some pupils who require nappy changing, PEG feeding and the administration of medication.  The principal of the school, Ms Valerie Monaghan, is reported as stating the school is down two SNAs, from 13 to 11, and believes it is being reviewed and assessed as a mainstream school in respect of its SNA allocation, even though each child has additional needs.  These two items are in stark contrast to each other.  I refer to the lack of awareness of the need for frugal treatment of the public finances in the setting of pay levels and in the treatment of pay scales, while at the same time, the most vulnerable suffer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ivana Bacik quoted my remarks about abortion being a difficult and sensitive issue in support of her call for a debate with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I, of course, agree there should be such a debate.  I always have had grave reservations about images of aborted babies being used as part of abortion-related campaigns because they have a desensitising effect.  However, there are controlled circumstances in which RTE and others should not be afraid to advise people that they intend to show them such images as part of public education programmes.  One should not censor the reality of abortion.  However, as far as the posters to which Senator Ivana Bacik refers are concerned, I can see nothing wrong with them and would be very worried about a censorious attitude being taken to public advertising that gets to a core reality.  I remind the Senator that stating &ldquo;Abortion tears her life apart&rdquo; may not necessarily simply be referring to the child who, of course, dies.  However, there has been a deafening silence among abortion proponents in recent years about the growing knowledge of the possibility of adverse mental health effects of abortion on women.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There comes a time when a searching public debate is needed.  I am a little concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should avoid making points he will make in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude on this point.  I am a little concerned that members of the Labour Party believe they have their tails up in respect of the legalisation on abortion in Ireland.  Some of them regard the expert group as the ready-up they need to foist it on more unwilling colleagues in government.  However, on this issue I can state&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to phrases such as &ldquo;tails up&rdquo; and &ldquo;ready-up&rdquo;.  Is this the civilised debate we will have?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; an t-am istigh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Any attempt to legalise abortion in this country will cause massive controversy because this is the signal human rights issue of our time.  Ireland has been a beacon for other countries in the manner in which its medical care for women has been top-notch, while also protecting the life of the unborn.  It is more of these posters that will be needed, not fewer, if that is what it will take to get across the reality to some elements in government that abortion takes an innocent human life&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s point is well made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik, on a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, is the Senator suggesting this is a matter that is appropriate to be debated on billboards?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>How is that a point of order?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen suggesting citizens should not have a right of complaint?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator does not like reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect, Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen is one minute over time.  I have been indulgent and ask him to conclude, without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>While Senator Ivana Bacik, of course, is entitled to interrupt, Members must not be afraid to engage in a factual, courteous debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On billboards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, billboards.  Particularly when a Government is taking a censorious approach and perhaps doing things behind the scenes to advance a certain political agenda, one cannot deprive citizens of their right to communicate core ideals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s point is overstated and he is over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I remind Senator Ivana Bacik that all Members are subject to the obligation of truthfulness.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the imminent publication of the personal insolvency Bill.  While all Members are frustrated by the length of time it has taken to introduce it, it is preferable that the Government has spent the time to get it right.  Moreover, if it is necessary for the Seanad to sit from Monday to Friday for some time to bring the legislation through the House, all Members would be prepared to so do.  Just before I came into the Chamber, I received a telephone call from a person who was about to be put out of the family home, who the bank literally had by the throat and who, most likely, would not have a home in a couple of months&rsquo; time.  Consequently, this legislation is critical and I applaud the Government for spending the time to get it right.  All Members want to see it done properly and wish to spend the appropriate time in debating it.</P>
        <P>I also agree that comprehensive briefings on this matter are relevant and necessary.  I support proposals that a copy of the set of recommendations of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, on which it spent a great deal of time deliberating to propose recommendations in respect of the personal insolvency Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that there is a need to examine the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, ASAI, because the use of social media is now a predominant means of advertising.  I suggest a charter of people&rsquo;s rights in respect of social media is required.  Approximately 900 million people use Facebook, more than 1 million of whom live in Ireland.  This constitutes an enormous number of people who are using what essentially is an unrelated medium.  There is some appalling advertising through Facebook and while the company, in fairness to it, probably reacts to some of the unsavoury elements of the advertising, society and the Government have a responsibility to try to regulate it because there is nothing as bad as a lack of regulation, as has been evident in the past.  Consequently, I support the call for a debate on extending the remit of the ASAI.</P>

	<P>I am not wandering anywhere.  I am making a point about a court case that took place in Waterford a few weeks ago, where a former Fine Gael town councillor was found guilty of corruption in respect of a planning and rezoning issue in the county.  It is important to have an independent, thorough investigation into what happened in County Waterford.  It is also important that we move beyond those investigations, because the Mahon report looked at this and many other issues around the State.  It made a number of clear recommendations, including the need for an independent planning regulator who will be free from political pressures.  That needs to happen as soon as possible.  I call for a full and proper debate on the planning system in this country, on political corruption, which is still evident, and the need for full investigations on issues in respect of Waterford and other counties.  We also need to debate the need to implement the findings of the Mahon tribunal.</P>

	<P>I normally agree with much of what is said by the previous speaker, but on this occasion I think he doth protest too much on the question of Oireachtas salaries and expenses.  To provide clarification and to put an end to the circus of some people attempting to be holier than holy, I repeat the request I made in the House some months ago that the Minister for Finance write to each Member asking if he or she wishes to receive his or her full salary.  If Members do not wish to receive their full salary, the balance should simply remain with the Exchequer.  This would put an end to the circus of people pretending they are living on &ldquo;X&rdquo; amount, even though they are in receipt of a much greater salary and using the balance for party purposes.</P>

	<P>Prior to the intervention of the previous speaker, I wanted to comment briefly on the debate begun by Senators Bacik and Mullen on the abortion issue.  Perhaps I am moving in the wrong social circles, but I have not yet received any complaints on the advertising.  I appreciate that abortion is a sensitive subject, but that does not mean we can ignore the reality of what the subject is all about.  At some stage, we will have a substantive debate on the matter here, perhaps in the autumn, and we cave the broader arguments until then.  Language is important and one of the tragic lessons of history which we learned in the 1930s and 1940s in Europe is that people have debased language and changed words to remove reality from the public.  We do not debate the subject of abortion, but what is called the termination of pregnancy.  That kind of debasing of the language does not help.  Anything which forces us to recognise the reality of abortion and concentrate on the alternatives is helpful rather than a hindrance.  It may be uncomfortable, but that does not mean it is wrong.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent months we heard a story from China which concerned the forced abortion of a seventh month old baby.  This was done to comply with the law of the state.  The story outraged the world and the people who brought that story to the world was the family of the woman and child in question.  We salute that family from a human rights point of view, but the story has taken an unusual turn in the past couple of days.  The family has had to go into hiding because they have been branded as unpatriotic for having spoken to the media.  I hope we do not find ourselves in a similar position.  I believe the majority of people in this State oppose abortion and I would not like to think that for some whim, we intend censoring those anti-abortion activists.</P>

	<P>As I came out of Croke Park following the International Eucharistic Congress, I saw an army of young people handing out anti-abortion leaflets.  My reaction was that it is the only way they are going to get their message across, because I do not find them succeeding in getting their message across in the media.  I was also delighted that it was young people doing this work, and there were no tired and weary images which we sometimes see shown on television when an anti-abortion issue is raised.  I hope this House, the status we enjoy and the power that goes with the Oireachtas, will not be marshalled to prevent the voice being heard of those who are anti-abortion.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste on the recent announcement on the personal insolvency Bill.  The Government has been true to its promises of action on mortgage debt.  A series of other measures to assist those in mortgage difficulty has been also agreed.  Fundamental to our strategy is a radical overhaul of Ireland&rsquo;s regime of personal debt insolvency.  The Government has met with the main banks to brief them and to discuss their approach to mortgage arrears, and this is to be welcomed.  The Government is also fulfilling its commitments and responsibilities to develop new options for those people in debt distress.  The banks must play their part to resolve this crisis, as they were mainly responsible for it.</P>

Deputy Chief Constable Gillespie took part in the L&iacute;ofa programme, which is being sponsored by the Department of Culture.  This is a major achievement and shows that the native language is growing in Northern Ireland.  I congratulate her and her staff and associates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>My attention was drawn some years ago to the very large number of road deaths occurring in Ireland.  I am delighted to say the number has decreased dramatically in the past ten years.  My attention was also drawn recently to the European Commission website on road safety and its section on travelling abroad reminds people travelling to different parts of Europe to stay within the law.  There are different laws aimed at road safety throughout Europe  It is interesting to note our laws in that regard.  We are not obliged to have a first aid kit, a florescent jacket, a warning triangle or a fire extinguisher in a car.  Those are mandatory in a number of other European countries, while other countries are taking steps towards that goal.  These are comparatively easy steps to take.  It is dramatic when a person&rsquo;s car breaks down, be it in the mud, the snow or at night time, and we hear of the horror of death caused by other cars that hit people when they are trying to repair a breakdown.  We can do something about this.  It has been proposed in the past, but the Minister has not moved on it yet.  I believe it would be very simple to introduce such a measure.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, there was an item on the radio about motorcycle helmets, which are classified in Ireland as luxury products and attract the highest rate of VAT, whereas in the United Kingdom, they are zero rated for VAT.  As well as encouraging people to wear a helmet, it seems a simple step to take to focus attention on road safety and bring it to a higher level.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I support the call by my colleague, Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill, on the issue of rates.  I raised this a number of months ago.  We are contacted regularly by people who have businesses, especially those who own a small rural pub and may not open their premises except for a couple of hours at night to serve the one or two customers who call in to them.  They must pay for the significant rates levied on businesses.  It is appropriate we would have a debate and give the local authorities the flexibility to vary the rates for those who are not making the income they were making in the past.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question for the Leader.  When will the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, the Minister who disappeared for two months, come to the House to discuss the septic tank regulations under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012?  He reappeared yesterday at the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, looking well rested and tanned, where he announced that people could register their septic tanks over the next three months.  He has refused to outline the criteria for upgrading a septic tank and has ruled out the option of providing grant aid.  On the one hand he is telling people to register the septic tank but he is not telling them what they are registering for.  It is a pig in a poke.  I ask the Leader to consider having a general discussion on the guidelines for septic tanks pursuant to the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.  Following the debate on that Bill, we had public consultation.  I am aware that many groups who made submissions under the public consultation process did not even receive an acknowledgment of their submissions.  Will the Leader clarify whether he will invite the Minister to the House next week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>

As the matter is before the court today, one may not comment.  I remind Senator Cullinane that in the same week the gentleman in question was found guilty, some Sinn F&eacute;in councillors were convicted of murder in Northern Ireland.  I think Senator Cullinane should kick the memory buds into operation for even more heinous crimes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise the subject of anaerobic digestion for consideration.  Compared with other jurisdictions, in particular Germany and Austria, which produce 15% of their electricity requirement from anaerobic digestion, this State has no such plants.  The energy produced is sold for a similar price to offshore wind energy.  It is more expensive than normal and it is considered to be too expensive at present.  With the price of fuels spiking worldwide, whether gas or crude oil, we must remember that, down the line, anaerobic digestion will be a legitimate industry for this State.  I am concerned nothing is happening at present because if we can achieve that type of electricity generation from anaerobic digestion plants, it will be a significant benefit.  There is also the benefit of getting people back to work in the construction sector.  Thousands of jobs would become available if these plants were to be built.  These jobs would be easily accessible and would be positive for the environment.  I would appreciate the Leader requesting the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to come before the House to discuss this important matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen&rsquo;s honeyed words put me in mind of the fact that in recent days the Vatican has appointed the Rome correspondent of Fox News, who is also a member of Opus Dei, as their chief spin doctor.  I welcome a debate but I remind the House that coating poison with honey does not make it any more palatable.</P>
        <P>In his very thoughtful speech, Senator Bradford said that the control of language is highly significant in this issue.  I am horrified that people should still peddle the idea that some people are pro-abortion or their tails are up and all this kind of stuff.  I am not pro-abortion and I strongly object to anybody taking over the label &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo;.  I am pro-life.  There are only a few people, like Pol Pot and the rest of them, who are not pro-life.  I notice another little seepage in language where people, such as those in the Iona Institute, describe themselves as pro-family.  It may come as a surprise that I emerged from a human family and I am pro-family.  I am not apologising to anybody about it.  I publicly condemned what occurred in China, and while I applauded the Chinese Government for facing the fact the world population is an explosive situation, the woman in question was violated and that is a different matter.  I am pro-choice because I think there are certain circumstances such as the rape of a 14 year old girl&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am asking for a reasoned debate where people&rsquo;s experience is allowed to be placed on the record without the kind of bullying and colonisation of language that has occurred so lamentably previously.  There is a great difference between what has been allowed already under our Constitution and the taking by force of a woman who is seven months pregnant and forcibly aborting the child in her womb.  It is appalling, it is a gross violation and I stand against it.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a reasoned debate, and I hope it will be so.  We may need to have a session somewhere else, in the audiovisual room or some other place &mdash; we did this when discussing AIDS &mdash; in order that we avoid the type of bitterness that goes on.  I think that would be very useful.  We have good debates in this House.  We have a proud record, and as we speak, a Bill from this House initiated by Senator Feargal Quinn, which is very important is going through the other House.  Today the newspapers are full of Dr. Crown&rsquo;s intervention where children will be protected from smoking.  The other House is doing a lot of things that people feel are damaging them.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann is promoting the interests of decent ordinary people.  I think we need to send this message out.</P>
        <P>With regard to cancer, I was very interested in the submissions by Senator Crown and his briefing where he made the point that diesel fumes are incredibly toxic.  I walked down O&rsquo;Connell Street today and I could hardly breathe because of the gush of diesel fumes from buses, public service vehicles, especially the tourist buses.  The last time I asked about this, I was told these buses are not subject to any kind of vehicle test.  They should be.  Will the Leader bring this to the Minister&rsquo;s attention with a view to ensuring the buses that create this level of pollution and other vehicles such as large lorries should be subject to a test in order that they do not poison our populace?</P>

Last week, I raised the issue of the septic tanks and at the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, of which I am a member, and the Minister responded to it.

	<P>My question for the Leader is on the use of fire brigades, especially in rural Ireland, where firemen are retained.  I have dealt with the issue for a number of years but there has been another instance in recent weeks.  There was a fire on somebody&rsquo;s premises or land and a good samaritan rang the local fire brigade or 999.  The fire brigade put out the fire and the owner of the land or premises, who did not contact the fire brigade, was billed.  I have approached the authorities about the matter and been told they are constrained by legislation and must bill somebody.  A number of years ago, a dairy farmer I know left his farm to visit his mother in hospital.  Three days later he discovered the fire brigade had been on his land to put out a fire and he was given a bill for &euro;1,300.  The farmer did not even know there had been a fire.  I ask the Leader to seek clarity from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the issue.  There must be a case made that people who do not cause a fire are not liable for a bill supplied by a local authority&rsquo;s retained firemen.  I ask for clarity from the Minister on the matter.

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I, along with other Members, ask for a debate on the personal insolvency Bill next week.  It seems ridiculous in the extreme that we must continue to wait.  We have already waited for many years, and I include the years when I was on the Government side of the House when proposals were also made.  Many proposals have been made and Bills introduced since I have been on the Opposition side of the House.  It is almost 11 months to the day since the Family Home Bill was debated in this Chamber.  If my constituency colleagues had voted for it then, it would been enacted into law and something would have been done to alleviate the plight of people in mortgage arrears.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has pointed out, rightly, that the banks were the only people to have been consulted on the issue, which makes no sense.  We might ask them for a submission, but to invite them in here and give them a private briefing before the rest of us is ridiculous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>True.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is similar to showing a burglar the blueprints for an alarm system before it is installed.  I call for a debate, even if the Bill is mammoth in size and consists of 200 pages.  The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste quite comically wasted public time by holding a press conference to display their unity rather than highlighting the importance of the mortgage issue.  This House has the capacity and must put the interests of the people front and centre, to coin a phrase regularly used by the Taoiseach when in opposition, and debate the Bill, make worthwhile suggestions and make it law.  As I have often said, I fear that Senator Barrett is on the back stairs of the Department of Finance with the bankers.  My fear is alive and well.  As we saw yet again yesterday, we will have a bankers&rsquo; solution for the bankers with the people playing mere spectators.  I would like to see real legislation and real change that puts the people first, not the banks and their bottom lines.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I do not mix in the right social circles either or travel through the wrong railway stations.  Perhaps it is simply my macular oedema but I have not seen the so-called offensive advertisements yet and neither, as Senator Norris will know well, am I going to bully, try to bully or try to colonise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator and I appreciate his comment.  Like the rest of the Senators I find abortion abhorrent.  Like the rest of the Members, I condemn forced abortions in China and wherever else they take place.  We are all anti killing and the taking of life, so I would expect, as has been said in the Chamber, that any debate on the subject would be reasonable and rational.  Personally, I recognise life as being from conception until natural death and we are all capable of being quite rational when expressing our views on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, want to refer to the item raised by Senator Bacik, which has two component parts.  First, the billboard campaign and her efforts in censoring them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Not censoring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very liberal for anybody to suggest that.  Whether I agree with the structure of the billboards or not, I defend the right to have them.  It is interesting that those who oppose it will be on the other side of the argument.</P>
        <P>I listened to the debate and Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; rightly mentioned forced abortion.  Many people in the House have paid tribute to Chen Guangcheng for his strong position on the matter that led to his incarceration in China and subsequent high profile release.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of pro-choice or pro-abortion, people on the pro-choice, pro-abortion side will be aware of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.  It has been detected recently in Texas, and perhaps in a couple of other states, that people who classify themselves under the umbrella of pro-choice have encouraged young pregnant girls to have an abortion because the young girls already had daughters but now wanted sons.  Effectively, we are promoting gendercide.  I do not know where anybody stands on the subject.  I was appalled by the images of the Holocaust where dead emaciated bodies were scattered around, and I am sure everybody in this House was revolted by them.  I have also seen images of abortions with dead babies, their arms and legs torn apart and left to die in buckets and all sorts of boxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not having that debate today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In my opinion those images are equally abhorrent.  I ask anybody that is pro-abortion or pro-choice to explain the difference to me and whether it is moral or ethical.</P>
        <P>There were changes made at a very late stage to the composition of the expert group that has raised serious suspicions and we need to debate this important issue in the House.  There are well-known abortion advocates on the expert group and, therefore, anybody of a pro-life disposition would have serious concerns.  The Minister for Health&rsquo;s comment in the D&aacute;il on the Clare Daly Bill would have exaggerated those concerns.  I ask for a reasoned, rational debate in the House, but one with honest language, not subterfuge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Some Members tend to hide behind subterfuge.  Let us call it abortion and not pro-choice because that is exactly what it is.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>The people want to protect water quality and public health.  We have in place a system that will do that and which will meet our obligations under the European Court of Justice ruling of 2009, an issue with which the previous Government failed to deal.  It is time to move on, to allow the work continue and for people to register.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn made some interesting observations on road safety, a matter which is of concern to every Member.  While the number of fatalities has reduced significantly in recent years, there was a worrying increase during the month of June.  I hope this trend will not continue.  An initiative has been brought to my attention by a number of constituents recently in regard to our roads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is an issue on which we could have a discussion with the Minister.  It concerns the number of oil spillages on roads and leakages from trucks which can cause very serious accidents.  Due to the difficult economic situation for hauliers, perhaps the same investment is not being made in maintaining the quality of vehicles.  It is an issue about which we must be concerned given the volume of large vehicles on the roads.  Anybody who has had an incident with an oil spillage will be aware of the catastrophic consequences.  There is a need to keep the issue of road safety high on the agenda.  This issue deserves attention.  Local authorities would have good information on the number of times they have to clean up following oil spillages.  We should not lose sight of the issue because of the potential catastrophic consequences for citizens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader when the review of the community employment schemes will be published.  Perhaps he would give the date of publication.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I join Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill and Senator Michael Comiskey in calling for a debate on local authority rates.  This is a significant issue, especially for small businesses, and is causing enormous hardship for many.  I am aware of a case where the rates on a premises in a county town amount to &euro;15,000.  The premises has recently been leased.  Before the person opens the door a bill of &euro;15,000 is due to the local authority.  This is a scandal in the current economic climate.  I ask the Leader to arrange for an urgent debate with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on the rates issue.  I welcome him back, having witnessed him walking around the House on a number of occasions yesterday.  As my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, said, he looks well.  Perhaps I should request Senator Landy to ask him to come to the House because he appears to have more luck with him than the Leader.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the local government reforms he proposes to introduce early next year.  He owes it to the House to give us an opportunity to debate local government reform.  While he ignores the House and the views of elected councillors, perhaps he would do us the courtesy of coming to the House.  I ask the Leader and Senator Landy to speak to the Minister and invite him to come to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on local authority rates, an issue I have raised on numerous occasions.  It is time we had a look at the rates being charged to small businesses.  In the North there is a rates holiday for those wishing to set up a new business.  This is the type of idea we should take on board.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on how the medical referees in the Department of Social Protection assess applications for invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance and, particularly, domiciliary care allowance.  I have said consistently that it is obvious there is a change of tack in the way cases are evaluated now as distinct from the past.  I listened to the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, on the radio recently speak about the same issue.  She expressed serious concerns about what she has seen &mdash; exactly the issues I have raised.  She made the point that in the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance, if one seeks an oral hearing, it is not the person cared for who is assessed but the carer who is asked to evaluate whether the person cared for needs to be cared for.  The Ombudsman also expressed concern about the domiciliary care allowance where people had been in receipt of the allowance for their children and, while nothing had changed medically with the children, it was decided to withdraw the allowance.  The Ombudsman has overturned many of these cases.  If 50% of appeals for social welfare are overturned on medical grounds, then 50% of them were incorrectly diagnosed by the medical referees.  I call on the Leader for a debate on the way medical referees do their business in the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Moloney.  Three slots were passed because no Labour Party Senator was present.  The Senator looked anxious.  She may have thought I was discriminating against her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Chair had forgotten about me.  I am sure all Senators are aware of the Jigsaw project and the Jigsaw network.  Today young people appear to have much to deal with, such as study, work, friends and family relationships, drugs and alcohol, and it all gets on top of them.  If they need immediate help in my area, Jigsaw Kerry is one of the places to which they go.  The Jigsaw project aims to ensure young people&rsquo;s voices are heard and that they get the right help where and when they need it.  Jigsaw Kerry forms part of a network of Jigsaw projects delivering tailored community-based supports for young people&rsquo;s mental health needs.  We are all aware that good support can help offset the isolation and stigma associated with mental health issues.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister with responsibility for mental health come to the House specifically to debate youth mental health, in light of the fact that, today, Killarney is coming to terms with the untimely death of a young teenager, to whose family I extend sincere sympathy.  There is a need for a debate specifically on youth mental health.  The Jigsaw project, which is a three year pilot in a number of areas, must continue to be funded.  I have written to Dr. Tony Bates of Headstrong asking that funding continue.  As a Government we must ensure funding is in place for Headstrong to go on the Jigsaw projects.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to come to the House for an open debate on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Senator Moloney, in calling for a debate on youth mental health.  Perhaps we could have it before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Recent reports have highlighted that 1,311 retired teachers were employed as supervisors at the State examinations.  This alarming number is up from 1,147 retired teachers who were employed last year, an increase of 13%.  It is inequitable and highly unsatisfactory that retired teachers are being rehired to supervise examinations when thousands of graduates are being forced to emigrate because they are unable to get work.  In comparison with the high number of retired teachers employed for supervision this year, only 742 unemployed and substitute teachers were employed.  I call on the Minister to cease this practice and ensure young graduates, substitute teachers and unemployed teachers get first preference when supervisors for State examinations are being hired.</P>
        <P>I have raised continually throughout the year the issue of the employment of unqualified teachers and the urgent need to hold on to our valuable graduates, if at all possible.  In the past year, 700 graduate teachers have gone to Abu Dhabi.  Since February of this year, 321 retired teachers have been re-employed by schools, 186 in primary schools and 147 at second level.  We need to provide every opportunity for our graduates to work in Ireland.  To that end, we must put a structured system in place.  I propose we reintroduce the practice of maintaining a panel of suitably qualified teachers who would be available to work at short notice.  This would be preferable to the practice of hiring non-qualified or retired teachers when suitably qualified teachers are available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, raised the case taken by Deputy Thomas Pringle.  While I do not wish to comment on matters before the courts, I understand Mr. Michael Cush, counsel for the State, told the court yesterday there would be no Executive action before Ms Justice Laffoy gives her ruling on that case.  My understanding of that is that the instrument of ratification of the treaty will not be lodged with the EU by Ireland before that time.  However, there is no impediment on the House dealing with Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill today.</P>
        <P>I note Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s point regarding Ministers&rsquo; scripts.  Ministers have been informed that they should provide a script for Members when speaking in the Seanad.  Some Ministers prefer to speak from notes, as opposed to using a script.  We have asked that those notes be made available to Members.  My office has raised this matter with Ministers over a period of time.  I understand what Senator O&rsquo;Brien has said on the matter.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators referred to the personal insolvency Bill.  I understand the Bill will be published as a D&aacute;il Bill and will go to the D&aacute;il first.  It is a matter for that House to order its business and decide when the Bill will be taken.  However, if the Opposition wished to have this raised at an early stage, I am sure the Government would be amenable to those requests.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik said the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on personal insolvency legislation should be circulated.  The heads of the Bill were discussed for days on end by the joint committee, long before it was discussed with the banks.  The report of the joint committee should be examined.  It is incumbent on Senators to inform themselves of the proceedings of the committee hearings.  I will, if possible, arrange a briefing by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, similar to that held before the referendum.  I will contact the Library and Research Service to arrange that briefing for Members.  It would be very informative.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised the matter of advertising and billboards, which gave rise to a debate on the pros and cons of abortion.  Abortion, as has been stated, is a sensitive subject.  When the House holds a debate on abortion, I hope it will be devoid of bitterness and division.  I hope that will be the case.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Zappone&rsquo;s comments on the LGBTQ parade.  The Senator&rsquo;s question regarding Dr. Lydia Foy might best be dealt with as an Adjournment matter.  In that way, Senator Zappone may be given the information she requires.  I will endeavour to find out the progress of gender equality legislation from the Minister for Social Protection, as the Senator requested.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Neill, Comiskey, Wilson, Kelly and Conway raised the matter of the valuation of business properties and rates.  Senator Comiskey suggested that more discretion should be allowed to city and county managers or to local representatives with regard to rates on properties.  This is a serious situation.  A new tenant can be liable for rates owed on a property.  This is inhibiting business.  Members have raised the issue and it should be addressed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Minister is aware of the problem and I hope we will see action to help people to start up a small business without having this millstone around their necks.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen made some points about increments, which I addressed on a previous occasion.  Senator Cullinane called for a debate on planning.  The House has had several debates on planning, but if it is necessary to have another I will arrange that.</P>
        <P>Senator Brennan congratulated the Deputy Chief Constable of the PSNI who received 96% in her Irish examination and has been awarded a silver f&aacute;inne.  As the House debates Bille na Gaeltachta, it is good to note that some members of the PSNI are fluent in Irish.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn made valid points about road safety and Ireland&rsquo;s lack of conformity with safety regulations that apply in other EU countries.  I received notice yesterday that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, has begun a public consultation on the new road safety strategy for the period 2013 to 2020.  A public consultation document and questionnaire on the various education, engineering, enforcement and evaluation measures which have and have not worked is available on the RSA website, and submissions may be made online to <i>strategy@rsa.ie</i>.  It is apt that Senator Quinn raised those points today.  The vehicle, if Senators will pardon the pun, to make those submissions to the RSA is available.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government come to the House to discuss the Water Services (Amendment) Act.  I am sure Senators have seen plenty of the Minister.  We had more than 24 hours of debate on that legislation.  If Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill does not have all the answers at this stage, I do not know what I can say.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy referred to anaerobic digestion.  The points he raised could be made to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, who will be in the House later today.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris&rsquo;s points regarding buses and trucks could be made in a submission to the RSA.  It is my understanding that trucks, in particular, are subject to tests.  I was in that business at one time and I know that trucks are subject to stringent annual tests.  I would think buses are subject to similar tests.  In any event, submissions may be made to the RSA on that subject.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Leader respond to my suggestion about a debate on abortion?  Could we have a discussion in the audiovisual room to prepare for the debate, so that it is the kind of debate the Leader wants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not arrange a discussion as several discussions have been organised in the AV room by various Members on various sides.  I have enough to do to arrange a debate in the House.  I fully agree with Senator Norris that we should have a reasonable debate devoid of bitterness and division.  That is all I wish to say on the subject at this point.</P>
        <P>Senator Landy referred to billing for fire brigade charges for those who do not call out the service.  We will raise the matter with the Minister and try to get another result for him from the Minister on the matter.  Senator Landy seems to be so successful himself that I am inclined to leave it to him.</P>
        <P>Senator Mac Sharry raised the issue of the insolvency Bill.  I have said the heads of the Bill have been discussed at length by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  All Members should inform themselves of the contents of the hearings.  Senator Mullins spoke about the maintenance of trucks and oil spillages.  I dealt with that in my reply to Senator Quinn and Senator Norris.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson inquired about the review of community employment schemes.  I will endeavour to find out when the review will be published and I will revert to the Senator on it.  On local government reform, I am sure that when the Cabinet has discussed it we can have a debate in the House on the matter.  Despite what has been said about the absence of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, for the past two months, he has probably been in this House more often than any other Minister on many subjects and pieces of legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly referred to medical referees and the fact that 50% of the appeals are overturned.  We can make those points to the Minister when he comes to the House.  Senator Moloney mentioned the Jigsaw programme.  Senator Moran also called for a debate on youth mental health.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has been most active in that regard.  She has come to the House on several occasions to discuss the matter.  If necessary, I am sure she will be willing and available to come back to the House to discuss this serious matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Moran also raised the issue of retired teachers being employed in supervision of State examinations.  I totally agree with her sentiments.  Graduates and unemployed teachers should get priority in that regard.  I am sure she has made representations to the Minister for Education and Skills on the matter.  I will press the matter with him also.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  He slipped in under the radar and I did not notice him for a couple of seconds.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte romhat.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  As I understand it section 2 provides the Minister for Finance with the authority to make payments to the ESM to cover this country&rsquo;s contribution to our share of the authorised capital stock.  The amount involved is extraordinary.  Section 3 sets out the amount but I am dealing with section 2 which gives the Minister power to do so.  The sum is &euro;11,145,400,000.  It is an incredible amount of money that the State, which is essentially bankrupt, will put into the ESM.</P>
        <P>I made the point yesterday in the course of my Second Stage speech that a positive option that must be considered is for the ECB to consider directly funding the ESM.  Many politicians not just in this country but across Europe have pushed for such an option as a better way to resolve the issues that exist and to provide the necessary firewall to stabilise the euro.  We wish to ensure that the integrity of the euro is protected and, more importantly, the lives and livelihoods of citizens of Europe.  I also echo a point made yesterday by others that countries that are in a bailout situation, as is the case with the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, should not have to make a contribution yet the ground rules are changing with the ESM treaty.  The situation that will arise is we will borrow money from the troika, the IMF and the European Central Bank to put into the fund.  Whatever way one looks at it, we will have to borrow money to cover State expenditure, for day-to-day spending, paying back bondholders or putting money into the ESM.  That is money the taxpayer will have to spend and the State does not have the money which means we will have to borrow it.  We will borrow the &euro;11 billion over a period of time.  I accept the amount is capped.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State might indicate that we might not have to make the full contribution but we might have to pay even more in time because of what is happening in Greece, Spain and potentially Italy.  It does not make sense for countries that must make a contribution to borrow money to put into a fund to get the money back.  I will oppose the section to give the Minister for Finance the authority to be able to use borrowed money on which we are paying interest to give to the ESM and then for us as a nation that is in a bailout programme to pay more interest when we receive money.  That does not make sense.  There is a better way of doing it.  We suggest the better way is the European Central Bank to fund the ESM.  That makes far more sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Senator&rsquo;s remarks yesterday on Second Stage.  He basically put forward the proposition that the better way of doing it is for the direct recapitalisation of the banking system through the European authorities.  I do not fundamentally disagree.  I would wish that to be the case.  The Taoiseach made a remark that appeared this morning on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> agreeing with Senator Cullinane as well.  We all agree with that but others do not agree with us on the issue.</P>
        <P>One could ask what are the two key objectives we face at the moment in their broadest terms.  First, we must get back to the markets if they can lend to us at reasonable rates.  Otherwise we have access to rates of interest of a little less than 3%, which is not a bad situation in which to be in the circumstances, for a programme country.  Our No. 1 objective is to get back to the markets.  The No. 2 objective is to get money back into our banks so at some point in the future we can sell off the shares we own and thereby get money back for the Irish taxpayer.  Senator Cullinane has put forward a view, which is shared by many, that the recapitalisation of the banks should occur from the centre.  Many of us agree with him on that but that is not where we are at the moment.  Of course I wish it were different but that is not the case.</P>
        <P>Until such a time as the Germans, the Finns, the Dutch and the Austrians change their view on this issue, we are where we are.</P>
        <P>The Senator said we were putting &euro;11 billion into the fund.  As I said yesterday in my reply to the points he made &mdash; I am not sure whether he was here at the time &mdash; what we are putting in at the moment is &euro;1.27 billion in tranches of &euro;254 million, two this year, two next year and one in the first six months of 2014.  Our &euro;1.2 billion is a small percentage of the overall &euro;80 billion which the member states that have agreed to the treaty will put into the capital fund.  That money is then leveraged for private sector borrowings across the world.  The &euro;80 billion is never touched; it is the essential leverage upon which borrowings can be made for this new fund.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I made the point yesterday that we could describe this as some kind of gigantic credit union in which, in order to obtain funds, one must have money on deposit.  The Senator is right in saying this rule did not apply in the previous European stability mechanism.  One could make the case that this is part of the commitment that all member states make as a firewall to protect the euro and also to protect individual member states that may need to access the fund from time to time.  The &euro;9.4 billion which makes up part of the &euro;11 billion can technically be called upon, but there is no anticipation that it will be called upon, given the fact that the &euro;80 billion will be provided by all member states together.  We contribute our share of that.  As I said yesterday, when 90% of it is in place, the fund comes into being.  Progress is being made towards the ratification of the treaty across Europe.</P>
        <P>Do we continue to work for a better pan-European solution?  Yes, we do.  Do we believe that requires far greater integration of our financial system?  Yes, we do.  Do we believe that ultimately what is required on bank recapitalisation is a much stronger resolve to shore up the banks rather than putting all of that debt on the sovereign?  Yes, we do.  Is that going to happen in the future?  I cannot answer that question, as I am sure the Senator cannot, despite the fact that we might wish it to happen.  I want to be honest.  We need to deal with this as we see it.  As I said yesterday in my reply to Second Stage, the entire objective of the last six months of last year was a firewall to support the euro.  This is it, effectively.  This is the support that underlies our currency.</P>
        <P>We will continue to negotiate as best we can.  If there are substantial changes to the ESM treaty, it will require primary legislation in this and the other House.  No one can preclude that possibility for the future.  However, in terms of where we are at the moment, it is important that this firewall is in place, not just for the euro but also for us.  The reason is the difficult situation we face in terms of our national finances.  In addition, the fund is important for us not only because it would allow us to obtain money if we did not return to the markets at the end of next year &mdash; which is the firm resolve and ambition of the Government &mdash; but also because it sends a strong signal to the international money markets that Ireland has this support behind it, which it has signed up for by adopting the treaty.  That in itself is the kind of support that the private markets want to see.  Were that not there, one could argue that the cost of Irish money would spiral even further.  This is an important backstop of support behind our programme and behind our ambition to get us back to the money markets.  That is why we think it is important to ratify the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  He is in fine form and is being honest and clear.  However, his honesty and clarity just underline to me how dangerous the situation is and how absolutely futile our efforts are &mdash; how impotent we are in the face of the bullying that is going on.  I did not hear terribly well. I thought I heard the Minister of State say that this undermines our currency.  Perhaps he said it underlined it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well, it undermines it, in my opinion.  As for the firewall, a firewall made out of firelighters is not an awful lot of use.  It is madness.  Half of the countries that are supposed to be contributing are bankrupt.  We know they are bankrupt.  Where are they borrowing the money from?  Senator Marie Louise O&rsquo;Donnell told me the other day that she had seen a performance by the comedian Tommy Tiernan in which he said that Ireland owed a hundred billion million, Greece owed a hundred trillion squillion, and so on; everyone seemed to be borrowing, and his conclusion was that we should find the person we have borrowed the money from and shoot him.  That was a comic way of looking at things.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not very helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but it shows that the thing has become grotesque and surrealistic.  This notion of borrowing in order to put money into a fund that is going to save us is bizarre economics, and is precisely the kind of thing the other House is screwing Deputy Mick Wallace over.  The Government&rsquo;s behaviour, at international level, is the same behaviour it has criticised in an individual.  It is dishonest.  It is perpetrating a fraud on the people.  We are not allowed to discuss half of the stuff that is here.  I tabled amendments because, as I have discussed with the Minister, the body that controls all of this money is inviolable and unaccountable to the Judiciary, the Legislature, the Executive or anything else.  It is a kind of mafia.  Suppose Mr. Berlusconi were in charge.  That would be great.  His strings would be pulled from Sicily.  What kind of nonsense is this?</P>
        <P>I intend to vote against this Bill.  I wish we had the opportunity to revise the entire&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>When we get to that section, the Senator can raise the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will certainly do that.  I take it we will get to that section.  It is part of the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on section 2 at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly raise that, and I thank the Minister for his suggestion.  However, I am concerned about the way things are run.  We started discussing this just before noon.  I received notice at 11.45 a.m. that my amendments were not allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The rest of Europe will wait for the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I hardly think that, but perhaps if some of the ideas that I clearly, consistently and cogently argued in this House had been listened to by previous Governments &mdash; and I would be happy to make whatever little groatsworth of wit I have available to the rest of Europe &mdash; we would not be in this mess.  The Minister of State may look back and see what I said, and he may check to see whether I was right.  I was a lone voice here.  The headlines in the newspapers went to the colleagues who were screaming for the heads of named individuals, because that was sexy news, but one cannot afford to have ideas in this country, apparently, because they are trashed.  Nobody wants to report them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on section 2, Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will leave it at that.  I am not exaggerating myself and saying I am the great panjandrum who can solve the whole thing.  I am not making that claim.  I am just saying that if one looks back at the record of the House, one will find something very interesting.  Perhaps it would have been useful if we had been allowed, not by the Parliament or by the parties but by the media, to discuss these ideas publicly.  Then maybe we would not be in quite the mess we are in.  I do not like saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, but I am unapologetic in saying that I have been cogent and consistent and, lamentably, I have been proved right.</P>
        <P>This is my final point, and then I will sit down.  I received able assistance from one of the Minister of State&rsquo;s valued colleagues in the other House.  I am not sure if I am allowed to name him, but his first name is Peter.  He contacted me to say that he thought my ideas were right, but there were no figures attached.  I said that was because I am not good at figures.  He supplied them to me, and on every occasion those figures have proved accurate.  The Government has the wisdom and resources it needs within the Minister of State&rsquo;s own party.  I would certainly support it.  Obviously, his feeling is similar to that of myself and Senator Cullinane &mdash; that we are in a mess, we are being forced to do things that may well be dangerous, and we hope they will not explode in our face.  We hope it is a developing situation and that we may achieve an easement.  We have gone along with everything required of us by the EU, yet we are being treated worse than any other country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to say from the outset that this is not an abstract debate.  In canteens and households up and down this State, and presumably across Europe, families and individuals are discussing the future of the euro and the implications for them of events in Europe and Ireland.  We attended a presentation in the AV room today concerning people in receipt of rent supplement and the difficulties experienced by some because of rent threshold caps.  We could discuss a raft of issues that are affecting people.  This debate is not academic.  It is about the real economics affecting people across Europe.</P>
        <P>As Senator Norris stated, the Minister of State&rsquo;s honesty is refreshing.  We welcome the honesty and clarity he brings to his role and to his contributions in the Seanad.  Sometimes, laying matters before us honestly reinforces our concerns.  When the Minister of State posed the question of where was the firewall, I was concerned to learn the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, treaty is that firewall.  Given the size of the countries seeking bailouts &mdash; &euro;100 billion for Spain alone &mdash; many people believe the pot of money might not be enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Not maybe; it will not be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my point.  We are constantly told the goal posts are moving.  The pot is enough now, but something else will occur.  For example, Cyprus is looking towards the pot.  Italy may eventually do the same.  What happens if France needs a bailout?  This process is madness.</P>
        <P>Direct recapitalisation makes sense.  The Minister of State does not disagree.  The Government and many others want direct recapitalisation.  The Minister of State referred to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks in a newspaper today.  I agree with almost all of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments regarding what he wants, but words are cheap and we have been listening for God knows how long.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s crucial comment was that, although direct recapitalisation might be discussed, there would be no solution at the upcoming summit.  When will there be a solution?  As far as the real solution is concerned, the can is always being kicked down the road.  This is part of the problem.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned that we want to return to the bond markets.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently cited that as our aspiration for the State, but it is a question of how to create the requisite conditions.  Taking ownership of zombie, defunct and non-existent banks &mdash; Anglo Irish Bank does not exist &mdash; placed a liability on the taxpayer.  This week, we will pay &euro;1.17 billion to bondholders in Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank.  No one likes this, but it is the reality.</P>
        <P>It has been stated that, although many people in Europe do not want the ESM, we must go along with it.  I will not put words in the Minister of State&rsquo;s mouth, but there is a better solution, namely, direct recapitalisation.  However, some countries do not want direct recapitalisation and we must go along with their plan, even if it is a bad one and will not work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As long as it rescues the German banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not make sense.  We must convince people that there is a better way.  I hope this work is ongoing at EU level.  There is nothing wrong with Ireland saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  One of Europe&rsquo;s main problems, be it in terms of this treaty or a major question, is its claim that, although a solution is not the best one, it is the only one on the table and people cannot say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We can say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Sinn F&eacute;in says &ldquo;No&rdquo; because the treaty will not work.  Government representatives tend to attack my party during debates and may do so during the course of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, we attack the Senator&rsquo;s argument, not his party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>They might on this issue, but we are normally asked about what we know about the economy.  We were right when we consistently stated these plans would not work.  We consistently stated that the previous Government&rsquo;s solution for the economy would not work.  We have been proven right.  The plans are not working in Europe or Ireland.  This is not just my party&rsquo;s view.  Senator Norris and many other Independents and economists believe Europe is not taking the right course of action.</P>
        <P>I will stick to debating the section under discussion, as it asks us to provide the Minister for Finance with the power to be able to make the contributions required of the State.  The Minister of State clarified the figure for this year as being &euro;1.27 billion, with further instalments during the course of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be &euro;1.27 billion between now and 2014 in five tranches of &euro;254 million each twice this year, twice next year and once in the first six months of 2014.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot agree with such daftness, given the option of direct recapitalisation.  That option should be available.  We are asking states that are essentially bankrupt to borrow money to invest in a fund from which they will take back that money.  I have not been reassured by the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  If anything, it has reinforced my opinion that the treaty will not work.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that we are being primed for another treaty.  We must understand that some people are following a different agenda, that is, a completely federal Europe and an ever closer union.  Those people are using Ireland&rsquo;s economic problems as an opportunity for another power grab in Europe and further centralisation of power.  We will discuss this issue further in terms of Senator Norris&rsquo;s points on the inviolability of the people who will manage the treaty.  They will seek additional powers.</P>
        <P>None of this is a solution to the problems facing Europe and this country.  On that basis, we will push this section to a vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If Sinn F&eacute;in does not, I will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s comments.  While we differ in our analysis of and approach to the situation, his party is acting in what it believes are the country&rsquo;s best interests.  He will concede that the Government is doing likewise.  We might differ on how to work it out, but we are on the same side and want to do the best for Ireland.</P>
        <P>There has been criticism of this deal.  It might not be ideal, but it contributes to an overall settlement.  It is not the finished product, only a step in the right direction.  Negotiations must occur in the context of the total problem facing us.  There is no question of it being Labour&rsquo;s way or Frankfurt&rsquo;s way and no giant leap will finish the job in one step.  A multitude of small steps will be required.</P>
        <P>I will draw a genuine analogy between negotiating a solution for Ireland&rsquo;s problems in Europe and Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s work in Northern Ireland.  From 1969 until 1994, that party pursued a particular strategy towards achieving its aims.  That strategy did not work and was changed to one of negotiating in 1994.  We do not yet have a united Ireland, which is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s ultimate aim, but since 1969 we have gone a long way towards achieving it.  Incremental negotiation will change the European picture, although I hope it will not take 45 years.  Senator Cullinane takes my point that there will be no bombshell cure in the morning because the EU, Ireland, a Minister or a Senator did something or other.  Change does not work that way and we must appreciate that it will be incremental and slow.  Everyone realises that calling for a major resolution overnight is not realistic.  Section 2 proposes to give power to the Minister to do exactly what I have outlined, which cannot be very contentious.  There may be more contentious sections further down the line but if we oppose this section and throw it out, we may as well throw out the entire Bill.  We should not get ahead of ourselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the comments of my colleague.  I have always been one for a direct hit to do the job.  For example, if there was a blocked pipe in my home, I would not get the garden hose but rather a power hose.  I have found piecemeal solutions irritating but I now recognise why they came about.  It was impossible to deal with this issue in one fell swoop.  It could not be done in such fashion and I do not know if we are finished yet.</P>
        <P>This Bill is trying to achieve stability in Europe, and the word &ldquo;stability&rdquo; is being lost in our conversation.  In Germany people are saving and they are getting a low interest rate, so it costs money for them to save.  They must also deal with a service charge.  The German economy is getting money for nothing.  We would love to be in such a position but it will take time to get to there, and as Senator Gilroy mentioned, we must take small steps rather than giant strides.  I have always been a firm believer that the running of a country is similar to running a business, and when a firm is spending beyond its means and borrowing on a weekly basis, it cannot continue.</P>
        <P>This Government has made cutbacks but, as in business, it has loans to repay.  There is a fine balance between the budget deficit, the repayment of loans and, effectively, cutting one&rsquo;s cloth to measure by finding savings.  The Minister of State should be complimented on his effort in this regard, with one shining light being the changes to procurement.  It needed to be done and, in fairness to the Minister of State, he carried out the task effectively.  I heard him say recently he is not finished with the process yet, and I wish him the best of luck with it.  As I noted, it irritates me that we cannot get the power hose, as it were, and do this in one giant leap, that we must instead take a series of small steps.  I wish the Minister of State the best and I have the utmost confidence in his actions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers I wish to comment briefly on our position and the national debt in particular.  I have read the record of the discussion in the select committee, and the amount of discussion on irrelevant portions of this Bill was astonishing.  That is annoying as we must stay with the point or else we will be here for days, weeks and months.  The great theories being espoused amazed me.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made the point yesterday that the banking portion on the sovereign debt is less than 25%.  We would all prefer if it was not there and we hope that at some stage it may be accounted for somewhere else.  For two years the deficit we run will be the equivalent of what Anglo Irish Bank cost us.  We can, rightly, go nuts about that.  We are obliged to get our deficit under control and we will do so.  When that happens, we can go in a different direction, which will make it easier.  Nevertheless, it is not easy at this time.  The markets are very clear, as they want countries to go in Germany&rsquo;s direction rather than that followed by the peripheral countries.  Money is being offered to Germany and France at knock-down rates, so it costs some people to save money.  At the same time, peripheral countries are being charged 6% or 7% in interest.  The markets are clear on the way they want governments to go.</P>
        <P>A national debt is not repaid.  The national debt in the UK started with a war between Britain and France in the 1600s and it has not been repaid fully since.  It is constantly turned over.  A country keeps it under control by making repayments so when a bond or other amount becomes due, it can be paid.  This is done by the markets allocating funding in a process that has existed for hundreds of years.  I listened to a presentation which noted that Bolshevik Russia reneged on its national debt after the revolution in the early part of the 20th century, and when the country went back to the markets in the 1990s, it repaid an amount for the moneys reneged on.  That is how long debts stand and how the structures operate.</P>
        <P>We will probably never fully repay our national debt, which may increase to more than &euro;200 billion and 118% of GDP, but we must be able to keep track of it and repay the interest as it becomes due.  As society expands and develops, we must keep up.  Otherwise, if we repaid it in full we would all be looking out over half-doors in thatched homes and going to the crossroads for a set dance.  This is the advancement of society.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the debate we will have on this.  I put some issues to the Minister of State yesterday which I am sure we will touch on again today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We support this Bill as it is necessary, although it is not perfect.  My main concern is that I do not know whether our Government and other governments are doing enough to advance solutions to finally resolve this matter.  There have been suggestions involving eurobonds, common banking regulation and a common fiscal set-up within the European Union, or at least the eurozone.  These are not being pushed enough and the people who need to be persuaded are not being convinced.  A job could be done in this respect with the aim of solving this crisis.</P>
        <P>Even if eurobonds were introduced, I suspect the legislation would be similar and Sinn F&eacute;in would argue the Irish people should not pay German or Spanish debts.  The reality of such bonds is that we would all be liable for the debts of everyone else.  There may be a net benefit to us but I am certain of the opinions of Sinn F&eacute;in and those who have consistently opposed the European project.  The Labour Party initially opposed Europe but came on board, and the Green Party did likewise.  There is no doubt Sinn F&eacute;in will come on board, just as it did with Mr. McGuinness shaking the Queen&rsquo;s hand.  The party was a year late in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As somebody who was sentenced to death by the IRA 30 years ago, I find these consistent historical attacks on Sinn F&eacute;in boring beyond belief.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il is very sensitive when it comes to Sinn F&eacute;in.  We just ignore such comments at this stage.</P>

	<P>I am not sensitive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We should concentrate on section 2.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not perfect and much more needs to be done by the Government.  Nevertheless, it is worthy of support.  The last referendum result indicated that many people who oppose Europe are doing so for short-term political gain rather than the interests of the country.  It seems this Bill deals with an insurance policy for the country, and although it is not perfect, no policy provides a complete guarantee.  The Minister and the Government could do a lot more to persuade their colleagues, especially given that Fine Gael boasted before the election about its influence in the European People&rsquo;s Party.  A lot of work could be done in that regard but it is not being done at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to stifle debate, and on Committee Stage people can contribute as often as they want, but both Senator Cullinane and Senator Norris have complimented the frankness and straightforwardness of the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution so rather than go in circles, I will let the Minister of State contribute.  Senator Cullinane says he will put this to a vote, as he is entitled to do, but I do not want too much repetition.  Otherwise we will be going round in circles.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a public debate on the issues we face.  We need more of this.  I want to take up one of the points raised by Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy on the question of the national debt and speak honestly about what the national debt is.  The last time I asked the Department of Finance how much we owe as a country, from recollection it is about &euro;186 billion, and about 23% of that relates to the banks.  A total of &euro;63 billion was put into the banks.  The previous Government put in &euro;21 billion of our money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The other &euro;42 billion that is outstanding concerns the ongoing recapitalisation of the banks and the promissory note.  So less than a quarter of everything we owe relates to the banking problem.</P>
        <P>Three quarters of the money we owe relates to the fundamental difference between tax and expenditure.  The major part of the deficit problem is that we are spending too much and not taking in that money.  To bridge that deficit requires a number of things.  We must increase taxes and reduce expenditure, but for every 1% of GDP growth, there is &euro;1.6 billion the following year.  Growth of 3% would generate &euro;4.8 billion, making up the adjustments on the tax and expenditure side.  From recollection, this year 20% of all of the tax we gather goes to pay interest on the national debt.  Senator D&rsquo;Arcy is right.  We never paid off the national debt, even in good times.  In 1991 it was 39% of GDP and then stayed roughly the same, although as a percentage of the total size of the economy it was much smaller.  There was an argument at the time that we should pay the national debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I made that argument in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I should be more closely attentive to the Senator&rsquo;s speeches in this House.  From now on I will write down everything he says.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s sense of irony.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We are, however, heading in the wrong direction on the debt; we know that.  It will reach a maximum of 118% next year, and the only way it will come down is for the economy to grow.  The more growth we have, the smaller the liability as a percentage of the total size of the economy.  That is the crisis we face.  Inflation is the other way of doing it but we must get those numbers down.</P>
        <P>I hear a critique in this House about what is happening in Europe at present but no alternative is being offered, other than one that requires other people to pay the bill.  I do not disagree with Senator Cullinane.  I would love tomorrow if the European authorities, the ESM, or anyone else decided to fund the banks, although this would require a change in legislation at the least.  We would all love that, but who pays for it?  The suggestion from Senator Cullinane is that Ireland plc will have this amazing new fund to recapitalise our banks, we will get some of the &euro;43 billion back and everything will be hunky dory.  We are not, however, going to contribute to this new fund.  Is that really living in the real world?  What planet is the Senator living on?  I did not mean to say it like that but that is fundamentally dishonest.  The notion that a country as indebted as we are can obtain funds from another source without contributing to that source is not living in the real world.  The world does not work like that.  People must be honest about that.</P>
        <P>We can say until the cows come home that we are paying back the German debt, but that does not stack up with the facts of the case.  The major part of our debt is nothing to do with banks.  It is to do with the collapse in the economy and the transactional taxes disappearing.  This hole emerged and someone is funding it.  At the moment, broadly speaking, the German authorities are funding our deficit because if we came into immediate deficit, heaven knows the Armageddon that would face this country.</P>
        <P>We must be honest about this.  Blaming the Germans and other European countries for our current predicament is an interesting narrative but it is fundamentally dishonest and panders to the worst kind of neo-nationalism and politics.  I believe the German authorities are grappling with this issue because they must sell this ultimately to their domestic audience, which has become increasingly hostile and eurosceptic.</P>
        <P>This is part of a wider project.  I know the European way is slow, dreadfully slow.  Europe can rightly be criticised for the failure on its part to implement the kind of reforms to which we have all agreed but which have not been implemented.  We are a small country and we do not have huge leverage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">After the referendum campaign, I was with my children in Marlay Park on the Saturday.  A constituent came up to me and told me he voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to stay in the game.  I saw that as interesting, that people see this as a gigantic match we are not at the end of but in which we are coming to the end of the beginning, as Churchill famously said.  If we are going to get the country to a better place, we must box clever and stay at this.  We must also demand, as the Minister for Finance said publicly at the end of the conference call with other eurozone colleagues, that if there are better terms and conditions, we will get them.  He made that remark in the course of the eurozone meeting, and told the Irish people that on the "Six One News".  I am repeating that today.  If terms and conditions improve, we will demand those improved terms and conditions for us, too.  I know it is frustrating.</P>
        <P>That is the point I wanted to make.  Senator Cullinane is also being honest in this debate.  I recognise that the Sinn F&eacute;in position has also changed on this issue.  Before the last election, the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesman on finance, Deputy Doherty, and the party president, Deputy Adams, spoke about saying &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; to the troika and that we would fund ourselves, that we do not need international money.  Since the election, on a quiet news day, that position was changed.  The position now is that we will work with the troika to get a better deal.  Where did we hear that before?  Sinn F&eacute;in is not that far away from us, despite the amateur dramatics and the smoke and mirrors, if the truth be told.  Once Sinn F&eacute;in accepts the troika is here, of course it wants to negotiate a better deal and do the devil and all, but once it is here, it is here on condition.  It is here on condition based on conditionality.  It will keep giving us the money on a quarterly basis, predicated on our achieving certain objectives.  I do not think if we drill through the Sinn F&eacute;in position there is that much difference between us.</P>
        <P>I know the party opposes section 2 and the Bill and we have the speeches accordingly.  If, however, we tease out the Sinn F&eacute;in stance on this, the party has moved its battleships, accepting implicitly that if the lender of last resort is in the country, it is here on the basis of conditions to which we and the troika must agree.</P>
        <P>I reject the contention that there has been no improvement in the circumstances we face.  Our current circumstances are totally different from those of 18 months ago.  The reputation of the country, as a small open economy, has been restored.  We have a programme that is difficult for our people but we are working through it.  Our economy is growing, and will do so ten times faster if the eurozone is restabilised.</P>
        <P>Ireland, as a small programme country, has proven that it can secure changes.  The Government renegotiated the minimum wage deal agreed by the previous Government for the lowest-paid workers.  That happened under the regime of the troika.  The Government was able to demonstrate that we could exempt over 330,000 people from the dreaded universal social charge as a result of the programme we are undertaking.  It was able to achieve a better deal on the sale of State assets.  Previously, in respect of such sales, 100% was sought but we now have a deal in respect of which 50% is sought.  We can use the funding available for investment in job creation, which has been negotiated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.</P>
        <P>We will continue to work our way through this.  The result of the referendum on the treaty, which was backed by the Government parties and Fianna F&aacute;il, which played a very important role in putting the country first in the campaign, shows that people want to be at the heart of the eurozone because they realise the enormous benefits for the country of being there.  They want to remain in the game to ensure we can continue to negotiate a solution to the problem.  I believe passionately that people will stick with the programme if they see the country moving towards a better position.</P>
        <P>It is the long-standing ambition of the Government to re-engineer the promissory note arrangement, and that work remains.  We have had some success this year, including in March through our not having to make the payment and putting it off.  The long-standing ambition and first priority of the Government in its negotiations is to ensure that the &euro;28 billion on the Anglo Irish Bank side can be re-engineered so our debt will become more sustainable in the long run.  We believe we can secure this deal but it will require other developments.  If and when we secure the deal, our position on re-entry to the market will be inordinately better than it is at present.  We remain absolutely committed to this goal.  I assure Senator Byrne that the negotiations are ongoing.  He may not read about them in the paper or see footage of them on the news every day but they are taking place nevertheless in a quiet, deliberate and diplomatic way, and will take place until the country is in a better place.</P>

	<P>I can tell from the Minister of State&rsquo;s expansive response and body language that the option of more debate is being explored.  We are on section 2.  I will allow Senators Cullinane and Norris to contribute as it is their prerogative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  He has incited my response to some of his comments.  Senator Byrne mentioned a potential historic occurrence that might take place today.  An even bigger historic occurrence was when the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, stated there is not much difference now between Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael on these issues.  I will remind him of that the next time he writes one of his columns and attacks my party on the economy.  I must write down the date and time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is somewhat <i>orbiter dicta</i> where section 2 is concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very relevant.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made the point that those of us who oppose the Bill, including section 2, and the treaty are not living in the real world, as we ought to.  Those of us who do not believe the current policies are working are told this continuously.  The Minister of State was in opposition when a former Taoiseach said people who did not agree with his analysis of the Celtic tiger were negative, did not live in the real world and should commit suicide.  The Celtic tiger involved light-touch regulation of the banks and an undermining of our public finances such that they were built on sand, and there was a property bubble that we could see was going to burst.  We have been proven right about our commentary at the time.  Comments such as those made by the then Taoiseach are always made about people simply because they do not agree with the proposition put forward by the Government, yet we live in a real world that is very different from the bubble in Leinster House.  It is a world in which 440,000 people are out of work and where businesses are closing every day of the week.  If one walks down the high street in Waterford, my area, one will see shops closed with &ldquo;For sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;To let&rdquo; signs.  This is the case in every town, city, rural area and village.  Most of our banks are defunct and some no longer exist.  Some are in State ownership for the wrong reasons, and this is coupled with the crisis in Europe.  This is the real world in which we live.</P>
        <P>I made the point yesterday, perhaps flippantly because it was raised by somebody else, that the empire has no clothes in that the European&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>The emperor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;project itself is in the midst of a very real crisis that we all want to see solved in a way that makes life better for citizens, not just banks and bondholders.  We want a better solution, a solution that will work.  We simply do not believe the solution proposed will work.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is referring to real-world solutions.  The need for direct recapitalisation is one.  I will get to the point where the Minister of State said we shifted our policy.</P>
        <P>If this Bill is passed, the ESM mechanism will apply to us.  If it is the case that the Government is to put such an arrangement in place, one must try to change it as much as one can to make the organisation more accountable and better, even if one does not agree with it in its entirety.  If the ESM is in place and there are funds available, we should be able to use them to invest in jobs in the economy, not just to recapitalise banks and bail out countries.</P>
        <P>We are not just talking about bailing out countries, however.  In many circumstances, we are not talking about bailing out individuals but about taking money from a pot to which we contribute, bearing in mind that the Minister of State said we are not living in the real world if we do not make a contribution.  In the real world, we do not have money.  Therefore, how can we put money into a fund when we do not have it?  We must borrow it to get it back.</P>
        <P>If banks need to be recapitalised, as in Spain where the recapitalisation figure is approximately &euro;100 billion, the Government must go to the ESM and borrow the money required.  The taxpayer is then liable.  Essentially, taxpayers are being asked to recapitalise private banks and institutions.  That they are asked to do this is morally, economically and socially wrong.  It demonstrates that we are not really dealing with the problems in the banks.  Are we really asking ourselves why they are occurring and why the banks are in need of recapitalisation?  During the course of the campaign before the recent referendum on the fiscal treaty, which was passed, I made the point that one of the failings was that the treaty did not deal with how banks should operate.  It forced restrictions on states and did not deal with the restrictions that should be on banks.</P>
        <P>There is no discussion whatsoever on how we can regulate the banks properly and ensure that what happened in the past will not recur.  There has been no discussion at European Union level; it is all a question of imposing restrictions and brakes on Governments.  There is no doubt that some Governments acted very irresponsibly.  We need mechanisms that act as checks and balances in respect of what states do.  These are real-world issues that are affecting us all.  The banks were primarily the organisations that behaved in a most reckless fashion.  In this regard, the example of Anglo Irish Bank is the best.  It simply engaged in a race to the bottom, borrowed money from the bond markets and used it to give to the golden circle to speculate on land.  It all went belly up and we are paying the price.  There was no regulation of the banks.  All we are doing is setting up a new fund which can be used by member states to put more money into banks, if necessary.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State raised the issue of the shift in positions.  Everybody&rsquo;s position is changing because things are happening so fast.  We did not want the troika arrangement, as we did not want Ireland to lose its sovereignty and a situation where we would end up in a bailout programme.  However, we were signed up to it.  It is one thing to try to stop something when it is happening, but when one is part of a troika arrangement, there is no way to escape.  I am sure the Minister of State will accept that is why our position on this issue has changed.  It is a little like how we do not like the ESM, but, if it is in place, we must work within it, as one must be pragmatic and constructive.  The only way we can get out of this situation, which the Government states it is trying to do, is by getting back into the bond markets.  My party does not believe we will get back into them if the State continues to shoulder more debt.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned a figure of &euro;170 million in respect of the national debt.  The Government will borrow more money and put it into the ESM fund.  It will pay out more money on bonds.  We are not really reducing the deficit as quickly as we want because of the policies which are being pursued which my party believes are counterproductive.  It wants Ireland to return to the bond markets and reclaim sovereignty, but we accept that the troika is here and that we cannot wish it away, although both we and the Government did not want it.  Unfortunately, it was Fianna F&aacute;il which brought it upon us through the failure of its policies and those of the Green Party.  The reality is we are in a bailout programme and the only way we can get out of it is by getting back into the bond markets.  My party does not believe in the totality of what is being put before us in terms of what the Government is trying to do in its fiscal and budgetary policies and also the European response to the treaty.  While there is some good work being done, we do not believe the totality of what is being put in place by the Government will get us back into the bond markets.  We believe strongly &mdash; we will see who is proved correct &mdash; that we will end up in a second bailout programme.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the conditionality being imposed on us as a consequence of the arrangements of which we are part, but he can bet his bottom dollar that if there is a bailout Mark II, the conditionality will be even worse and that those who will suffer and have to pay the price will be the citizens of the State through further tough budgets.  We are facing four more tough budgets under the Government.  If we do end up in a second bailout programme, no doubt whoever lends us the money &mdash; most likely the ESM &mdash; will attach conditionality to it and that it will not be good for citizens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senators that we are on section 2 because all kinds of issues are being covered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to be brief by way of a series of bullet points.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is persuasive, but I remember his former colleague from Fianna F&aacute;il, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, who was an old friend of mine, sitting in the Minister&rsquo;s seat and being equally persuasive and brilliant.  I disagreed with him because I had analysed his language and want to do the same with the Minister of State.  The words the Minister of State is using, &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;, &ldquo;game&rdquo; and &ldquo;reputation&rdquo;, tell me that perhaps the debate should be moved from this Chamber because we are dealing with politics, not substantial ideas.  What we need is a radical reappraisal of the system in which we put the welfare of the people first.  One needs to start by looking at the definition of money which has moved from being attached to reality.  It is now merely a symbolic representation of energy.  It is obscene that multi-billionaire bondholders are paid off.  Yesterday I met a woman outside Leinster House who told me she had not eaten for two days.  She is by no means unique.  That is the impact of these policies and the refusal to take a radical view.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s position that we cannot do it on our own.  However, we need to spark a debate.  So what if it is intellectual and academic?  What are the universities doing?  Why are they not tackling these issues?  Why are we, at a political level, not taking on the bond markets?  Even Sinn F&eacute;in wants to go back to them.  I would like to abolish them.  We are bond slaves or bondsmen.  The markets are not serving the interests of the people.</P>
        <P>The Government side has stated the markets are investing in Germany because they approve of its Government.  That is rubbish, absolute tripe.  They are doing so because they know Germany can pay them back and because they will get money out it.  They know we cannot pay.  In section 2 we are promising we will put in &euro;11 billion, money we do not have because we are bust.  The reason I do not like this and the reason I have been voting against it is I like the truth.  I do not like fantasy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I live in the real world, which is not one where one who has no money promises to pay.</P>
        <P>As I stated yesterday, when the guarantee which has got us into the mess in which we find ourselves was before the House, I asked what the ultimate figure would be and was told it was &euro;400 million.  When I asked what was our gross national product, the officials did not know.  They had to go out and make a telephone call to find that it was &euro;200 billion.  The position is the same on the issue of insurance.  Against what is one insuring?  I am considering my insurance policy because it is difficult to pay on a house with the furniture I have and I do not know I can afford it.</P>

	<P>It strikes me as absurd if the insurance premium one has to pay exceeds the value of the items one is insuring.  That is what we are in danger of doing.  It is common sense.</P>
        <P>I encouraged the former Minister Charlie McCreevy when he said he was putting a little aside for a rainy day.  It was nowhere near enough.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State has opened up a range of issues to which I feel duty bound to respond and I will do so as quickly as possible.  I say this with all due respect to the Minister of State who has made a persuasive case to the House and who will rebut points made by some of the Senators on this section, but there are a number of issues that I must address.</P>
        <P>What the Government gave through the exemption of the lowest paid in respect of the USC it took away through the reduction of the dole for part-time workers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State raised this issue and I am responding to what he said.</P>
        <P>The sale of State assets is an invention of the Government, it has nothing to do with the troika agreement.  The Government has told the troika that it wants to sell State assets and the troika has stated it can put so much of the proceeds towards investment.  I wish the economy was growing.  The Minister of State is saying it has returned to growth.  There was growth following budget 2010 that the Minister of State&rsquo;s party opposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>Everybody is wandering through the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>If others were allowed to raise the issues of rent allowance and house insurance, I will refer to issues that the Minister of State raised on the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, the Senator is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>There was growth after budget 2010 which the Minister of State&rsquo;s party opposed.  Fine Gael constantly makes claims on junior bondholders, but that measure was put in place by legislation which Fine Gael opposed just before the general election.</P>
        <P>On the bond markets, Sinn F&eacute;in should be careful what it wishes for.  Senator David Norris was correct on that point.  Much of the talk about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s desire to return to the bond markets will come back to haunt it.</P>
        <P>There were many PR mistakes made by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration and one of the biggest was encouraging a fear of the IMF.  We kept saying that if we did not do this or that, the IMF would come here.  It did.  From a PR point of view, all of what we had said came back to haunt us.  We should have been portraying it as a safe harbour in the event that we were denied access to the bond markets, which is exactly what happened.  It was portrayed initially as a dangerous course to follow, whereas I say thank God for it and the troika.</P>
        <P>They gave us money to continue to provide public services, pay public service salaries and pensions, make social welfare payments and keep the country running.  People were encouraged, instead, to fear them.  Similarly, we must view the European Stability Mechanism as another safety net which we will access if we are unable to return to the bond markets.  Contrary to Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s description of the bond markets as some kind of refuge, they are full of sharks who will do everything possible to make a few quid.</P>

	<P>I would like to be the only Member present to discuss the relevant section.  It is difficult to see how one could make an argument for voting against the section if we all share the belief that we must access funding from some source.  The only likely source of funding available to us at present is the European Stability Mechanism.  If we vote against the section, we are stating we do not want the ESM.  It strikes me as particularly ironic &mdash; I touched on this issue on Second Stage yesterday &mdash; that those who oppose the section ask the reason we should put our money at risk by contributing to the fund.  This is precisely the same argument as is used by the more belligerent members of the German commentariat who ask the reason Germany should contribute to the mechanism from which Ireland is drawing funds.  We cannot argue, on the one hand, that we do not want to contribute &euro;1.27 billion to the ESM&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have the money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot contribute to something and then take it back.  It does not make sense to give to oneself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in codding ourselves.  There is a great deal of irresponsible lending and many financial transactions taking place.  We cannot accuse German taxpayers of being irresponsible.  Germany is reaping the benefits of a series of reforms it introduced in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall.  German taxpayers are frugal savers who will contribute 27% of the total of the fund.  It has been argued that they should continue to contribute and bail us out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>If they do not agree with the real solution, that is their problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>German taxpayers are bailing us out with their money and we demand that they continue to provide us with funding while refusing to make our own contribution.  That is a fantastic idea but it is also laughable and unrealistic.  While there is nothing that grieves us more than borrowing money in our current economic circumstances to contribute to the ESM fund, it must be done.  The very people Senator Cullinane claims to seek to protect, namely, the owners of businesses which are closing down and the unemployed, have most to benefit or lose from our decision on whether to join the ESM.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>That makes perfect sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Either Senators do not understand what they are saying or their proposals are disingenuous.  As the Minister noted, three quarters of the money we are borrowing is to fund public services.  The largest item of Government expenditure is the social welfare programme.  Senators argue that we should not contribute &euro;1.27 billion to access the money we need to have a guaranteed funding stream.  This would place those who most need State services at greatest risk.  We will be fine because we have grand salaries.  Those who are on social welfare, use our hospitals and attend our schools will be most disadvantaged if we do not pass this legislation.  One can say what one likes about the bond market and other matters but we need funding to finance our public services.  If we vote against this section, we may as well tear up the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am being consistent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is lovely to be able to say that from inside the hallowed walls of the Seanad Chamber.  How will we make social welfare payments or pay disability allowances if we do not have access to ESM funding after 2013?  We face a funding cliff in 2014 when a sovereign bond of &euro;11 billion must be restructured.  Where will we get the funding to meet this cost if we reject the section?  What will happen if we cannot secure funding in the markets or through the ESM?  Senators may say I am scaremongering but the prospect of closing the deficit in one year is extremely scary.  We will have to find, from public expenditure, &euro;11 billion to restructure our bond and approximately &euro;9 billion to finance the public service at its current level.  This year, we will reduce public expenditure by &euro;3.6 billion, which will be extraordinarily painful and, in many cases, unfair.  What would happen if we had to reduce public expenditure by &euro;20 billion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator clearly did not listen to a word we said.  I will repeat my comments when we discuss the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt Senator Cullinane will repeat them but I cannot understand his position.  We can play politics as much as we want but Sinn F&eacute;in was unable to respond on the many occasions we asked that party during the campaign on the stability treaty to show us the money.  According to Sinn F&eacute;in, we will go to the IMF and elsewhere, veto this, that and the other and still be in a position to fund public services.  That is a crazy proposition.  If we cannot return to the markets, where will we get the money?  Sinn F&eacute;in has had six months to answer that question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been pointed out that we do not have money.  That is incorrect as we have &euro;33 billion in revenue from taxation every year.  However, we also have obligations, of which the payment into the ESM is one.  To whom do we owe our first obligation?  Is it State employees and those who have retired from public service?  Should we pay their pay and pensions before we make social welfare payments?  People on social welfare are given money from the State based on the decisions of the Oireachtas and the social conscience of its Members.  Of the &euro;33 billion the State receives in revenue, &euro;19 billion is allocated towards the salaries of those who work in the public service, with a further &euro;21 billion spent on social welfare payments.  The very people to whom Senator Norris and Sinn F&eacute;in Senators refer are those who would be most affected were we to fail to pass this legislation.</P>
        <P>Explaining the position to an older person who receives a pension, I stated that I did not want to have to explain the reason the Government and Oireachtas would be required to cut expenditure by &euro;10 billion, &euro;12 billion or &euro;14 billion in one year.  Irrespective of the ultimate figure, the result would be the impoverishment of the very people the Senators opposite believe they are protecting.  I do not believe they believe their own arguments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If people wish to oppose this measure, they must put forward an alternative.  It appears the only alternative is a default position where one effectively defaults on the commitments one has made.  In our case, the consequence of owning the main banks, apart from Bank of Ireland which is in 50% State ownership, is that their liabilities and assets belong to the State.  One may agree or disagree with how that came about but it is the <i>de facto</i> position.  The train has left the station.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the default option.  At a eurozone meeting I attended in February, it was agreed to provide for an organised default by Greece of &euro;170 billion.  It could be argued that this default, which involved the public and private sectors, was the largest ever default.  In other words, countries that held Greek debt were obliged to pony up the interest and hand it back.  That was a big commitment for them and, thankfully, Ireland was not exposed enormously in that regard.  However, for private sector involvement, they were also obliged to pony up a huge amount of money.  While that was an example of default, has it worked?  For those who suggest default offers an option and alternative, please show me where it has worked.  Do they mean Argentina, where, to take up the hunger analogy used by Senator David Norris in respect of the woman he met outside Leinster House the other day, one quarter of the population went hungry?  What do they mean?  Will they, please, show me where the alternative has worked?</P>
        <P>We are part of a eurozone with 16 other countries and defaulting would take us out of it.  As for whether it would be immediate, Members should run the following numbers.  There are 110,000 direct US multinational jobs here, with a further 120,000 indirect jobs, and they would go overnight because once one introduces capital controls to stop people from taking money out of the country, there is no longer a Single Market.  As for what happened in Iceland which has its own currency, the reason it could do this was the authorities there stopped people from taking money out of the country via capital controls.  Consequently, were that to happen in Ireland from 1 January 2013, it would be goodbye to all foreign direct investment.  Such investors would be out of here within one day.  Members should run the numbers and explain to me the impact an additional 200,000 on the dole would have.</P>
        <P>Another point which I believe Senator John Gilroy has made concerns what is happening in Greece.  It is not the poor or those in receipt of unemployment benefit who are leaving but the rich who always go first.  They take their posh houses or multiple posh houses and liquidate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>And their furniture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They take their bank accounts and get out.  Who is left?  It is the person in receipt of unemployment benefit, the carer and the pensioner who will see their living standards slashed repeatedly.  If Members oppose section 2 because they say they have an alternative, I want to hear what it is.  I want to hear about circumstances in which Ireland can gain access to money at a rate of 3%.  No one is putting up his or her hand and telling me where Ireland can get money at 3%.  Section 2, in putting in this capital, will allow the country, in a scenario which I hope will not arise, to get money at some point in the future.  If Ireland puts this money into this credit union, as I describe it, at some point in the future the fund will borrow on Ireland&rsquo;s behalf in the international money markets.  Moreover, what Ireland will be charged on is the tiny additional margin for obtaining these funds.  At present, it gets funds at 3%, while the money markets would charge 7%.  If Members can tell me where Ireland can get money at rates of 2%, 2.5% or 3%, I will be all ears, but I have not heard it yet.</P>
        <P>If one is honest about this, the European Stability Mechanism does two things.  Were Ireland to need this emergency fund, it would be available at very cheap rates in comparison with those at which the country could borrow in the money markets.  Second, however, it is in place as a confidence boost towards getting Ireland back into the money markets.  People talk about borrowing and money markets as though they were faceless bureaucrats and people with all this money piled up behind them.  However, they represent pension funds and other ordinary people.  They represent all kinds of individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister of State should let Members have this information.  He should let Members know how many of the credit unions are involved.  He is trailing around red herrings.  What proportion is held by Irish bondholders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very small.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude by noting that this mechanism, through section 2, allows Ireland access to that emergency fund, if needed, which I hope it will not.  Second, it gives Ireland additional confidence in trying to get back into the markets, an objective with which everyone agrees.  It is welcome that Sinn F&eacute;in wants Ireland to return to the bond markets.  It did not want us there before the election, but it does now.</P>

      </Speaker>
        <P>Question declared carried.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 3</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Logic dictates that if one opposed section 2, one would also oppose section 3, unless one was convinced by the Minister of State&rsquo;s arguments, which we were not.  I will make some general points on the ESM and respond to the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution in which he asked for an alternative.  It is important to spell out the alternative, or at least the proposition Sinn F&eacute;in is putting forward.  First, we must look at what is before us.  The ESM is being presented as a firewall.  We will take money from countries that are broke and put it into the ESM.  That mechanism will provide cash, first, to states that need it because they are in a deficit situation and, second, to banks because they need to be recapitalised.  The State will then become a conduit for that.  The backdrop to all of this is the continuation of the issues I mentioned previously, which are massive unemployment, the difficulties families are experiencing and the pressures on banks.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in advocates the adoption of a different deficit reduction strategy.  I think the Minister of State would accept that Sinn F&eacute;in, consistently over a number of years, has put forward a set of budgetary proposals that are different from his own.  What we want is a different way of reducing the deficit.  We accept the need to reduce our deficit in an appropriate fashion that does not have a deflationary impact on our economy.  The previous Government put in place a four year strategy that became a five year deficit reduction strategy.  That is the current bailout situation we are in.  For starters, we wanted it over a longer time period but we would also have gone about it in a different way in that we would not have targeted low income families and people on welfare.  We would have tried to get revenue in from higher earners, introduced a third rate of tax, abolished tax exemptions and shelters, capped pay at &euro;100,000 and all of the proposals we put forward <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House whenever we are asked for an alternative.  We would introduce a different deficit reduction strategy and budgetary strategy from that followed by the Government.  From the outset we have consistently said we need to grow the economy.  If the difference between what one takes in and what one spends is a specific amount, let us say &euro;14 billion or &euro;15 billion, and the economy does not grow, the only way to reduce that is through cuts and austerity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>What about inflation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, we could borrow.  However, it makes perfect sense that one would try to grow the economy, which in turn would grow revenue.  Growing the economy, revenue and finance is the easiest way to heal the difference between what one takes in and what one spends.  That is why we have called for a jobs strategy and a growth strategy that would underpin a different deficit reduction strategy as well.</P>
        <P>We have also called on bondholders to take a haircut.  We do not make any apologies for that.  I know the Minister of State&rsquo;s party made such a call before the election, perhaps not to the same extent, but certainly as regards junior bondholders, we made commitments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the manifesto.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State asked for responses and he said that no response had been made.  We are talking about the ESM treaty, which in some respects is convoluted.</P>
        <P>The other strategy would be to devise a different way to deal with the banks.  The Government has said it wants to deal with the problem by means of promissory notes, yet what we are seeing is the most convoluted system I have ever seen.  Essentially, the Irish Central Bank was allowed to print more than &euro;30 billion to give to Anglo Irish Bank.  That could be written off but the Germans do not want us to do that.  They want us to give the money back.  The first or second instalment of &euro;3 billion that was to be paid back recently was taken from NAMA which was given a Government bond on the strength of that.  NAMA gave the money to the Central Bank which burned the money and it was left with the bond.  Bank of Ireland was to take over the bond and it had to get the agreement of its shareholders, which was provided.  Bank of Ireland now has the bond and at some point we will pay it back and the same will happen for the next round.  It is complicated and convoluted but ultimately it means that we have to keep paying back the money.  There is no real deal.  Reference was made to smoke and mirrors.  That is it.  We would do it differently.  We do not see why we should pay any of the money back.  In our view it would not be inflationary and it would be easy were the money to printed and written off as part of an overall debt reduction strategy.</P>
        <P>It is not right to say that there is not a solution.  We have said what is required is to strengthen the ECB and its ability to act as a lender of last resort.  That is what we want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>One does not pay into it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be the best way to do it.  One option that could be examined would be for the ECB to print money.  It would be different if we had to make a contribution to a different scheme but we will not support a contribution to the scheme that is before the House.  We want a genuine mechanism of solidarity.  We do not believe this mechanism is such.  That is why we do not want to provide the &euro;11 billion which we are asked to do in section 2.  We are putting forward alternatives.  The Minister of State might not agree with the alternatives presented but one should not state that no alternative has been put forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>

	<P>I clearly remember in the 2007 general election my party was described as economic illiterates by a party which then went on to devastate the economy.  I do not know whether the Minister of State will agree but it was the very policies we warned against&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in voted for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that created the sheer disaster we have in the economy at the moment.  It is interesting to note that what keeps coming up over and over again is that somehow Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policies would wreck the economy.  The economy is wrecked.  It is the policies we warned against that were at fault.  There are genuine alternatives.  Some of the proposals we advocated were about having proper regulation of the banks and not diluting the taxation system, which we did, especially for those at the top who were given generous tax reductions.  The tax base was hollowed out during the Celtic tiger years.  We are in the current situation because of the big gap in our public finances.  That is because the bubble burst and our public finances were not sustainable and we have to try to improve them again.  The reality is we are not asking the higher earners to pay.  We are asking the lower earners and people at the bottom.</P>
        <P>We have always said that what we want is not a permanent bailout situation but that we would eventually get back to the bond markets, which is where we need to be.  In an ideal situation we would not have to borrow at all but the reality is that sometimes one needs to borrow and at the moment we have to borrow.  One must ask why the bond markets locked this country out of the markets altogether.  Why will they not lend to us at reasonable rates?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They think they will not get their money back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for that is because they think the policies that were pursued previously and are being pursued now are wrong.  Senator Norris made the point that the reason bondholders invest in Germany and are still investing in France and elsewhere is because they believe those countries can pay the money back.  They do not believe we can pay the money back because they see us continuously taking on debt which is not ours.  They do not see any solution to the bank situation.  They see the perceived solutions to be all talk, hollow words, smoke and mirrors and they do not see the real solutions.  If the solutions were in place, the bond markets would be much more inclined to lend money to this country.  I refer to different deficit reduction policies being in place that are not deflationary and do not make the situation worse, which is what is happening.  The domestic economy is floundering because of the policies that are being put in place.  I have given the Minister of State a comprehensive view of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s analysis.  He will obviously disagree with the Sinn F&eacute;in position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is what I am talking about: whether we are on the right road, if the policies will work, if the ESM will work and if it will be a firewall.  I do not believe it will be.  I will finish on this point.  Every single time Europe presents a solution, we end up with a new crisis.  This week&rsquo;s summit is another crisis summit.  I am sure there will be discussion of more steps that must be taken because we are not dealing with the real problems and putting forward the real solutions.  Sticking plaster, or should I say &ldquo;stickie&rdquo; plaster, solutions &mdash; the Minister of State should pardon the pun given his partners in Government  &mdash; will not solve the problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>A party that ruined the country told Sinn F&eacute;in it was economically illiterate.  The party that ruined the country is still the party that ruined the country and Sinn F&eacute;in is still economically illiterate.  I wish to point out three things about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s comprehensive position as outlined by Senator Cullinane.  He said we can deal with the exceptional liquidity assistance, ELA, and the promissory notes in a different way, that we can somehow unilaterally rewrite the promissory notes to take care of the ELA.  However, he does not answer the question of how that would then fit into the TARGET2 system.  He might not have heard that term before.  It would undermine the entire system of euro transactions if we unilaterally interfered with the ELA.  It would also undermine the rules of monetary policy if we did that.  What is more important is that while we could do that economically, it would destroy the reputation of the country.  Of course, politics is about relationships &mdash; in this case, relationships with our partners in Europe and trying to find a common way forward.  Although we said while discussing the previous section that progress was slower than we had hoped, it is working.  Before we came into Government, the interest rate Ireland was paying on the secondary bond markets was more than 15% and was actually coming close to 16%; it is now less than 7%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>They are right.  If the Senator goes back to August of the year before last, he will find the secondary bond markets were charging Ireland interest of around 16%.  That is true; the Senator can check it.  Now the rate is 7%.  The bond markets are clearly saying Ireland is doing something in the direction of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has said it wants us to reach a position in which we do not have to borrow.  Did the last three months not exist, or what?  Was that not exactly the reason Sinn F&eacute;in was arguing against the stability treaty &mdash; because we would not be allowed to borrow?</P>

	<P>Incorrectly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>The so-called realistic and comprehensive solutions that Sinn F&eacute;in is putting forward are fairly comprehensive, but they are not one bit realistic.  Section 3 is the same as section 2.  If we reject section 2, we reject section 3.  The House has shown that we are not in favour of rejecting section 2, so it is unlikely we will reject section 3, although I suspect there will be a vote on it.  The Minister of State asked for a realistic alternative, but we still have not heard it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure I have an awful lot more to add.  I very much agree with Senator Gilroy&rsquo;s comments.  Section 3 follows section 2 as night follows day, and the House has divided on section 2 already.  I am not convinced about Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s view that some kind of quantitative easing in the ECB would solve our problem.  The reason wealth is behind a currency is that it provides a guarantee.  If one starts printing money, as he describes it, one immediately undermines the wealth that exists within that currency.  That is not a solution.  One could argue that the three-year money at 1% that the ECB lent to the banks before Mr. Draghi&rsquo;s considerable initiative in December was a kind of quantitative easing.  The real problem is that there is no inter-bank lending at the moment.  It is not just Ireland that is locked out of the money markets; the money markets themselves are locked out.  If we take out the emergency liquidity funding provided by the ECB, there is very little activity going on.  That is why it is so important that we resolve the problem with the euro once and for all.  Our growth is hugely dependent on stability within the eurozone.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was in France some weeks ago, he made the point that we could come back like a rocket if such stability could be achieved because, more than any other country in Europe, we produce many goods and services that we cannot consume.  We must get them off the aisle, and as a consequence we need to be part of a hard trading currency so that we can sell our goods and services at a price that is to our benefit.  We are like a cork bobbing up and down on the ocean; as the euro moves towards a stable position, we will recover more quickly.  Our growth rates are twice those of other eurozone countries.  Our economy is primed and we are ready to come back if we can achieve stability.  On a broader level, the purpose of the European Stability Mechanism is to provide such stability and, on an individual level, to give us the backstop about which we have spoken in the past.</P>
        <P>The Senator is suggesting, if I am interpreting him correctly, that we take some unilateral position on this.  I refer him back to our party&rsquo;s manifesto in advance of the general election, in which we warned against this strategy.  We said what we wanted to do in terms of senior debt, but we made it absolutely clear that we would not take some unilateral position and that we would work in the context of Europe to produce what we describe as a pan-European solution.  It is important that a country whose economy is the same size as that of greater Manchester does not start telling bigger countries what it will or will not do.  If we go down the road of taking a unilateral position on these matters, we will find ourselves very exposed very quickly.  It will affect not only our reputation but also our economy and our ability to negotiate.  Small countries such as Ireland have always punched above their weight in negotiations.  We have a number of attractions and advantages, and taking up some unilateral position, for which the Senator has argued, would be dangerous.  We would find ourselves out in the cold very quickly, and then where would we get the funds to make sure pensioners and carers and the unemployed were paid so they could stay in this country?</P>
        <P>I will make one last point.  The Senator has suggested a number of alternatives within the budgetary position of his party, but they are based on bogus figures.  It would be a really good idea if all parties&rsquo; submissions were sent to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in advance of the budget.  Here is one fact for Senator Cullinane: 75% of all income earners in this country earn &euro;50,000 or less, and they contribute 19% of the tax take.  We have a very progressive tax system in that the more one earns, the more one pays.  The OECD has referred to that.  The real problem, traditionally, has been the number of people who do not pay income tax at the bottom.  Up to 36% of all people who are working do not pay any tax.  The numbers are not there to implement the Senator&rsquo;s budgetary solution for closing the deficit by taxing the wealthy, whoever they are.  Who are the wealthy?  That is an important question.  They are the people with mobile capital and assets they can remove, as I said in my previous contribution.</P>
        <P>Our position is to avoid levying huge taxes on work while there are around 440,000 people unemployed.  We must create an incentive for people to move from benefits to work.  However, we must also broaden our tax system, and the challenge for the Senator and his party, as we go into the budgetary process and in view of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to introduce a new property tax, is to tell us how Sinn F&eacute;in would do it.  The Government has already said that next year we will have to find &euro;3.5 billion; broadly speaking, this equates to &euro;1.25 billion in additional taxes and &euro;2.25 billion in expenditure cuts.  Let us take the &euro;1.25 billion on the tax side.  A property tax will take in, at best, &euro;0.5 billion.  Thus, we still have to find &euro;750 million on the tax side for next year.  That is a lot to ask in the context of the last number of budgets.  The challenge for the Senator&rsquo;s party is not to oppose everything.  It is living in a fantasy world in which it goes after the rich &mdash; a group it does not define &mdash; and leaves everyone else alone, with no cutbacks on the expenditure side, no tax increases for those on middle and lower incomes and just the small percentage of people at the top providing all the money that is needed.  The numbers are not there to justify that.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposal is a fantasy that can be presented as an alternative in five minutes on RTE, but when one looks at it properly, one can see it is not an alternative.  Yes, of course we can do more in the area of taxation, and we must weigh up the impact this would have on work.  I am not suggesting it cannot be done, but to say it is the solution is just fantasy, and anyone with any credibility from an independent economic organisation would come to the same conclusion.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State mentioned fantasy economics.  The provision in section 3, to the effect that we must put &euro;11 billion of borrowed money into a fund when we will probably need to draw down more than that amount, is fantasy economics.  For many years and possibly since before 2007, the parties that share an economic consensus &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party &mdash; have called Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s economic policies the stuff of fantasy.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State made a point about high earners and asked about where the money would come from.  Recently, a Central Statistics Office, CSO, report showed that the disposable income of the top 10% of earners in this State increased last year whereas everyone else&rsquo;s decreased.  This tells me that there is scope for people at the top to pay more.  The mobility of wealthy people&rsquo;s capital was mentioned, but the people who are moving are the young unemployed.  They are leaving this country because there is no leadership or employment thanks to the Government&rsquo;s policies.</P>

	<P>I will repeat my point.  It will be my last contribution on this section, as our debate on the next section will be important.  The only question of relevance or significance is whether the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, will work and whether the road we are on is the right one.  We can attack political parties&rsquo; policies and describe them as fantasies because that is what the Minister of State likes to do ideologically.  Sinn F&eacute;in was proven right when we stated that the measures being taken in 2007 and Fine Gael and Labour&rsquo;s pre-election promises last year would not work.  This treaty, in particular section 3 about which the Acting Chairman is precious, will not work.</P>

	<P>Appropriation Bills pass through the D&aacute;il &mdash; I presume they appear in the Seanad as well &mdash; whereby sums of money are appropriated every year for the provision of services and the payment of wages, yet we never debate them.  This section enables us to have such a debate.  Regardless of which side of the argument one is on, the sum of &euro;11.1454 billion is staggering.  The section authorises the Government to pay that amount.  We are in favour of it, as the sum must be provided in the overall context, but the significance of the section is worth noting and we must consider it carefully.  Although some of us disagree on the topic, this debate is worthwhile.  The section calls to mind the Appropriation Acts which have been passed without any debate whatsoever for a long time.  In opposition, Fine Gael criticised our Government for that process.  No one denies that is what we did every year.  Given the starkness of the figures, genuine debates would be worthwhile.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and declared carried.</P>
        <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 5</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the provision about which I feel strongest, as it is the most undemocratic element of the Bill.  I am glad it has been included, as it brings into the local arena all of the conceptual arrangements that are made and, curiously enough, immunised in the main article.  I received a message from the Cathaoirleach to the effect that my amendments were ruled out of order because agreements scheduled to Bills were not subject to amendment by the Parliament and, as such, we do not have the power.  A large section of this text is immune from debate, scrutiny or amendment.  That is regrettable, but I must accept the legal position.</P>
        <P>Luckily, the principle is enshrined.  We have an opportunity to debate and vote against section 5, as I shall.  The Minister of State must be committed to it because he is committed to the entire package and I will not expect him to accept my opinion.</P>
        <P>The section incorporates the series of immunities and inviolabilities that are rehearsed in this article of the international agreement.  They are matters of concern.  Section 5 reads, &ldquo;The ESM shall have within the State the legal status, privileges and immunities referred to in Article 32 of the Treaty&rdquo;.  Let us consider the article, which reads, &ldquo;The ESM, its property, funding and assets, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of judicial process except to the extent that the ESM expressly waives its immunity&rdquo;.  It also reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">4. The property, funding and assets of the ESM shall, wherever located and by whomsoever held, be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation or any other form of seizure, taking or foreclosure by executive, judicial, administrative or legislative action.</P>
        <P LI="1">5. The archives of the ESM and all documents belonging to the ESM or held by it, shall be inviolable.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P FLI="0">Its premises shall be inviolable.  In other words, no one, from lawyers, accountants, politicians to police, need have access to the ESM.  Where is the accountability and transparency?  We are creating a sealed unit, the &ldquo;Euro Slush fund Microwave oven&rdquo; &mdash; the ESM &mdash; because we will use it to cook the books.  No one can open the door to see how it is doing or what is happening.  Speaking as an academic and former chairman of the Friends of the Library in Trinity, how can we understand what mistakes have been or will be made unless people have access to its archives?  Although it is fantasy money, it is still ours.  This provision will land us in our individualised island pool of manure.  We are entitled to access to information.</P>
        <P>I am unsure about whether I made my next comment in this Chamber, but I certainly made it somewhere.  Imagine Mr. Berlusconi as one of the ESM&rsquo;s board members.  It could have happened and still could.  One never knows; politics is strange.</P>
        <P>We are giving away a great deal under this section.  I do not know what damage would be done by removing that provision.  I shall vote against the section.  I did not contribute on the previous two sections because they were identical to the immediately preceding section.</P>
        <P>As I had made all the arguments, there was no point in making any more.  I will contribute again when I know the response of the Minister of State, but I will not delay the House long.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>With a number of provisos, I do not really share the concerns of Senator David Norris.  Having immunity is commonplace in international organisations in foreign countries.  If a terrorist is appointed as an ambassador or to the diplomatic staff of a particular country, in general, that person will have immunity from criminal prosecution.  I presume the ESM will have its own disciplinary procedures.  If it does not and there are no procedures at the European level, I will be concerned.  Perhaps this makes the case for having a federal union.  I can certainly understand why an organisation such as this should not be subject to the criminal or civil laws of individual member states of the European Union, provided there is a sanction at a supranational level for breaches.  I do not believe there is a criminal law applicable to the European Union or eurozone, but I assume the matter has been dealt with.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns of Senator David Norris regarding the immunity of persons mentioned in section 5, as it could involve a grave issue.  However, I have read the section and noted the words &ldquo;in their official capacity&rdquo;.  As Senator Thomas Byrne noted, it makes perfect that people acting in their official capacity under the section enjoy immunity.  Those acting outside their official capacity will not enjoy such immunity; therefore, there is not much to concern us.</P>

	<P>Is that when they play golf?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Thomas Byrne outlined, there are numerous examples where there is immunity for persons across all levels of international organisations, with the key term being acting in their &ldquo;official capacity&rdquo;.  If we were to drop that term, Senator David Norris would be exactly right in that people would enjoy immunity in doing whatever they wanted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be exactly wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When the section applies to persons acting in an official capacity, it makes the workings of the ESM all the more efficient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators John Gilroy and Thomas Byrne have made the point exactly.  It relates to persons acting in an official capacity in so far as he or she is a board member of the ESM.  If the former Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Berlusconi, was a member of the board, he would have immunity only for his actions as a board member.  It would not apply to anything else, which is the essential point.  Senator Thomas Byrne is also correct in that the procedures in this respect are no different from those applicable in any other international organisation such as the IMF or the United Nations.  In Europe there is the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Asian banks are also no different.</P>
        <P>The board of the fund will be a separate legal entity and in our case the Minister for Finance will be a member of it.  My understanding is that the Minister for Finance in each of the countries that is a signatory to the treaty will be a board member.  The Minister for Finance is a public entity and answers questions in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  It is not a nameless individual.  I do not, therefore, have the same concerns as Senator David Norris on the issue.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides that the ESM shall have within the State the legal status, privileges and immunities set out in Article 32 of the treaty and the chairperson of the ESM board of governors, the governors, the alternate governors, directors, alternate directors, the managing director and other staff shall be immune from legal proceedings with respect to acts performed by them in their official capacity and enjoy inviolability in respect of official papers and documents.  Article 32 of the treaty sets out that the ESM shall have full legal personality and capacity to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property, contract, be a party to legal proceedings and enter into a headquarters agreement or protocols, as necessary, for ensuring that its legal status, privileges and immunities are recognised and enforced.  It further sets out that the ESM, its property, funding and assets, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of judicial process, except to the extent that the ESM expressly waives its immunity for the purposes of proceedings or by the terms of any contract, including the documentation of the funding instrument.  It also provides that the property, funding and assets of the ESM shall, wherever located and by whomsoever held, be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation or any other form of seizure, taking or foreclosure by executive, judicial, administrative or legislative action.  The archives of the ESM and all documents belonging to or held by it shall be inviolable.  The premises of the ESM shall be inviolable and its official communications shall be accorded by each ESM member and each state which has recognised the legal status and the privileges and immunities of the ESM the same treatment as it accords to the official communications of an ESM member.  To the extent necessary to carry out the activities provided for in the treaty, all property, funding and assets of the ESM shall be free from restrictions, regulations, controls and moratoria of any nature.  The ESM shall be exempted from any requirement to be authorised or licensed as a credit institution, investment services provider or other authorised licensed or regulated entity under the laws of each ESM member<i>.</i></P>
        <P>As the ESM is an international financial institution, euro area member states agreed to give the ESM and those working for it &mdash; the governors, directors etc. &mdash; diplomatic privileges and immunities in line with other international financial institutions set up by international treaty.  The privileges and immunities mainly relate to diplomatic immunity, taxation and exemption from any requirement to be authorised or licensed as a credit institution, investment services provider or other authorised, licensed or regulated entity under the laws of each ESM member.  A Government order under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 could not address in full the privileges and immunities provided for in the treaty.  Therefore, they are provided for in the Bill.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for a most interesting and informative statement.  It gets worse by the minute.  I may be out on a limb, perhaps with my colleagues from Sinn F&eacute;in, but I have a couple of points to make.  There has been a comparison with diplomatic immunity etc., and terrorists were brought into the debate.  I do not know how al-Qaeda was brought into it.  No legal instrument will protect against that group as if somebody wants to blow something up, it could be done.  However, that is not relevant to this debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Thomas Byrne has made the interesting comment that he assumes there is some kind of disciplinary procedure in place.  Perhaps the Minister of State might let us know if there is.  I have said the following on a number of occasions, but I am unsure if I have done so in the presence of the Minister of State.  There should be an international court to try individuals and organisations for economic crimes against humanity.  It happened at Nuremberg with IG Farben, Thyssen, Krupp and others.  One hopes the ESM will work all right, but I would like to think the idea would eventually be taken up, with people being held accountable, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>I wonder what is meant by the archives being inviolable.  As I would not want to see them being destroyed, they should be inviolable in the sense that they should be immune from attack or destruction.  Will the Minister of State reassure me that they will be accessible to scholars?</P>
        <P>The most farcical element is that immunity extends only to personnel acting in an official capacity.  I gave the example of Mr. Berlusconi and was perhaps a little unfair to him.  However, I am not interested in his bunga bunga.  I am not interested in any of them.  I simply could not care less, they do not interest me.  I cared about Donie Cassidy&rsquo;s golfing holidays because I thought they brought the Seanad into disrepute but I do not care about private lives.  I do not care.  It is exactly their official capacity that concerns me.  If they make mistakes with my money, I am worried; if they pick their noses at mass, I do not care.  It is their official capacity that interests me and that should be central so I do not understand why the Minister of State is saying this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State then gave a couple of examples.  I am glad he cited the United Nations as it is a classic example.  The utter lack of democracy and accountability in the United Nations is precisely why it is standing idly by again while people are being murdered in Syria.  The reason is that a small group of nations, five in number, the permanent members of the Security Council, each have a veto.  Like this, it is undemocratic.  That is not a good example from the Minister of State.  I have always strongly supported the United Nations but I remember the late Erskine Childers, who was either the son or the nephew of our distinguished former President and he was a senior United Nations official.  He gave a series of very interesting lectures on RTE radio.  He was passionate about his commitment to the United Nations but he highlighted the democratic deficit in the body and I fear the democratic deficit allowed under this Bill.</P>
        <P>In this case, with the ESM, we have a hermetically sealed unit with these enormous sums of money at its disposal but it is accountable to no one, not to the legislature, the judiciary or the police.  There should be some protection for any country that has a grouse against it.  I was also concerned about something that was let slip, that this is to do with diplomatic immunity in terms of the personnel involved, including their tax.  I would hate to think people given charge of this enormous amount of imaginary Monopoly money so they can cook the books would not pay tax for the privilege of doing it.</P>
        <P>If we give this total, comprehensive immunity and lack of accountability, the staff of the ESM are not answerable to the police.  We are not necessarily talking about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there is Interpol.  I am not expecting the garda&iacute; to raid the offices of the ESM or for the fraud squad in Harcourt Street to do an audit but I do not think putting in place blanket inviolability and making them immune is a good idea.  No thanks, I want answers and I want people to be accountable.  I want to know what they are doing and I do not want them to do it behind closed doors because that always leads to trouble.</P>
        <P>The example of the United Nations is a very good one and I thank the Minister of State for handing it to me.  Let us reform the United Nations, make it accountable, remove the veto from the five permanent members and make it something decent.  We should make the ESM decent by establishing an international court to try people for economic crimes.  I will supply a list of them, including Goldman Sachs and all the ratings agencies.  They are still around and no one is bothered about taking them on.  The Government is too scared to take on the ratings agencies.  The reply always comes back that there must be confidence.  Finance is not poetry, it is not Coleridge, it is not the willing suspension of disbelief, there should be reality behind the money and I want to know what is happening in that little sealed bunker, whether it is in Berlin, Frankfurt or Ballybough.  I want to poke my nose into it and find out what is going on.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State wandered a little from the topic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It was all relevant but what Senator Norris said is correct.  The context of this discussion, and the way in which we are being presented with this treaty, and inviolability that goes with it for the fund itself and the members of the board, is that people are fearful of a lack of democracy, scrutiny and oversight in Europe.  They know these concepts created some of the problems we have and at a time when there is a greater call for proper accountability.  The explanatory memorandum on section 5 states that the section provides that the ESM will be immune from legal proceedings and enjoy inviolability in respect of officials and documents.  The Minister of State spoke about the board being free from regulation and control.  The Minister of State can appreciate why there are concerns when we are setting up a fund involving massive amounts of money, all of which come from the taxpayer.  We disagreed about whether to put money in, although we will be putting money in if this Bill is passed but the board and the fund itself enjoys inviolability.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s sentiments.  At a time when there is a need for more accountability and oversight, we need to see the removal of the immunity granted to the fund itself and its board members.  I have not been persuaded at all by the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  When he read the list of things the board is exempt from, it reinforced that this should not be supported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris should read the European directive document on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions because the very point he is making about credit rating agencies is being addressed in that, although it is only a draft document.</P>
        <P>I took some time out to listen to the debate on Committee Stage with the Minister for Finance on section 5 and it was very informative.  The taxation issue, from what I am told, is double taxation.  If someone is working here and then goes to wherever the ESM will be based, he or she should not be taxed on the double, similar to those who work in the European Parliament and other areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They should be taxed where they work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a choice they can make.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>From what I gather from the conversation about immunity from legal proceedings on Committee Stage, a person who wants to take a case for political purposes in the Irish Supreme Court will not be allowed to advance the case.  That is a good thing because we have seen people take cases to the Supreme Court for political purposes and the taxpayer ends up paying for it.  During the fiscal stability treaty referendum campaign, the day before the moratorium, another court case was brought to the Supreme Court for political purposes, for more coverage that cost the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an accusation that is unsustainable and I respectfully ask the Senator to withdraw it, particularly in light of the comments of the distinguished judge in the case, who was grateful to the appellant in the case, Deputy Pearse Doherty, for opening up an important constitutional point.</P>

	<P>Article 37 concerns a dispute resolution process within the treaty.  It is comforting that the European Court of Justice has jurisdiction in that area.  It is not as if the ESM can operate on its own and do what it likes.</P>
        <P>Members of the Oireachtas have inviolability or potential inviolability with respect to their private papers according to the Constitution.  We have immunity from suit in respect of what we say in this and the other Chamber.  We have immunity from detention on and when travelling to and from the premises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We are elected, or some of us are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave examples of embassies.  There have been problems with diplomatic immunity during the years when bad people, including drug traffickers and terrorists, claimed immunity.  The system does not always work perfectly.  Immunity in the context in question, however, is relatively common.  The purpose is to allow people to get on with their jobs.  The reality is that if an individual country could decide to pit its police force or civil service against the ESM, it could wreck the whole system.  It would be a way of breaching one&rsquo;s obligations.  The arrangement is sensible, although I would prefer if there were a criminal law mechanism at a super-national level to cover people.  There is a gap in this regard if there is no such mechanism.</P>
        <P>We are reduced to conspiracy theories in this debate.  The provision in question is commonplace and not new in regard to the ESM.  There are far more important matters to be debated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was dealt with on Committee Stage in the other House.  Article 28 of the treaty states an internal audit function shall be established according to international standards.  That is <i>pro forma</i>, as Senator Thomas Byrne stated.  Article 29 refers to an external audit.  It is clear in the legislation we are adopting that the accounts of the ESM shall be audited by an independent external auditor approved by the board of governors and responsible for certifying the annual financial statements.  The external auditors shall have full powers to examine all books and accounts of the ESM and obtain full information on its transactions.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, the staff of the ESM who will be from Ireland and other nations are negotiating at official level the internal rules of the organisation.  As with any organisation that must be set up from scratch, there ought to be internal controls and rules.  The staff will come to an agreement on the matter shortly.  The official agreement will be brought to the board which is to be representative of all the signatory countries.  In our case, the Minister for Finance will be the representative.  A person with a public personality will be questioned.  The board&rsquo;s job will be to ensure the proper functioning of the ESM such that it will carry out its mandate as set out in the treaty.  The rules will be in place and involve all staff members.  As with any organisation, it will take a while to have the staff members established.</P>
        <P>There are to be by-laws of governance for the board of directors.  These will be put in place and ready for board approval when the ESM enters into force.  Of course, it is not yet in force because we require the 90% rule to apply before its establishment.  It is expected this will happen shortly.</P>
        <P>On the question of accountability, I have stated the ESM will have a board of governors comprising the Minister for Finance of each of the euro area member states, with the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro, Commissioner Rehn, who is known to this country, and the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Draghi, as observers.  The ESM will also have a board of directors.  Each euro area country will appoint one director, with one alternate director.  The board of governors will appoint a managing director responsible for the day-to-day management of the ESM and the managing director will chair the board of directors.</P>
        <P>While I hear what colleagues are saying, I would admit it if the treaty were a radical departure regarding existing international treaties to which we are a signatory and international bodies of which Ireland is a member.  It is not such a departure.</P>
        <P>Senator Thomas Byrne made a good point on our status as elected Members of the Oireachtas.  There are privileges Members enjoy and they are set out under the Constitution.  The immunities and privileges for the ESM relate only to people who are carrying out their official functions; they do not relate to any other aspect of their lives.  While I understand Members&rsquo; concerns, they are being over-egged in respect of the establishment of a body such as the ESM.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is being helpful.  When he states there is nothing radical or no new departure, I acknowledge his point.  However, he has implied we should follow defective models instead of correcting the mistakes that have been made clear in the models for other international organisations.</P>
        <P>Senator Thomas Byrne has stated there is immunity in the Oireachtas.  It is partial immunity.  On committees, for example, it extends only partially.  Questions have been asked about this.  I remember when Members of the Oireachtas were held before the courts for various reasons when they tried to test this aspect.  Included among them was a distinguished member of the Minister of State&rsquo;s party.</P>
        <P>The difference is that we are elected.  For that reason, there is privilege to allow freedom of discussion, but that discussion is reported in the newspapers and it is open.  We are immune from libel proceedings, but we are not immune from reportage; that is the difference, even though we are elected.  Therefore, the argument is false.</P>
        <P>What worries me very much &mdash; I am sure it was just a mistake of judgment or expression &mdash; is Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy challenging the right of a citizen to go to the Supreme Court.  That is lamentable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture on offshore oil and gas exploration.  The report focuses on an interesting and topical area of public policy and a range of diverse subjects and issues.  The joint committee invested considerable time in the preparation of the report.  Detailed evidence was taken from a range of parties and considerable time was spent in considering the information gathered.  The work of the joint committee culminated in the publication of a detailed report which makes a total of 11 recommendations.</P>
        <P>I am sure the joint committee&rsquo;s report will make a valuable contribution to the debate on how we should manage our indigenous oil and gas resources to ensure the best result for the people of Ireland.  The 11 recommendations included in the report reflect the broad nature of the report and address a number of themes, including the following: recognising the importance of Ireland&rsquo;s legislative and strategic policy approach being fit for purpose; bringing a focus to specific aspects of the non-fiscal regulatory regime; considering interactions involving the public in general, as well as those relating to the communities of areas where development activity is planned; and the tax terms that should apply in the case of future commercial discoveries.</P>
        <P>This is the first opportunity for either House to debate the joint committee&rsquo;s report since it was published last month.  I look forward to listening to the contributions of Senators on the report in general and the recommendations contained therein.  I commend an important aspect of the report, namely, the inclusion therein of a detailed amount of factual material on Ireland&rsquo;s historical experience of offshore exploration.  This information is presented in a well structured, helpful and accessible manner to the reader.  There have been occasions when debate on this subject area has been premised on myth rather than facts and it is a positive aspect of the report that it captures so much detail in a single document.  Understanding Ireland&rsquo;s petroleum exploration experience in the past four decades is important to a balanced consideration of what fiscal terms are appropriate for the country.  Understanding our experience relative to that of neighbouring jurisdictions is, however, critical.  It is helpful, therefore, that the reports contains considerable detail of Ireland&rsquo;s exploration history and some detail on neighbouring jurisdictions, in particular, Norway.</P>
        <P>Before engaging in a discussion of the report and its recommendations, it would be useful to, first, consider the wider environment within which policy and the regulatory framework is set.  While the report recognises that the principal national legislation governing exploration licensing is more than 50 years old, a broad range of more recent national and European legislation also applies to activities in the sector.  Much of this legislation addresses health and safety and environmental issues and is not specific to the oil and gas exploration sector.  This is of relevance to some of the recommendations and a point to which I will return.</P>
        <P>At a general level, I can make the following observations about the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  On initial consideration, there are recommendations that appear both sensible and desirable, while others are already covered by the existing licensing conditions and regulatory regime.  Some recommendations need to be explored further, including several which have wider public policy implications, while there are others in respect of which I have strong reservations and remain to be convinced that they offer the right way to proceed.</P>
        <P>I will address the recommendations in the context of the four general themes I have outlined.  The report proposes that there be a clear and transparent fiscal and licensing regime which provides certainty for the State and the industry alike.  It goes on to recommend that the 1960 Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act be reviewed and that changes not be made retrospectively to the fiscal licensing terms.  It also stresses the need for a clear strategy governing Ireland&rsquo;s approach to petroleum exploration, pointing to the merit in such a strategy having an input in other initiatives such as the public consultation on the &ldquo;Our Ocean Wealth&rdquo; document.</P>
        <P>The 1960 Act is important in setting out the high level exploration licensing regime and the rights conferred by the various authorisations.  In the period since it was enacted a broad body of legislation at national and European Union level has also been enacted which is of direct relevance to petroleum exploration and production activities.  This includes planning, safety and environmental legislation and against that background, my Department commenced a review of the 1960 Act earlier this year, which is ongoing.</P>
        <P>I agree with the joint committee that it is important to have a licensing regime that communicates both stability and certainty to industry.  This is especially true in circumstances in which Ireland is competing with other countries to attract exploration investment in the case of an industry where the nature of the business requires the taking of a long-term view.  For this reason, I welcome the recommendation of the committee that no retrospective change should be made to the licensing terms.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a very clear strategy in this sector, key elements of which are to seek to maximise the benefits to the people of Ireland from its indigenous natural resources, to provide opportunities and encourage private industry to take the risk associated with investing in exploration, to take initiatives to deepen knowledge of the potential of its offshore, in particular through supporting key research projects and to seek to have a robust regulatory regime in place to ensure that activities are carried out in a safe manner that does not harm the environment.  In the future, it will be necessary to keep our strategy under review to ensure it remains fit for purpose in what is a constantly changing environment.  As today is the first debate on what is a substantial and detailed report, I do not propose to dwell in detail on each individual recommendation.  I will, however, comment briefly on the recommendations relating to the maximisation of production from a commercial field, the principle of unitisation and the issue of flaring of gas.  If I am clear in my understanding of what the committee had in mind with each of these recommendations, then these issues already are addressed to a considerable degree by the existing licensing terms, together with the Department&rsquo;s own industry-specific rules and procedures.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the recommendations relating to public consultation and &ldquo;community gain&rdquo;.  The statutory obligations requiring public consultation in the case of petroleum-related projects are very detailed and extensive.  I do not know whether the recommendation is a statement recognising the value of public consultation and advocating continuance of the <i>status quo</i> or a suggestion that adequate public consultation is not already provided for.  While I appreciate the latter might be perceived as being the case by some who made submissions to the joint committee, the reality is that all major infrastructure consent processes involve a public consultation phase, generally including an oral hearing.  These requirements are not industry-specific and the obligations result from both national and European legislation.  This means that any future oil or gas development project would be subject to a number of consent processes, each of which would have a detailed public consultation phase.  The &ldquo;community gain&rdquo; concept is interesting.  As a concept it is clearly not industry-specific.  It also is complex, as communities are not homogenous and as a result what some may consider a gain, others may consider a loss.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in granting planning consents under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, has included specific &ldquo;community gain&rdquo; conditions in some cases.  The question of introducing such a provision on a statutory basis is a far broader question and would of course have implications well beyond the subject matter of this report.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the recommendation in the report that has generated the greatest level of interest since its publication, that is, the recommendation for an almost doubling of the existing tax rate applying to petroleum production.  As I already acknowledged, the report includes a good deal of useful historical information in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s experience of offshore exploration.  While the report recognises that &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s petroleum potential is largely unproven&rdquo;, it does not address how this situation should be remedied in the future.  The changes in the tax regime proposed are not of a minor or modest nature.  What is proposed is a fundamental re-positioning of Ireland&rsquo;s tax terms, bringing its tax on profits from petroleum production to a similar level as that of the United Kingdom and, in the case of very profitable fields, imposing a higher tax level in Ireland than that which applies in Norway.  Norway, Members will recall, is the country to which some people advocate the Government should hand over the running of this industry.  The proposal is that this new tax regime would apply in the case of discoveries made under exploration licences granted in the future.</P>
        <P>The report sets out four main reasons for proposing these tax changes, namely, high oil prices, the impact of advances in technology on exploration success rates, the fact that not all regions with petroleum potential are politically stable locations for investment and recent positive indications from exploration off Ireland&rsquo;s south coast.  The first two of these factors, namely, high oil prices and new technologies, do not give Ireland any comparative advantage.  They do not make investing in exploration in the Irish offshore more attractive relative to investing in the North Sea or elsewhere.  I should add that advances in technology in the exploration sector, like most other sectors, tends to be of an incremental nature.  It is still a fact that without exploration drilling, no new discovery will be made.  This is a critical factor for Ireland, as drilling levels in the Irish offshore remain very low.  Incremental advances in technology may help but more drilling is essential.  Political stability as a location for investment is an advantage that Ireland has over certain other regions.  However, this is by no means a new or indeed an exclusive advantage.  It is also an advantage that is enjoyed by our neighbours, Norway and the United Kingdom, which have better prospectivity that has been demonstrated through decades of successful exploration.</P>
        <P>The final factor that would appear to underpin the report&rsquo;s tax recommendation is the positive news from recent drilling off the Cork coast.  While the drilling results are encouraging, further work is required to establish whether this discovery can be declared to be commercial.  If this discovery is declared to be commercial, that could be expected to have a positive impact in attracting more exploration investment to the region.  However, the potential impact should not be overestimated and needs to be put in context.  It would be positive as a new commercial discovery and Ireland&rsquo;s first commercial oil discovery.  It would, however, also only be Ireland&rsquo;s first commercial discovery in well over a decade, with the last commercial discovery, the Corrib gas field, not yet in production.  While it would be positive news, it would not by itself make Ireland the new North Sea.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I do not wish to be negative or to undersell Ireland as a location for exploration investment, quite the contrary, but one must deal in realities.  The reality is that the Irish offshore is underexplored and its petroleum potential is largely unproven, particularly when compared with other petroleum regions such as Norway and the United Kingdom.  The statistics on exploration drilling and on producing fields speak for themselves.  A total of 156 exploration and appraisal wells have been drilled to date in Ireland&rsquo;s offshore, compared with more than 1,200 wells in Norway and 4,000 wells in the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom has in excess of 300 producing fields while Ireland has only three, with a fourth in development.  Norway is the second largest gas exporter and the seventh largest oil exporter in the world.  Ireland on the other hand imports more than 95% of its gas and 100% of its oil requirements.</P>
        <P>In my view, Ireland&rsquo;s focus should be on how to encourage an increase in the level of exploration investment and exploration drilling in particular.  This is what is needed if we are to establish the true petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.</P>
        <P>It is important to recall that the principal factor driving exploration investment decisions by industry is the likelihood of making a new discovery.  The challenge is how to improve the industry&rsquo;s perception of Ireland&rsquo;s prospectivity relative to that of other countries.  Exploration drilling is the key.  Last year we had one exploration well and this year there may be none.  That is the backdrop against which we are having this debate.  We have to recognise that Ireland is competing with countries such as Norway and the United Kingdom to attract mobile international exploration investment and cannot set its tax terms in isolation or we risk discouraging potential investment.</P>
        <P>I thank the joint committee for its detailed report and look forward to hearing the views of the Members of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a few points on the report.  I am not a member of the joint committee that prepared it.  However, I commend the work of Deputy Andrew Doyle and the committee, including Fianna F&aacute;il Senators Paschal Mooney and Mark Daly who would have participated in this debate but are unable to be here for it.</P>
        <P>The points made by the Minister are not lost on me.  We do not want to scare away the few prospectors who come our way.  More should be done to attract exploration companies to Ireland.  There are, clearly, scientific reasons certain areas are more rich in natural resources than others, but when one considers that there are 300 fields in the United Kingdom and three in Ireland, it makes sense that we should do all we can to increase the drilling taking place and ensure we extract the maximum amount.</P>
        <P>I am also conscious that we must obtain an appropriate return from the resources at our disposal.  While a 40% figure is radical, it is something that could be looked at.  Oil and gas are finite resources and their supply will decrease rather than increase.  In that context, we would have little to fear in striking a rate that was higher.  Exploration companies would still come.  As the Minister pointed out, we enjoy political stability and a number of factors are in our favour.  The Minister has said they are not exclusive to Ireland, but they will become more exclusive as time passes.  Because we are dealing with finite resources we would have nothing to fear in underlining the return we must get for them.  Large companies are prepared to put considerable resources into what may turn out to be fruitless drilling expeditions.</P>
        <P>I am interested in the report&rsquo;s recommendation that we engage with our Norwegian and Portuguese colleagues and other countries with which we have direct relationships and which might be more intimately involved in exploration and not as dependent on the expertise of exploration companies as we are.  We might learn from them how to increase our involvement, or about the potential for joint ventures with exploration companies in order to maximise our return.  If we are not prepared to charge 40% on profits, there may be scope for us to have a piece of the action if we are prepared to take some of the risk.  We may be able to enjoy some of the profits of fruitful offshore exploration.</P>
        <P>In Ireland we tend not to have retrospective legislation or taxation.  While I appreciate that reputational issues are at play, I would not overvalue reputation.  The entire world&rsquo;s reputation has been damaged in recent years on a great many levels.  Doing the right thing can supersede any reputational damage.  We might look to South American countries, although the reputations of some of them might not be great.  Venezuela completely redesigned its hydrocarbon legislation to the benefit of the state.  The Minister has said he is not in favour of upping the return to 40% for all new licences, but is there potential to look at existing licences to see if we could extract more from them?  Resources are finite and a limited number of revenue streams are available to us, particularly in these times of recession.  Is this something at which we could look?  Is there a commercial angle for the State in existing licensing arrangements?  It would be foolish not to throw our eyes over this, in the event that an opportunity could be spotted.</P>
        <P>I agree with much of what the Minister has said.  I commend those who participated in compiling the report and hope the Minister and his officials will be able to reflect on some of the points I have raised.</P>
        <P>While we have him here, the Minister might comment on the fracking issue which is important in my part of the country.  Senators Paschal Mooney, Imelda Henry, John Kelly and Diarmuid Wilson also come from the part of the country affected by it.  I know the Minister is aware of the huge fears in the area, which I share.  My stated position, for now, is that I am against fracking.  There seem to be mixed messages and individual and group agendas at play.  Listening to media interviews with representatives of the company, I am not imbued with confidence by their car salesman approach.  I heard the chief executive of the company on Ocean FM, speaking from Hong Kong.  The fear of people in the north west and the Shannon basin is justified, when one considers that France, a country hardly noted for its energy conservatism, has suspended all fracking activities, pending further investigation.  A longer term study in the United States will not produce conclusive results for quite a few years.  I know the Minister has spoken with the EPA.  It is being suggested that if it wants more resources from the Department, it should give more detailed answers to the questions people are asking.</P>
        <P>I have always promoted western development.  The north west, being peripheral, needs extra help.  If there is a bounty in the earth that can help that region and be extracted safely, we will all cheerlead for it.  For now, however, there are so many variables at play that I am concerned about damage to the water table and other environmental by-products of this activity.  On the one hand one has the polished car salesman approach of the company and, on the other, one has what people might describe as propaganda-type films &mdash; one was shown previously but I have never seen it.  In the middle there are many people who have genuine concerns.  I hope the Minister can enlighten us somewhat on it.  Sometimes the enlightenment might be that we cannot do anything currently because the information is inconclusive.  In the event that the information available to the Minister is inconclusive then the safest thing to do is to do nothing until such time as we have conclusive, detailed information available to us.  I apologise for going off on a tangent on fracking but I took the opportunity to say it given the presence of the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  It is important that we are addressing the work that has been carried out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture as access to oil and gas could be welcome components of a successful economic recovery.  The committee has produced an informative report stretching to more than 200 pages arising from various hearings the committee held between September 2011 and March 2012.  I hope the Minister and his departmental officials will take much of what it contains on board and that he will work on the findings.</P>
        <P>While the Department has responsibility for the exploration of oil and gas, it must be borne in mind that an independent body, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has responsibility for the regulation of the activities of the oil and gas industry with respect to safety.  The separation of responsibility was identified as a necessity during the Corrib dispute by Peter Cassells who said that it was an unsatisfactory position that the Department was charged with promoting gas and oil exploration and the monitoring of the construction and inspection of the pipelines.  This shows that there have been problems in the past but that we are learning from them for the better.  The report adds to the bank of information.</P>
        <P>This country imports more than &euro;6 billion worth of fuel every year, some from parts of the world that are currently experiencing much upheaval thus resulting in higher fuel costs.  I have spoken many times previously about the problem and how we should examine renewable, indigenous sources of energy.  We must also look for potential sources of hydrocarbon fuels in this country both onshore and offshore to reduce our dependence on imported oil and gas.</P>
        <P>This country has not been a successful destination by international standards for offshore exploration companies with only four commercial discoveries since the 1970s, namely, Kinsale, Ballycotton, Seven Heads and the Corrib gas field.  In terms of the number of exploration companies operating, the report indicates that this country is just about managing to avoid a net loss and that there was only one new entrant in 2011.  According to the committee&rsquo;s report we have had 182 wells drilled but only 24 have been for development and production.  In its appearance before the committee in September 2011, the Department recognised the poor number of wells drilled when it said that we are typically doing one mile per year which is extremely low.  It said that we needs tens if not hundreds more wells to make an impact.  The way to change those figures is to create the conditions, be it through our taxation policy and-or how we award licences to exploration companies.  The more wells drilled, the better the odds of finding more commercial fields.  That will be achieved by issuing more licences, which will follow from attracting more licence applications, which will happen when the conditions in this country are attractive for the location of the industry.</P>
        <P>We should look at the number of applications under the 2011 round of licensing when 15 applications were received.  In comparison, in the recent round of applications in the United Kingdom 350 applications were received.  The comparison might be similar to comparing apples and oranges as the United Kingdom has proven vast commercial finds since the 1970s but it is an indication that we must work harder to get the applications.  No one is suggesting that we sell off the options for buttons but we must look at the models we use while protecting the resources for the State and the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>The report makes 11 recommendations.  They were developed to encourage the exploration of the natural resources for the benefit of the nation.  We must do everything in our power to encourage both domestic and overseas exploration companies to identify this country as a location in which to set up operations.  Some of the recommendations include a review of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Act 1960 to enable a clear and transparent fiscal and licensing regime; that the State should keep those regimes under constant review; the obtaining of geological data from all licensees is of paramount importance; that the State should consider ways of controlling production volumes as part of its resource management; and there should be a clear and comprehensive public consultation process at the first substantive stage, thus avoiding situations such as the Shell to Sea campaign.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is recommended that the tax take should be a minimum of 40% but I agree with Senator MacSharry that I would be flexible on it if it meant getting more business.  We must examine that issue.  An important recommendation is that the Minister would draw up a strategic policy document for petroleum exploration in addition to maintaining the ongoing contact with other countries such as Norway and Portugal with a view to the exchange of ideas and to learn from their experiences.  A recommendation that makes much sense is the prohibition of gas flaring.  How many times has one seen on television shots of oil platforms burning off considerable amounts of valuable gas?  One could run a lot of barbecues with all the wasted gas.</P>
        <P>The offshore island gas industry has contributed to the development of the economy through discoveries such as the Kinsale gas field which was discovered by the exploration ship <i>Glomar North Sea</i> in 1971.  The find resulted from the search for oil which started in the 1960s in the Celtic Sea.  No oil was found then but the international exploration company, Marathon, discovered gas in waters only 100 m deep and a further 1000 m below the sea bed.  The field was developed in 1976 and the first gas was brought ashore.  Currently, it supplies approximately 15% of this country&rsquo;s natural gas needs and when new fields such as the Corrib gas field come on-stream we will further reduce our need for imported fuels.</P>
        <P>With advances in technology, fields once considered non-commercial can now be harnessed.  The Barryroe field, which was discovered in 1973 by Esso in shallow waters off the Cork coast was classified as non-commercial.  I believe it should now be included in the commercial finds column as data released by Providence Resources since the report was published in May forecasts 12,500 barrels of oil per day and 11 million cu. ft. of gas per day.  The economic threshold for market viability of a field is 1,800 barrels per day.  This model allows for horizontal wells, which while more expensive than conventional wells are much more productive and have less well heads, thus ensuring that significant savings can be made on extraction.  It is believed that a potential saving up of to &euro;650 million could be made on that find alone and the money could be invested in further exploration and development.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Barryroe holding, Providence Resources has holdings at Spanish Point and the Burren.  In the 1940s we were told that this country had little if any natural resources.  We had low grade coal, lead, silver and a lot of turf which has become an issue in the recent past.  The notion that oil or gas could exist onshore or offshore was laughed at, yet many things have changed in the past 70 years.  I commend the report to the House.  I especially thank the members of the Oireachtas joint committee, the oil and gas industry for the figures, SIPTU, community groups, the Norwegian Government and officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for their work in preparing the comprehensive report.</P>

The report is an important volume and a benchmark which allows us to have an informed debate on this important issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The report is important in that it puts to rest much of the wishful thinking and fanciful discussion that often surrounds debate on the issue.  Every once in a while information appears to suggest that oil has been found off Dalkey but we must remind ourselves that it is Dalkey and not Dallas we are talking about.  I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s position in that I am reluctant to race to imposing more stringent or severe tax penalties on energy exploration.  We must encourage exploration rather than discourage it.</P>
        <P>Senator White is not present but some years ago when Mr. Padraic White was chief executive of the IDA he pointed out that one of the difficulties they had in attracting investment was that people were reluctant to give up any portion of their idea or project and would rather see it wither on the vine than hand over any element of it.  What I am saying is that 20% of an enterprise that is productive is better than 100% of an idea that is not realised.</P>
        <P>Sometimes we have a very strange view of things.  I am not someone who is in any way dismissive of environmental concerns &mdash; on the contrary &mdash; but one would have to ask whether these can act as a deterrent.  We hope for all sorts of discoveries off our shores, but the minute we do find something &mdash; we have done so only sparingly so far &mdash; we try to impede it by protesting and objecting.  We must consider the practical realities and try to achieve a balanced and sustainable way of using our resources if we strike oil off the west coast.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With the permission of the Acting Chairman, I would like to deviate slightly from the subject of natural resources.  Rather than talking about resources we would like to have, we should concentrate on exploiting properly the resources we actually have.  The finest and best natural resource in this country is water.  No one can dispute this, as it does not seem to have stopped raining this year.  I will take this opportunity to ask the Minister, through his good offices around the Cabinet table and as Minister with direct responsibility for the semi-State company, Bord na M&oacute;na, to expedite and embrace its project to establish at Garryhinch the first reservoir to be built in this country in 70 years, because Dublin and the Leinster region are running out of water.  It is our most important natural resource and is central to all industrial development as well as being used for agricultural, domestic and commercial purposes.  It is absurd to have any further delay on this project, which has been kicking around for the last decade.  In terms of natural resources, that is something we need to expedite.</P>
        <P>With regard to resources we do have, there is a proud tradition in the Castlecomer-Crettyard area of coal mining.  Its coalfield has become redundant over recent decades, but with the advent of modern technology and machinery, it could be revived.  There is a tradition of coal mining in the area and there are men who have first-hand knowledge of mining coal, many of whom are unemployed.  Ireland is importing coal, but there is a viable coal seam in that region.  Perhaps the Minister would find out within his Department why there is such an undue delay in issuing a licence in the Castlecomer-Crettyard area to extract the resources that are there, which would result in import substitution and eliminate the need to bring in coal from Poland and elsewhere.  This would result in the production of hundreds of tonnes of coal, worth tens of millions to the economy, and would put 50 to 70 men back to bountiful work.  I beg the Minister&rsquo;s indulgence on these points, which are connected to the issue we are discussing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House again.  Similar to Senator Whelan, I am a little out of my depth on this issue.  I am no J. R. Ewing but I do want to talk about some of our energy resources.  I would like to question the Minister on the Corrib natural gas field.  I know he received a report from the Western Development Commission some months ago which contained recommendations about bringing natural gas to the west and north west.  It suggested that this would save millions for local businesses.  As I have mentioned before, the Shannonside Co-op in my own town of Ballaghaderreen uses more electricity than the whole town of Castlebar, so it would be very important for this gas to go along the natural route east.</P>
        <P>The issue of fracking was raised by Senator MacSharry.  The problem with fracking is fear of the unknown.  We do not really know what is likely to happen if we allow companies to engage in it.  I welcome the report that has been commissioned in the US, and the sooner we see it, the better, because this issue is of grave concern to many people, especially in my part of the country.</P>
        <P>With regard to our energy resources, there are many new technologies coming on stream, and I am conscious that things will keep changing over the next 20 to 25 years.  I gave an example of that today by mentioning companies that are creating energy in different ways, and as time goes by there will be new initiatives and technologies.  The one I presented today was an example of cheaper electricity generation.  It is green, clean and neighbour friendly and it does not create an eyesore in the landscape.</P>
        <P>On that subject, as the Minister knows, wind energy is my pet project at the moment, but I am concerned that unless we start to consider other technologies to generate electricity, our landscape will be destroyed by wind turbines.  I know it is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion that we will not have wind farm developments at every crossroads in the country, but I am concerned about something that happened in Donegal County Council last week.  Councillors were asked to lift the 500 metre restriction on the distance between wind turbines and houses, and they were sold the story that unless they did so, Donegal would not achieve even 3% of its wind energy targets.  If Donegal cannot achieve 3% of its target while maintaining the 500 metre restriction, I can guarantee that turbines will be at every crossroads in the country, and particularly in Donegal.  I have grave concerns about that.</P>
        <P>The Minister has been helpful, suggesting to me that there should be public consultation on these issues and that there should be community gain, and I agree with him.  Unfortunately, to date, public consultation has happened only after the deal is done.  I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by Mainstream in which it provided details of a proposed project.  That is what I call public consultation.  It did not do things in reverse order, signing sweet deals with farmers and saying what is in it for them before telling the public what it proposes to do.  I welcome the announcement, although I hope the project does not affect the human right of people to live in peace and harmony in the countryside.  I hope there will be community gain, public consultation and public agreement.</P>
        <P>In addition, I hope that when such companies announce the creation of, for example, 4,000 jobs, these are actual jobs.  When it comes to such announcements, there is always a certain amount of spin attached.</P>
        <P>When I met the Finnish ambassador to Ireland in this House recently, I asked him about wind farm developments in Finland.  He said that when wind energy was first introduced in Finland, everybody was happy with it as it was green and clean and they liked the turbines and so on, but now there are many objections to such developments, and if there are objections to a project, it does not go ahead.  They do not force such projects on people who do not want to live beside them.  We must think hard before we decide to destroy our landscape with wind turbines that will be an eyesore for years into the future.</P>

	<P>We know it is his pet hate.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, which was responsible for drawing up this report, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue today, as I participated in the discussions that led to its publication.  Offshore oil and gas exploration has become a more topical issue in recent years owing to activities around our coastline, including the recent work that I hope has led to the discovery of an oilfield.  I am relieved that offshore exploration remains somewhat uncharted territory for two reasons.  First, the Constitution vests ownership of all natural resources in the State which is in the driving seat and sets the criteria for exploration and tax regimes.  It has a heavy responsibility in ensuring licences are awarded in a transparent way that prioritises the common good.  Under other regimes, too often decisions were taken for the wrong reasons and, as the late Seamus Brennan put it, matters were worked out on the back of an envelope.  The people are fearful of what gas and oil exploration means for them.  They are sometimes distrustful of politicians and fear that vested interests will win the day.  Everywhere they can see examples of inappropriate projects being given the green light because of nod and wink politics.</P>
        <P>The most controversial part of the Minister&rsquo;s contribution relates to the tax regime.  He mentioned that the proposed changes to the regime were not of a minor or modest nature.  I am one of those who drew up the report and went through it in detail.  It proposes four tax bands.  The larger the find, the more profitable it is and the higher the tax paid.  The proposal depends on profit ratios.  The Government&rsquo;s approach differs from that of its predecessors, in that it prioritises transparency and accountability.  For this reason, the committee&rsquo;s report was important.  It was produced by a democratically elected group representing the full spectrum of opinion within the Oireachtas.  Informed by consultation with many relevant groups, the report takes account of a carefully considered range of factors.  It also makes a clear recommendation on the need for greater public consultation.  We need an informed public debate.  Oireachtas Members have a responsibility to inform themselves on these matters, given the potential economic and environmental importance of offshore oil and gas exploration to the State.</P>
        <P>My second reason for welcoming the report is that for the first time it brings these issues to the forefront of Government decision making.  We will look to some of our neighbours to determine best practice.  As the Minister and other Senators have stated, the committee studied the position in Norway and Portugal, with particular emphasis on fiscal regimes.  It has identified Norway which has a more developed offshore sector than Portugal as a model for how the exploration industry can be managed to a country&rsquo;s best advantage.  We are fortunate that we can learn from our Nordic neighbours in this regard and I urge the Minister to take full advantage of the Norwegian experience.</P>
        <P>I emphasise the need to build public trust and confidence in this area.  The committee has recommended that the Minister establish a forum of key stakeholders through which a policy on offshore exploration could be devised to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s hydrocarbon resources are maximised for the benefit of the people.  We do not need another situation similar to that in respect of the Corrib gas field.  Policy formulation and licensing must be characterised by transparency and informed discussion.  I wish the Minister well in this important work.</P>

        <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate and hope it will form part of a wider debate that will lead to the Government implementing the report&rsquo;s proposals on the taxation of oil and gas profits and its other recommendations.  The report was the consequence of the Minister agreeing last year during a debate on my party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion in the D&aacute;il on oil and gas exploration to establish a review.  While it does not naturally embody all of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s recommendations for changes to the licensing and review terms governing oil and gas exploration, it goes a considerable distance in that direction.  It is highly significant that it won all-party approval at the committee.  This proves that, regardless of the sarcastic references during the D&aacute;il debate by some Government Deputies to Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s alleged Darby O&rsquo;Gill economics, most Members came to realise that the current regime was a travesty.  Anyone familiar with the current terms will know of the political background to the changes and the role played by the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, and others who did not exactly cover themselves in glory in other areas of responsibility.  The claim that the changes were made in the best interests of the State and its citizens is no more accurate than the claim that certain planning approvals were granted in the best interests of anyone other than the developers involved and their political cronies.</P>
        <P>The report recommends a minimum tax rate of 40%, increasing in certain circumstances to 80%.  That would bring the State into line with other states and take us out of the lower range of international oil and gas profit tax rates.  There are also recommendations in respect of greater public supervision and involvement in exploration.  Unsurprisingly, the companies&rsquo; response was to claim that any change would act as a disincentive.  I was disappointed to note that, yesterday in the D&aacute;il, the Minister appeared to support this line in response to a question.  It is true that exploration off of our coast is difficult and costly.  As the estimates of the value of what is forecast to be brought ashore from the Corrib gas field prove, however, there are significant payoffs.  This explains not only why exploratory drilling continues but also the eagerness with which companies take up licences.  This is indicated in the report which states 2011 saw the highest number of licences ever awarded.  It was crazy that these licences were issued under the old terms before the Minister had received this report.  The companies are not taking up licences for the good of their health.  They are doing it because they know that they will make handsome profits.  It is not a hobby or charitable undertaking.  They have calculated the risk and the investment and have decided that it is worth their while continuing.  This confidence has been repaid recently, as exploratory drills have confirmed large deposits in fields off the Dublin and Cork coasts.  These finds will bring the companies involved considerable profits.  Given that they are extracting natural resources, it is only correct that they be expected to pay a reasonable rate of tax.</P>
        <P>My party proposes that the State take a majority 51% share in all finds and establish an exploration company.  It is essential that it have the same direct input as other states such as Norway have.  The success of the Norwegian state&rsquo;s involvement is illustrated, perhaps ironically, by the fact that Statoil is one of the licensees in the Corrib field.  Apart from ensuring the State is directly involved in the extraction of oil and gas, the establishment of such a company would ensure it would have full knowledge of the results of exploratory drills.  This is essential, given that anecdotal evidence from people who have worked on rigs suggests the full results of oil and gas finds have not been disclosed.  This also suggests that, in some instances, the companies involved have decided to sit on the finds as part of future reserves.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  It was waffle and he did not make a major point or give any indication as to where he stood on the recommendations made.  The tone of his flippant and dismissive reply is an insult to the work of the committee which spent hours working on the report and its recommendations.  His only concrete statement was that he did not wish to be negative or undersell Ireland as a location for exploration investment, but he is underselling Ireland.  Is he acting on behalf of citizens or the oil companies?  His statement today and previous statements seem to place him on the companies&rsquo; side.</P>
        <P>The report is in line with the opinions of many of the Minister&rsquo;s trade union colleagues in SIPTU which recently published a report on the oil and gas industry.  Its recommendations on using the industry to derive benefits and create employment in the State need to be taken on board.  Not only should we benefit from the tax regime, but we should also ensure the creation of as much employment as possible in a unionised sense.  Security of supply is an issue.  From my reading of the licences, there is no such security.  The companies could choose not to sell the oil and gas to the State.  Where are the Justin Keating principles?  Which Minister will stand up for the right of the people to ensure the greatest value for the State is derived from our natural resources?  It should not be done to the companies&rsquo; benefit.  They are not out there for the craic; they are there to make significant profits.  The Minister is following the line of previous Ministers by siding with the companies as opposed to citizens who have a right to a just reward from the State&rsquo;s natural resources.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I was very interested in the comments of my colleague from Sinn F&eacute;in who has reservations about the Minister&rsquo;s position.  I would probably share some of them.</P>
        <P>I will go back to the beginning.  My interest in the issue was first sparked by the Keating principles.  That was a long time ago, in 1975, when I was beginning to get interested in politics.  I knew Mr. Justin Keating who was the son of the great painter Se&aacute;n Keating.  He was a man of incisive intellect.  He was a vet and an academic.  He also had a strong commitment to the social values of the country and the constitutional notion that the wealth of the country should belong initially to the people.  I know my colleague, Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, mentioned the Keating principles, but it is worth putting more flesh on them.</P>
        <P>The first substantial legislation on the use of Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas reserves was introduced in 1975 by Mr. Justin Keating during the term of office of a Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition Government.  He was part of the Labour Party element.  It was modelled on international best practice to ensure the people would benefit substantially from their own oil and gas reserves.  Under the legislation, the State could acquire a 50% stake by right of viable oil and gas reserves discovered.  In addition, production royalties at a rate of between 8% and 16% and corporation tax at a rate of 50% would accrue.  In exceptional cases the 16% rate could be increased.  The legislation also attempted to prevent the energy companies from sitting on exploration licences by specifying that they should begin drilling within three years of the date of issue of an exploration licence.  I take it, or I hope, the Minister supports this and perhaps he might indicate his attitude towards the Keating principles which seem extremely fair.</P>
        <P>In our experience of exploration we have got into bed with some very peculiar people, although they are powerful and large, buying publicity all over the place.  I am speaking about companies such as Shell.  I dissociated myself from and ceased my subscription to <i>National Geographic </i>- a wonderful publication &mdash; when it was bought by Shell for propaganda purposes and to show that it was environmentally clean, etc.  We will not ever forget what the company has been doing and continues to do in Nigeria or the dangerous situations it has provoked all over the world.  There was a murky case in which the company admitted complicity in the murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa and fined.  These companies need much governance.</P>
        <P>I accept that there is a judicious balance to be struck because until recently this was a marginal area and there was a problem in attracting companies with the necessary wealth to engage in highly technical deep water drilling.  The rewards potentially are enormous.  I compliment Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill and Deputy Andrew Doyle for producing this report which contains much information.  The potential can only be realised if we understand the level of exploration required.  There are potential reserves of 10 billion barrels-of-oil equivalent in the Irish Atlantic margin.  I know it may be difficult to get at it, but technology is increasing in its sophistication, such that reserves that were inaccessible years ago are now well within economic range.  Oil prices are also continuing to rise; therefore, what might not have been commercially exploitable ten years ago is now most certainly commercially exploitable because we have the technology available.</P>
        <P>I have sympathy for the people involved in Shell to Sea, although attempts were made to discredit them by <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>, or looking at the people they mixed with.  I was warned that I was associating myself with Eirig&iacute;, etc. but I am not scared by this if the idea is right.  It is as simple as that.  It is clear that we have much potential in our position.  Looking at the map, we have an enormous segment of the Atlantic shelf.  We are concerned with oil and gas exploration, but there are many other elements that can be taken into consideration.  The scientific unit in Galway, with the two research ships, is doing an enormous amount of extremely valuable work in understanding how these elements could be used to the benefit of the people.  The principle must be that they are used to benefit them.  I am sorry the Minister has, apparently, set his face completely against retrospection.  The Russians had no difficulty, in dealing with the same company, in introducing retrospection and renegotiating the entire deal.  I suggest this could be considered in the case of Shell and the Corrib field.</P>
        <P>What is the current position on Rockall, the ownership of which is disputed?  It is probably the focus of a mineral rich area under the seabed and its position in international law is unclear.  I remember attending a conference in the Royal Irish Academy a number of years ago at which international legal experts teased out the issue.  We appear to take one view and the British another, as they want it too.  Our claim seems to be much stronger.  I ask the Minister to update us on the position.  If it has not yet been clarified, I ask him to make a very strong defence of Irish interests.</P>
        <P>The Minister has indicated he has examined the recommendations made in the report which, on initial consideration, seem both sensible and desirable.  He has been positive, detailing the ones which have been covered and those that need further exploration.  He has also outlined the recommendations about which he has strong reservations; I take it that retrospection is one of these but perhaps he has further information to give us.</P>
        <P>The strategy outlined by the Minister, if carried into effect, is reasonable, but it is a statement of intent rather than anything directly practical.  Seeking to maximise the benefits to the people is clearly in tune with the Keating principles and I very much hope the Minister will be in a position to comment on this.  I have a motion on the Order Paper requesting the Government to revive and implement these principles.  The Minister has also indicated a wish to provide opportunities and encourage private operators to take the risk associated with investing in exploration and deepening knowledge of the potential of offshore resources.  I have referred to the work being done in Galway in this regard.  The Minister has also outlined the need for a robust regulatory regime.</P>
        <P>As I have been involved in the business of the House for the entire day from the Order of Business onwards, I have only had a little time to glance at the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  I do not intend any discourtesy if I misrepresent or misunderstand what I have read quickly.  I am not sure if he referred to regulation, not just in the financial sense in order to produce the maximum yield for the people but also in terms of safety.  In the case of Shell, there were a number of violations of safety regulations, environmental protection and planning laws.  The BP oil spill was referred to in a report produced by SIPTU which might be recommended to the Minister.  It sought proper safety regulations.  I hope the Minister will take this into account.</P>
        <P>It would be useful to receive an update on fracking.  This is a new method of exploration, particularly for gas, and it involves the introduction of water at high pressure into the geological strata at a considerable depth.  It has been successful in both Canada and Poland in producing significant gas yields.  On the other hand, there are serious concerns about the environmental impact of this method of mining, particularly the effects of the unanticipated release of gases into the atmosphere and pollutants into the water table.  Perhaps the Minister might refer to this.  I may have to go somewhere else, but I will read his reply.  I encourage him to use everything at his disposal, including the weapon provided by this excellent report, to extract the maximum benefit from our natural resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>The main issue I wish to mention is that of community gain, the term used by the Minister and to which the report of the committee refers.  We have not been good generally where an industry has affected communities.  There was a programme on TG4 on ore mining in north Tipperary, around Nenagh, and the lakes of leachate and other materials left behind which have since destroyed the environment of the area.  The community did not gain from that project.  I am also thinking about the mining of coal in the Slieveardagh area, specifically around Ballingarry and the Commons, where communities were depleted of their resources and when the mine was closed, the communities never recovered.  We have, however, a shining light in the area.  While there is a lot of criticism in some areas of the pharmaceutical industry, my experience in County Tipperary is that the pharmaceutical companies have become involved in the community, not just through financial sponsorship but by becoming involved with community efforts, driving environmental projects and generally being of benefit to the community.  Will the Minister tell us how he sees this issue progressing and how the petroleum and other offshore industries can help out in this regard?</P>
        <P>I have had some contact with people involved with the liquid gas project in Tarbert.  To the best of my knowledge, the project is ongoing and the Minister inherited it.  There is great potential for job creation and I would like to think there is also an opportunity for community gain.  Something, however, is blocking the project.  We are talking about the report today, but I would appreciate it if the Minister commented on this project also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was a member of the committee that prepared this report and we met a variety of stakeholders, both in committee and externally.  Therefore, I welcome the opportunity for the House to discuss this important element of the Irish make-up, particularly if we manage to have a successful flow from the Atlantic seabed, as seems to be initially indicated.  Perhaps we are in for better times.</P>
        <P>The report debunks the notion that the tax regime introduced and altered by various Governments, dating back to Justin Keating&rsquo;s first regime, is somehow overly generous.  In comparison with the regimes in other European countries, it is generous, but time and again the report points out, not just from its own sources but from independent sources, that the Atlantic seabed is an inhospitable place, as we can see from the lack of success so far.</P>
        <P>The most important issues relate to community interests.  We should be getting a flow from the Corrib gas field by now.  We are two years late at this stage, which is primarily, although not exclusively, a result of local protests.  I fully support the right of anyone to protest and if I lived where those who are most active in protesting live, I might have a different perspective.  Having said that, the last Government and the Government before it were negligent in the manner in which they dealt with local community interests.  One of the major recommendations of the report is that we consider the vital issue of how best we can ensure community consultation and consent which can be considered to be independent by all of those concerned.  When a resource is found, there should be a system in place to ensure agreement on how it is to be developed in such a way that it maximises the take for the State and its citizens, while, at the same, being sensitive to local needs in the host community.</P>
        <P>In our dealings with the Norwegians we discovered they did not put the cart before the horse, as happened here.  They went out first and looked after the planning, environmental and community issues.  Everything was put in place and all the building blocks were laid before the go-ahead was given to drill.  This relates primarily to significant offshore drilling where the results are processed offshore.  There are only one or perhaps two onshore processing plants, but they went to great trouble to ensure they were accepted.  We asked them about the onshore processing plant located about half way up the Norwegian coast and were told the objections were from people who did not like having it in the line of sight.  That reminds me of what is happening in Dalkey, where people are complaining that they do not like the notion of a drilling platform in their line of sight in the beautiful vista out over the coast.  That was the only objection expressed.  When asked how far residents were from the onshore processing plant, the question was not fully understood by the senior Norwegian official until we asked if they lived a mile or two miles from the site.  She replied that they lived beside it, that it was part of the community and had not generated the same opposition as the Corrib site.  I am not comparing like with like; I am simply pointing out that has been their experience.</P>
        <P>The history of how we arrived at this point makes for interesting reading.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I commend those elements of the report to Members.  The report states quite baldly that Ireland has serious disadvantages with regard to offshore exploration for oil and gas reserves by comparison with other locations.  In 1985, the 1975 exploration and production terms, as referred to by Senator Norris, were changed by the then Minister through reducing State royalties.  In 1986, the coalition Government introduced further changes by abolishing State participation rights for marginal fields.  In 1987, there was a change of Government and a new Minster for Energy.  Later that year, the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister announced new fiscal terms that included the exemption of all oil and gas production from royalty payments and a 100% tax write-off against profits on capital expenditure for exploration.  In 1992, the then Minster for Finance made a further change.  In 1997, the current regime, under which the current Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is operating, came into being.  The outcome of the licensing round as a result of those changes suggests the strategy of offering two-year licensing options rather than offering frontier exploration licences has a positive result.  The number of proposed awards is the highest of any frontier round, the first of which was in 1994.</P>
        <P>I will leave Members with the following caveat: although the State was more successful in attracting applicants than previously, an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> in 2011 did, however, highlight the fact that none of the world&rsquo;s major oil players applied under the licensing round.  Therefore, those who perpetuate the myth that Irish exploration terms are so generous that they are bleeding the country dry need to go back and read this report.  They will find the facts therein.  I fully support what the Minister is doing in this regard.  What will happen will benefit the Irish taxpayer in the medium to longer term.</P>
        <P>I concur with the remarks of Senator Norris.  The Minister may have an update on hydraulic fracking, to which subject I do not have time to devote today.  I gather the issue is still dormant in that the company in question has not yet applied for a drilling licence.  If the Minister has further information, I am sure the House would welcome it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I commend the committee and its report.  I am not a member of the committee but particularly welcome the clarity of the recommendations, the manner in which they are laid out and the work members have done to achieve this.</P>
        <P>I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s view on a couple of the observations of the committee, particularly on the consultation process involving local communities.  We all know now that there is no way in which any project of this nature can be embarked upon without consultation with local communities.  We have almost arrived at a position in which we need to know what constitutes best practice for consultation, such that it will be genuinely effective and in order that some parts of the community will not believe others have usurped their opportunity to speak.  Given the sorts of arguments that break out at community level, we need to ensure that when the process is put in place, it will have been put in place in the best possible way to ensure it will have real meaning.  The people in local communities must feel they have genuinely been consulted and that they will be listened to.</P>
        <P>Let me consider the idea that legislation should be kept transparent and simple.  I am sure this is welcome.  Those who examine legislation always wonder what most of it means.  There is much at stake, as Senator Mooney reminded us.  It is not as if companies are queueing up and that we are bleeding the taxpayer dry.  This is not the case.  What we want to do is have an industry and develop it correctly and appropriately.</P>
        <P>The recommendation for the prohibition of the flaring of gas is very specific.  It is worth making and I am heartened to see it in the report.  Has the Minister any observation on it?</P>
        <P>Other Members have referred to the relationship we may have with Norway.  I am sure the Minister stated in the past that the circumstances of Norway and Ireland are not the same, but I hope the Department will draw on Norwegian experience and expertise, if it is available and if the Norwegians are willing to assist us.  That would be good.</P>
        <P>I welcomed the news earlier this week on the wind farms being set up in Offaly.  While this is not directly related to the committee&rsquo;s work at this point, I recommend the investment and welcome the export opportunities that were mentioned.  This sort of progress is a reminder to us all that hydrocarbons are ultimately going to run out.</P>
        <P>Like many other Senators, I will take the opportunity to mention fracking.  One item of information I have been looking at relates to reports from Alberta, Canada, earlier this year.  The relevant authorities have become very concerned about recent reports about water contamination and the use of methanol.  Fracking is a new form of exploration and has been described as a &ldquo;brute force technique&rdquo;.  These are probably good words to describe the process.</P>
        <P>The 2011 US Congress report discloses that fracking fluids often contain substances such as coffee grinds, salt, ceramic balls, walnut hulls, lead, petroleum distillates and methanol, thus showing that anything can be used in the process.  Therefore, it renders it unsafe.  We need to have a serious debate on this.  We will raise the issue again.  We acknowledge that it will be part of the debate on how we look after our future energy needs.  Consultation will be extremely important because this is such a difficult area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire ar ais go dt&iacute; an Seanad.  The offshore petroleum industry, as yet undeveloped, has the potential to be an important contributor to the State&rsquo;s economic recovery if substantial discoveries are made.  I am sorry I was not present for the Minister&rsquo;s speech and, therefore, I hope I do not repeat some of his points.</P>
        <P>The Irish Offshore Operators&rsquo; Association is concerned that a key recommendation of a recent report includes a proposal for a tax take as high as 80% of profit, which seems excessive.  The proposed tax rates are comparable to or higher than those in Norway, which has an established industry and a high rate of commercial discovery and which refunds 78% of the cost of unsuccessful exploration.  Taxing a fledgeling, undeveloped industry in Ireland at the same rate as a mature, developed industry significantly discourages companies that are currently considering Ireland as a location for exploration.</P>
        <P>The Irish offshore industry effectively commenced in 1973.  At that time, despite the drilling of numerous exploration wells, there was not a single commercial discovery and interest in Irish offshore exploration more or less petered out.  It was proposed to reduce the tax rate to 25% but the poor discovery rate persisted and industry interest in Irish offshore exploration continued to decline.  Of the 30 companies that have operated wells off Ireland, only five remain in any way involved, and of that five, only two are active in exploration.</P>
        <P>There has been a lack of drilling success between 1975 and 2011.  Only one significant commercial discovery, the Corrib discovery, was made.  By contrast, in 2010 alone in the UK sector, eight new fields came on stream, with a further 13 new projects approved for development.  In terms of drilling success, and notwithstanding the recent announcement regarding the Barryroe discovery, Ireland lags far behind the North Sea, unfortunately, and is seen as a poor bet for exploration investment.  For instance, mobilising a rig from the North Sea and installing it off the west coast will cost around &euro;6 million before a meter is drilled.  A single deep-water well off the west coast can now cost between &euro;70 million and &euro;80 million.  Ireland is perceived as an unrewarding and difficult place in which to do business.  The extreme difficulties and delays in bringing a discovery into production in Ireland are well appreciated internationally.  This is a country which depends on imported oil and gas for over 90% of primary energy.  The new companies that have been awarded licences, while most welcome, are relatively small and, with one exception, there is an absence of companies which could be described internationally as household names.  Norway is averaging approximately 50 explorations and appraisal wells per annum.  It has 71 producing fields, with a further 64 at various stages of planning and approval, and another 49 discoveries awaiting evaluation.  As far as the international oil and gas industry is concerned, Ireland continues to have serious reputational problems.</P>
        <P>The offshore industry has already brought significant benefits to Ireland, at both national and levels, and has the potential for much more.  Since 1978, the Kinsale Head gas field, together with its satellite fields, Ballycotton and Seven Heads, has provided energy security, clean fuel, taxation revenues and employment.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann was established, and the original national gas grid constructed, on foot of the Kinsale Head development, as were the Nitrigin &Eacute;ireann plant at Marino Point and the ESB gas-fired plants at Aghada and Poolbeg.  The significant concentration of process industries, such as pharmaceuticals and food, in the Cork Harbour area was facilitated by the availability of Kinsale Head national gas.  The original and subsequent capital expenditures on the field amount to more than &euro;1.5 billion in today&rsquo;s money, which is no mean fact.</P>
        <P>The Corrib gas field, from now until completion of construction, will sustain 1,465 full-time jobs.  During production it will sustain 175 full-time jobs.  The extension of the natural gas grid to the north west, which would have been uneconomic without the support of the Corrib gas, has already brought natural gas to 12 towns in north Galway and Mayo, with the possibility of more.  A report by the Western Development Commission in September 2011, which examined the benefits of extending the gas grid to a further 11 towns in the north west, estimated that &euro;20.6 million could be saved annually in fuel costs between commercial and domestic users if natural gas were made available in these towns.</P>

	<P>As there are no other Members indicating to speak, I call on the Minister to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members of the House who contributed and repeat my appreciation of the Members of this House who were members of the committee that compiled the report.</P>
        <P>I regret that one Member of the House seems to consider that I ought to have come in to the debate today with decisions already made on the report before the debate on the report commences.  That is not a reasonable position.  That is what I was accused of last year when I stated it would take some considerable time for the joint committee to do its work and that I had to get on with the business.  The joint committee now has done its work and this is the first time the report has been debated.  It has not yet been debated in the Lower House or in the committee itself.  It is right that I should listen to what Members have to say before I make any decisions.</P>
        <P>I also commend the House on the extraordinary creativity that brought in wind turbines, fracking, water reservoirs, Rockall, eels and LNG.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Fracking is specifically referred to in the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand corrected.  If Senator Landy does not mind, I will give the eels a miss.  On the LNG matter he raised, I can inform him that I sincerely hope and expect the regulator will announce a decision before the end of the month.  It was delayed again, as the House will be aware because I was here recently, as a result of complaints lodged with Brussels but the expectation is that it will make the decision by the end of the month.  I hope that will be good news for Tarbert and Kerry and for diversity and security of supply for Ireland.</P>
        <P>I do not disagree with what Senator Whelan stated about the capacity of Bord na M&oacute;na, with thousands of acres of cutaway bog at its disposal, to deal with the water issue.</P>
        <P>There is no fracking.  That is important.  There will not be any fracking until we have evidence-based advice available to us.  I am sure most Members of the House agree with that.  The EPA has made an initial report and the funding has been assembled to enable the EPA to conduct the kind of extensive study that would seek to allay the fears of people or produce scientific evidence on the practice by which Senators Mooney, MacSharry, O&rsquo;Keeffe, Norris and Kelly can be assured, one way or the other.  We do not yet have that scientific advice available to us.  Indeed, it is not available elsewhere, although in certain states of the United States it has had the most dramatic impact on prices.  Whenever we discuss the bigger picture, I will come back to that issue in terms of energy.</P>
        <P>I will proceed to some of the more major points.  First, I agree entirely with Senators MacSharry, Mulcahy and Whelan who stated that the issue is how to balance attracting investment and getting a return for the people.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh advocates that I take a 51% stake and impose a tax level of up to 80% and he completely ignores the fact that there is no drilling going on.  He stated that there are significant pay-offs which explains why exploratory drilling continues.  Sadly, exploration drilling does not continue.  There was one well drilled in 2011 and none so far in 2012.  It is difficult to have this debate if, as Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh communicates to me, like some others, that he would be far happier going to bed at night in the comfort that we have a 51% stake in anything that is found, we have established a State oil company and we have an 80% tax rate, but we have no find.  It seems to be entirely irrelevant that we do not make any find.  The fact is we need the comfort blanket of saying: &ldquo;By God, those large oil companies will pay through the nose if they come to Ireland.&rdquo;  Sadly, they have not been coming to Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised with me the Keating principles established in 1975.  The expectation in 1975 was that, as a result of what Senator Terry Brennan described, Ireland would have an offshore experience similar to that in the North Sea.  Sadly, this has not been the case and only one find, the Corrib field, has been made since.  I do not propose to discuss the Barryroe field and ask Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh to bear with me in this regard because neither he nor I has information from that field yet.  I wish the company involved every success and will await the outcome of drilling there.  The position remains that the Corrib field is the only find made since 1975.</P>
        <P>I have genuine difficulty understanding how anybody can argue with the necessity to increase economic activity by attracting companies which will carry out exploration and drilling.  Without them, we will not find whatever oil or hydrocarbons are in our waters.  Senator David Norris spoke of there being 10 billion barrels of oil in Irish waters.  We do not know if that is the case because it is an unproven, unestablished figure that featured in a report on potential oil finds in Irish waters.  I sincerely hope 10 million barrels are available, but we must first find them.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not have sufficient investment capacity to establish a State oil company to drill empty wells at a cost of &euro;80 million per attempt.  We do not have that kind of money.  The question is how one pitches a tax regime that is consistent with attracting serious players into our waters to undertake the drilling and prospectivity required.  My mind is not closed in this matter and I am happy to listen to arguments in this and the Lower House about what should be done.  However, the fact of the matter is that the Keating principles did not produce results and it was my colleague, Mr. Dick Spring, another Labour Party Minister who held office after Mr. Keating, who loosened the terms governing exploration in the mid-1980s precisely because we were not having any success.</P>
        <P>I have been accused of many things but never of being on the side of the oil companies.  If that is the way Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh wishes to see it, that is fair enough.  Dick Spring was not on the side of the oil companies either when he made the decision he had to make in the mid-1980s.  Unfortunately, we still did not get results.  We heard a passing reference to the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, and innuendo and so forth.  There is no evidence that less restrictive terms produced results in bringing oil companies flocking to our shores to engage in drilling on the Irish continental shelf or elsewhere in Irish waters.  This brings us to the decision by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Eamon Ryan, to alter the tax base in the Finance Bill 2008 by implementing a sliding taxation scale ranging from 25% to 40%.</P>
        <P>Senators who are also members of the joint committee did not take the opportunity to explain the reason they had selected Portugal and Norway as comparators.  There are similarities with Portugal which has, from memory, a tax rate of 27%.  The joint committee decided to recommend a tax rate of 80% which exceeds the Norwegian rate of 78%.  Why did it compare Ireland with a country with which it did not have a similarity?  If one drills an empty hole in Norwegian waters, one is refunded 78% of the costs incurred and the strike rate in Norway is beyond our wildest dreams.  If we only had the Norwegian strike rate for one year, it would make a considerable contribution to resolving our current difficulties.  I do not understand the reason the joint committee did not recommend adopting the Portuguese tax rate, as distinct from the Norwegian rate.  It is the uniquely advantageous geological structure of Norway that produces its extraordinary strike rate.  One could go into a Paddy Power office and place a bet on having one strike in four drills, whereas one could drill around the Irish coast for a long time before finding another Corrib field.</P>
        <P>While I have not made up my mind on this matter, I have a genuine difficulty in understanding how it would be a source of comfort to some people or how they would sleep easier in their beds at night if we had a tax rate of 80%, took a 51% stake and did not find any oil or gas.  I would prefer to find some gas, if it is to be found, and some of the 10 billion barrels of oil to which Senator David Norris referred.  Let the Minister for Finance of the day then decide what he wants to do about it.</P>
        <P>Senator David Norris has stated I appear to have set my face against retrospectively making changes to the tax regime.  I remind the House that for reputational and other reasons the joint committee, in one of its 11 recommendations, proposes that I should not change the tax regime retrospectively.  This is not my recommendation but one made by the joint committee.  The Senator also made some sensible remarks.  He has stated he does not mind with whom he is associated and that he will continue to support the Shell to Sea campaign.  It is correct that the companies involved in the Corrib field took their eye off the ball and there were genuine local community interests which should have been addressed.  Since that time, however, the State has bent over backwards in every way it can.  In so far as it is known to man to make safe the bringing ashore of gas, this has been done.  Uniquely on the planet, we are engaged in constructing a tunnel under Sruwaddacon Bay at a cost of &euro;400 million.  What else can one do to improve the safety prospects locally?  The &euro;400 million cost will be written down against the costs of developing the field, which means the Exchequer must forgo &euro;100 million in taxation.  This cost is only a small element of the difference between the &euro;1 billion anticipated cost of bringing the gas ashore and the &euro;3 billion costs incurred as a result of delays.  This is supposed to be a victory for the people.  Is it a patriotic achievement that the project has cost &euro;2 billion more than anticipated, that immense reputational damage has been done to Ireland abroad and that we have not yet brought ashore one cubic centimetre of gas?  Something about the sea brings out a soft-headed romanticism in Irish people with which I find it very difficult to deal.  We are either serious or not about exploiting an indigenous resource that may be available but difficult to find and achieving from it the optimum benefit for the people.  I hope we can also develop an industry in the process.</P>
        <P>Senator Marc MacSharry counselled a joint venture.  If we have an industry and make a number of finds, that appears to be a sensible approach to take.  However, we are trying to get companies with expertise, deep pockets, skills and a track record to engage in prospecting and drilling off the Irish shoreline.  We could very well do with a find.  Three finds since the days of Justin Keating is a very poor return, especially when compared with the endless finds made off the coast of Norway and elsewhere.  This is the comparison that must be made and I am glad of the opportunity to start this debate because the report from the joint committee deserves to be debated in both Houses.  Members should regard this as the beginning of this debate.  I do not have a closed mind on it but people who have definite views on this matter must deal with some of the questions I have raised because I have practical decisions to make.  The decision is whether to frighten off any prospect of drilling off our shore or whether I should be persuaded to impose a tax regime that has the probability of attracting heightened economic activity off our shore and, hopefully, the better prospects of making a find in the interests of the people.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 1</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>First, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  During the Second Stage debate last night, Members went over the various aspects of this Bill in great detail with the T&aacute;naiste and at the time I noted it was somewhat historic in that three of its four elements relate to past events.  I reiterate Members&rsquo; welcome &mdash; I believe it was unanimous &mdash; for the accession of the Republic of Croatia.  However, in the context of the protocol that is about to be put into law through its inclusion in the original 1972 treaty, I wish to raise again with the Minister of State an issue I raised with the T&aacute;naiste.  Unfortunately, because of the division of ministerial duties yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste was present for the first part of the debate while the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, attended its second part.  As a result, the Minister of State referred only to those contributions he had heard during his presence and there was nothing about contributions during the first half of the debate.  Given the Minister of State&rsquo;s European affairs role, she may be able to provide clarification in respect of the meeting that took place recently in Rome between Angela Merkel and representatives of Italy and France, in which there was some talk of a figure of &euro;180 billion being set aside as a form of stimulus package that would involve the European Investment Bank, EIB, unspent Structural Funds and other sources.  Reference was made to the aforementioned sum of &euro;180 billion and were the Minister of State to clarify, I would be grateful.  Obviously, it would be in the Government&rsquo;s interests to be able to access funding for infrastructural projects in particular, which from what I have been reading is being discussed in the margins at least.  The focus of my query is whether the Minister of State has positive news in this regard, whereby Ireland might be able to access money to be used for structural projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator and regret my absence from the Chamber yesterday, as I was in Luxembourg to attend the General Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no inference at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.  However, given the way it transpired, it was somewhat inconvenient for the House, for which I apologise.  I was in Luxembourg at the General Affairs Council.</P>
        <P>Briefly, on the issue of stimulus, funding availability and what may or may not be available, it would be irresponsible of me to raise expectations about underspent Structural Funds.  This is entirely a good news story, in that Ireland is one of the best countries at absorbing Structural Funds.  In consequence, there are no unspent moneys available to us.  By the end of the current financial framework, Ireland will have spent all the money available.  This applies to the new member states of the European Union, particularly countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, which have huge difficulty in absorbing Structural Funds and which are finding it very difficult to so do.  As I stated before the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs this morning when this exact question arose, as one of the more developed member states with one of the best records in absorbing Structural Funds, Ireland should assist these countries.  If Structural Funds can benefit newer member states to the east in respect of expenditure on roads or whatever, it benefits everyone because obviously, Ireland has goods and services, as well as skills and labour, to provide.  While this would be beneficial to Ireland and we should be working to assist those countries, it has proven very difficult.  In some instances, they have absorbed only approximately 10% of their allocated funds, which is quite startling.  Unfortunately however, there are no unallocated funds for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The good news, however, regarding the figure of between &euro;160 billion and &euro;180 billion mentioned by the Senator is that it specifically relates to European Investment Bank funding.  Last Monday evening in Luxembourg, I attended a dinner with Werner Hoyer, the President of the European Investment Bank.  He is a former counterpart of mine as he was the German European affairs Minister until January this year.  He is highly constructive and very engaged and is extremely positive towards Ireland and the programme countries.  He is conscious of the need to prioritise investment in countries such as ours, which are struggling at present and which could do with some form of injection of growth stimulus.  The figure of &euro;180 billion is approximate and it could vary upwards or downwards.  Potentially, it could range between &euro;150 billion and &euro;200 billion.  It will arise, assuming there is agreement at tomorrow&rsquo;s summit on a &euro;10 billion capital injection into the EIB, which will dramatically increase its funding capability.  Werner Hoyer, in conjunction with the President of the European Commission, last week circulated a joint paper to all the Heads of State and Government, which in essence stated that with a &euro;10 billion paid-in capital injection from the member states, the European Investment Bank could leverage that amount up to &euro;60 billion for strategic infrastructure projects.</P>
        <P>In the aforementioned paper, they detail quite well how they would do this, with a focus on youth unemployment, training opportunities for young people, strategic infrastructure in the form of broadband etc., as well as the green energy and technology sectors.  This is very much in sync with Ireland&rsquo;s national priorities and we could really benefit from it.  The &euro;60 billion available from the European Investment Bank would be then be leveraged up, through co-financing and various private funding mechanisms, to the figure of approximately &euro;180 billion.  This comprises a significant capital injection for the EIB.  The bank does not lend its own capital or taxpayers&rsquo; money but borrows on the financial markets.  Consequently, its triple-A status is of huge importance and one slight difficulty we must overcome is to identify how the EIB can invest in countries such as Ireland that do not have triple-A rating without compromising its own rating and therefore its ability to borrow on the markets.  It is a little complicated, but Mr.Werner Hoyer, the president of the European Investment Bank will visit Dublin next Dublin and will meet the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin to explore opportunities.  I am friendly with him and he has expressed his sincere and genuine interest in working with Ireland to identify projects that would be a good fit for the EIB, helping it to maintain its credit rating yet also being very beneficial for Ireland.  It is a good news story.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for that very comprehensive reply.  Ireland is still drawing down some Structural Funds under the original 2007 to 2013 programme.  Has the Government formulated its priorities and set out a plan in anticipation of this funding or will it wait until the money is on the table before it decides on how it will be spent?  We are borrowing this money.  How does the rate of interest compare with the 3% interest rate that applies to funding under the bailout programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>It depends on the availability of funding for the EIB and on the individual projects.  I do not think I can give the Senator a figure for a flat rate of interest, as much as I would like to.  It is below cost funding and the rate of interest is very competitive.  For countries such as Ireland, it is very attractive.  Countries in a stronger financial position might in fact be able to access financing at a cheaper rate elsewhere, depending on the domestic situation but for countries in the position that Ireland is in, it would be below cost and very attractive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are doing a great deal of preparatory work.  The Cabinet committee on European affairs has met on a number of occasions and the key ministries, the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have been charged with looking at potential projects.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is overseeing that and has already done quite a bit of work on it.  To respond to Senator Mooney&rsquo;s question on whether we look for the money first and identify the project afterwards, the answer is absolutely &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That would not work with the European Investment Bank, it makes its decisions on a project-by-project basis.  The EIB is a commercial entity and operates in a commercially viable context and therefore it is important that we go with obvious projects that can fit the criteria that have been outlined by the European Investment Bank.  It is worth noting that companies such as Bord G&aacute;is, for example, has successfully attracted EIB investment.  It is not just a question of the State accessing this money.  Banks can access finance from the EIB, as well as semi-State companies.  There are a range of opportunities and we are exploring all of them.  The key outcomes from the summit tomorrow is that we get agreement on the paid in capital.  In principle that was agreed at the ECOFIN Council so it should be agreed by the Heads of State and Government tomorrow.  That is our first priority.  Our second priority is to ensure that unlike the initial project bonds initiative, which focused very much on transnational major infrastructural projects, which ruled out projects in Ireland because we are a small island country, we must ensure there is flexibility about the types of projects so that smaller countries, such as us, can benefit from the opportunities.  That is already acknowledged by the European Investment Bank in the paper I mentioned, which was co-authored by Werner Hoyer and Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso and identified specifically the sort of language we have been pushing for.  They identify a priority programme country, peripheral countries, small islands and so on.  We are very much on their radar and that will make it much easier when we go with our projects to be able to say that as per the Council decision or as per the criteria set out by the European Investment Bank, we are a programme country and we have projects that fit the bill.  Therefore, I am very optimistic about our potential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to explore some of the points we raised with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday, and to which we did not get answers as he left early, which was unfortunate.</P>
        <P>I am somewhat sceptical about states becoming involved in the creation of jobs.  They have tried that in other countries and failed miserably.  It is fundamental for the State to create the conditions in which the private sector can create jobs.  I know that is significant challenge but on the other hand I do not dismiss the Minister of State&rsquo;s efforts, as outlined to my colleague, Senator Mooney.  Focused investment might generate some improvement.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious that this Government raided the pension pots of many people in the past year on the pretext of generating jobs.  Very little, if anything, was achieved by it and the money was used to support Exchequer finances.</P>
        <P>I know this will be a different matter because the money borrowed must be repaid.  I would like to see the emphasis put on the semi-State sector.  I presume, but the Minister may correct me if I am wrong, the private sector could access some of the money from the European Investment Bank.  I think we should encourage that in order to generate jobs.</P>
        <P>There are probably certain key infrastructural projects, to which the Minister of State alluded, that would also be appropriate areas but I am concerned that with the political pressures, the high levels of unemployment, the Government would start spending money to satisfy a political imperative that we are seen to be doing something to create jobs.  We end up adding to the debt levels, which makes it more difficult to extricate ourselves from where we are.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned training and that is a good idea.  Let me repeat a point I made yesterday about the ESM.  The Minister dismissed an earlier comment when I said that &euro;700 million, in my opinion, was not sufficient to meet the challenges.  I am not sure that I mentioned the figure at the time, but I had it in my mind some months back, that Europe would need about &euro;2 trillion, to get ahead of the curve on this.  It has not been happening.  Each crisis is being addressed as it arises and we are now four years into the most difficult economic situation I have seen in my lifetime and I am older that the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>When this crisis happened I was trying to draw comparisons with previous events in history.  This is probably the greatest global financial and economic crisis since the Wall Street crash in 1929 which signalled the ten year Great Depression.</P>
        <P>Most economists will accept that there was not much of an improvement by 1939.  The war intervened which makes it difficult to extrapolate any conclusions from it, because one does not know whether war prolonged it or it assisted a recovery which came about in the 1950s.  I remember saying that we were looking at a period of at least a decade, if not longer, of stagnation and recession.  Many people dismissed my comments as alarmist, but I am concerned about the situation.  I do not have solutions, but what worried me is that nobody seems to have solutions, including the experts.  What we must do at European level is to get a template as to how this crisis can be successfully tackled in order to set the European and the global economy on an upward curve.  I talk to people in the United States.  The outlook is similar there but is not as bad as in this country because they have a more optimistic approach.  To support my argument, the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, warned the financial crisis will last at least five more years.  Many of the experts are starting to revise their earlier optimistic views.  I am not patronising the Minister of State, but I am impressed by her intellectual capacity and knowledge and that she is well on top of her brief.  It is often unusual among politicians and Ministers and I am trying to encourage the Minister of State to take that on.</P>
        <P>I have seen reports on the Spanish situation.  If they get into difficulty and are not able to borrow from the sovereign they talk about for their banks, they would use up what has already been allocated for this particular process.  I do not want to scaremonger because it can be self-fulfilling.  Equally, there is no point in avoiding reality.  Cyprus has joined and is borrowing &euro;10 billion which, by our standards, seems small but is more than half of its total economy and is quite significant.  It puts Cyprus in almost the same bailiwick that we are in, but Italy is on the fringe.  There is no talk now but very early in the crisis there was a lot of talk about Spain, Italy and France.  We are in a serious situation but I do not know what we can do here other than to urge the Minister of State and the Government, particularly the Taoiseach, to make European leaders face the issues.</P>
        <P>I have been highly critical of a lack of facing up to things and that brings me to another point I think is covered in this particular section.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach can correct me if it is not.  One of the four planks of the provision is to increase the number of Members of the European Parliament from 736 to 751.   An increase in numbers in democratic structures, including the European Parliament, is going in the wrong direction.  The European Parliament should be significantly reduced in size to improve its effectiveness and efficiency.  Yesterday my colleague, Senator Sean D. Barrett, made an interesting observation by suggesting a bicameral European Parliament to allow for another house and allow other voices to be brought to bear on these issues.</P>
        <P>I have strong views on my final point and I expressed them to the T&aacute;naiste yesterday but did not receive an answer.  He mentioned the fact the provision also covers the protocols that the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, succeeded in getting when the referendum on the Lisbon treaty failed in this country.  As the T&aacute;naiste pointed out in his address to us yesterday, the protection of life and the protection of family and education are fundamental protocols that are now being incorporated and underpinned, as was promised at that time.  I welcome the move.  He rightly said that Europe was living up to what was expected of it and I said to him, and I shall repeat it for the Minister of State present, that I am concerned about the approach made by the Government on the issues.</P>
        <P>As the T&aacute;naiste pointed out in his speech, the issues were important to the Irish people and were matters of great concern to them.  I am highly critical, therefore, of the establishment of the expert group because its composition was changed at a late stage, and I have tabled a motion on the Adjournment on the issue.  New people were added to the panel and some people on it were replaced, but I do not know why.  The change has raised a lot of suspicions within the pro-life movement.  Strong abortion advocates, ones whom the Minister of State probably knows, have also been included in the expert group.  They were strong abortion advocates in the past.  I am concerned about the outcome from that move.  I want a commitment from the Minister of State that the Government will honour the protections in the protocols that have been included as part of this provision and which we secured from our European colleagues.  I do not want us to throw them out now having fought to get them and their having been endorsed by the Irish people.  They are part and parcel of what we are and are part of our value system in Ireland.  Any attempt to dilute them would be a retrograde step for the citizenry and country.</P>
        <P>I am not sure that my next point applies to the Minister of State.  The explanatory memorandum supplied did not help in our understanding of the legislation and her speech was far more informative.  Either we get an explanatory memorandum that does its job or the name should be changed.  Perhaps they should be dispensed with altogether, although I would not recommend that.  I would ask for my criticism to be passed on to whoever drafted the explanatory memorandum.  It did not give us the information we needed to understand  the contents of the Bill.</P>

	<P>I want the Minister of State to reply to my question in her response.  I am curious to establish the significance of the accession of the Republic of Croatia.  There has been strong support for Croatia&rsquo;s accession from all parties, inside and outside of Government, dating back to the mid-1990s.  We have raised the issue in the past and the Minister of State is probably actively doing that daily.  It should be remembered that we, as a small country, need to forge alliances or consolidate alliances of mutual interests.   What significance in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s interests does the Minister of State attach to the accession of the Republic of Croatia?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Walsh and Senator Mooney for their comments.  I also thank the Cathaoirleach and the House for affording me the opportunity to come here to conclude this element of the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Houses.</P>
        <P>I shall begin by responding to Senator Walsh&rsquo;s point on the role of governments in job creation.  I could not agree more with his comments.  Sadly, there has been a lot of rhetoric, particularly in the past two to three months, that has almost misled the public in Ireland and across the European Union.  There has been a great white hope that governments can step in with money they do not have and create millions of jobs that will result in a rise in everybody&rsquo;s standard of living.  The crisis we face is a lot more complex.  I have never believed that increased government spending either by increasing budget deficits or, more crucially, increasing national debt levels is a solution.  Ireland learned that lesson in the late 1970s and in the 1980s when governments did precisely that.  All parties in the House participated in those governments.  They pandered to populism and went into government by making unsustainable promises and spending taxpayers&rsquo; money.  All they did was mount debt upon the shoulders of Irish taxpayers without it doing anything to improve the employment situation.  It was not until 1987, when the then Government and Opposition collaborated, that public finances were brought under control and the positive conditions for growth and job creation began to be created.  It was done by restructuring the economy and that is why I support the European agenda of restructuring.  Some call it austerity but I disagree.</P>
        <P>We have a long way to go to reform the public sectors in all the European member states.  I value and treasure the European social model.  Our democratic, economic and social models in Europe are the best in the world, bar none.  Notwithstanding the current crisis, it is the best in the world but it is unaffordable.  Europe spends more on social welfare and social protection than the rest of the world combined.  We can continue to pretend it is sustainable but it is not.  People, across the board, must work longer for less pay and until an older stage in life and probably with fewer holidays.  We must face that difficult reality.  It is unpalatable politically but it is reality.</P>
        <P>How do we drive innovation and creativity in Europe?  How do we help Europe to compete with the rest of the world to maintain the standard of living we have come to expect?  We have to do the things to which we have already signed up.  The best drivers of growth in the European economy are not fantastical stimulus projects with governments spending on roads to nowhere.  The best thing that we can do is honour the commitments we have made such as implementing the services directive and the Single Market, that is, sadly, lagging behind where it should be or what we have committed to doing.  We must end the tiresome debate on the seat of the European patent and get on with implementing the European patent.  Ireland is the most creative country in the European Union because there are more entrepreneurs here than in any other European member state <i>per capita</i>.</P>
        <P>More than any other country, Ireland can benefit from implementation of these measures which have the potential to add significant capacity and wealth to the nation and the European Union collectively.  I am very supportive of the EIB model of investment because it is a commercial investment and not a case of governments spending money they do not have.  It is a viable economic banking authority which will invest in the provision of viable strategic infrastructure, which is well worth doing.</P>
        <P>I am sorry if I dismissed the Senator&rsquo;s view on the ESM previously.  I do recall that happening, but I take his word for it.  Perhaps, it was misconstrued in some way.  When it was said previously that the ESM was not adequate, my firm view was that it would be better to have an ESM with &euro;700 billion than no ESM and no fund.  Many Members in this and the other House advocated that we vote against it, which would have meant we would have no emergency backstop.  That was irresponsible.  The other point I have made is that the ESM fund has already grown.  It started as a fund of &euro;500 billion, but it has grown to &euro;700 billion and has capacity to grow in the future.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have repeatedly stated the ESM should receive a banking licence, that we should change the terms in order that it can effectively act as a bank and raise money in the markets and potentially increase its capacity to approximately to &euro;2 trillion, although I do not have a precise costing, but to significantly more than &euro;700 billion.  The ESM should be enabled to recapitalise banks in member states directly rather than through the sovereign.  We have learned that lesson here.  We have learned the hard way that lumping private banking debt on the shoulders of ordinary taxpayers is the wrong approach.  That is my position and that of the Government.  It has been the position of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, at ECOFIN, but there was no agreement on the issue, which is not to say it is not possible.  The wonderful thing about the European Union is that it is evolving all the time.  We should never throw in the towel and say the debate is over because it is constantly evolving.  Even when one looks at the crisis, where people were two years ago is a different place from where they are today.  Positions have changed and people have moved on.  We should constantly strive to build consensus.</P>
        <P>That brings me to the Senator&rsquo;s point about Croatia and its significance as a like-minded member state of similar size.  I believe passionately in the role of small and medium-sized countries in the European Union.  We have to start working together much more effectively.  Last week I visited Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, and we have almost an identical approach to EU policy at this time, especially to the crisis.  There is huge potential to forge common positions from everything from tax to European integration, likewise with many of the other small member states.  The accession of Croatia is significant for more reasons than this: it marks the beginning of the process of reunifying the Balkans with the rest of Europe.  Next week I am visiting Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro and in the autumn I hope to visit Serbia and Macedonia.  My commitment, as we approach the Irish Presidency of the European Union, is to the Balkans and enlargement of the European Union, of which  traditionally we have been supportive.  That commitment and passion will not diminish but strengthen while I have responsibility for that issue.</P>

       <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the public service reform plan, 17 November 2011, addresses a wide range of issues such as: implementation of shared services models for HR, payroll, pensions; evaluation of new business models for the delivery of non-core services; reform of public procurement processes and property rationalisation; and reducing costs, addressing duplication and eliminating waste to support job creation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that under the public service reform plan bodies to be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished in 2012 include the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland, the Irish Manuscripts Commission, An Comisin&eacute;ar Teanga, the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />to publish the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht&rsquo;s response to the public service reform plan, including the cost-benefit analysis and projected savings;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />to undertake a consultation process similar to the process on the new human rights and equality body, thereby establishing a working group, including representatives of the national cultural institution affected by the public service reform plan and the public; calling for submissions to assist the discussions of the working group; publishing the report of the working group; presenting the Minister&rsquo;s plan to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />to realise the aforementioned commitment in the programme for Government, by establishing a policy and research unit within the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in order that annual qualitative and quantitative research can be carried out to increase our understanding of the public value of the arts; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />to protect the &ldquo;arm&rsquo;s length principle&rdquo; between the national cultural institutions and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht by retaining independent boards of directors; appointing board members on a non-remunerated basis; publically advertising the position of director of the National Museum of Ireland; the director of the National Archives of Ireland and the CEO of Culture Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to debate the motion as proposed by the group of Independent Senators.  This is a timely debate, one in which I support the Minister and the Government in highlighting how we can enhance, protect and sustain the role of culture and, in particular, the national cultural institutions in the Republic.  Therefore, I propose the motion which Senator Jillian van Turnhout will second.</P>
        <P>There are a couple of issues I wish to highlight.  I am director of the national theatre, the Abbey Theatre, one of Ireland&rsquo;s national cultural institutions.  When the Taoiseach appointed me to the Seanad a little over one year ago, I knew my role as director of the Abbey Theatre, my role as a citizen and my role as a Senator would add to the challenges and the opportunities I would have in contributing to the debate and the public policy remit of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The reason the motion is before the House is that there has been no meaningful public consultation; there is no other reason.   National cultural institutions belong to the citizens of the Republic who have a right which has been denied to them to have the important reform process discussed in public.  With the motion, I could have stayed quiet and said nothing.  The funding for the Abbey Theatre comes from the Arts Council and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  My relationship with the Minister and his Department has always been cordial, professional, supportive and beneficial to the arts in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has empowered me to speak on issues about which I care and know.  I have heard with disquiet that there have been concerns expressed about my contribution to this debate.  I take my position as director of the national theatre extremely seriously and I am totally committed to it, but I also have the right and the responsibility as a citizen and a Senator to engage in a debate about which I am passionate.  In his speech in the D&aacute;il last night the only national cultural Institution the Minister singled out specifically in terms of funding was the Abbey Theatre which received &euro;7.1 million a year from another national cultural institution &mdash; the Arts Council.  We have also received a grant from the Minister&rsquo;s Department this year for the removal of asbestos and to meet capital costs.  I am indebted to the Minister whom I thank on behalf of the board of the Abbey Theatre.</P>
        <P>I support the Minister&rsquo;s vision and work programme.  We are in difficult financial times, but our approach to all sectors of society needs to be carefully considered and judged before we consider dismantling or restructuring the way we work.  I wholeheartedly applaud and thank the Minister on behalf of the arts community and the public who have access to the arts for the funding he has managed to obtain.  A cut of only 3% is a remarkable political result.</P>
        <P>There is a need for a more extensive debate on the governance and policy for the arts sector; perhaps there is a need for a Green Paper on the opportunities and challenges facing the arts in the 21st century.  The Minister has been in the job for the past 16 months and we have yet to hear his vision of how we should embrace, use and support the arts in the new era in the Republic.</P>
        <P>In the programme for Government it is clearly set out that the Department will take a lead role in &ldquo;making strategic policy formulation the primary function of the Department, with line agencies and bodies responsible for policy implementation&rdquo;.  When the Minister examines his Department&rsquo;s strategy statement arising from the programme of the Government commitment, he will note that the mandate &ldquo;is to foster, promote and support Ireland&rsquo;s world-class artistic and cultural strengths, at home and abroad&rdquo;.   In order to achieve the strategic policy formulation goal, the Department requires an arts policy unit with dedicated research staff who can commission and analyse data, surveys and research material.</P>
        <P>As a founding member and proud supporter of the National Campaign for the Arts, I know that one of the emerging aspects of our research work is the lack of data on levels of cultural participation, cultural consumption patterns and barriers to increased participation.  Arts and culture support tourism, create jobs and enhance reputation, but how do we measure the role of the arts and culture in our citizens&rsquo; lives?  Do we know, on a regular basis, how many of our citizens engage or have access to the arts and is there a better way for us to inform policy for the arts?  I notice that on the Department&rsquo;s website there is very little data and research available to us on these issues.</P>
        <P>We need to move beyond the economic, the consumer and the marketplace and to accept the public value of the arts, the role of the citizen and the place of the arts in our society.  I am happy to volunteer to support the Minister in this, as is Senator Marie Louise O&rsquo;Donnell, who could not attend this afternoon.</P>
        <P>The Minister is part of a Government that agreed on the public sector reform plan last November.  He also has all of Ireland&rsquo;s cultural heritage and institutions available to him within his ministerial remit.  It was a lost opportunity for him between November and now not to address the economic challenge as a way to debate in public and to consult in public how these institutions could react, change and develop under the public sector reform plan.  It was a lost opportunity for the Minister not to take a lead on this so that the citizen and the taxpayer could contribute to the debate.  This was done in other Departments quite efficiently.  The reason independent Senators are moving this motion is that the Minister&rsquo;s Department&rsquo;s actions will have an adverse impact on the quality and rigour of the output of the institutions which will ultimately have an impact on audiences.  No board or cultural institution is above review or examination with regard to the efficiency of service delivered to the public.  That includes all the cultural institutions listed in today&rsquo;s motion.  No board or cultural institution is above the delivery of the efficiencies and shared services that will give better value to the taxpayer.  A review is good, providing it is open, transparent, meaningful and complete.  Has the Minister commissioned any cost-benefit analysis or seen any reports on the potential savings of any of these proposed mergers or amalgamations?</P>
        <P>The Minister has stressed the need for reform and review.  All organisations are open to that, but international precedents show repeatedly that a well-structured efficient board is an essential part of an organisation managing and achieving significant reform.  Ireland does not have a good history of effective board governance &mdash; we need only look at our banks &mdash; and this is an opportunity to address this in a positive way, to look at the full potential a board can play not just in fund-raising, but in supporting an organisation to meet current challenges and manage a process of reform.  Tomorrow, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, will launch a new Government code of governance to charitable and voluntary organisations.  Central to the code is that all organisation have a board to comply with governance codes.</P>
        <P>In his contribution to a debate in the D&aacute;il last evening, the Minister stated his commitment to the independence of the cultural and programming aspects of the institutions.  That, however, does not go far enough.  The independence he looks for is achieved by an independent board.  I know that as director of the Abbey Theatre and I knew it as director of the Project Arts Centre. This is the reassurance we are looking for in our motion today.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment to our motion does not guarantee to the House that the Minister will not repeal or seek amendments to the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Culture Ireland has been one of the success stories of the arts over the last five years.  It has worked tirelessly and imaginatively to support the Government in enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s reputational recovery abroad, and this is acknowledged in the Government amendment to the motion.  This is a body which had a board and a director and worked well within the Minister&rsquo;s Department, but it was by-passed recently when the Minister appointed, without competition, a director of this body.  Perhaps the board rubber-stamped this, but there has been no public comment from it.  There is now an impression, which I know is not the Minister&rsquo;s intention, that the arms-length principle of Culture Ireland is well and truly broken.  In our motion this afternoon, I call on the Minister to publicly advertise the positions of director of the National Archives, director of Culture Ireland and director of the National Museum of Ireland.  The Government amendment does not go far enough in this particular regard.  The only way to support programming independence is through good governance, and that means independent boards who appoint independent directors.  This, in turn, will support the work of artists and archivists and the citizens who benefit from it.  It is on this basis that I continue to propose our motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my honour to second this motion, initiated by our independent group.  I wholeheartedly endorse everything my colleague, Senator Mac Congha&iacute;l has said.</P>
        <P>I come to the motion from a different point of reference.  In recent years, I have developed a keen interest in researching my ancestry.  Through this hobby, I have had the pleasure of using the National Archives of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland and the genealogical records put online by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>In preparing to second the motion I did my own research, so it was with surprise that I read the contents of the Government amendment.  The Government &ldquo;notes the extensive consultation undertaken&rdquo; by the Minister.  I found it extremely difficult to find evidence of this consultation and can only conclude that it happened behind closed doors.  This is regrettable.  We are talking about our national culture and our national cultural institutions.  We all have ownership of them and any proposals in their regard surely warrant an open, transparent and inclusive consultation process.  An example of such a process is included in our motion but it has not been taken up in the Government counter-motion.</P>
        <P>There is a feeling of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>  in the air.  In his budget speech of 2008, the then Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced that the Government had decided to proceed with a wide range of amalgamations of State agencies, including the merger of the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland and the Irish Manuscripts Commission.  The proposal was subsequently dropped.  This self-same action was included in the Government&rsquo;s public service reform plan, published last November, which stated: &ldquo;Merge National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission into the National Library while maintaining separate identities.&rdquo;  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il, the Minister said he was considering a range of options for the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland, including streamlining and moving some support functions back into his Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From my reading, a merger is proposed but the institutions will all keep their own identities.  Lest we forget, eight years, between 1997 and 2005, were spent moving the library out of the Department, including transferring staff from the Civil Service to the public service, and now we are talking about moving some of them back in again.  I have often heard of moving deckchairs on the <i>Titanic</i>.  This really sums that up.</P>
        <P>From my experience and research, the roles and functions of these State agencies are completely distinct.  I am focusing my intervention on the National Archives of Ireland, which is situated within the Minister&rsquo;s Department, with statutory independence.  The National Archives of Ireland is legally charged under the National Archives Act 1986, and the significance and importance of its functions in the interests of democracy, transparency, truth and justice cannot be overstated.  We know how essential court and other archival records are to clarifying the State interaction with the Magdalene laundries and to other bodies of inquiry and redress.  As we enter a decade of sensitive commemorations, how we understand our history is critical, and I am well aware that the absence of factual material can often distort it.</P>
        <P>From my experience of researching my own family history, I knew the story of how my great-aunt fled Ireland with her two year old child in 1929, abandoning her husband and her ancestral home in County Clare.  By researching in the National Archives of Ireland, I found District Court records of how my great-aunt tried, on several occasions, to seek the court&rsquo;s protection from her husband, who assaulted and abused her.  When she could not get remedy from the court, she was left with no alternative but to escape to England.  When I shared this with her daughter, who is now in her 80s, I cannot put a price on the relief, understanding and closure these archival records provided.  To understand and interpret our history appropriately we need to ensure that our archival material is properly stored and easily accessed.</P>
        <P>I cannot stress enough the link between transparency, justice and proper record keeping.  No one in this Chamber needs to be reminded of the serious, and in some cases fatal, consequences of our historically poor record keeping.  Only last week, we received the report of the independent child death review group.  Other reports, such as the McEntee and Barron reports into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, illustrated the failure to keep adequate records.  In years to come, when historians try to understand decisions taken today and in recent years in matters such as planning, where will the records be?  Who will be preserving them?  What are we doing to review the National Archives Act and to address its deficiencies, such as records of State agencies and electronic records?  I am genuinely concerned.  No doubt the Minister will confirm the value he places on the National Archives, but I am saddened to see that the evidence is to the contrary.  The financial allocations to the National Archives between 2005 and 2011 showed a dramatic reduction in funding which is now back at 2005 levels.  The Minister is well aware of the concerns expressed about storage, access, humidity control and conservation at Bishop Street, despite the best efforts of staff.  The National Archives has a staff of 47, of which 14 are archivists.  In addition, there are six vacancies due to the moratorium, two of which are for archivists.  There is also the critical position of director.  I note that in many countries of similar size with a comparable volume of records the staffing levels far outnumber ours.  For example, the National Archives of Scotland has 160 members of staff, of whom approximately half are archivists, while at the Danish National Archives there are 261 members of staff, of whom approximately 88 are archivists.  I also look with envy at the completion of the PRONI building in Belfast which was delivered on time and under budget last year.  I note its location in the <i>Titanic</i> quarter of Belfast and the clear link drawn with culture and tourism.  Instead of moving deckchairs, should we be discussing our vision for protecting our cultural heritage?</P>
        <P>This Saturday, 30 June, marks the 90th anniversary of the destruction of the public records office in the Four Courts.  On that fateful day 1,000 years of Irish cultural history literally went up in smoke and vanished without trace, yet to the surprise of many, given the financial position at the foundation of the Irish Free State, one of the first acts of the new Government was to rebuild the public records office.  What clearer signal could there be of the priority given to our cultural heritage in the 1920s?  If the proposed merger is to succeed as set out and the consequences are as many as I fear, I wonder how kindly historians in 90 years time will review our decisions today.  I ask my colleagues to stand and be counted and let the record show that they supported the motion.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the Government&rsquo;s commitment that, in bringing forward any governance reforms that may be required to realise the goals of the public service reform plan, it will support the programming and curatorial independence of the national cultural institutions; and,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the Minister&rsquo;s intention to conclude his response to the public service reform plan as soon as possible and to consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to bringing these matters to the Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister for the debate on this important motion.  It is important to address the issue with proper forethought and planning, the engagement of stakeholders and a clear strategy in mind rather than to let the situation fester any longer.  While I admire the motion, the counter-motion goes as far as the Government can on the issue.  In the public sector reform plan many of the issues covered in the motion are still under examination.  The Government cannot commit to a particular stance on an individual institution while the examination is ongoing.  To box ourselves in with hypothetical situations and to limit our options would be to shoot ourselves in the foot and waste the opportunity the examination and the report will present us with in due course.</P>
        <P>We must examine the structures in place and determine whether they are fit for purpose.  Chief among the challenges ahead is the need to raise and spend money.  It is the case that several institutions with similar purposes need identical marketing departments, but they do not need to duplicate administrative functions.  There seems to be room for economies of scale, on which I expect the report will comment.  Let us make no mistake, however, as the Minister said, these institutions are world class exemplars of what they do.  They rank alongside their international counterparts.  They could do more with more money, but the funding challenges we face are significant.  Unfortunately, no field can be immune in the budgetary situation in which we find ourselves.  As such, we must find a way to rationalise savings, while impacting on neither output nor quality.  One could ask whether it is possible to do this.  I am confident that we can.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned, one of the most straightforward ways by which institutions in the sector could become more efficient is sharing common functions.  In that sense, it encourages me to see that the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Gallery have made a proposal.  This shows a willingness to engage that is, frankly, refreshing.  While we all wish the cuts did not have to be made, the reality is that something must give.  I would rather we received full and frank advice from the institutions involved.  If anyone knows where we can find efficiencies, it is the people involved directly in the day-to-day running of the organisations.</P>
        <P>Similar to the Minister, I cannot accept the notion that the mere examination of reform possibilities amounts to an attack on the cultural edifice of the nation, as some have cruelly suggested.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I never said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I also refute the idea that other parties would not have done the same in similar circumstances.  While there is a need to cut costs, on the one hand, there is also a need, on the other, to secure private funding from elsewhere and to put together programmes that will encourage philanthropy from new avenues.  As the Minister outlined, we have seen great success, with the National Archives managing to secure &euro;250,000 for a particular project.  I would like to see more of this.  It is my sincere belief that if we present compelling propositions, we will see the private sector step in to support the great institutions.  However, no matter what are the recommendations of the report or what way a programme of savings is put together, the Minister has delivered one message loud and clear, namely, that curatorial independence will remain, that there will be no orders from the Department that a particular exhibit must be purchased or that a specific selection of books must be put on display.  I share the Minister&rsquo;s intention that at the end of the process the cultural institutions will emerge stronger and be able to weather any storm.</P>
        <P>It can be easy to forget about all things other than numbers and to view the world through the prism of a balance sheet.  To do so is both short-sighted and unwise and in that sense, I am heartened to see that the Minister has taken such a balanced approach and worked so hard to engage with all stakeholders throughout the process.  Nevertheless, while I ultimately admire the thrust of the motion proposed, for the reasons outlined, I must support the counter-motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Is mian liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire, agus tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; neamhsple&aacute;cha as an r&uacute;n seo a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair.  Cabhra&iacute;onn s&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; a leith&eacute;id de r&uacute;n a phl&eacute; mar tugann s&eacute; seans d&uacute;inn uilig &aacute;r dtuairim&iacute; agus &aacute;r dtaith&iacute; a gcur ar f&aacute;il eadrainn f&eacute;in.   Is &eacute; mo thuairim go bhfuil gach duine ins an Teach seo taobhach agus cabhrach le haon rud a bhaineann leis an gcult&uacute;r agus leis na heala&iacute;ona.  Is mar sin ar ch&oacute;ir &eacute; a bheith.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister who has always been available to us when issues relating to his portfolio arise.  We have had him in the House to discuss the decade of commemorations and the arts.  I found this helpful because sometimes we all tend to work in isolation.  The Seanad is the ideal forum in which to have a discussion such as this.  We should look at the broader picture as we see the arts and culture today.  We all accept that they are important to the quality of life and the morale of the people, as well as to the image of the country abroad.  All of us are aware of how we have delivered in that regard.  The status we have as a small country internationally is amazing.  The arts and culture have been central to it.</P>
        <P>I have seen the Minister travel the length and breadth of the country to attend all kinds of events &mdash; small, big and international.  He has always had a ready ear to listen to anyone with a point of view.  That is consultation with the grassroots.  I have seen this being delivered on organically and subsequently evolve into policy.  I hope that will never change because if that consultation with activists in a cultural and artistic sense does not continue, we will have lost an important conduit in terms of the overall policy that will eventually be developed.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister has acknowledged the importance and excellence of the national cultural institutions because there is no doubt that they are one of the main conduits for the image of the country abroad, but they also give a certain motivation to the people.  I refer, for example, to schoolchildren visiting one of the institutions, academics and other participants.  It it important that there be such a forum and focus.</P>
        <P>I hope we will not have an acrimonious debate.  I hope that it does not harm the unity and cohesion that has existed in the arts and cultural world to date.  We each have an opportunity to engage on this issue and I hope that we can get back onto even ground.  We are all Irish and committed to our cultural and artistic identity.  Any contribution that we make in this debate should have that intention.</P>
        <P>I compliment the two Senators who have spoken.  Senator Mac Conghail stated that he had always found the Minister and his officials to be professional and helpful, which has also been my experience through the years.  Speaking as Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s spokesperson on the arts, it must come as something of a surprise that I am praising the Minister or his Department, but some issues are above politics.  This happens to be one of them.  It is above party considerations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national cultural institutions should not feel aggrieved in any way, as it would be wrong not to acknowledge them for their work.  We have been particularly lucky in the calibre of personnel that we have succeeded in attracting, Senator Mac Conghail being an example.  His vigour and vision have made a major contribution to the Abbey Theatre.  For this, I salute him.  The theatre grew out of the same renaissance as our independence and our individuality as a people.</P>
        <P>We are facing economic challenges.  If any public figure does not start by acknowledging these, it will create a difficulty and send us down a cul-de-sac.  Each Department is facing identical challenges.  I made this point when the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was in power.  It is easy to make arguments knowing full well that the resources are not available to respond 100%.  When the Minister sits down at the table, I hope that he will have listened to my comments.</P>
        <P>Given the motion&rsquo;s origins and the experience behind it, this is probably one of the Chamber&rsquo;s best debates.  The Minister has the vigour to make the strongest argument possible on behalf of arts and culture.  Had this debate been held 30 years ago, the man or woman on the street might not have been on our side.  I do not mean this in a derogatory sense.  Interestingly, they are on side with what we are trying to achieve now.</P>
        <P>It should not be argued that arts and culture do not put bread on the table.  The opposite is the truth, as their economic value is beyond question.  Senator Mac Conghail referenced his background.  Three all-Ireland fleadh cheoils in Cavan will have delivered &euro;120 million to the region by their end, the VAT derived from which will be approximately &euro;30 million.</P>
        <P>Arts and culture are the essence of the Irish as a people.  Is it not funny that we fall back on them in challenging times?  Good hurling, football and soccer teams lift our spirits.  These are the people who will help us to rise each time we have a problem.  When one visits the museum to study our history, the Abbey Theatre to watch a play or the fleadh cheoil to play music, one is seeing what we are as a people.  This is important.  The Minister should put these arguments to the Minister for Finance or whomever is making the decisions.  I hope that today&rsquo;s debate will not be concerned with vested interests or what we are seeking individually, but with everyone working together towards a common goal.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  The strength we can have by being united is exactly what the Minister needs and nothing that might detract from it will help us, as financial decision makers could perceive divisions.  We are depending on the Minister to pick up the ball, run and score.  He needs all of the support we can give.  That these arguments are coming from Fianna F&aacute;il may be surprising, but I dearly love everything that we do from an artistic and cultural point of view.</P>
        <P>Each of us has had the opportunity to visit China or Japan, countries of 1.3 billion and 100 million people, respectively.  Given the fact that we are a young and small nation, we are always overawed when the Japanese or Chinese people whom we ask about Ireland generally refer to our arts and culture.</P>
        <P>There is a time for closing ranks, unity and positive focus.  I am not against debate or differing opinions, but confrontation spills out and might distract us from our common cause.  I would love it if there was no amendment to this motion and if we could agree a single motion that the Minister would convey to the decision makers.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and this opportunity to debate the motion.  I thank Independent Senators Mac Conghail and van Turnhout and the rest of their group for moving it.  As colleagues will be aware, we held a similar debate on 7 June.  It was a debate on the decade of commemorations.  Many of us raised the important role to be played by the national cultural institutions during the coming decade.  We referred to the critical issue of the independence of those institutions.  I welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s response, in which he spoke in support of the principles of autonomy and independence.</P>
        <P>I am glad the amendment to the motion emphasises the Government&rsquo;s commitment to introducing governance reforms with a view to supporting programming and curatorial independence.  I am sorry that the amendment could not go further.  I hope that the Minister will address some of the matters raised by the Independents, for example, their concerns regarding the appointment of directors to a number of the institutions in question.</P>
        <P>The key point is that no Senator is against governance reform.  Everyone understands the need for a review of governance structures if we are to ensure that all of our institutions, including those under discussion, are run in the most effective way possible and continue to make a significant contribution.  The national campaign for the arts provided an excellent briefing.  The Government&rsquo;s briefing acknowledged the significant economic, social and cultural contribution made by the arts to our society.  We all share a voice in this regard.</P>
        <P>There is no disagreement on the need to maintain a review.  The institutions have been forthcoming in terms of making proposals for governance reform.  In the D&aacute;il, the Minister referred to the galleries&rsquo; practical proposal on the sharing of back room services.  However, it is key that there be rational, evidence-based cases for potential governance and structural reforms.  A controversy has arisen, in that people working in the arts were fearful of forced mergers or amalgamations of institutions.  This would not make sense or save money.  The international experience is that mergers and amalgamations do not save money.  They require long-term planning, investment and clear business strategies.  While the national cultural institutions recognise the need to cut costs, they believe that this can be done in such a way as to preserve their independence and autonomy.</P>
        <P>Labour is conscious of the legacy of President Michael D. Higgins, one of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors.  He introduced the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, which set up the framework for many of the institutions currently under discussion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator van Turnhout or Senator Mac Conghail referred to Culture Ireland.  There is a particular concern about Culture Ireland and it is worth saying that the body has played an important role in promoting Irish arts internationally.  The issue of the director of Culture Ireland has been raised in the Independent Senators&rsquo; motion.  A number of issues have been raised that might be dealt with in the debate but we all agree about the need to ensure the most effective possible structures for the institutions that are so important to promoting our culture here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House this evening and congratulate the Independent Senators and Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on their contributions.  We should all feel honoured by the contributions to the arts and our country, and I know Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in particular has been involved with traditional Irish music.  As a former teacher of music, his work is widely known and appreciated in the music field.  Senator Mac Conghail has done outstanding work in the Abbey Theatre.</P>
        <P>From a Labour perspective we must consider the amendment put forward.  It is clear from the contributions in this debate that we are all acutely aware of the immense importance of the arts in the cultural life of the country.  Ireland can be justly proud of our long history of cultivating support and promoting the arts, and we all recognise that even in times of economic downturn, maintaining this support is essential.</P>
        <P>We have seen that this sector is expanding, providing employment, attracting investment, raising our country&rsquo;s profile abroad and bringing tourists to our shores in significant numbers.  Senator van Turnhout mentioned the <i>Titanic</i> Quarter and I visited it last Saturday.  The cultural and tourist opportunities it has provided are immense.  The Government is committed to supporting the Irish national cultural institutions and acknowledges the tremendous work that has been achieved.  It is also committed to implementing public service reform as outlined in the programme for Government, and there can be little doubt that the sharing of services, such as information technology, human resources, marketing and procurement will lead to savings and efficiencies.  We are the custodians of our heritage and have a duty to ensure the millions of people home and abroad who want to immerse themselves in our heritage get the service they want and deserve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also very happy to welcome the Minister and his officials, whom I recognise, to the House.  I have dealt with the Department over many years.  This Minister is appropriately placed, and I have known him for a long number of years, as we have shared an interest in various cultural issues.  There is naturally a particular Kerry emphasis, which is perfectly appropriate, as my focus is on Dublin and I speak about Joyce or Bram Stoker quite often.  The Minister has really helped to put on the map people like George Fitzmaurice and although John B. Keane did not need to be put on the map, the Minister has underlined the fact that he was there.  There is also our mutual friend, Mr. Brendan Kennelly.  There is goodwill from the Minister, who is in a difficult position.  In parlous economic times, human rights and the arts are almost invariably the first two targets, leading to this difficulty.</P>
        <P>I recognise that this House sometimes echoed to the voice of Senator W. B. Yeats, one of our greatest poets.  The motion is sponsored by Senator Mac Conghail, who has played a significant role in the Abbey Theatre.  It is a dreadful and appalling building but he showed real artistic imagination in turning the dreadful gallery around and putting in a fully raked theatre.  We are graced tonight by Ms Rosaleen McDonagh, who is a writer, wheelchair user, Traveller and sometime contestant for the university seats here.  In one way she is kind of a hated rival but also a very good friend.</P>
        <P>It is very important to recognise the practical significance of the arts.  During the presidential election I quoted from time to time from a survey which emerged at the time from a Scandinavian university.  That indicated the critical impact of community involvement in the arts in terms of mental health and well-being, demonstrating a saving to a country&rsquo;s exchequer because fewer people needed to use mental health resources.  The issue should be grounded in the issue of mental health and well-being, and the arts are needed more than ever at this time, when people are depressed generally by unending bad news.  Hollywood cinema boomed during the Great Depression and the same is happening today.</P>
        <P>I attended a very well orchestrated briefing organised by Senator Mac Conghail and briefing notes from the National Campaign for the Arts were presented.  It was fascinating material.  Some 57% of the adult population attend the arts, with 1.2 million people regularly engaged in creative artistic activities.  Attendances have increased in the theatre by 8% and at exhibitions by 11%.  This suggests the activity is not elitist but deeply ingrained in the spirit of the Irish people.  The national cultural revival, led by people like Yeats, predated political nationalism and helped create the movement.  Cultural nationalism came first and political nationalism was inspired by it.</P>
        <P>Some 111,000 participants attended 592 events nationwide as part of the Bealtaine festival.  I have mentioned well-being, and research by Professor Semir Zeki, professor of neuroesthetics at University College London, indicates that viewing a work of art creates the same chemical response as love, putting chemicals like dopamine into the brain.  It is a very good activity.</P>
        <P>What strikes me about the motion and amendment is that there is one area of disagreement.  The difficulties are indicated with the resignation of Dr. Patrick Wallace and Professor Diarmuid Ferriter from their respective positions.  Those serious events must be taken account of.  The first part of the Independent Senators&rsquo; motion is inarguable and the Minister practically repeats it word for word.  The Minister would like to have the work welcomed, praised and cherished.  The Senators also note certain facts before the bitter disagreement becomes evident in the final four paragraphs.  The motion asks &ldquo;to publish the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht&rsquo;s response to the Public Service Reform Plan, including the cost-benefit analysis, and projected savings&rdquo;, which would be very helpful.</P>
        <P>Amalgamation of the national library and archive was attempted in Canada, so there is a precedent.  The Canadians believed it would save money but it cost 50 million Canadian dollars.  A cost-benefit analysis would be very important in this respect, as is the arm&rsquo;s length principle.  Artists can be difficult people politically, as it is their role.  Plato kicked them out of the republic because they were unreliable.  He called them liars.  Picasso got it right when he stated that art is a lie that reveals the truth.  Politicians do not always like the truth being revealed and we must have the arm&rsquo;s length principle so that we are immune from censorship and interference.  I do not believe this Minister would do such a thing, but there could be difficulty later.</P>
        <P>The motion further asks &ldquo;to undertake a consultation process&rdquo;, which would be important.  I have always found the Minister to be open and helpful but it can be unhelpful to be given the impression that decisions are taken at Cabinet before a consultation process is complete.  The retention of independent boards of directors is absolutely necessary.  These people are mostly unpaid so there is no cost cutting in getting rid of them.  Some are paid, but in Eugene Downes of Culture Ireland, we got a terrific deal.  I know the Minister&rsquo;s commitment; why would I not?  I am a fellow traveller.  Did I not travel down with him in his splendid motor car to Kerry to F&eacute;ile na Gr&eacute;ine in Tech Amergin?  That festival is in difficulties, as the Minister knows, and I know he will do what he can to assist it.  We saw at that festival that the spirit of art and f&eacute;ile includes that idea of generosity of spirit.  Pauline Bewick, the artist, was there, one of the greatest Irish artists.  She has been extremely generous in giving to the community works of art of enormous value.</P>
        <P>Even at this stage, there should be some negotiation between representatives of the two sides, just to look at those final four paragraphs.  That is all that separates us and they are negotiable.  I salute my colleagues among the Independent Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees for having put this motion forward.  They argued it vigorously, as is their right, but they argued it in a way that was not antagonistic and the questions they asked must be answered.  This Minister will, I believe, answer them.  It is a difficult time but Seanad &Eacute;ireann would give the Minister the support and backing he knows in his heart he has, and it would be great if we could get a combined resolution.  He will have a battle with economics.</P>

	<P>It is unique in my 30 years in national politics for both Houses to debate an issue simultaneously.  It is even rarer for the same issue to come up in Private Members&rsquo; business, so it is a first.  I compliment and congratulate Senators on raising this issue.  We live in a democracy and must listen to each other and to constructive criticism.  This is what makes our democracy so strong.  I am delighted the debate is taking place in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  It is good for the arts.  I recognise that the Taoiseach appointed these Senators to the Seanad and gave them the freedom to say what they want.  The Taoiseach deserves recognition for that.  I am delighted we are all part of this debate.  The Senator accuses me of having no vision but I&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have had a vision for the arts for many years.  It did not start yesterday.  Rather than having one of these academic visions, I have a practical vision.  In my town, when I realised we had some great writers there who were not properly represented, I decided to go ahead and set up a literary centre for them and to honour them in other ways, such as with documentaries for RTE.  I have a vision that might differ from the intellectual or academic vision but it is practical.  Like Senator Norris, I was impressed by Tech Amergin and my vision is for the arts in the whole country, not just in Kerry or Dublin.  Unfortunately in the past, the vision of policy in this country was not geographically inclusive.  People throughout the country are entitled to access to quality performances in good venues, whether they are in Donegal, Clare or Dublin.</P>
        <P>It is to the credit of both Houses of the Oireachtas that they have found common purpose in prioritising the national cultural institutions this week and I am pleased to be here to address the House on this issue.  It is my fourth time in the Seanad since becoming Minister and I have always found the debates here to be informed, compelling and insightful.  I spent four years in the Seanad, from 1983 to 1987, and sat with people like our current President, Michael D. Higgins, the current Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and many others who made it in politics afterwards, including the former President, Mary Robinson.  There were some interesting debates on the arts back then as well.</P>
        <P>My starting principle is that the periodic examination of organisations, especially those receiving money from the taxpayer, is a healthy and necessary exercise.  This should be done at all levels of Government.  While I am in this position, I want to make them better and for them to give a better service to the community, the taxpayer who funds them and the consumer.   The Government recognises this principle and the taxpayer deserves nothing less than our acknowledgement of it.</P>
        <P>The public service reform plan published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, against which backdrop this debate is taking place, aims to deliver enhanced public services.  The plan notes that shared services can potentially transform the competitiveness of State bodies and that sharing functions like human resources, IT, payroll, procurement and other services will yield long-term savings.</P>
        <P>Institutions funded by the taxpayer, through my Department, are part of the public service reform plan.  Our arts and culture define us as a nation; they are what set us apart.  They differentiate us in a world of growing sameness.  They are our badge of honour, our greatest ambassadors, and their reputation has endured and grown when our reputation in other spheres has been diminished.  They have contributed a great deal in the last four years to repairing a tarnished image of us worldwide, especially in New York, Europe and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>This Government is hugely supportive of our arts and of our cultural institutions.  Since the downturn, very significant cuts have been made to our arts and culture budgets.  In 2012, as Minister, I ensured the reduction in day-to-day Exchequer funding for our arts and our cultural institutions was the smallest reduction since 2009.  I do not put this forward in any way as a point of self congratulation, I am simply reiterating that the funding for these institutions has never been more difficult.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Considering the way in which we address that funding challenge for the future cannot be avoided and we are determined to work with our cultural institutions in this challenge.  The process of reform in which we are engaged is not about diminishing them, it is about the long-term survival of these institutions.  In this challenge, they must work together, share common operational services and draw on shared support services.  Our national cultural institutions are capable of doing that.</P>
        <P>When I first came to this House as Minister last September, I said that my objective in Government is to make the arts and culture part of our national script, to make them a central and essential part of the narrative about the character of a new, different, changed and better Ireland.  That remains my objective.  Of the many things we excel at in this country, the arts are foremost.  In fact, our arts and culture practitioners are world class.  As I said previously in the D&aacute;il, however, one of the things we could do better is to have a calm and level-headed debate about the future direction of institutions that are funded by the taxpayer and are in place to serve the nation.</P>
        <P>I know these institutions well.  I have engaged with them throughout my life.</P>
        <P>These cultural bodies, which hold, protect and manage important collections of art, literature and diverse artefacts on everyone&rsquo;s behalf, are defining components of Ireland&rsquo;s academic, cultural, documentary and archaeological heritage.  They steward our history, witness our present and have educational value.</P>
        <P>My door is always open to those who wish to share their views on the future direction of these institutions, and on our arts and cultural policy more generally.  It is a matter of great regret that some chose the megaphone instead of that door.  Some recent commentary has suggested that I am planning to dismantle the organisations.  Let me assure the House that the Government is planning no such thing.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">This debate has not been helped by speculation.  The debate in the Seanad has had a different tone generally than that in the D&aacute;il last night.  Dismantling the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 was never in my plan, nor was impinging on the arm&rsquo;s length principle as it applies to the Arts Council.  If one pores over the record from 2003, one will note I argued for hours to protect that principle.  Senator Fiach Mac Conghail was adviser to the then Minister, John O&rsquo;Donoghue.  I am very conscious of the freedom and independence of our national cultural institutions.  Undermining the curatorial and programming independence of the national cultural institutions was never in my plans, and our counter-motion confirms the Government&rsquo;s position in that regard.</P>
        <P>My Department funds these institutions, not as much as I would like but as much as I can.  This year, eight core institutions, including the galleries, museum, library and archives, will receive more than &euro;41 million in total.  This is approximately a third of the arts, culture and film budget of my Department.</P>
        <P>Senator Mac Conghail should note I did not single out the Abbey Theatre last night.  As he knows, the theatre&rsquo;s funding comes from the Arts Council.  Therefore, it was only fair to mention how we fund the national cultural institutions I have listed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not mention them all, in fairness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I mentioned that the Abbey Theatre got extra funding.  I did so to emphasise the type of funding being provided to cultural institutions. The Abbey Theatre will receive more than &euro;7 million, approximately, a ninth of the current Arts Council allocation.  I am making the point that the taxpayer is providing substantial funding for the cultural institutions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I said last night that our institutions are world class at what they do.  They rank ahead of many illustrious international peers.  More could be done with more money, but the funding challenges I face in my Department are significant.  I sometimes go the National Museum of Ireland or the National Library of Ireland, particularly the former because it gets a higher footfall, and I see visitors really enjoying our artefacts.  I often ask visitors what they think of the museum and they state they are fascinated by it.  They state their experience there is as good as they would have in any other part of the world.  We should be very conscious of the treasures of the country and the richness of our artefacts and archeological heritage, as displayed in our museums and national cultural institutions generally.  What I want to ensure now is that Ireland&rsquo;s national cultural institutions can optimise the funding they receive from the taxpayer and be equipped to deal with the range of issues that will arise in the future.</P>
        <P>One of the obvious ways in which we can help the institutions to work in a more effective, efficient and co-operative way is to encourage them to share common services.  Many of the institutions have individual marketing and human resources departments, while institutions also purchase services such as security and insurance which may, if pooled, drive down total expenditure over time.  This is common sense, pure and simple.</P>
        <P>The three main galleries &mdash; the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Gallery &mdash; have put a detailed proposal together on how support and operational services can be shared, and this is being considered at present.  The remit and independence of each of these institutions would not change under these proposals.  The National Gallery of Ireland would continue to show historically important artwork while the Irish Museum of Modern Art would retain its focus on contemporary work.  The institutions concerned would, of course, continue to decide what to exhibit and where to exhibit it.</P>
        <P>There has been much recent commentary about the National Library of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland and the National Archives of Ireland.  The latter is part of my Department and always has been.  It is working very efficiently and effectively.</P>
        <P>When it was announced there would be a review, the Secretary General of my Department set up a review unit and approached the matter very seriously.  The unit has consulted all the organisations and individuals.  The staff in question are those who have been in constant contact with the organisations for years.  They are the staff who gave them funding and grants over the years.  Those who say there was no consultation are incorrect because there certainly was.  Saying there was none is absolutely unfair on the officials in my Department, who have given so much to the arts over the years and whom the Senators know.  The consultation has been extensive and intensive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The National Archives of Ireland is headed by a director with statutory independence and is advised by a voluntary board whose members offer their time <i>pro bono</i>.  Under this structure, it does excellent and independent work.  The National Archives of Ireland, of all institutions, has pioneered online developments, including its award-winning digitisation of the 1901 and 1911 census returns.  The organisation raised &euro;250,000 from philanthropy in the past 12 months to fund a digitisation project, and this ought to be recognised.</P>
        <P>The National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland, which have been in existence since 1887, worked in a similar way until 2005.  I am considering a range of options for these institutions, such as whether the sharing of support functions can streamline how they operate or whether they would operate more efficiently if these support functions were delivered by my Department, which already manages human resources functions for other institutions, such as the National Archives of Ireland, for example.</P>
        <P>I want to examine the governance of institutions and consider how boards or advisory groups might perform a more outwardly proactive and international role in terms of fund-raising and philanthropy.  Having collected a lot of money for cultural projects in the United Kingdom and United States over the years, possibly up to &euro;500,000, I note there are considerable opportunities.  I would like to see our cultural institutions reaching out to a diaspora that would connect with our national treasures.  Senator Mac Conghail has been doing so for the Abbey Theatre&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>With the Minister&rsquo;s support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and there are efforts to reach out involving the National Concert Hall and proposals to make connections in New York.  There is certainly significant potential and our national cultural institutions will have to reach out to realise it.</P>
        <P>In an era of diminished State funding capacity, it would simply not be right of me to ignore the examination of existing structures to see whether they are suited to the realities of 21st century arts and cultural funding.  Where institutions are funded virtually 100% by the taxpayer, the Government has a responsibility to subject them to periodic review.</P>
        <P>Much of the commentary in this House and outside has focused on the curatorial and programming independence of the institutions.  There is no question of their being undermined.  More commentary suggests that I have not consulted relevant parties.  I have addressed this already.  There has been ongoing contact and engagement with the cultural institutions since the Government published its public service reform plan last November.  That contact is continuing.  I met the chairmen of all the national cultural institutions, along with the Arts Council and Culture Ireland, to discuss these issues and hear their views.</P>
        <P>Some have said I am against open, competitive recruitment processes for directors of the institutions.  I want to nail this on the head.  Since I came to office, we have recruited new directors at the National Concert Hall, the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Arts Council, all through open competitions managed by the Public Appointments Service.  We are in discussions with the service on the appointment of the next director of the National Museum of Ireland.  Never before have so many directors been appointed in the same year.  We have managed to recruit some top-class young people with international experience who will make a major contribution to the national cultural institutions.</P>
        <P>I give recognition to those who have retired.  Senator David Norris mentioned Dr. Wallace who retired; he did not resign.</P>
        <P>I ask those who criticise to look at my record in this matter and draw their own conclusions.  I do not accept that examining the possibilities amounts to an attack on the cultural infrastructure of the nation, as some have suggested.  In fact, the idea that any organisation or institution should be, or consider itself to be, above examination for reform is unhealthy and a recipe for a bad deal for the taxpayer.  These institutions are the cultural heartbeat of the nation, the stewards which care for a resource which is literally priceless.  I want to ensure they work in the most effective and efficient way possible and that they can cope with the challenges they will face.  It is my intention that following this process our national cultural institutions will emerge stronger and have a more certain future in order that for coming generations they can continue to preserve our past and inform our future.</P>
        <P>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail made a point about Culture Ireland.  A new director has been appointed; the board has made and announced the appointment.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to Mr. Eugene Downes by Senator David Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>What about competition?  The post of director of Culture Ireland was not advertised externally.  That is what we were looking for.  It was done internally.  He is a civil servant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a full-time position, in other words, it is temporary.  It will be advertised like other jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is welcome.  I thank the Minister for telling us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The person who has been given the job is someone who was in that position for many years, knows the process well and the procedures within Culture Ireland.  One could not find a better person to do the job.  I have experienced the efficiency of the person who replaced Mr. Downes, Ms Christine Sisk.  She is a top class civil and public servant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister wishes to pay tribute to Mr. Downes also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am doing so.  Mr. Downes was excellent.  It was unfortunate that, because he was on contract and of employment law, we were not able to retain him.  He has a major role to play in the arts and I hope he will continue to play it.  Obviously, it would have been advantageous to have him in the position for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union, especially because of his vast number of contacts all over the world, including in New York, the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe.  He is a major asset to the country.  It is unfortunate, as I said, because of his contractual arrangements and employment law, we were not able to keep him on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am sure that in some of the special matters involved, including Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union, the Minister will be able to find a role for him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope he will play an important role here in the future.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that I did not single out the Abbey Theatre.  I was not in any way singling it out because of Senator Fiach Mac Conghail&rsquo;s association with it.</P>
        <P>I am delighted Senator Jillian van Turnhout received such satisfaction from the National Archives of Ireland in tracing her family tree, etc.  The National Archives of Ireland is a part of my Department which has been really criticised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>That is recognised and acknowledged.  It raised the issue of under-resourcing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the context of what is happening, it seems as though, if the Department has any connection with a State institution, there is something wrong with it.  I realise they must have independence, but, eventually, the Department provides the funding and also gives advice and help.  The National Archives of Ireland is a good example of a body in which there is an independent director and advisory council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>Which is currently vacant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the council of the National Archives of Ireland, I say to Senator Maurice Cummins and confirm that I was delighted that Professor Diarmaid Ferriter after he had resigned from the National Library of Ireland had stayed on in the council of the National Archives of Ireland.</P>
        <P>For all those who were appointed to the National Library of Ireland by the previous Minister, former Deputy Mary Hanafin, in August 2010, she pointed out in her letter to them that their appointment was for five years or subject to amalgamations or rationalisations.  Those who took on the appointments knew exactly what the terms were.</P>
        <P>Capital funding for the National Archives of Ireland rose last year.  That was one of my agendas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>It was for damaged buildings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Funding was increased this year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and I went to the National Archives of Ireland which had a problem with the roof which we tried to solve.  My officials are working closely with it to try to find a solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>There are also significant storage issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I know too well.  It was a pity, when we had so much money in the country with which we did not know what to do, that all of these challenges were not faced.  Obviously, there was the lack of a vision, to which Senator Fiach Mac Conghail referred.</P>
        <P>The proposer and seconder of the amendment, Senators Tony Mulcahy and Ivana Bacik, expressed strong views.  Senator Ivana Bacik, especially, expressed her views to me and I will have further conversations with her.  Senator Mary Moran only had two minutes in which to contribute, but she certainly raised important issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I have known each other for a long time.  He had a vision for Comhaltas which, more than anyone else, he has achieved.  He had to fight to get support for the organisation during the years.  I remember the 2003 Bill in that regard.  It is now paying off in a big way, not only from a cultural point of view but also from an economic point of view.  One can see the spin-off in what is happening in Cavan and the increased interest in Irish music all over the country.  At one time it was not cool; now it is very cool such that every youngster in the country wants to be able to play an instrument.  I acknowledge the role Senator Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has played in that regard.  I thank him for his balanced contribution in which he was not political or anything like it.  It is a pity some of his fellow party members in the D&aacute;il did not consult him before they spoke last night.</P>
        <P>I hope I have mentioned and thanked all of the Senators who spoke.  In this House we can formulate an arts policy.  I have my own vision, but none of us has a monopoly of knowledge or wisdom of the arts.  Anyone who thinks he or she has will be disappointed because there are many who have much to contribute in different ways, both at a practical and an intellectual level.  They include those from an academic background but also from a performing background, be it in the visual or performing arts.  We all have something to contribute in our own way.  None of us is a total expert.  I look forward to the rest of the debate, which will inform me and a broader audience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach.  T&aacute; l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm a bheith anseo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na le cupla focal a r&aacute; ar an &aacute;bhar th&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a thabhairt dos na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; Neamhsple&aacute;cha, the Independent Senators, for tabling this important motion.  We are living in constrained economic times.  Sometimes, however, society must weigh up what it believes in and where it has come from to ensure we do not abandon our ethos, culture and identity, in other words, who we are as a people.  I have the utmost regard for the Minister and I do not propose to fall out with him.</P>
        <P>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; summed up the issue well when he noted the purpose of this debate was not to make political points but to discuss an important aspect of Irishness and who we are and where we come from.  As a small country on the periphery of Europe, what sets us apart from our nearest neighbours across the water is our cultural identity, namely, our language, dance, song and music, as well as our cultural institutions which are headed up by people of world renown, including Senator Fiach Mac Conghail who moved the motion.  It is important to make this point and recognise the work of all those engaged in a voluntary or professional capacity in the arts and heritage sector.  They encapsulate what it is we want to promote in terms of being Irish, including our culture and heritage, both in this State and on the island, for the benefit of Irish people and those throughout the world who have Irish links.  Cultural tourism is a major element of this work.  Regardless of where one is in the world, when people hear one is Irish, they tell stories about Riverdance or visiting the National Museum or one of our theatres in Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Minister is in a very important Department and plays a major role at Cabinet level.  At a time of recession and economic challenges to the Government, it is tempting to pick the low-lying fruit.  Sport and the arts are sometimes considered areas where money can be saved, but this is not always the right thing to do.  We should not always view everything in an economic context or tick boxes for the purposes of reducing expenditure.</P>
        <P>My party supports the Minister in his endeavours at Cabinet level to protect the independent status of the national cultural institutions, which was first recognised in the Arts Act of 2003.  We are almost ten years down that road.  It was important to provide the institutions with independent status and a separate identity, latitude and freedom from party politics and ministerial and departmental interference, although &ldquo;interference&rdquo; may be too strong a word.  This independence has served the country well in the past decade.</P>
        <P>I do not support the proposal to merge An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga with the Office of the Ombudsman.  None of these organisations should be merged.  Individuals from the arts, culture and heritage sectors have pointed out such mergers have given rise to additional costs in other countries.  In the case of Canada, for example, the exchequer incurred additional costs of &euro;15 million.  While merging organisations may look well and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform may argue it will save money, this approach does not always work.  Before pursuing this option, all potential mergers, whether they have been announced or may be planned in future, should be the subject of a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis.  International best practice suggests we should maintain the independent identity of institutions that are vital to the State, not only in these times of economic challenges.  In ten, 20, 30 or 40 years, when some of us will be long gone, these institutions must work for our people to protect national identity and cultural values and safeguard our cultural future.  This is the approach advocated in the motion and I commend the Independent Senators on identifying it.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to Professor Diarmaid Ferriter who resigned from the board of the National Library of Ireland in protest at the manner in which the cultural institutions were being treated.  Notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s argument that consultations are taking place, as the motion correctly notes, the arts, heritage and culture sectors do not believe it is sufficiently meaningful.  Perhaps the issue could be revisited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That perception is unfair to the staff of my Department who have worked with the individuals in question for years.  I acknowledge, however, that it is the impression people would get from reading the newspapers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Having spoken to representatives of a number of the organisations in question, it is certainly the view they are expressing.  When my party was in government I challenged Ministers on this matter and insisted consultation was not meaningful enough.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the matter.</P>
        <P>While I do not like to attach a value to the arts, the sector supports approximately 80,000 jobs and contributes approximately &euro;4.7 billion annually to the economy.  If one downgrades or undermines the arts, which I am not suggesting is being done, including through the merger of key organisations, it will have indirect knock-on effects on the economy.  We must avoid such a scenario.</P>
        <P>I had hoped the motion would either secure all-party support or the Government parties would at least approach Independent Senators with a view to formulating an agreed wording for the motion that could have been acceptable to all Senators.  No one wants to vote on issues of cultural significance or, for that matter, related to sport, about which I know a little more than I do about the arts.  Unfortunately, while we do not want to vote against what the Minister is doing, in light of the concern expressed by the sector, we are obliged to support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate.  It is part of our make-up and psyche that we all share such an enthusiasm for the arts.  Our cultural institutions are of major importance to our national heritage.  I have great time for the Independent Senators and salute everything Senator Fiach Mac Conghail has done in the Abbey Theatre.  The Abbey has put on great shows over the years and we are proud of it.  However, I find it amusing, if not rich, that the Independent Senators have tabled this motion.  I was interested to hear the Minister put on record both in the other House and again in this Chamber this evening how much the Abbey is receiving.  It is important to note it is in receipt of one tenth of the Department&rsquo;s capital budget and one ninth of the Arts Council&rsquo;s budget.  I am sure the Independent Senators recognise the huge goodwill the Minister has for the arts.  While I accept everything that has been said, especially by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Members should be closing ranks.  In this Minister, they have a man who is a safe pair of hands and who has operated with an open door policy at all times.</P>
        <P>As for curatorial and programming independence, he has guaranteed it.  He merely is talking about back office administrative functions in this regard, and there can be economies of scale in respect of human resources, information technology, payroll and procurement.  There is no harm in any of that and great good could emerge in having a pooling of resources.  One cannot escape the fact of the nation&rsquo;s finances, which is the reason I agree so much with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  One must be careful as there is such a tremendous image abroad for which these national cultural institutions are in their own way responsible.  If I may joke slightly about it, the Minister would not drop the ball, and I salute that.  Members are aware of this man&rsquo;s commitment.  They all wish to optimise funding and all are aware of the severe difficulties we face.  There is nothing to fear, once we steady ourselves, as the Government is managing scarce resources well and will continue to so do.  The Minister continues to be completely open and again gave a guarantee in this regard this evening.  While I was saddened that Professor Diarmaid Ferriter chose to resign from the board of one institution, as the Minister noted he has remained on the board of the other, which is good.  People of his calibre should continue to make themselves available and should be prepared to enter into consultation.</P>
        <P>Many worthwhile and sensible points have been made in the Chamber this evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Senator did.  I must apologise to the Senator as I missed the beginning of his contribution.  There was something of a cock-up with regard to the starting time but perhaps that was my fault.  It certainly was not that of the Senator.  I have no doubt the Senator made some good points.</P>
        <P>However, I revert to basics.  I do not wish to labour this point because the Minister&rsquo;s heart is in the right place.  He seeks to optimise the funding but because the Government is paying out so much more money than it is taking in, it must be extremely careful.  Moreover, he who pays the piper must have some say with regard to calling the tune because in this case, that is the taxpayer of Ireland.  The Government must be very careful in this regard and the Minister is being more than careful in how he is balancing things out.  He is a safe pair of hands who lives and breathes the arts.  As all Members opposite accept this point, I repeat it would be a pity for a division on this matter to be necessary and I certainly hope there will not be one.  The perception abroad regarding some of these points is completely inaccurate, and in fairness to Members on the other side, I believe they recognise this.  Consequently, I appeal for common sense and for Members to allow the amendment to go through.  Senator Norris noted earlier there is little between the respective positions, perhaps a few words or a few paragraphs.  While he made a few brief points, I do not have to hand the notes I made on them.  However, he noted Members were aware of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment and that little separates them on this issue.  Consequently, I plead with Members to accept the amendment and to avoid a division.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>It is great to have the Minister in the Chamber and I will welcome him by responding to some of the points he made.  I reconfirm the welcome by the Independent group of Senators to the artists, archivists and members of the National Campaign for the Arts.  I am pleased to support this motion tabled by Senator Mac Conghail and Senator van Turnhout.  While I am not an expert in this field, at the outset I acknowledge the courage of my colleague, Senator Mac Conghail, in particular.  It is not easy to be a voice of dissent.  At the same time, I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s robust, straightforward and honest-speaking way of responding in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il.  He is right that it makes for a good practice of democracy.</P>
        <P>Before coming to a couple of the points made by the Minister, I wish to echo many of the sentiments expressed by Members that the arts are the soul of our nation.  I speak about this from the perspective of someone who could be described as Irish-American Irish.  While I was born in the United States, my ancestors are Irish.  I recall coming to this land and hearing for the first time poetry spoken in Irish by Nuala N&iacute; Dhomhnaill, which was extraordinary.  Moreover, it was when I first saw Brian Friel&rsquo;s play &ldquo;Translations&rdquo; on the stage of the Abbey Theatre that I finally copped on to what it meant, that is, to the importance of the Irish language, the stealing of that language and the meaning of the language as part of the cultural identity.  As for the archives, I also recall that extraordinary feeling as an American Irish person, learning about my great-grandmother and where she was born and seeing the records with my mother, who has since passed.</P>
        <P>The arts are the soul of the nation and, therefore, Members wish to support the Minister in his vision and the making of an arts policy that enables and encourages the freedom, creativity and critical engagement with what is happening politically, economically and socially, as well as in the rebuilding and reforming of the Republic.  Again, I think of that tradition Senator Mac Conghail is carrying on so ably in the context of his work.  However, and Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and others also spoke about this, Members also seek a policy that provides arts to enable the nourishment of the meaning of life, of right living and of relationships characterised by well-being, as well as to remind one always of the &ldquo;something more&rdquo; and of the need to go beyond, about which Senator Mac Conghail spoke.  Consequently, Members seek a policy that is about neither the acts or programmes that represent the censorship of the past nor the benign neglect to which Fintan O&rsquo;Toole referred.</P>
        <P>However, what are Members asking for?  I will be succinct, as a few other Members wish to contribute.  What is the difference between the Independent Senators&rsquo; motion on one side and the amendment and the Minister&rsquo;s arguments on the other?  I wish to appeal to that common sense for which Senator Paul Coghlan has asked Members.  Is there still time to ascertain how Members might come to a common perspective in this regard?  What is the difference between the motion and the amendment?  On first reading, not being an expert, I noted many similarities.  However, one difference, to which the Minister did not refer, pertains to whether he would be willing to publish his response to the public service reform plan.  He spoke about the plan and his response to it but the call of the Independent Members is for that response to be published.  He spoke at length about the consultation process back and forth and because I have not been as close to it as have others, I wish to respect the points made by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke about a more meaningful or at least a form of public consultation process, and Members on this side were trying to call for a process that they perceive as being public.  In this context, they tried to put forward a constructive example, as such a process currently is under way in respect of the merger between the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority of Ireland.  I have monitored that issue closely and refer to the process of ongoing requests for submissions from the public and to a working group engaged in taking them in, reviewing and putting out.  I was present for the speech given by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, yesterday at the launch of the last annual report of the Irish Human Rights Commission.  He referred to the working group&rsquo;s report that made recommendations for the merger of the new body.  He indicated that it did draw on public consultation and for one of the first times perhaps the Government accepted all of the recommendations for the heads of a Bill.  It shows what public ownership can be as a result of that type of process of consultation.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister finished the consultation phase or is there more public consultation that could take place?  He referred to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strategic policy.  We are offering it as an example of a way of implementing the commitment.  I did not hear the Minister refer to that.</P>
        <P>In trying to understand the differences between the motion and the amendment, we are seeking independence in terms of governance.  The Minister refers to independence in terms of programming and curation.  There is a difference of emphasis.  Will the Minister respond on the issue of the independence of governance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Senator Zappone that I have made no proposals to Government yet.  I have not finalised my position.  It is too early to accept the motion because we have not yet determined what we will do.  That is the reason I cannot accept the motion.  I included elements of the motion in the amendment in recognition of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  When he spoke about fellows who dropped the ball, the phrase occurred to me was to be careful what you ask for because you might get it.  If one was afraid of the fellow in one corner-back position, there was an even tougher fellow over in the other corner and one could end up in a worse state.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to what went on in the years in which the money was all spent.  I refer to an bord snip nua.  I previously used the proper English language title which nobody uses any more.  I will claim a grant from the Arts Council for that.  An bord snip nua tells us that between 1997 and 2009, the number of higher grade civil servants rose by 82% in numbers compared with 27% on average.  That is what happened.  A massive bureaucracy grew up during the period.  I refer to page 12 of volume one of the report of an bord snip nua.  The pay level due to benchmarking at those top levels meant that we ended up with senior civil servants and Governors of the Central Bank being paid far more than their international comparators, including the former Taoiseach because his pay was linked to that of higher civil servants.  Builders, bureaucrats and bankers are the ones who got us into this mess.  Whether Senator Mac Conghail can run a matinee on a Wednesday in October is not going to solve those problems and we must face up to them.</P>
        <P>In the Book of Estimates for the current year I note that the programme expenditure was down by 9%.  That is correct.  We are in difficulty.  Everyone must participate in the solution.  However, the administration budget only reduced by 2%.  The total budget went down by 9% and administration went down by 2%, but most of the items in the administration budget went up.  My unweighted average for the five of them is that they increased by 63%.  A total of 23% more was spent on travel and subsistence, training and development expenses increased by 67%, postal and telecoms increased by 10%, offices expenses increased by 26%, and policy reviews and value for money increased by 14%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senator Barrett would allow me to interrupt, as he is aware, my Department was a reconfiguration of previous Departments.  Because of the reconfiguration, the figure in the Estimate does not reflect the amount spent in the Vote on administration.  I explained that when I was doing the Estimate before the committee.  Senator Barrett is correct in what he says but there is an explanation for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Go raibh maith agat, a Aire.  That is what the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, must address.  He referred to low-hanging fruit.  I think much low-hanging fruit hit him on the head.  The pattern of increases in non-pay administration budgets is evident right across the board.  The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues must come to terms with that.  The administration, as published, is &euro;36 million.  That is the equivalent of the cost of five Abbey Theatres going on administration.  We must question that.  It is a problem in the health service as well, the massive growth of bureaucracy as against frontline staff.  We have a problem in that regard.  It is important to diagnose what got us into the mess.  Whether we get rid of people who serve on a board voluntarily or who have offered to serve for free will not solve the problem, which is layers of bureaucracy.  The problem is Sir Humphrey, not the frontline staff.  I accept what the Minister said about the need to correct the numbers but they apply across the board.  People looking in on the administration from outside wonder if a so-called capture has taken place, that the radicalism the electorate chose when it changed the Government so radically has not altered the permanent government.  The nature of bureaucracy is that it likes to expand the budget, expand its influence and grow even when the overall activity in the economy is contracting.  That is a serious danger.</P>
        <P>Another point on how bureaucracy behaves is exemplified in the McLaughlin report on local government.  I have discussed it with the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd.  In the moratorium period in local government the number of directors reduced by 7%, clerical and administration staff reduced by 4%, professional and technical staff by 3.7% and outdoor staff &mdash; those who do the work &mdash; reduced by 13%.  We do have a problem with bureaucracy.  I hope that in tackling it we do not damage the vital front line and that we take into account what reaches through to people in the art galleries and theatres.  The bureaucratic side has done remarkably well to escape so lightly to date.  We must not allow it to continue to escape by endangering the cultural activities the Minister, I and everyone in the House value.  A new emphasis is needed the next time around on budgeting because bureaucratic costs do not produce anything.  They are inputs and overheads.  We are all interested in directly productive cultural activities, including all the work the Minister did himself for cultural activities in County Kerry such as raising money abroad.</P>
        <P>The situation is echoed in local government, the health service and in universities.  If we keep going, there will be a small number of people giving lectures but there will be an increased number of strategic managers watching them give the lectures.  The Government must get a grip on the problem.  The emphasis should be on people who put on performances, shows and exhibitions in galleries which people attend in large numbers.  Bureaucracy got off very lightly in the previous Book of Estimates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is welcome to the House.  I am delighted to be able to take part in the debate.  It is always good to have a debate, although there are serious issues at stake.  It is worth saying, if I might shamelessly talk about Yeats Day for a moment &mdash; the Minister and I had the pleasure of being part of the inaugural launch of Yeats Day in Sligo two weeks ago &mdash; that in the current times when things are difficult and there is not much money, it shows that with some creativity and a small amount of money, much can be done to tap into what we have talked about as our identity and culture.  As Senator Zappone said, it is in our hearts and souls and sometimes we are touched by it.  On the day when we started to celebrate the legacy of W.B. Yeats, we were able to do so with the participation of the national cultural institutions, which were holding hands, so to speak, and at their best.  The National Gallery, the National Library and the Abbey Theatre were in Sligo, on the ground, sharing the moment and proving that even in straitened times there is great creativity and enthusiasm for the arts.  We should not forget those moments because they are the things we work towards.  I am sure that when Senator Barrett talks about bureaucracy, he means inefficient bureaucracy as opposed to bureaucracy <i>per se</i>, because we need people to do that work, the stuff one has to churn through to create a commemorative day, week, event or matinee.  Without the bureaucratic input, there is nothing else to see on the outside.  I am sure Senator Sean Barrett was thinking of inefficient bureaucracy as opposed to bureaucracy in general.</P>
        <P>I understand why the Minister is not in a position to accept the motion.  I respect that, too.  As Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and others said, we do not want to be in disagreement here.  We all value our national cultural institutions because they are the tangible, concrete manifestation of our artistic and cultural endeavour.  They are where we keep our connections with our ancestors, history and past, with whom we were and, therefore, with whom we are, and where our dreams and concerns for the future find a home.  They bind us together and are vital to our well-being and sense of identity.  We need our national cultural institutions, but not more than ever before.  We always needed them.  We now need them to be underpinned by independence, while being able in a cut-throat commercial world to do business.  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s absolute commitment to the curatorial and programming independence of all the institutions.  That is something he never had any intention of touching.  It is important, in this context, that he make that clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That point is very much respected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the Government is as committed as the Minister to the ongoing independence of these institutions.  From conversations I have had, that is what I understand.  Independence does not have to be the sacrificial lamb of reform, nor should it be.  The public service reform plan is one of the planks of reform that will continue over a period of time.  It is part of the jigsaw puzzle of reform.  The public &mdash; that is, you and I, voters &mdash; wants to see a better, more efficient, more cost effective and more productive public service, as do public servants themselves.  That is a win-win.  The plan is unlikely to be perfect or get everything right first time around.  It can, however, establish shared work practices, what the Minister calls the shared services model, for human resources, payroll, pensions and other services that are duplicated.  That sounds easy to say.  In fact, it has rolled off our tongues several times in several ways.  It will, however, bring enormous difficulties and challenges for the people and the range of national cultural institutions involved.  The acknowledgment by national cultural institutions that this is the direction in which we need to go is important.  They recognise the need to get value for money.  Bringing them together to work towards that end is a big achievement.  It is something we should recognise and commend because it will be difficult.  Making the changes happen will involve obstacles, problem solving and trust.  We talk blithely about change, but it is incredibly difficult and a slow process.  To have walked this far already is a great achievement. </P>
        <P>The Minister is committed to improving customer service and working in new ways.  These will be vital.  The world in which the national cultural institutions are operating is changing and they must move and change in that changing world to compete, stay open and survive.  The public, of which we are part, and the public service, of which we are also part, do not want to see any of our great institutions diminished.  Reform always has a dangerous edge to it.  We know the concept of giving an inch and having a mile taken.  In this debate we are saying there need to be inches and inches, but we do not want to go the whole mile.  I ask that the national cultural institutions keep their independent boards and their arm&rsquo;s length relationship with the  Department.  That is not maintaining the <i>status quo.  </i>Instead, it could turn into the robust system of governance the institutions will need to ensure they become stronger, more in charge of their own destiny and responsible for keeping the doors open, finding new ways and adapting old ways to fund their existence and keeping and protecting the cultural legacy that we, the people, have entrusted to them, which responsibility I know they take seriously.One size does not fit all.  I understand the Minister and his Department are looking at all available models and, perhaps, at ways to adapt them to make hybrids of what is in place.  We know there are benefits to having a robust, thriving cultural economy.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  This is critical for tourism and inward investment.  It is also critical for our own identity.  The changes that will be driven by cost efficiencies must be made carefully and slowly because so much &mdash; so much that I know the Minister values &mdash; is at stake.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure this conversation is ongoing.  Perhaps some of the public consultation model about which the Independent Senators spoke could be looked at and might help all of us because we have a shared interest.</P>

	<P>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; eala&iacute;ne.  T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach.  Is bre&aacute; an rud go bhfuil an t-Aire anseo in&aacute;r measc ar&iacute;s.  Tugann Sinn F&eacute;in taca&iacute;ocht ioml&aacute;n don r&uacute;n at&aacute; &aacute; chur ar aghaidh ag na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; neamhsple&aacute;cha agus f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimhe.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh s&eacute; in acmhainn ag an Rialtas tac&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n go hioml&aacute;n mar at&aacute; s&eacute;, mar s&iacute;lim gur cuireadh ar aghaidh &eacute; le dea-mh&eacute;in agus ar mhaithe leis an rud ceart a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
        <P>Many years ago Oscar Wilde defined a cynic as a man who knew the price of everything and the value of nothing.  I am sure the Minister is surrounded by cynics, although I do not contend he is one, rather he is the opposite.  However, they are plentiful.  If Oscar Wilde was alive today, he would probably describe Chancellor Angela Merkel as a cynic.  I am sure there are many others throughout Europe who do not realise the value of the arts and culture, particularly in the Irish context.  I imagine Ireland has more artists <i>per capita</i> than any other country because we cover so many disciplines, from literature to dance, theatre, music and so on.  That is probably true and we will contend it is until someone tells us the opposite.</P>
        <P>The debate has gone in the wrong direction.  The Minister has said his starting principle is to examine organisations, especially those receiving money from the taxpayer, and that this is a healthy and necessary exercise.  That is the wrong place to start.  Earlier we had a debate on our natural resources, including oil and gas.  We should turn this debate into one on our natural resources.  The arts are probably one of our best natural resources.  The debate about funding would then centre on how to support that resource.  How do we support artists and the people with the creativity, genius and ingenuity to create art that is different from anything else in the world?  How does this enhance us as a community, a people and a state?  What are the benefits and dividends that ensue from it?</P>
        <P>I have a bugbear about the way the arts are measured.  People in the arts community have always felt a need to justify ourselves to those with a bums-on-seats mentality because that is what the Civil Service has asked us to do.  It is what the funders, the cynics, have asked us to do.  We have to justify everything in those terms.  We need to stand up and say the arts deserve to be funded.  Arts activity is worthy of being funded in its own right.  Conditionality should not be imposed on someone funded as an artist in residence, for example.  An artist in residence should not be obliged to do workshops in schools.  An artist in residence should receive stand-alone funding.  However, I accept that we must have some measurement in order to stave off all the cynics around us.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>How do we best enhance the arts and how do we use them?  They can be a catalyst in bringing us out of an economic downturn.  Very little capital investment is needed for an arts project.  The Galway Arts Festival, the film industry and other arts projects have shown that the multiplier effect of investment in the arts is massive.  The comeback from arts activities, in direct taxation and the spend in the local community, is massive.  We need to make that argument.  To use football parlance, the Minister has gone in with the hard shoulder on a number of occasions to defend the arts, but in a football match of 70 minutes a player has to keep on doing this.  The Minister is going to have to keep doing it to defend the arts.  We need him to go in with the hard shoulder and tell the cynics to back off the arts.  He would have our full support in doing so.  He would also receive cross-party support.</P>
        <P>To keep the cynics happy, one must recognise that expenditure in the arts sector alone amounts to &euro;1.8 billion and that 26,590 people are employed in the arts, all of whom are paying tax as employees.  This is of huge importance.  Moreover, the creative industries themselves are worth &euro;5.4 billion to the country and employ almost 100,000 people.  That is neither a small nor an insignificant number of people.  As Senator Norris noted earlier, 57% of adults or almost 2 million people are arts attenders and 1.2 million people engage in artistic or creative activities.  Consequently, we certainly have the requisite number of bums on seats for the size of our nation but my point is this should not be the only measure.</P>
        <P>The Minister and I both attended a recent event organised by him in which he toured the country to talk to people involved in the arts.  It was very good and there was a fantastic engagement in the Town Hall Theatre, Galway.  One suggestion made at that meeting was the Government should consider having an artist appointed to each State body.  That is a really good and clever suggestion.  First, for an artist who is fairly hard up, there would be a stipend that certainly would add to his or her income.  However, it would be crucial to bring such creativity into the decision making of the State and this should be done at all levels.  Artists tend to think differently and creatively and to look at other ways of doing things and I believe people have become highly blinkered in their thinking.  One must recognise the work of the artist as being important in its own right.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an tAire &aacute;balta labhairt faoi Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta and I hope the funding available for that body can be continued, as it is very important for Irish language arts.  Moreover, the inclusion issues of geography, social inclusion and access to the arts for people from all spectrums of society are very important.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the four main thrusts outlined by Senator Zappone and the wishes of the independent artists are pragmatic and clear.  I will conclude by quoting Oscar Wilde, who wrote &ldquo;We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars&rdquo;.  I believe the Minister and Members are looking at the stars but they must convince a great many more people to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>To paraphrase Phillip McMahon, who wrote &ldquo;Alice in Funderland&rdquo;, we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking up at the Spar.</P>
        <P>At the outset, the Minister should be under no illusion but that all Members are here to support him without question.  However, what is vital in our community, of which the Minister is a part both as a Minister and in respect of his role and the work he has done in Listowel, is that a good and vibrant debate is really important.  Lots of disagreement is important and he should not feel discomfort in any way, because it is better to have such a debate in public.  This is the problem that has been encountered heretofore.</P>
        <P>I assure the Minister that under no circumstances am I impinging on, or impugning, the reputation, skill or expertise of the Minister&rsquo;s officials.  As for Niall &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, assistant secretary of the Department, who is sitting behind the Minister, and all his officials, I know them, have worked with them and went shoulder to shoulder with them through many wars.  I acknowledge publicly that Members on this side  &mdash; certainly the Independent group of Senators &mdash; are not criticising the civil servants.  The Minister must be made aware of that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>They seek the flip side of this, namely, the public consultation side.  This is the reason we drew an example from what is being done by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  The public must be a part of this debate, and as there was no airing, it was our responsibility to come to the Seanad to deal with that lack.  Incidentally, utterly unbeknownst to us, Fianna F&aacute;il tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion in the D&aacute;il.  As for the idea there was synchronisation, it is a complete coincidence because the Independent Members have their shift in Private Members&rsquo; business, as does Fianna F&aacute;il.  I reassure the Minister there was no&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know she did not apply for the job and I would encourage her in this regard.  At the same time, however, that job should be publicised.  The Minister&rsquo;s contribution also mentioned the director of the National Archives, but that position is vacant at present.  We have an acting director, not a director, of the National Archives and that position should be filled.</P>

First, when he has made up his mind, can he publish his response to the public sector reform plan and put it into the public domain before it goes into the process in the way his ministerial colleagues in other Departments have done?</P>
        <P>Second, the Minister&rsquo;s speech indicated clearly he has no intention of dismantling the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  I note this and accept it is very close to what the Independent Senators seek.  I absolutely agree with him, notwithstanding the periodic review of each and every cultural institution or body, that one must look for value for money and for efficiencies, but also and more importantly, for governance.  While the aforementioned 1997 Act protects the governance, the Minister has every right to look for value and to investigate whether they work well, and indeed the Minister appoints them.  The Minister said that dismantling the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 was never in his plans.  If I can accept that as what the Minister is saying to me, I would consider that to be a <i>sine qua non</i> in terms of the arm&rsquo;s length principle.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for foreign affairs, Deputy Creighton, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this Adjournment debate.  I apologise for not welcoming her when I was in the Chair earlier.  Another Senator jumped in before I had the opportunity, but I will welcome her now.</P>
        <P>My matter relates to the town of Rathmore in County Kerry.  I am unsure as to whether the Minister of State is <i>au fait</i> with it.  The Cullavaw river flows behind the town for approximately two miles before joining the River Blackwater.  Much of the area has suffered severe flooding several times, with one house flooded and five others put at risk.  At Ballycullane in Rathmore, two large streams join together and flow into the Cullavaw river, which can lead to exceptional flooding that blocks the road and forces residents to use a longer route to get to the western side of the town where the church and a number of shops are located.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why Rathmore has not been included in the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, which is designed to assess and map the county&rsquo;s river system to identify areas at risk of significant flooding.  I assume that major works will not be carried out on the Cullavaw, given that it has not been even included in the flood risk review report that is being prepared.  If this is so, will the Minister of State confirm whether the river is suitable for funding under the minor works scheme?  Residents are asking that the overgrowth along the river banks be cut back and that the eyes of the bridge be cleared of the shrubbery that impedes the water&rsquo;s flow and results in flooding.  I am sure the Minister of State agrees that it is not too much to ask for the Office of Public Works, OPW, to clear the river bank.</P>
        <P>People are entitled to live in their homes without the fear or risk of flooding.  If a house is flooded and one claims on one&rsquo;s insurance, the house will never be covered against flooding again.  This is a major concern for residents.</P>
        <P>We seem to have wet weather constantly.  Unfortunately, this might continue to be the case.  In this light, it is important that we nip the problem in the bud before a considerable amount of money is needed to carry out major works.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and hope she will have some good news for me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for her brevity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Moloney for raising this issue.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, cannot be present for this debate, but he asked me to extend his thanks to the Senator.  I will take this Adjournment matter in his stead.</P>
        <P>As I am sure the Senator knows, the OPW is aware of the location&rsquo;s flooding problem, which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, understands has been ongoing for a number of years.  However, as the River Cullavaw, a tributary of the River Blackwater, does not form part of any arterial drainage scheme for which the OPW has a maintenance responsibility under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, as amended, the maintenance of this watercourse does not fall under the OPW&rsquo;s remit.  This position was notified to Kerry County Council in February 2011 in response to a resolution adopted by the council requesting that the OPW carry out works to address the flooding issue.  The OPW&rsquo;s position was reiterated in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply to Parliamentary Question No. 95, which was tabled by Deputy Tom Fleming on 10 November 2011.  In both instances, it was advised that it was open to Kerry County Council to submit an application under the minor flood mitigation works scheme for funding to implement measures to alleviate the flooding problem.  To date, no such application has been received.</P>
        <P>The scheme was introduced by the OPW in 2009 to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved within a short timeframe.  Under it, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects, with the balance being funded by the local authority concerned.  Works that would be normally the responsibility of the council or for which funding is available from other State bodies, for example, road repairs or gully cleaning, will generally not be considered for funding.</P>
        <P>Local authorities submit funding applications in the prescribed format.  These are assessed by the OPW, having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including the cost benefit ratio.  Any proposal should be cost effective, have no negative social and environmental effects and not create a significant flood risk elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Regarding the benefit-to-cost ratio, proposals must meet a minimum of 1.5:1 to qualify.  The benefit-to-cost ratio for a particular project is calculated under the terms of the scheme, having regard to the total costs of the works and the value of the total benefit accruing from such works.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the council to devise a feasible engineering solution to address the problem and to submit it to the OPW for consideration under the scheme.  Any proposal received from the council will be assessed under the scheme&rsquo;s criteria, having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management.  Should funding be made available, the commencement and progression of any work would be a matter for Kerry County Council.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her good reply.  It was my understanding that it had not been confirmed that these works were suitable for the minor works scheme.  However, the response clearly lays out that the council has been notified several times.  I will raise the matter with the county manager and engineers and proceed from there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  My Adjournment matter relates to the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to make a statement on the need for the former Camp Liberty in Iraq to be recognised as a refugee camp under the UN flag and his willingness to pursue at EU level the resettlement of refugees from Camp Ashraf in Iraq to EU countries.  Since the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply might make reference to it, I am aware that the group involved in Camp Ashraf forms part of the People&rsquo;s Mujahedin of Iran, PMOI, which was designated as a terrorist organisation more than 15 years ago.  I am aware that the United States bombed these camps on at least one occasion and also that the National Council of Resistance of Iran, NCRI, has taken a case in the United States, with the US Court of Appeals giving the Secretary of State four months to determine the position and whether a group opposed to Iran should be removed from the list of foreign terrorist organisations.  It has been indicated that if the Secretary of State fails to take action within four months, the petition for a writ of <i>mandamus</i> setting aside the foreign terrorist organisation designation will be granted.  It is clear that the courts were far from satisfied with the failure to back up the designation which was granted when Dr. Condoleezza Rice was Secretary of State.</P>
        <P>Following the attacks by Iraqi forces on Ashraf, in which 47 people were killed and over 1,000 injured, an agreement was signed at the end of 2011 between the United Nations and Iraq to relocate the residents inside the country before allowing the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, to carry out its refugee determination process to transfer them to third countries.  The people within the camps were encouraged, as part of an attempt to find a peaceful solution, to transfer to Camp Liberty, which was agreed to, despite the legal right to stay in Ashraf.</P>
        <P>Ashraf residents have movable and immovable properties because they have been there for a considerable number of years and these properties are estimated to be worth over &euro;500 million.  They were built and obtained through their own efforts and with their own money, yet Iraq does not allow them to sell them in Iraq or transfer them to another country.  Camp Liberty does not meet humanitarian and human rights standards.  There is a heavy presence of armed forces and vehicles, a lack of freedom of movement, a serious shortage of infrastructure such as water, electricity and sewerage systems, and also a lack of necessary facilities for the disabled and the elderly.  All of these facilities are available in Camp Ashraf, provided at the residents&rsquo; own expense.  Iraq justifies these restrictions under the pretext that Camp Liberty is a temporary transit location.</P>
        <P>Only last week a committee of the European Parliament refused to meet a high level delegation from Iraq because it included the commander involved in the camps.  There is international recognition of the issue.  While condemning violations of the Iranian dissidents&rsquo; rights in Camp Ashraf and Camp Liberty, there is a real need for the United Nations and the United States to compel Iraq to stop imposing inhumane restrictions on residents, particularly preventing them from selling or transferring properties.  The United Nations and the UNHCR must recognise Camp Liberty as a refugee camp.  I am asking that we play our part in achieving this.  The matter also covers the resettlement of people from Camp Ashraf who do not want to move to Camp Liberty because of what has happened there, the conditions in which people live and the risk to them.  Apart from whether one subscribes to their political beliefs, it is important from a humanitarian perspective that we are seen to play our part in this regard.  I, therefore, ask that Ireland play its part in having other countries in the European Union accept refugees from Camp Ashraf.</P>
        <P>It is important to state the leadership of the resistance movement has responded to allegations that there are weapons at Camp Ashraf by saying it would support a call on the American State Department and the Department of Defense to task the US military with immediately inspecting Camp Ashraf with necessary equipment and announcing the findings.  In other words, it would welcome independent verification by the United States that there are no weapons in the camp.</P>
        <P>I attended a rally the group held in Paris over the weekend.  A former UN official who was personally involved and left the service because of qualms of conscience about this issue indicated that the UN base in Iraq and Baghdad had falsified documents on the conditions at Camp Liberty in order to meet the requirements of those above who wanted more favourable pronouncements and assessments of the camp.  That is appalling, although it is a separate issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore.  </P>
        <P>In December 2011 an agreement was reached between the United Nations &mdash;  specifically the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees &mdash; and the Government of Iraq on the closure of Camp Ashraf in Iraq.  The camp residents agreed to their relocation under its terms.  The process for the closure of the camp has been under way since February this year, under the supervision of the UNHCR and the UN Special Representative, Mr. Martin Kobler.  Of the 3,400 residents in Camp Ashraf, approximately 2,000 have now transferred to Camp Hurriya, formerly Camp Liberty, near Baghdad.  This is designated as a temporary transit location from which the residents will move on to more permanent accommodation in other countries which both the residents and the Iraqi authorities now agree is the desired solution.  The transfer process to Camp Hurriya is a difficult one, with great distrust and suspicion between the two sides.  This issue has been well outlined by the Senator.</P>
        <P>In Camp Hurriya the UNHCR is processing the individual residents and determining where best to relocate them.   A number of residents may already have a citizenship or other claim to relocation in another country and the UNHCR is identifying these first.  The remaining residents, probably a majority, must be found relocation places in other countries.  The UNHCR is encouraging countries to make such places available.</P>
        <P>It is important to be aware of the wider background to these issues, some of which have been alluded to by the Senator.  Camp Ashraf was set up as a military base by the People&rsquo;s Mujahidin of Iran, PMOI, in 1986.  The PMOI was classed as a terrorist organisation by the European Union until 2009 and is still so formally designated by the US Government.  Neither the PMOI nor the political wing, the NCRI, has significant support inside Iran and the people concerned cannot be regarded as the Iranian resistance or a government in exile.  Their forces assisted Saddam Hussein in the violent suppression of uprisings in the Shia and Kurdish communities in Iraq, during which large numbers of civilians were massacred.  By its own admission, the PMOI admitted responsibility for numerous attacks in Iran resulting in thousands of deaths during the paramilitary campaign.  Although no longer engaged in violence, the PMOI has continued to run Camp Ashraf in a tightly controlled and near totalitarian manner, with well documented reports, including from Human Rights Watch, of the abuse and intimidation of residents.</P>
        <P>Following the war of 2003, the new Iraqi Government took a very different view of the presence of the PMOI enclave in the country and sought at first to move it from its position near the Iranian border.  Latterly, when this was resisted by the residents, the Iraqi Government has moved more strongly to have the camp closed altogether and the PMOI and the residents moved to other countries.  Although the background from which Iraq has approached the issue is appreciated, the protection and human rights of the residents are key concerns for Ireland, its EU partners and the wider international community.  The European Union has enunciated a series of essential principles regarding Camp Ashraf and its residents.  Iraq is, once again, a fully sovereign state, no longer under the tutelage of either the United States or the United Nations.  It has sovereignty over the camps and is within its rights in seeking to move Camp Ashraf away from the Iranian border.  Equally, this means that the Iraqi Government is responsible for the safety and humane treatment of the residents.  There must be no question of forced return of any resident to Iran and the Iraqi authorities have accepted this.  The process under the UNHCR is the agreed and only means of resolving the situation at Camp Ashraf and should be adhered to.</P>
        <P>With regard to the living conditions in Camp Hurriya, we call on the Iraqi authorities to allow all reasonable provision for the safety and comfort of the residents, including the transfer of necessary equipment and property from Camp Ashraf.  In doing so, we recognise that it is the judgment of the UNHCR that Camp Hurriya is of an acceptable standard to accommodate refugees.  The precise status of the camp is a matter for the UNHCR and the Iraqi authorities to decide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply but it did not state if we will pursue at EU level efforts to have these refugees resettled in Europe.  The UN has said the camp is of an acceptable standard but I have personally heard the person who was involved in drafting that report stating it was falsified.  That was my point; it is an appalling vista, should it be true.  Given we are endeavouring to secure a place on the human rights council of the UN, it would be vital to take up that.  I have also heard serious criticism of the UN representative but I do not have any personal knowledge about the veracity of that.  It came from people who are more familiar with the situation within the European Parliament and elected representatives within the US.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>On resettlement, as a country that promotes and values human rights &mdash; a core aspect of our foreign policy &mdash; we encourage it but it is the sovereign decision of individual member states as to whether they accept refugees or not.  Of course we encourage others and Ireland will try to play its role but for historical and political reasons we must be sensitive.  Some member states in the European Union are reluctant to accept refugees because of the character, history and make up of the PMOI.  We must be sensitive to that reality while trying to pursue the objective the Senator outlines and with which I agree.</P>
        <P>I cannot stand in the House and pronounce on the veracity or otherwise of a report.  We put our trust in the United Nations as a vital multilateral institution, one which we are very involved in and often leading in the field of human rights promotion.  I cannot stand over that claim, I can only say that in respect of any doubts, we will explore them.  Ireland is seeking a nomination to the human rights council and we hope we will be successful in that election.  If we are, we will be in a stronger position to proceed with some of these issues.</P>

    <sTitle>Community Employment Schemes.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming in because I realise how busy she is.  I am conscious of the hours of work she has put into resolving the outstanding issues surrounding the community employment schemes.  This Adjournment matter offers the chance to debunk any scare-mongering that has taken place about doubts surrounding the Minister&rsquo;s own personal commitment to the community employment scheme model and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to those schemes.  My concerns, as set out in my question to the Minister, are that there are more than 23,300 workers employed in 1,270 community employment schemes country-wide, all carrying out valuable work, training and labour activation activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The budget in December caused some consternation for many of the schemes because it was proposed initially that there would be a 66% cut in materials grants for the schemes, which would have rendered many of them inoperative and unsustainable.  The Minister, to give credit where it is due, initiated a review of that and embarked on a wide-ranging review of the operation and funding of the schemes.</P>
        <P>It is universally accepted that one size does not fit all, that not all schemes are the same and they do not all require the same funding or training modules.  The review was initiated as far back as January.  Half the year has since passed and the initial report was due at the end of March.  A considerable period has passed where many of the schemes, their workers, supervisors and sponsors have been operating in limbo and they have not had much clarity on the funding model.</P>
        <P>This evening I urge the Minister to assist us in this regard.  It is imminent and the Minister has been pressing for this to be brought to a conclusion.  I ask her to indicate to us this evening when we can expect the review to be concluded and what its determination will be so the schemes can proceed in a vigorous and sustainable fashion.  In Laois, a total of 17 viable schemes employ more than 300 people.  Like everyone else country-wide, they want to know where they stand so they can get on with their work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Whelan for his kind remarks and I acknowledge and reiterate the importance of community employment in the provision of crucial services to both rural and urban communities across the country.</P>
        <P>There are 1,143 CE schemes in operation nationally, with 23,300 places, on which there are around 22,000 participants and approximately 1,400 full-time supervisor posts.  Work on these schemes covers a diverse range of activities such as child care, horticulture, social services, cultural and arts activities, IT, sports, environmental, heritage, clerical and administrative and drugs rehabilitation.  The overall estimated budget will be in excess of &euro;315 million for 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Due to the current economic circumstances facing the country and the need for the Department to find substantial savings in the context of the budget, it is necessary to examine all aspects of expenditure of my Department on an ongoing basis.  It was against this backdrop that the financial review of CE schemes got under way a couple of months ago.  The schemes were transferred to the Department on 1 January.  The main objective was to identify areas where savings could be achieved through efficiencies so that best use could be made of the available funds in the context of the important work that is done for local communities and in order that participants have a good quality experience that offers the possibility of progressing into work.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As a result of the review, significant savings have been already made to the overheads of CE projects in terms of annual insurance costs and audit fees.  The savings will increase next year as some projects had already incurred these costs prior to the new arrangements being in place.  Given the volume and breadth of the data being returned, the review has taken longer than anticipated to complete but it is important to point out that this has allowed more time for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and for the Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of CE which will improve the budgetary situation for schemes.  We must bear in mind that 700 F&Aacute;S staff joined the Department, along with the 23,000 people on the schemes.  This has been a major change under the Croke Park model.</P>
        <P>I am happy to tell the House that the review is now complete and schemes will receive notification of their revised allocations by the end of this week from their local departmental offices.</P>
        <P>Under the revised arrangements to be notified to sponsors, schemes will no longer be given universal amounts of financial support but instead will be provided with a specific level of support aimed at meeting the particular costs necessarily incurred by them, having regard to the overall level of funding available for community employment nationally.</P>
        <P>As Senators will appreciate, the review is of interest and importance to the many stakeholders involved.  Accordingly, I will ensure stakeholders will be able to respond to the findings.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that a separate labour market activation schemes policy review is under way because my Department is spending almost &euro;1 billion on various forms of activation and employment support.  This review, which is nearing completion, will also help to inform the Department&rsquo;s strategic approach to the schemes, including the community employment programme.</P>
        <P>I assure Senators that the Department is committed to supporting the community employment programme and the valuable contribution it is making to the provision of services to individuals and communities.  I anticipate that the employment managers involved in the schemes from the Department will contact schemes from tomorrow in regard to allocations in respect of materials and training.  This will be very much influenced by the submissions made by scheme organisers.  I am putting into place an appeals mechanism for scheme organisers who are unhappy with what they have received.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  It is really good news that the review is concluded and that schemes will be notified as and from tomorrow.  This is very important for many schemes because, although many accepted there had to be modifications and changes and that there were budgetary limitations, the lack of clarity was crippling their ability to proceed with any vigour.  The development is very important.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister, in her wisdom and as part of the review process, has embedded in the system an appeals process.   When there is a change of structure and system and a new template, it is important that the sponsors and supervisors be given a chance, where necessary and appropriate, to make their case and appeal if they believe certain circumstances have not been taken into account.  I welcome this.  Could the Minister elaborate a little on the appeals process and how it will work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated, some additional funding is being made available in regard to materials and training.  Its allocation will depend on the applications made by schemes.  This will be communicated by regional managers.  Some schemes submitted applications referencing figures below &euro;500 and other schemes submitted applications referencing figures above &euro;1,000.  They can apply to the regional manager initially and if they are still unhappy with the outcome, they can apply to the assistant secretary in charge of the schemes overall.  Clearly, they will have to justify any application they make and show they have made savings.</P>
        <P>One of the interesting points to emerge from the review is that many schemes were incurring heavy administration costs because there are so many companies, particularly in respect of insurance and auditing.  We have changed the arrangements to make it possible to make savings.  As I stated, some schemes have already entered legal commitments, and in some cases schemes are committed to quite expensive rents.  We will be asking schemes to seek to re-negotiate with landlords.  Savings may not be possible for some this year but it may be possible to enter the negotiation process now.</P>
        <P>I hope we will have good outcomes.  We are involved in discussions with the prototype SOLAS on the provision of training.  With certain types of programmes, particularly ring-fenced ones such as those pertaining to drugs and child care, the training, education and qualifications offered are very important.  We hope to improve the qualification people can obtain from such schemes.  I have had an opportunity over the past few months to visit schemes around the country and meet groups of supervisors and directors of scheme sponsorship companies.  I have enjoyed this very much and I was very impressed by the work taking place.  We have retained all the places and supervisors.  Under the current structure, there are schemes that last for one year, two years and three years.  For certain categories of individual, it may be possible to extend the given period.  In this regard, the position remains as it was.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, for attending this evening.  I will be brief because I am last, but not least.  I am acutely aware of how busy the Minister is.  I commend the Government on the JobBridge scheme and how well it is working.  The six-month placement, which I have used in my company, works very well.  Some employers in the private sector may have taken advantage of the JobBridge scheme.  I would not like to see young interns used for an extra three months as a cheap form of employment.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the opportunity I believe lies in the public sector.  The internship scheme is wonderful for young people who might have been sitting at home unemployed and who are desperate to get their foot onto the first rung of the ladder.  There is a great opportunity to enter internships.  Some Departments are seeking extensions for their interns.  This may be where a project has become bigger than envisaged or where an intern is doing so well that there is an opportunity to give him or her further work and keep him or her on for nine months, thus resulting in a superb experience for the intern.  I ask the Minister to examine how JobBridge is working in the public sector and whether considerable flexibility can be allowed such that a young intern can get an extension of three months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The national internship scheme, JobBridge, was launched on 1 July 2011.  Therefore, we are approaching the first anniversary.  In practice, as Senator O&rsquo;Brien is probably aware, the first internships took place in September of last year.  The scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community and voluntary sectors.  I thank the significant number of firms, particularly in the private sector, that offered to host interns.  There has been much criticism of the scheme but, by and large, the feedback from participants has been extremely positive.  Those who have monitored the scheme extensively on social media have in many ways done a public service because I do not believe they appreciated initially that the scheme is not just for graduates.  When people use the phrase &ldquo;intern&rdquo;, they often believe it pertains only to graduates.  I was always very interested in having no age limit, other than that one must be over 18, and no qualification limit such that different people at different levels would be able to obtain experience.  More than 15,000 employers of various kinds have offered to host interns.  This indicates the pent-up interest among employers to give people an opportunity.  The feedback has been positive.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides internship opportunities of either six or nine months for unemployed individuals at all skill levels.  It aims to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience by providing them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.</P>
        <P>To date, the scheme has made significant progress.  Slightly more than 8,000 internship placements have commenced since the launch of JobBridge in July 2011.  Our target was to have 5,000 placements commenced within one year.  While the scheme has its critics, it has clearly been popular.  There are currently 4,896 interns undertaking internship placements and in excess of 2,000 internship posts are currently advertised on the JobBridge website at <i>www.jobbridge.ie.   </i>These figures show the strong level of interest in the scheme, both from a host organisation perspective and the perspective of prospective interns.</P>
        <P Just="Left">JobBridge is the first initiative to be rolled out under the new national employment and entitlements service, NEES, which is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  In assisting individuals to bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work JobBridge provides those seeking employment with the opportunity to undertake a six or nine-month internship in a host organisation.  It aims to offer individuals of all skill levels, ranging from those who left school early to highly qualified graduates, a unique opportunity to develop new skills to complement their existing skills and to earn valuable experience.  I have met graduates, postgraduates and even a number of individuals with post-doctorate qualifications who are participating in the programme.  On completing their internship, participants will have much improved their prospects of securing employment.  In the current labour market environment JobBridge provides individuals with a unique opportunity to secure work experience in a new field and enables people to break the cycle.  For instance, an internship may provide unemployed workers with skills acquired in construction, a sector which has lost many jobs, with an opportunity to try a new field.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the national employment and entitlements service, under the management of the Department of Social Protection, is a crucial element of our improved targeting of resources for work placement, training and education for the unemployed.  I am confident the service will provide the framework within which the reinvigorated national employment action plan will deliver activation policies and priorities.</P>
        <P>The current guidelines governing JobBridge provide that a participant may avail of a placement on an internship work experience opportunity for a period of six months &mdash; 26 weeks &mdash; or nine months &mdash; 39 weeks.  It is a matter for the host organisation to advertise the proposed duration of the placement, which is completely at its discretion.  I understand the majority of host organisations offer the longer period of nine months or 39 weeks.  Many employers have told me they would like the internships to be longer than nine months.  In this context, it is important to note that an internship opportunity is intended to act as a probationary period to establish if the intern is suitable to take up a permanent role with the host organisation.  It is not intended to act as a probationary period to determine if the intern is suitable to undertake a further period of internship with the same company.  For this reason, host organisations need to make a decision on the duration of the internship before it commences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overall, it is important to note that individuals may avail of a maximum of two JobBridge internships.  However, the total cumulative time may not exceed nine months or 39 weeks over the two-year period.  Employers who retain JobBridge interns in paid employment, of whom there are a significant number, receive an 18-month holiday in respect of employer PRSI.  This benefit appears to be little known among employers and I am anxious to ensure they become aware of the significant saving that can be made from taking on a person on a paid basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme.  We have appointed external consultants to carry out an independent evaluation of the scheme.  I am anxious that all labour market activation schemes are subject to real-time evaluation.  In the past, much of the evaluation of schemes occurred several years after people have completed the relevant programme.  The external evaluation of JobBridge has already commenced.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am extremely happy and congratulate the Minister on her professionalism and aggressive, business-like approach in having the evaluation done immediately.  I agree with everything she said about the private sector.  The JobBridge scheme is wide open to abuse.  As an employer, I am ashamed to admit I was not aware of the PRSI holiday available to employers who permanently employ someone who completes a JobBridge internship.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will have to advertise that information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start shouting about it tomorrow.  We are all aware of the problems in the public service arising from the moratorium on recruitment.  I have encountered cases of public service organisations taking on JobBridge interns for six months, only to find that they had sufficient work to continue the internship for a further three months.  This is a wonderful experience for the intern.  The Department will probably tweak the scheme after the first year.  I ask the Minister not to change the position regarding the private sector but to give the public service greater flexibility in this regard.  I sit on the audit committee of Kildare County Council.  Given the evolution and changes under way in local and national government, it is important to reform and take different approaches.  It is in that spirit that I ask the Minister to provide for a little more flexibility in the scheme.  One does not always know in advance if one has nine months&rsquo; work for a person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Brien for her comments.  I will specifically ask for the point she raises to be addressed in the evaluation.  As she noted, the embargo makes it difficult in the context of public sector placements for interns to immediately secure employment in a public organisation.  Nevertheless, there is a certain placement rate because opportunities also arise in the public sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the end of May we secured an additional 1,000 places on the scheme, which will increase the number of placements to 6,000.  The purpose of the increase is to make provision for potential applications from lone parents and people with a disability.  Some people may not be interested in the community and voluntary sector, which is where activation schemes have tended to be available for lone parents and people with a disability.  However, many lone parents who became aware of opportunities in small and medium-sized businesses contacted me to express an interest in pitching for such opportunities.  For this reason, we opened up the scheme at the end of last month.  We will find out over the summer if this decision has resulted in lone parents and people with disabilities benefiting from many of the interesting opportunities to emerge in the small and medium-sized business sector.  I expect a significant number of entrepreneurs to emerge from this process as people avail of opportunities to work with others in the development phase of a business.  There is nothing to compare with acquiring experience in the business environment and using it later in one&rsquo;s own business, if one is so inclined.</P>
