	<P>I have notice from Senator Thomas Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to change his policy on ministerial school visits in order that he visits schools around the country, which should be an essential part of his duties.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have notice from Senator Martin Conway of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to reverse the changes he has made to the career guidance counselling services in schools, particularly in small rural schools with fewer than 500 pupils.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to clarify the position on MFG Teoranta and when a new Leader funding administrator will be appointed for Gaeltacht areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have notice from Senator Mark Daly of the following matter:</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to make a statement on the viability of paying rent allowance directly to landlords instead of to tenants.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have notice from Senator Colm Burke of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to outline the amending legislation he proposes to put in place to deal with the issue of properties that are not registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to ask about the treaty on stability, co-ordination and governance in the EMU to which the Government has signed up.  Some 25 of the 27 member states have signed up to it.  Will the Leader afford time early next week for a debate on the treaty in this Chamber?  A sufficient amount of time should be allocated to do so. Will the Government commit to undertaking a public information campaign on what it has signed up to, even pending receipt of advice from the Attorney General?  We understand the Taoiseach has said the treaty has formally been sent to the Attorney General for her advice, but I am certain that she and her office have been involved in giving advice up to now.  It appears the Government does not want to hold a referendum.  My position and that of my party is that we should bring the people along with these significant EU changes.  We are and always have been a pro-Europe party and I do not envisage that changing but, at the very least, the people should be aware of what the Government has signed up to on their behalf.  Will the Government consider holding a referendum on the matter, regardless of the Attorney General's advice?  The draft treaty places strict fiscal controls on Ireland and it is only right and proper that citizens get an opportunity to know what the treaty contains and to have a say on it.  Fianna F&aacute;il will seek legal advice on the matter.  It would be appropriate to seek an early debate on the treaty.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">My party has circulated a motion, to be considered for cross-party support, calling on the Government to extend an official invitation to Pope Benedict XVI to visit Ireland in an official capacity this year.  I ask that all Senators take the time to consider our motion and hope that the House will agree to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today and tomorrow, the D&aacute;il will debate changes in respect of small, rural and minority faith schools.  Many Members on the Government side are most uncomfortable with these changes.  At the very least, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, should review this matter as he did in respect of DEIS schools.  Months ago, I was one of the first to mention the fact that 25% of the schools to be affected were minority faith schools.  I have attended three meetings held by Church of Ireland schools that will lose teachers and permanent learning supports.  Since it is not the Government&rsquo;s intention to discriminate against minorities in the Republic, it should reverse a decision that will have an astonishingly negative impact on small Gaeltacht, minority faith and rural schools.</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P Just="Left">Next week, my party will use Private Members&rsquo; time to address this matter, but Members on the Leader&rsquo;s side of the House have asked that time be afforded to the Minister, who will attend the Chamber this afternoon to address legislation, to discuss this important issue in a non-partisan manner.  Many Government Members view the decision as a mistake.  That is fine, but a problem should not be exacerbated by continuing with a failed policy that discriminates against rural communities and minority faith schools. Will the Leader allow time for a proper debate on this matter next week?  Given that it was not the Government's intention to discriminate, now is the time to change its decision.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, I welcome the fact that we now have a text for the intergovernmental treaty, the so-called fiscal compact.  I agree that we should have a public information campaign on the treaty and look forward to debating it in the House.  We need to reserve our position on a referendum until we hear what the Attorney General has to say.  There is only one reason to hold a referendum, namely, to amend the Constitution.  If the Attorney General advises that the Constitution will not be affected, there is no requirement for a referendum.  Deputy Calleary accepted that as a point of principle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It would pre-empt the decision of the Attorney General.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on public procurement and professional fees.  In the context of the forthcoming debate on the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, I am interested in the issue of the State&rsquo;s role in setting professional fees and the distribution of professional work.  We must consider this issue in respect of other professionals as well as lawyers.  I am conscious that the Bill envisages the creation of multidisciplinary partnerships.  There is some concern that this might lead to the concentration of expertise in the hands of a few small firms, thereby indirectly creating monopolies.  This is a cause for concern.  For example, in the case of credit unions which are going into receivership &mdash; we had a high profile case in recent weeks &mdash; only a very few of the large accountancy firms seem to be getting that work from the State.  This is despite the fact that the expertise to deal with these matters may be elsewhere.  Moreover, there may be better value for money for the State in procuring accountancy services from smaller firms rather than always opting, by default, for one of the so-called big four.  We have also seen the State confining its business to a couple of large solicitors&rsquo; firms.  We must have an open debate on this issue, which is about consumer protection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I saw a newspaper report yesterday that a new Killarney-based GP practice is offering much lower consultation fees than those charged by its competitors.  This is a sign of the lowering of professional fees we would hope to see across the professions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>A doctor came home one day to find the archbishop of Paris in bed with his wife.  He took the archbishop&rsquo;s cassock&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The doctor put on the cassock, walked to the window and began blessing the people below in the square.  The archbishop told him to come away from the window, for he looked ridiculous.  The doctor replied that since the archbishop was performing his functions, he would perform the archbishop&rsquo;s.  I refer to this anecdote in the context of an issue of social protection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Social protection or moral protection.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Social protection.  There has been little improvement in the time taken to process medical card applications since the centralisation of that function took place.  We are told it should take 15 days to obtain a medical card if everything is in order.  However, I have been contacted by many people who have experienced delays.  Most recently, I heard of an application that was  submitted in October, with everything in order, and resubmitted on 29 November following a request for further information.  It was only after strong representations that this person&rsquo;s card was finally issued yesterday.</P>
        <P>We were assured last week that ten additional staff members would be appointed to the central processing facility to cope with the volume of work.  I am not blaming the Minister for Health for these delays; it is a question of staff shortages.  We must ensure the most vulnerable in society receive their medical cards without undue delay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We live in a very competitive world.  If we are to solve the serious problems facing the country, we will have to take action in those areas in which we are insufficiently competitive.  Figures published in recent days by the World Bank show this is the tenth best country in which to do business.  We may well feel proud of that, but the reality is that there are nine countries ahead of us.  There are several areas in which we can take action to improve our competitiveness.  For example, in this country it takes 13 days for start-up businesses to get up and running.  In Singapore, which tops the list, it can be done in three days.  When I visited Panama some years ago I was told that the objective was to make it possible to start a new business there in seven hours.  While it has not achieved that target, on the basis of the World Bank figures, that is the type of target we should be setting ourselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am impressed by the areas in which we have done quite well, including ease of paying taxes, resolving disputes and efficient regulation, the latter being rather unexpected.  We are also working hard in regard to construction permits.  On the other hand, we are only 62nd in terms of enforcing contracts, 81st in registering property and 90th when it comes to securing electricity supply to businesses.  These are areas in which we can easily effect improvements.  We must ensure that anyone who is considering opening a business will see Ireland as a place that is working hard to make itself an attractive prospect.  I welcome the great news that Sky is to open a new call centre in Dublin with the creation of 800 jobs.  This is a good example of what we can work towards.  In this regard, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, is working hard on ensuring we are the type of country that does not have in place regulations that serve no purpose.  Let us ensure we continue in that direction. In my experience as a Member of this House, State organisations do not appear to have the same understanding of the importance of time and speed as does the business world.</P><P Just="Left">Senators Bacik and O'Brien asked if there will be a need for a referendum on the fiscal compact.  Whether one is required the decision in that regard needs to be made as quickly as possible and we need to ensure we get it right.  I believe the objective in Europe is to create a Europe that is attractive to industry and for job creation.  Let us ensure we work towards that with the same enthusiasm as other countries.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse Senator D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s comments in regard to the delay in the processing of medical cards, which is now taking weeks and months.  The divergence between the official position and reality on the ground for people waiting for medical cards is unacceptable.  This issue must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I call on the Leader to arrange for a wide-ranging debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on our immigration policy which is long overdue.  It is a sensitive issue, one that provokes polarised opinion.  However, this should not deter us from tackling it.  Immigration without proper opportunity leads to isolation and ghettoisation of communities, which is not <Col N="5"/>healthy for anyone.  I am concerned about the farming out by the State and Department of Justice and Equality of the operation of asylum centres in which families and young children are incarcerated for years.  I would like to know who inspects or monitors the operation of these centres.  I have heard disturbing reports about the conditions in which more than 200 asylum seekers, many of them children, are currently being held.  I speak in this regard of the former Montague hotel near Portlaoise, where I am told there is no heating, food is being rationed and often food which is past its sell by day is being served, which is disturbing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator calling for a debate on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes. Such a debate is long overdue.  I note from the legislative programme that the Government intends to reintroduce a redrafted immigration residence and protection Bill.  It is long overdue.  This policy has huge implications for our housing and education policy, health services and the manner in which we treat people who come here seeking help.  I call on the Leader to facilitate a debate on this matter at an early stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call on the Leader to provide time for a debate on balanced regional development.  I do so in the context of figures published a number of weeks ago by IDA Ireland and printed in a number of today&rsquo;s national newspapers.  These figures, which are a breakdown of the number of IDA Ireland companies located in each county, the number of IDA Ireland supported jobs in each county and the amount of grant-aid paid to IDA Ireland supported companies in each county, have caused consternation in some counties.  The Border and south-eastern counties, which have suffered huge job losses, have been badly serviced by IDA Ireland.  If one examines the county-by-county figures, one will see that at the same time there has been a huge drop in the amount of funding available through grant aid to certain counties.  Some of the figures are amazing.  For example, Carlow went for two years without receiving any grant support.  For four of the past five years, not one single cent in grant aid was given to companies in Kilkenny.  In Waterford, the number of grants was halved and the amount in grant aid available was reduced as a result.  We must ensure the enterprise agencies are delivering for all the regions.  There is little point in having regional offices, developing regional policies and discussing regional development when the figures indicate that areas such as the south east and the Border counties are not receiving their fair share.  I ask the Leader to make time available for a debate on balanced regional development and to request the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come before the House to take part in it.  Let us ensure the enterprise agencies which are funded from taxpayers&rsquo; money will give all areas a fair crack of the whip.  The figures to which I refer clearly show that the south-east region and the Border counties have not received their fair share.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Taoiseach and his European colleagues for achieving agreement last night on a mechanism to deal with the euro crisis.  I call on the Attorney General to burn the midnight oil to bring certainty and clarity to the question of whether a referendum will be required.  Uncertainty is both unhelpful and destabilising.  I do not know why the Attorney General cannot provide her opinion as a matter of urgency.  I call on the Leader to impress on her the importance of this matter and ensure that whatever resources she requires will be made available to her in order that she might provide a considered opinion as soon as possible.  The last thing we need is for a debate to take place during the next four to six weeks on whether a referendum is required.  What is needed is a decision.  Once that decision has been made, we will be in a position to move on and either campaign in a referendum or ensure the compact will be implemented as quickly as possible.  What is required more than anything else is financial certainty as well as stability in order to ensure the economy can grow and that <Col N="6"/>the Government can proceed with the important task of creating employment to bring to an end mass unemployment and the emigration being experienced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call made by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, the Leader of the Opposition, for an early debate &mdash; certainly next week &mdash; on the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.  It is vital that such a debate take place, particularly in this House which has control of the issues that can be discussed here.  The Government is going to be reluctant to hold a referendum on the treaty.  When in government, my party was obliged to deal with many referendums.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il Government which brought about Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union, then known as the European Economic Community, EEC, via a referendum.  We also proudly supported the referendum on the Maastrict treaty and the two referendums on the Lisbon treaty.  We were obliged to fight referendum campaigns on these matters because we wanted to consult the people who wish to be consulted on matters of this nature.</P>
        <P>I predict that the Attorney General will recommend that a referendum should not be held and will instead suggest the introduction of a Bill to facilitate implementation of the new treaty.  According to what I have heard from certain Ministers, the Office of the Attorney General provided step-by-step advice on the wording contained in the treaty, the preamble to which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  In the preamble the term &ldquo;permanent provisions, preferably constitutional&rdquo; is used, but the treaty does not promote these as such.  That is an enormous change.  Two countries, namely, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom, have opted out of the treaty, in which there is no provision that the European Parliament should, even on the basis of courtesy, be consulted.  It merely states, &ldquo;The President of the Euro Summit shall present a report to the European Parliament after each of the meetings of the Euro Summit&rdquo;. Will the Leader make time available for an early debate on the matter?  The final text of the treaty contains a number of considerable changes from what was proposed in earlier drafts.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">There is nothing in the treaty about the Government&rsquo;s proposals to burn the bondholders or about the Labour Party&rsquo;s way rather than Frankfurt&rsquo;s way.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, stated that he would not pay one cent more to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A question, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will run from the referendum.  It is terrified of the Irish electorate after being in government for 12 months.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Senator can have a debate another day.  He must ask a question now.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Senator has a most unusual way of getting to a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am making a point.  We discussed this with the T&aacute;naiste last Thursday week and we are familiar with what is in the draft proposals.  The Government will have a tough fight on its hands.  When Fianna F&aacute;il makes its decision on the treaty debate it will be in the best interests of the people.  A referendum should be held.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>When will this Chamber have a debate on rural schools?  I have requested it for the past two weeks.  This evening and tomorrow the D&aacute;il will have a comprehensive debate on a motion and on a Government amendment to a Private Members&rsquo; motion on small primary schools.  We are trying to be relevant to the lives of Irish people so let us debate it here in a reasoned way with the Minister.  Small schools are under threat as are Gaelscoileanna and rural DEIS schools.  We need to debate the impact of Government policy on our children&rsquo;s education and on our communities.  It is more than likely the Minister will be here this afternoon to speak on the Education (Amendment) Bill but this will not allow for the debate that is needed.  I am concerned because I have called for this debate for two weeks.  I tabled two Adjournment matters last week but neither was taken.  This is not right.  Tomorrow evening a large protest will take place outside Leinster House.  We are a responsible Government so let us act responsibly on this important issue.  I look forward to hearing the Leader&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish the Leader to clarify something.  He mentioned that the debate on Committee Stage of the Education (Amendment) Bill will conclude not later than 6.30 p.m.  I hope we will have concluded it by then but if not I hope it is not the intention of the Government to use the guillotine.  I take it that what the Leader meant is that we will see what happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>

	<P>I thank the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume it will be well over by then, unless people pontificate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not jumping to conclusions but nonetheless it may prove to be a very interesting debate and quite a few amendments have been tabled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with my colleague, Senator Quinn, with regard to holding a referendum.  Regarding this decision, &ldquo;If it were done when &lsquo;tis done, then &lsquo;twere well/It were done quickly.&rdquo;  There is a need for speed because the longer this goes on the greater will be the perception that somehow politics is being played with this issue and that the Government is wondering whether it can secure the necessary support to pass it.</P>
        <P>There must be a presumption in favour of consulting the people.  I do not like to see reports of sources stating there is some confidence in Dublin that the pact may not necessitate a vote.  It should not be a matter for exciting confidence or optimism that people feel we will not need a referendum on this.  We should never devalue the idea of consulting the people in a referendum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a difference between &ldquo;the State may ratify&rdquo; and &ldquo;the State must ratify&rdquo;.  We can contemplate a referendum being required by the terms agreed by the leaders of the various member states, which would require it to be written in stone to such a degree that the Constitution would need to mandate the Government to ratify the treaty and not deviate from it in future.  I am not very comfortable with this idea, but it is something of a lesser order that the Government would nonetheless see fit to consult the people to ask whether it may ratify the treaty.  There is always something very healthy about this.  I am not saying we should have referenda just for the sake of holding them but these are serious issues.  We are about to make a very big decision that will impact on our ability to structure our budgets and manage our financial affairs into the future.  For that reason I hope for a speedy decision and for a presumption in favour of having a referendum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s proposal that if a decision is taken and we must await the decision of the Attorney General about a referendum, the indications are that it is not something that can be decided overnight.  It is a complex legal issue on which the Attorney General must give definite advice to the Government but if the Attorney General decides there is not a need for a referendum, I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s proposal that information should be made available to the public and a comprehensive campaign begun to get out that information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An aspect we have forgotten is the contribution the European Union has made to this country, for example, in the area of agriculture.  It is interesting that there are a number of letters in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> this week criticising various aspects of it but not taking into account the amount of money this country received under the agriculture budget and the infrastructure put into this country as a result of that contribution.  We seem to have forgotten that and it is about time we appreciated the benefits we get from the European Union.  When we joined the European Economic Community in 1973 1 million people were in employment.  I accept that more than 400,000 people are seeking employment here now but we have increased the number of people working to 1.8 million.  Europe is our marketplace.  That is where we must grow in terms of the product range we have available for export.  It is important that we also sell the positive message Europe is helping to create for this country and I would support such a campaign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the treaty published yesterday.  Unlike the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, I believe we should have a referendum.  To quote him directly, he is not a fan of referendums and does not believe they are democratic.  I have great time for the Minister but he might have to go back to political science class to learn that referendums are very democratic.  In that regard he is in conflict with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who said it is good for the people to be involved.  If the people are to be involved a referendum should be held.  We are aware that the Attorney General&rsquo;s office would have advised the Taoiseach and the negotiating team on all the drafts of the treaty in terms of trying to get wording removed to ensure there would not be a referendum.  Far be it from me to educate anyone in this House on the provisions of the Constitution but the Constitution can be amended even if a Bill is not in conflict with it.  This House has the power to petition the President that any Bill which contains a proposal of national importance be put before the people to get their assent.  The Government Senators, and Deputies, would agree that this measure is of national importance and if they believe that, the will of the people should be sought to determine whether they are in favour of it.  The fact that the Government is running away from it, as the statement from the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, clearly shows, is a bad sign for democracy here because if the people cannot be convinced by the Government that this is in Ireland&rsquo;s best interests, then it is not in Ireland&rsquo;s best interests.  It is up to the Government to convince the people by weight of fact and not by the scare-mongering displayed on the six o&rsquo;clock news yesterday to the effect that we will be kicked out of the eurozone.  We know that is a lie.  There is no provision for that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I welcome the news today that 800 jobs are to be created by Sky in this constituency.  It has been rare in recent years to hear of the creation of such a large number of jobs in one day.  As well as expressing concern about job losses, we need to also <Col N="9"/>acknowledge when there is an announcement of jobs to be created.  This is a positive development.  I congratulate Enterprise Ireland on bringing these jobs to Ireland.  Sky announced the creation of 1,200 jobs between the UK and Ireland.  It is a testament to the work of Enterprise Ireland and to how the country is doing that despite the difficulties we are experiencing, two thirds of those jobs are being created in Dublin.</P>
        <P>The World Bank&rsquo;s global economy standing list today ranks Ireland as number ten of the countries in which it is friendly to do business.  The top ten countries are the only ones released in the headlines and we are ranked among the top ten.  That is something of which we should be proud and it is difficult to believe considering the difficulties we are experiencing.  The list refers to the fact that we were experiencing difficulties and are under an EU programme but we are still ranked among the top ten business-friendly countries in the world.  That is something we should acknowledge.</P>

	<P>I join the Senators, particularly those on this side of the House, who have called for a comprehensive debate on the wording of the new treaty when published.  The people of Ireland are seeking leadership from the national Parliament and a debate on this significant initiative would be an opportunity to provide such leadership.  I must disagree with a view that seems to be growing that an achievement was made yesterday in Europe when, from an Irish perspective, all that is being offered is further austerity and sanctions if we do not proceed down the road we are on with, as one commentator said, very little carrot but lots of stick.  The people of Ireland are getting to a point where they cannot take any more austerity without some hope for the future.  That hope lies in the negotiations that I understand from the media are going on between the Minister for Finance in particular and the Taoiseach who are attempting to extend the massive bill that has been left as the legacy of Anglo Irish Bank whereby the promissory notes could be extended like a mortgage for the next 30 or 40 years which would lessen their economic impact.  Ultimately this is about our getting our deficit right.  It is important to put on the record that when it became apparent in 2008 that our deficit was widening, it was the then Government, led by the then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, who initiated the various severe budgets which have been inherited but are being followed by this Government because it had no choice.  We must get our deficit down to the agreed level, otherwise, as a country, we will not be able to survive, pay our civil servants and retain our services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new treaty will impose further harsh measures on this country without any attempt to concede we are the best person in the class.  We are not getting any credit for that other than newspaper headlines across Europe stating what a wonderful country we are to be battling against it.  We seem to be treated differently when it comes to giving the concessions that we need.  Unless we can get rid of the stranglehold of bank debt, we can continue along the austerity line and continue to reduce our deficit but we will still have it hanging over us, and that must be addressed by Europe.  Europe wants our people to support the Government and to support Europe.  I would question those who would argue that we do not support Europe when we do support it.  I am as pro-European as anybody, but we must stand up for our rights.  How long more are we going to be beaten down?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader of the House to invite the Minister for Health to come to the House to make a statement on the current status of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction.  That body was commissioned in 2005 and its members comprised eminent people under the chairpersonship of Professor Dervilla Donnelly.  The report of the commission contained 35 recommendations and it was presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health in 2005 or 2006.  Since that, however, I have heard nothing about it.  It is not satisfactory that there is no statutory regulation governing an activity that is happening in this country.  There should be legislation.  The Minister at the time did say there was no statutory regulation <Col N="10"/>in the area of assisted reproduction and that this was not satisfactory.  In advance of the Government framing such a regulation, which it will refer to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I ask that the Minister come to the House to make a statement on assisted human reproduction, because the self-regulation system in place, under the Irish Medical Organisation, is not satisfactory.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is removing self-regulation from solicitors, barristers and so on.  The same should be done in the area of assisted reproduction.  I request that the Minister be asked to come to the House to make a statement on this issue.</P>

	<P Just="Left">One does not have to be prophetic to conclude from recent events that the EU is at a crossroads, and by extension Ireland is at a crossroads as well.  There will be a temptation, in the interests of political expediency, to engage in posturing rather than to act at this time.  It would be wrong and disingenuous, however, of any Member of the Oireachtas to play on the fears and suffering of the people.  There is a particular time in the history of every nation when we should all act for the common good.  We should be prepared to set party political interests to one side.  We do that in wartime and in times of emergency.  The precipice may be a distance away at present, but we need to stop and reflect.  I hope there will be no political points-scoring at this time.  I recall, when sitting on the other side of the House, that I praised Alan Dukes for the Tallaght strategy, which I thought was very patriotic.  Now, sitting on this side of the House, I would adopt exactly the same role.  It would be in the interests of this nation if we all decided to work towards a consensus on the treaty and what is before us.  I do not think history will be kind to us, and I do not think the people who are suffering on the ground will be grateful, if we do not at this stage realise the seriousness of what is facing us.</P>
        <P>I make an appeal, having been in this House for the best part of 14 years, that we all step back, as public representatives and engage in an honest, sincere and practical way on this matter.  We can disagree on many other things, but we have an opportunity, if we stand together in a cohesive manner, to send a strong message to the people that we will give them honest, sincere and effective leadership and, at the same time, send a message abroad that we are united as a people and we will not be easily picked off by the big powers in Europe.  I have no doubt that if we fragment politically on this issue, we will face a serious situation.  I appeal to everyone on this issue.  Let us try to work in a positive and cohesive manner for the good of all people on this island.  I hope we will not be judged for having played politics with the lives of the people at this time.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I have heard some of my colleagues talk about the possibility or otherwise of a referendum.  Since 1973, when Ireland first entered what was then the EEC, there has been a straightforward approach whereby the Attorney General of the day examines each treaty dealing with Irish participation in the European Union.  If the treaty requires constitutional change, a constitutional amendment is put to the people in a referendum.  If it does not, there is no referendum.  Let us wait and see what the Attorney General, an independent officeholder, decides and then we can respond.  I am rather surprised that anybody would doubt the fact that the Attorney General is independent of the Government and will make the proper legal adjudication.  Let us wait until then.</P>

	<P>As has often been stated in this House, we have a significant role to play in debating the broader issues of our involvement with the European Union, European policy making and initiatives Europe can take to assist us with job creation and putting our country back to work.  It is not all about yesterday&rsquo;s treaty or a once-off meeting.  The entire European concept is ongoing and moving and we must play our part in that.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I remind my colleagues that this Tuesday last year the then Taoiseach, former Deputy Brian Cowen, asked the President to dissolve the D&aacute;il.  At that stage the country was not only broken economically but morale was at an all-time low.  There were huge doubts about our reputation here and abroad.  Difficult decisions have been taken in the intervening 12 months and every man, woman and child has suffered financially as a result of those decisions.  However, our country is changing and things have become a little more positive.  There is hope.  We have travelled a slow, steady but important journey in the 12 months since the dissolution of the D&aacute;il this time last year.  Let us hope progress can continue.  Ultimately, the prime target is to get our people back to work.  The European treaty, the European Union and all of us have a part to play in that regard.</P>

	<P>I join other Members in seeking a debate on the motion.  We will use our Private Members&rsquo; time next week to discuss the rural schools, which is an important issue.  Notwithstanding that these are difficult times and cuts are necessary, this cut is not necessary.  The cost to society generally and to rural Ireland far outweighs any benefit in the context of savings in the Department of Education and Skills.  For that reason the teachers of Ireland who are due to descend on D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this evening and tomorrow should be supported.  I know many Government Deputies and Senators share my view and I hope commonsense can be brought to bear and these unnecessary cuts can be reversed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fiscal treaty has been mentioned by many Members.  I seek an early debate on this issue.  It is imperative that a referendum is held on the treaty.  That is not to denote any opposition to the treaty or to make a political issue of it.  However, the failing of the political system here over the years, not least under the last Administration and certainly under this one, when one sees the understandable public anger, is the lack of public ownership of the public policy platform.  That is a critical issue which must be addressed and far be it from the Houses of the Oireachtas to be in fear of what the people might say or think about a particular point of view, irrespective of whether the Attorney General takes a view that it is possible to do this constitutionally.  It is imperative that our system and approach since 1973 modernises and <Col N="12"/>changes to consult the people a lot more often.  If the people have more of an input as to the legislation being dealt with in terms of Bills and issues, then they will have more ownership of public policy and, as a result, can have more confidence in the political system.  For that reason alone, the Government should show absolute leadership, and irrespective of the constitutional position and the necessity or otherwise of the fiscal treaty, it should hold a referendum.  We should show political leadership and show confidence in our people and consult them on this very important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in complimenting the Taoiseach and other European leaders on the progress they made in concluding the fiscal treaty document last night.  I would like to see a decision reached at an early stage as to whether a referendum is necessary.  While I do not think anyone has anything to fear from holding a referendum, I would disagree with Senator MacSharry in his argument.  If the Attorney General concludes a referendum is not necessary, it would be a great waste of time and money and possibly cause divisiveness to have a campaign that was deemed to be unnecessary.  We will await the decision of the Attorney General.  Everyone wants to see the Government get on with the urgent business of creating employment and getting our finances back on track and the country back into a more desirable state.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn spoke about the importance of time, speed and efficiency.  Will the Leader organise it in order that on the next occasion the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is in the House to discuss transport issues, we would also have the opportunity to discuss the operation of the Galway-Limerick section of the western rail corridor which was the subject of a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and which showed it in a rather bad light.  I support the call made recently by the West on Track committee for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, to open this section of track to a possible private operator, such as the RPA which made a stunning success of the Luas operation, and to invite other operators to tender for the running of this section.  It is very obvious that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has no particular interest in it.  Right from the start it has undermined it, failed to market it and priced it incorrectly.  The company is ensuring that rolling stock is taking two hours to travel from Galway to Limerick when less than one hour should be sufficient.  I call for a debate on this section of the western rail corridor.  The money has been spent to put it in place and we must ensure we get value for money and that the people who wish to use the service are getting a fast, efficient and user-friendly service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a matter which I have raised on previous occasions.  The cost of diesel fuel is at its highest ever level, as far as I can recall.  It seems to be increasing daily and this may be influenced by what is happening in foreign fields.  Fuel laundering and diesel fuel laundering in particular is now big illegal business.  It is no longer just a Border counties issue and is now in the west and south as well.  It is becoming more attractive now for car owners to purchase from the garage outlets selling laundered diesel, irrespective of the damage and the damage being done to vehicles.  More important is the loss of revenue to the economy as illegal laundered diesel accounts for 10% to 12% of the current total fuel market.  I suggest that one diesel fuel should be available for everyone with a rebate system available to the farmer or those with vehicles which are not used on the public roadway.  There may be difficulties of which I am unaware in having such a system but it is timely to have a debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>I will give an instance.  In my own county of Louth it costs the State &euro;1 million to clear up the sludge left behind, transport it via Dublin to be incinerated in Germany.  In the Border counties, it cost &euro;3 million last year.  Concrete action must be taken.  I urge the Leader to <Col N="13"/>arrange a debate and I ask for an explanation as to the reason one diesel fuel cannot be accessible to all.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There have been a number of requests for debates and I will endeavour to facilitate them, where possible.  However, I express my disappointment at the number of Members present in the Chamber for the debate last Thursday which was an excellent exchange with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  For the first 50 minutes of the debate only three Members were present on the other side of the House and only seven Members on the Government side.  The number rose from three to six during some part of the debate and from seven to nine, in the case of Members on this side of the House, for the remainder of the debate.  This is not acceptable.  Members repeatedly ask for debates and I cannot in good faith continue to go to Ministers to say there is great interest among Senators for debates on various areas of their portfolios only for those Ministers to attend the House and address a half empty or less than half empty Chamber.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is daily discussion in this House on the need to improve its image.  This is the responsibility of Members.  Senators who come to the Chamber for the Order of Business and then depart immediately do nothing to improve the reputation and perception of this House.  I acknowledge that they must attend committee meetings, but such meetings should not be held during the Order of Business and Senators should not facilitate their commencement when the Order of Business is being dealt with.</P><P Just="Left">I ask all Members to make an effort to spend more time in the House and engage proactively with its business, which is what we are here to do.  I hope this will start from today and that more Members will be in the Chamber to address legislation and make statements.  When Ministers are invited to attend the House for debates which have been requested by Members on all sides, it is not acceptable that only a handful are present.  This is not a productive way to use our time.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister.  The amendment has to do with the precise responsibilities of the Minister for Education and Skills in supporting students who face particular issues and are disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>The amendment seeks to reverse the proposal to delete section 2(1)(<i>f</i>) of the 1998 Act.  Were this provision to stand, the deletion would have the effect of removing the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility for providing various student supports, speech therapy in particular.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 4 proposes to delineate the measures in paragraph (<i>n</i>) to exclude any responsibility on the Minister&rsquo;s part for health and personal social services within the meaning of the Health Act 2004.  This is at odds with the Minister&rsquo;s obligation under section 13 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 to provide resources for &ldquo;the preparation and implementation of education plans prepared in respect of children with special educational needs&rdquo; with the objective of ensuring these children have the same rights to an appropriate education as their peers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In its broadest and most important dimension, education is about supporting human beings during their most important phase of development.  One cannot separate what we traditionally understand as being contained within the notion of education, that is, academic instruction and the formation of ideas and values, from the notion of <i>cura personalis</i>.  Each individual faces a different set of life circumstances and challenges.  For this reason, our educational architecture places a duty on the Minister to ensure that, consistent with the means available to him, students facing particular circumstances are supported.  This touches on a range of issues, including speech therapy.</P>
        <P>The combined legislation provides for the interconnection of the roles of the Ministers for Education and Skills and Health, the HSE and the health authorities generally in the delivery of the services required by pupils.  I do not understand why the approach adopted in the legislation is to remove the problem, as it were, from the Minister for Education and Skills.  This is a stilted view of education.  We are moving from a situation where the Minister must see to it that students have everything they need to one where he or his successors must not become involved in the provision of the health and personal social services that are seen to be the responsibility of the Department of Health and the health service.  This is the opposite of joined-up thinking.  Responsibility needs to remain with both Ministers.  On this basis, I propose that we delete line 10 and forgo the proposed substitution of wording in paragraph (<i>n</i>).</P>

	<P>I support the amendments.  As I stated on Second Stage last week, I understand where the Minister is coming from, given that the HSE has often used the fact that the Minister for Education and Skills has responsibility as an excuse for not stepping up to the mark.  However, I have a concern.  There is a gap arising from the failure to assign, at the same time, a positive responsibility to the Minister for Health.  The National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, is very concerned in this regard.  I am willing <Col N="15"/>to support the change proposed by the Minister provided there is a positive corresponding responsibility assigned to the Minister for Health.  In the absence of such a balancing provision, I would share the concerns expressed by NABMSE that a lacuna may arise.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 3 and 4 in the names of Senators R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and Feargal Quinn.  The effect of the proposals would be to maintain the position that the details of support services under section 7 of the Education Act 1998 are defined in section 2 of the Act to include speech therapy services, despite the position that such services are provided by the Health Service Executive and that funding is made to that body for the provision of these services.  In addition, no service currently being provided by the Department will no longer be provided as a result of the revised legislation.  Rather, the provision in the Bill, as published, is necessary to clarify the position on the delivery of speech therapy services to students of schoolgoing age.</P>
        <P>In regard to Senator Averil Power&rsquo;s concerns, the legislative framework will be regularised in accordance with the <i>de facto</i> position, which is that the provision of speech therapy services is a matter for the HSE.  The proposed provisions will not impact on the availability, through the HSE, of speech therapy services for children with special educational needs.  The Department will continue to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs and to work with service-providing partners in the health and disability sectors through the interdepartmental cross-sectoral team.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  However, it is by no means clear what the effects of the proposed provision will be.  In his speech to the House on 25 January, the Minister did not clarify or give comfort as to what practical changes this would make for schools, both mainstream and special.  He has assured us today that no services will no longer be delivered as a result of this change.  However, this provision appears to present itself as restricting the Department of Education and Skills from providing support services which the HSE also provides.  If it is duplication the Minister is worried about, let us draft an amendment which prevents duplication.</P>
        <P>One of the problems with the provision is that it is not clear which services will come under it and how pupils and schools will be affected.  It seems to be at odds with section 13 of the <Col N="16"/>Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  If it is not amended, it will become a matter for the National Council for Special Education to make requests of the HSE under section 39(1) of the 2004 Act to assist with the implementation of particular individual education plans, IEPs, and the provision of services, namely, those which the Department will not provide, which are necessary for the implementation of the IEPs.</P>
        <P>The problem is that section 39(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act allows for the HSE to refuse such a request where it does not have the resources to meet it.  In other words, there is no positive obligation in any Act for the HSE to provide quasi-educational services to children.  Most of the absolute requirements on the HSE to act in certain cases are set out in the Child Care Act and relate to children at risk of abuse or neglect.  The HSE has difficulty discharging even its obligations under those sections.  Given the current shortage of resources, facilitating a request from the National Council for Special Education could be a serious difficulty for the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is the Department of Education and Skills abandoning this problem?  This will leave us with a situation where the HSE may or may not live up to its responsibilities and the Department of Education and Skills can in the future, on the basis of this legislation, shrug its shoulders and say it is not its problem.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I am informed that the legislative framework will be regularised in accordance with the <i>de facto</i> position, which is that the provision of speech therapy services is a matter for the HSE.  That is not to say that my Department is washing its hands of the issue, which I believe is the Senator&rsquo;s concern.  The regularisation will take place following consultations between the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.  The legislation reflects the operation on the ground.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Speech and language support therapy is and always has been provided by the Health Service Executive for schoolchildren who have been assessed as having communications difficulties.  This position is already acknowledged by the Oireachtas through the provision of voted moneys to the HSE to deliver such services.  As such, the Houses of the Oireachtas are familiar with this ongoing practice and have voted moneys for its delivery.  The proposed provisions will not impact on the availability through the HSE of speech therapy services for children with special educational needs.  There are no skilled professionals within the Department or the NCSE who would be in a position to provide these services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a <i>de facto</i> recognition in legislation of what has been the practice for some time.  The services will be provided through the HSE, as is the case.  It is not a question of the Department of Education and Skills washing its hands of the situation: it does not have the skilled personnel to deliver the service and it was never the intention that the Department would have those skills.  This is a service provided jointly by the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.  The legislative framework will be regularised in accordance with the <i>de facto</i> position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What harm is being done by the current situation?  It seems that, in terms of having a proper vision for education, the Department of Education and Skills should continue to have responsibility in this area, even if the service is <i>de facto</i> to be delivered by the HSE.  How, if through this legislation the Department&rsquo;s responsibility is being removed, is it to have clout in this matter and from where will come the Minister&rsquo;s calling card with the HSE and Minister for Health in the future?  What mischief is the Minister trying to address in making this change?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="17"/>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am addressing the situation where in previous legislation, prior to delivery of the service, there was an ambiguity in terms of responsibility and delivery.  Previous legislation provides for the Department with responsibility for a particular service to deliver, regardless of its ability, professionally or otherwise.  The Senator will be aware of the disputes that arose with particular educational facilities which had quasi-medical facilities built in but which were not being occupied because we had no power to compel the predecessor of the HSE to deliver the services.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The regulatory framework will be addressed.  The power which I, as Minister for Education and Skills, will have will be through Cabinet collective responsibility.  Moneys are voted by the Oireachtas to the HSE, which has, <i>inter alia</i>, a responsibility to deliver these services.  It was pointless us having partial responsibility and no capability.  That was the stuff of turf wars, in which there was an aspiration and no capacity.  That is the way this started out.  The reality now, against restrained and restricted resources, is that the public organisation to which moneys are voted by the Oireachtas, which has the technical and professional capability to deliver the services, should be empowered and required to do so.  I will ensure there is proper communications between the Departments of Health and Education and Skills to make this happen, thus ensuring no confusion in the legislation.  This is clarification of existing legislation.</P>

	<P>It was stated in this House a couple of weeks ago that a person with two watches will never know the correct time.  The Minister is, through enactment of this legislation, clarifying for schools that the HSE provides these services.</P>
        <P>I cannot support the amendment and must side with the Minister.  As someone who has worked as a teacher for the past 35 years, I know how the system works in practice.  I support the Minister on this issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Department have a say in how the service should be delivered, for example, as regards whether it would be better if it were school or cluster based?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not be so brave as to state anyone has the power to say anything to the HSE.  In reality, however, we can express what our preference would be.  Even the Minister for Health encounters difficulty on occasion in obtaining responses from the HSE.  The legislation recognises the reality in straitened times.  We have the power of persuasion and the NCSE, the agency responsible for dealing with people with special educational needs, will do everything possible within its remit.  The Senator is a professional in this area and will be aware that sometimes there is a combination of special educational needs in a particular instance.  Where that combination includes a difficulty in communicating through language, the power we have &mdash; we never had the budget to allow us to do so &mdash; is to make a compelling case to the NCSE which is an autonomous body and can then put that case to the HSE.  Beyond this, we do not have the power to compel or prescribe.  That would be for the professionals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  As I agree with the Government on this matter, I cannot support the amendment.  As a teacher, I am of the opinion that the two must be kept separate.  The key is that a link is provided through resource teachers.  It is good that <Col N="18"/>this is the case because when it is recognised that a child requires assistance in communicating, speech therapy or other services can be provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s absolute certainty with regard to what the Bill does and does not do.  I take his point about the HSE not responding to anyone in the past in a reliable way.  However, should I take from what he said that the legislation will not improve the position for anyone?  If, for example, a psychologist makes a recommendation to the effect that a child needs speech therapy which is education based, the HSE could state that, in the context of resources, it is not possible to provide such a service.  That would bring us back to square one.  What would improve for the child involved?  I accept that the NCSE, an autonomous body, will be involved and that it is linked with the Department of Education and Skills.  However, I am still trying to identify how what is proposed represents an improvement for children who require services.  Will the Minister outline the nature of that improvement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>From her professional knowledge of the educational sphere which surpasses that of most Members, the Senator will be aware that the Department never had available to it the skills necessary to deliver the services in question in the first instance.  The aspiration set out in previous legislation was not matched by delivery on the ground.  We could not deliver to meet the gap in respect of possible or explicit responsibility because, from a legislative point of view, we did not have the power to compel people who possessed skills which were not part of the skill set of the Department.  Those of us in the Department are not speech therapists.  What we are doing is providing clarity and avoiding an ambiguity that would invite turf wars.  If there is a failure on the part of the HSE to deliver speech therapy services, both Houses of the Oireachtas and I will be obliged to place the focus of attention at Cabinet level on the Minister for Health because the services to be provided by means of the moneys voted to his Department and, through it, the HSE must be delivered.  What we are doing is tidying up legislation which does not match facts on the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I accept what the Minister has said.  Would it not have been desirable, for the sake of the children and the service they need to improve their learning or social skills, for the legislation to introduce a measure whereby it would be possible for the Minister to compel the Department of Health to deliver the service?  I ask this because two weeks ago the Minister for Health spoke at a conference in Galway and  stated that he had ensured joined-up thinking for the first time on autism, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills, by having one principal officer common to the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.  Would it have been possible for the Minister to have arranged joined-up thinking with the Minister for Health on this issue so the HSE could have been compelled to deliver the service required by children when they need it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator knows from her time in the House that no Minister has the power to compel any Government agency to do anything if the Department in question does not provide funding in the first instance.  We do not give money to the HSE and accordingly we do not have power.  We can make requests and seek co-operation, but to compel we need to write the cheques and we do not do so for this agency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will not take up too much time because we have already had this debate.  Although it seems to be very stark and the reverse of joined-up thinking I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides in this matter and I  believe in the need for good administration.  However, it looks too much like the Department of Education and Skills washing its hands of responsibility.  Sometimes one must keep a hand in, even when one does not have power, so one can have one&rsquo;s nagging rights.  I completely understand and respect the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to using his nagging rights at the Cabinet table.  I have listened very carefully to him and I know he is a thoughtful man.  However, there is something deficient in this approach.</P>
        <P>Section 5 states, &ldquo;Section 7 of the Act of 1998 is amended by repealing subsections (5) and (6) (inserted by section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004).&rdquo;  Section 40(5) of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act states, &ldquo;In carrying out his or her functions in respect of the provision, planning and co-ordination of support services, the Minister may, following consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, request the assistance of a relevant health board&rdquo; and section 40(6) of that Act states, &ldquo;A health board of which a request under subsection (5) is made shall comply with the request&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This is power of some type for the Department of Education and Skills, and this power &mdash; or responsibility more to the point &mdash; is being lost.  The Minister previously referred to the effect of this section as being a technical amendment.  I do not consider it technical.  The Minister will no longer have the function of requesting the assistance of the relevant health board in respect of planning, provision and co-ordination of social services.  The bottom line will be that nobody will be compelled to offer the vital support services should the HSE decline to do so.  I cannot see how this is good news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is a follow-up to the debate we had earlier.  It must be understood that the section we propose to amend predates the establishment of the HSE.  The thrust of my argument is a repetition of what I have articulated.  To make the system work departmental responsibility must be assigned to a group of people who are subject to Cabinet responsibility and collective direction.  We hope to get the joined-up co-operation of the various national services and agencies but this is a legal clarification of what has emerged from the past and which no longer fits the contours of the present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I raise the same concerns I raised regarding the earlier amendments.  Can the Minister reassure me and the House that the Minister for Health has that positive responsibility for delivery of health therapies in schools and that this will not leave a gap in that regard?  The reality for many children with special needs is that they cannot avail of an education without the appropriate health therapies.  The Minister is saying these provisions will not impact on what is being delivered but, unfortunately, in many cases the health therapies are not being delivered and that is holding back children.  I am in favour of availing of education.  I understand the need to ensure the Department of Health has a clear responsibility but I want to be assured that the Minister for Health has that responsibility and that somebody will be co-ordinating and checking that both the health and the education components are working <Col N="20"/>properly.  I appreciate that is the job of the National Council for Special Education as an agency but at ministerial level and at the Cabinet table will the Minister for Health have a clear responsibility for the delivery of health therapies in schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Subsections (5) and (6) have been inserted in section 7 of the 1998 Act by section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act of 2004.  These subsections provide that in carrying out his or her functions in respect of the provision, planning and co-ordination of support services, the Minister may, following consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, request the assistance of a relevant health board and that health board shall comply with this request.  Given that section 2 of the Act has been amended and given the responsibility of the Health Service Executive in this regard, subsections (5) and (6) of section 7 are no longer required to allow the Minister for Education and Skills to request the assistance of health boards to make speech therapy provision.  These sections of the Act predated the establishment of the HSE and the enactment of the Disability Act of 2005.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills remains committed to supporting the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs and it will continue to work with service providing partners in the health and disability sectors through the cross-sectoral team as established under the auspices of the Minister with responsibility for disability and mental health and of the national disability strategy stakeholder monitoring committee.</P>

	<P>I accept we will discuss the substantive issue about untrained teachers later but I oppose amendment No. 16 on the basis that it proposes to remove the words &ldquo;purpose of implementing section 30&rdquo;.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what the Senator is trying to do.  Substituting the words &ldquo;purposes of section 30&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;purpose of implementing section 30&rdquo; is essentially a technical amendment.  The substance of it is that we are substituting agreement with the word consultation.  That is at the core of it.  There may be other points of clarification.  I do not believe that &ldquo;implementing section 30&rdquo; as against &ldquo;purposes of section 30&rdquo; is a material change.  That is not my understanding of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendments No. 7 and 37 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Government amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 5, line 39, to delete &ldquo;appointment procedures,&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment proposes that the revised sections 23 and 24 of the Education Act 1998 are designed to clarify the hierarchy within the legislation.  Where publicly funded posts are concerned, the numbers and the qualifications of teachers, along with teachers&rsquo; terms and conditions of employment, flow from the authority of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the position in the existing legislation at section 24(2) and (5).  While there is a reordering of the subsections, there is no change to the powers of the Ministers for Education and Skills or Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>However, the existing provisions in the Education Act also provided that procedures for the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers were subject to the agreement of certain education partners.  From time to time since the enactment of the Education Act, particularly in regard to making redeployment arrangements for surplus teachers, the question has arisen as to whether this requirement for agreement of each and every one of the parties listed in the legislation must be secured before changes to procedures could be made.  An argument raised in regard to redeployment is that it is effectively an appointment procedure and is therefore subject to such agreement.  Some parties have also asserted that they must have a veto in regard <Col N="22"/>to the redeployment of primary teachers.  In consequence, a doubt has been cast over the State&rsquo;s authority generally to determine employment matters in regard to teachers and other staff employed in schools in publicly funded posts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The doubt that has been raised is that the power given to Ministers in specific areas by virtue of section 24(2) and (5) comprises the requirement to reach the agreement of all concerned when it comes to specific procedures to implement on the ground those matters that are defined by existing legislation as subject to determination by the Ministers.  This is an anomalous position.  The purpose of the revised section 4 is to eliminate any doubt about the capacity of the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure that matters he may have determined are not set aside by virtue of any party withholding agreement when it comes to implementation.  The Bill&rsquo;s provisions maintain the right of the Ministers to determine the numbers, qualifications and terms and conditions generally of those who work in schools.  The requirement for agreement in arriving at appointment, suspension or dismissal procedures now changes to a requirement for consultation.</P>
        <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 7 and 37 is to clarify that this pertains in respect of appointment procedures also.  A similar approach is also taken to redeployment, which will now be provided for specifically in the Education Acts for the first time.  This is because of the memorandum of understanding on the employment control framework.  Redeployment and appointment fall under the umbrella of the terms and conditions of teachers as well as being connected with the numbers of teachers that may be appointed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister has explained that well.  It seems that in that situation, where there is a question of consultation or agreement, to say there must be 100% agreement before a particular step can be taken is unrealistic, as 100% agreement is seldom obtained.  There is always somebody who is out of line.  The Minister has explained it very well and I support his view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister for clarification on the question of redeployment of a teacher who is on a panel when, after consultation, there is no agreement by a school to take a particular teacher from the panel, or a teacher remains on the panel.  With this legislation, the Minister will have the power to overrule that decision following consultation and appoint a teacher from the panel.  For example, would he see it as appropriate if a teacher who did not have fluent Irish was required to teach in a Gaeltacht area?  How would he respond if a teacher who did not believe in the particular ethos of a school was appointed to that school?  As I understand it, the responsibility of a school&rsquo;s board of management is to provide an appropriate education for its children and to ensure the teachers of those children are able to fulfil the requirements of the role.  In the first case I mentioned, this requirement would be fluent Irish, because it is a Gaeltacht school; in the second, it would be that the teacher would uphold the ethos of the school, be it Church of Ireland, Catholic or non-denominational.  I would like the Minister&rsquo;s answers to those two questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the remarks made by Senator Quinn.  I accept that there are times when it is difficult to reach 100% agreement.  However, I hope that &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; will mean real consultation and that concerns will be taken into account.  As the Minister mentioned in his own speech last week, partnership has been a key aspect of education, and I trust the Minister will use his power to make decisions as a last resort.  Partnership is important in the sector and is one of the key aspects of its success over the years.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like most of the previous speakers, I can see the need, very occasionally, for a decision to be made where things are being held up because people are unable to come to an agreement.  As a result of this change, would it be possible for the panel, for example, or the figures for the following year to come out that bit earlier, particularly for the first year, to give the authorities a little more time?  In 99.9% of cases, this will all be done without the need for the Department to come in and make a decision.  I would like that to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senators for their constructive interventions on this point.  I will respond to the query made by Senator Healy Eames.  Before last year, when a teacher became supernumerary to the pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, in a particular school, he or she stayed on the panel and, in many cases, stayed in the original school.  That luxury ended when we lost our economic sovereignty.  Under the memorandum of understanding with the troika, not only must we reduce our current budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2015, we must also reduce costs in the public service by reducing numbers.  It is known in the jargon as the ECF, the employment control framework.  Many Senators will have been lobbied last spring when employment concerns were rising.</P>
        <P>We were given a flat indication and I compliment Mr. Martin Hanevy and Mr. Pat Burke in the Department of Education and Skills for the way in which they negotiated, under existing legislation, with a number of teachers who had become supernumerary and who, for the first time, could not be left on the panel and in the school but who became a barrier to the employment of new, young teachers.  The reality was that no new teacher could be hired until we cleared the panel.  That meant redeployment.  I also thank some of the patrons who extended spaces for employment to teachers who had been teaching in schools of a different ethos.  There are many positive lessons to be learned from what happened last year.  The good thing for professional teachers coming into the education system is that due to growing demand, dealing with the ECF has been offset by the number of new demands for teachers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Healy Eames asked two specific questions.  The first was about the Gaeltacht and gaelscoileanna.  It would not be reasonable to impose upon a gaelscoil or a Gaeltacht school a person who manifestly was not qualified to perform the required functions.  I will leave resolving that to the professionals in the area.  I also do not think that somebody should simply be able to say: &ldquo;I will only go here and not there,&rdquo; and so forth.  There are rights and responsibilities.  With regard to ethos, in some cases it will be a matter for an understanding patron, on the one hand, to accept a tolerant and diplomatically prudent teacher.  The teacher&rsquo;s defiance, if there was to be defiance, in terms of not moving from the panel into a new job would mean that some newly qualified teacher would not get his or her job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Furthermore &mdash; I have discussed this with professional colleagues in the Department &mdash;  the words &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; and &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; are very simple words, but it can be strung over a long dispute as to what constitutes consultation and the extent of agreement.  I would be happy to enter into discussions, in an IR framework, with the educational partners to get a general consensus on the definition and meaning of &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable agreement&rdquo;.  Every time there is a dispute or every time somebody is affected, therefore, we would not have to start <i>ab initio</i> defining what we mean by consultation or agreement.  However, I would sooner put it in the flexible framework of social partnership and a Croke Park-type agreement, rather than inscribe it in statute law.</P>

	<P>I am delighted with the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he would be prepared to go into consultation under an IR framework.  I asked that question of him the other day but did not like to ask it again.  I am very pleased.</P>
        <P>As regards ethos, when I was applying for my first job as a principal many years ago, I was brought before a Sanhedrin of three respectable, strong priests.  They asked me if I thought somebody without religion could teach religion.  I said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  My competitor for the post said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I got the job.  The basis for it was that all things being equal, a professional can do a professional job.  In fact, my son&rsquo;s religion teacher at his secondary school is a confirmed atheist.</P>

	<P>I am grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s explanation.  He has indicated what he considers reasonable and that he does not see the point, for example, of imposing a teacher who is not fluent in the Irish language on a school in the Gaeltacht.  That explanation is very helpful.  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s undertaking that in another domain &mdash; through an industrial relations framework, for instance &mdash; he will examine what may be encompassed within the term &ldquo;meaningful consultation&rdquo;.  It might be helpful to have an exchange of CVs in a redeployment situation so that accurate information about a teacher&rsquo;s capabilities at a given point in his or her career could be conveyed, as opposed to schools relying on bush telegram that undermines the professionalism of teachers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I listened with great interest to the Minister and my colleagues.  To some degree, we are already engaged in a debate that relates to several of the amendments I have tabled.  The Minister is talking a very good talk about patrons being flexible and teachers not being so dogmatic as to refuse to be deployed from a panel into a school which may or may not be their first choice.  The word to describe the happy scenario the Minister suggests is &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;.  However, this does not negate the reality that this legislation is replete with references to matters being determined by the Minister, in some cases with consultation with various bodies and in other cases with only the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It goes back to the question I posed.  What mischief is the Minister seeking to remedy?  If he is reassuring us &mdash; I hope he is right &mdash; that agreement is likely to be reached in all of these scenarios, then why not trust the <i>status quo</i>?  It is one thing to say to people that one expects that agreement will be reached but, at the end of the day, the decision will ultimately be the Minister&rsquo;s.  It is easy to talk about people being reasonable and agreeing on issues when they know, and the Minister knows, what will happen if they do not agree.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It seems that the only situation in which there is genuine partnership is where even the legislation acknowledges the need not just for consultation but for consensus.  I observed on Second Stage that the constitutional underpinning of the provision of education services in this State does not, or should not, lend itself in quite the same way to ministerial fiat in regard to <Col N="25"/>these matters.  It is fine when one is talking about water services and septic tanks.  Important as those issues are, we are talking about education in this instance and it is important to bear in mind that the primary educators are parents.  That is the constitutional underpinning for all of this.  Despite the Minister&rsquo;s undoubted goodwill in this matter and the goodwill of all involved, I am not reassured.  What I see is erosion of the idea that things must be agreed between the different stakeholders in education in favour of a more centralising notion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the opposite view to Senator Mullen on this matter; perhaps I do not have as benign a view of human nature.  Just as a prospective hanging will concentrate the mind, this provision may be of assistance in encouraging people to reach agreement.  I have seen cases where 20 classes in a particular area will be without teachers on 1 September because the schools in question will not appoint that one last person from the panel.</P>
        <P>In saying this, I am not speaking within the European Union framework of economics.  Rather, I am speaking from the perspective of ensuring what is best for the standards and quality of teaching and learning in schools.  If agreement is not possible at the eleventh hour in a particular case, there must be a facility whereby somebody can step in and make a decision.  It is very rare that such a situation would arise but where it does, even after all the industrial relations procedures have been gone through, it is reasonable that the Minister should have that responsibility.  It is necessary to ensure our schools function properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy on this issue.  It will not always be possible to get agreement; that is human nature.  Therefore, it is important that there be somebody at the top, that is, the Minister, with the deciding power.  That said, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s undertaking on the redeployment, for example, of teachers to gaelscoileanna.  It is important that consideration be taken of the particular school and the particular teacher.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senators for their contributions.  I understand Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen&rsquo;s concerns.  However, we are talking about a very clear and defined area of potential industrial relations difficulties, namely, the redeployment of a teacher who has become supernumerary to one school and is appointed to a panel from which he or she must, under the employment control framework, be redeployed before new recruits can be entered into the education system.  The provision is ring-fenced in its applicability to that scenario.  If he is not satisfied the Senator will have a further chance to raise this matter on Report Stage &mdash; I am not inviting him to do so, but he will have that opportunity.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that the Department of Education and Skills does not normally work by fiat.  We receive our mandate and resources from this and the other House.  Moreover, some might argue that the Department has, over time, been far too consultative and facilitative in its engagement with the education partners.  It is not the culture of Marlborough Street to issue fiats, whatever else one may say about it.</P>
        <P>It being one of the youngest languages in the world and a polyglot or fusion of other languages, the English language has a rich treasury of words with the same meaning.  For example, another word for agreement is &ldquo;unanimity&rdquo;.  Unanimity also implies a veto, as we have seen in the dialogue of the European Union in terms of Council meetings.  In this case, we are talking about a potential industrial relations situation.  The Senator will know from his own work that there could be officials on the employer&rsquo;s side and on the union side and that they may, following consultation, reach an agreement as to what is reasonable.  However, the individual concerned could simply refuse to give his or her agreement, essentially exercising a veto.  The provision relates to those very few occasions when such a situation may arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year there was very successful redeployment of a large number of people who found themselves on panels.  Good work was done by senior officials in the Department, but they <Col N="26"/>came back with the observation that it would be wise to modify this proposal by way of a miscellaneous item of education legislation.  I have gone further than that, because I do not want to carve it into statute law.  I am saying to the social partners in education, who have a good ongoing working relationship &mdash; the Senator and others who may want to have their voices heard, particularly on the patron side, can also have an input into this &mdash; let us get a broad understanding of what &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; and &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; mean in order that we do not have to debate their meaning <i>ab initio</i> in every individual case.</P>
        <P>I say that without prejudice.  Senator Feargal Quinn, who has a great deal of managerial experience in these areas, made an important point about the difficulties that can arise.  A 100% agreement is a rare beast and somebody may want to be unco-operative.  The consequences of a lack of co-operation are not neutral and affect other people who, for example, may not get a job until an ECF supernumerary is redeployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to the Minister&rsquo;s remarks about redeployment being required, by implication, by the troika and issues with our economic sovereignty.  Redeployment is good in itself and work was started on it many years ago.  It is important to acknowledge that often, when different education changes are being discussed in the House, there is a tendency to rely on the current economic environment as an excuse for everything, which is unfair.  I met representatives of the troika with other members of my party when they were here some weeks ago.  They made it very clear that provided the Government reaches the overall targets, the troika has not told any Department what must be delivered upon.  It is important for people outside the House to see that not everything is being constantly blamed on the deal done with the IMF and EU.  Rational issues such as this should be seen as they are, and the Minister has rightly pointed out that redeployment, with the appropriate safeguards, is an important part of an effective public sector.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister on the section and I am reassured by the comments to the House regarding consultation and ensuring there is not a particular issue for Gaeltacht schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Senator&rsquo;s intervention and support.  She has probably spent more time on Marlborough Street than I have so far, as I have only been there 11 months.  Last March and April there was a barrier to the employment of new teachers until all the people on a panel were cleared from that year.  There has been redeployment and the Senator is absolutely correct on that point.  People lingering on a redeployment panel into the next academic year should not prevent new recruitment but last spring and early summer it had an effect until the panel was cleared.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 43, to delete &ldquo;Minister,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;Minister after consultation with and with the agreement of bodies representative of patrons, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff association representing teachers, or other staff as appropriate and&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">All of these issues are related but essentially, we are back to the debate about what &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; and &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; mean.  I propose a range of amendments and this amendment relates to the numbers and qualifications of teachers and other staff of a recognised school.  These issues should be determined from time to time by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As the Minister knows, I am arguing that we should talk about consultation and agreement of bodies representative of patrons, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff association representing teachers, or other staff as appropriate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 11 relates to a similar issue, namely, the terms and conditions of employment of teachers and other staff of a recognised school.  Amendment No. 36 relates to dismissal.  The issues are clear-cut.  The partners in question do not feel they were consulted on the preparation of the legislation.  It does not augur particularly well from their point of view.  The preamble to the Education Act 1998 specifically refers to the shared objective of education being provided in a spirit of partnership between the various stakeholders.  Any move towards the Minister having the power, without consultation and agreement, to set such issues as, for example, the dismissal and suspension procedures and terms and conditions of employment for teachers, would be in direct contravention of the preamble and the spirit of partnership upon which the model of education here is founded and on which it has thrived to date.  The various stakeholders are being sidelined and this is ignoring and devaluing the huge contribution made by voluntary members of boards of management.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If I heard the Minister correctly, he suggested that one could say there was sometimes too much consultation by the Department of Education and Skills in the past.  We need to talk about that.  That is a big statement.  Is that the reason the various stakeholders were not consulted prior to the legislation being brought forward?  That is not the way to go.  I respect the Minister&rsquo;s grasp of his brief.  He should explain to me if there is something I do not understand.  The legislation is causing concern.  What I say is reasonable and logical.  I am concerned that we are devaluing the contribution by voluntary members of boards of management.  I understand the requirements of the ECF, employment control framework, and the financial and other constraints on decision makers at the moment.  However, I look on it as a person who benefited from a good education for which I am very grateful.  I have a vested interest in that I am a member of the board of trustees of the CEIST secondary schools.  It seems that when one appoints a teacher one conducts an interview and one tries to select the best candidate for the job.  One views it through the lens of what is best for the student.</P><Col N="28"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Power said redeployment was a good thing.  Surely it is a necessary evil rather than a good thing.  Once one begins to talk about redeployment panels one is talking about less choice and less authority for those who have the responsibility to make an appointment for the benefit of the students who are in their care.  Without wishing to over-simplify the issue, one could view this through the lens of what is good for bureaucracy or what is best for children.  In any conflict between the Department of Education and Skills &mdash; I intend no disrespect to the personnel involved &mdash; and the board of management of a school, backed up by patrons and trustees, I would trust the board of management.  I would favour the subsidiarity principle.  I trust the judgment of the members of a board to decide what is best for the children in their care when they want to make an appointment.  There are certain realities that we must negotiate and deal with in terms of redeployment but let us not try to suggest that it is the answer to all prayers and that it does not contain problems because it does.  If a situation arises from time to time and one cannot empty a panel then there is probably a reason for that.  We must be open about that.  I am concerned about deliberately ignoring and devaluing the contribution by voluntary members of boards of management.  The Minister should correct me if I am wrong &mdash; I am totally open to that &mdash; but  I wonder why there was not consultation prior to bringing forward the legislation.  The board members have a right to consultation and to make an input into a process that intimately affects and restricts how they run the schools for which they work so hard.  I do not need to tell the Minister about the amount of voluntary work being done by committed people on boards of management, etc., on other people&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the Minister&rsquo;s previous Seanad contribution, he mentioned how the Department had embraced consultation and agreement, but a legislative requirement to this effect is not evident in the proposed subsections 24(2), (3) or (10).  It may be the Minister&rsquo;s intention to consult and to seek the agreement of various stakeholders, but the Bill does not oblige him or his successors to do so.  It could be argued that these provisions represent a unilateral amendment of the contracts of employment of thousands of publicly employed individuals.  There could be contract law and employment issues.  I will reserve my position in this regard, but I wish to flag my concern.</P>
        <P>The 1998 Act and other legislation make it clear that the board of management is the employer of teachers.  Would these sections have the effect of altering the relationship between the employer and the employee without the agreement of the supposed employer?</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the powers he is seeking under these sections as being solely an administrative convenience to be relied upon in cases of emergency, but there is a question of whether he is transferring the attributes of an employer to the Department of Education and Skills in a way that might have implications in terms of liability.  Although it is a separate question, it is worth asking whether the Department, the Minister and the taxpayer will be exposed to additional risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Without the checks and balances when one has an obligation to consult and agree &mdash; this obligation should be included in legislation, given the distinctive nature of education &mdash; the level of discretion granted to the Minister by this section is almost legislative.  The power to decide hiring and firing mechanisms unilaterally is being delegated.  Other sections of the Bill define in detail the Minister&rsquo;s power to make regulations in the context of the Teaching Council, yet there is no defining objective listed in this provision.  Questions arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s comments.  It may seem that I am contradicting my comments on the need for 100% agreement, but there is a difference between boards of management and individuals.  It is difficult to reach agreement with individuals, in that one among a large number will invariably disagree.  If we give individuals the right of veto, <Col N="29"/>operating the system would be impossible.  However, there is a difference in the case of boards of management.  If the boards and the Minister disagree, at some point or other we must pressure the Minister to recognise the opinions of the boards and the representative bodies of those involved in education.  The difference between consultation and agreement will always pose a difficulty.  There is no problem with the former, but there is with the latter.  The idea that the Minister would be forced to accept a different view must be taken into account.</P>
        <P>There is a difference between negotiating with boards and negotiating with individuals, as 100% agreement in the case of the latter is difficult.  When one deals with a representative body or a school management body, however, it is possible to strengthen the Minister&rsquo;s hand to encourage agreement rather than just consultation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is very much like what we have discussed already, but I take the point that there is a slight difference.  Rather than weakening boards of management, if this is done right, in the context of the Minister&rsquo;s reference to agreement and consultation, it could empower them.  In most cases, boards of management are not sufficiently consulted in the filling of vacancies in schools.  In the North all applications are reviewed by the board and must tick a certain number of boxes.  This ensures all those selected for interview are in possession of certain competencies.  That is very rarely done in this jurisdiction.  Instead, it is generally the case that the first the board members know of a teacher is immediately after his or her appointment when they are summoned to ratify the appointment.  It could be done differently.  Will the Minister indicate whether he is moving in that direction?</P>
        <P>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen has said there is a reason a person on a panel is not appointed to a post.  That may or may not be the case.  It could be, for example, that an applicant is not on good terms with a former principal who may have sent the message that the applicant is not a good teacher.  That has happened.  The basic competency of a teacher is judged by an inspector.  Once he or she has the necessary inspector&rsquo;s reports, that should be it.  Some time ago there was a proposal that boards of management might have responsibility for assessing teachers&rsquo; performance on a scale such as that applied to civil servants for the purpose of assessing eligibility for increments.  Such a move would empower boards and improve teaching and learning in schools.  However, it was not deemed acceptable at the time.</P>
        <P>Everything we do must be focused on the quality of teaching and learning in schools.  If these criteria are met, we can move ahead.  In supporting the Minister on this provision I note that there is nothing substantially different from what we have heard already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise if I repeat anything that has been said already.  I intended no discourtesy by my absence from the Chamber for the beginning of the debate.  I had to undergo a minor medical procedure and the surgeon was only available today.  I came here as quickly as I could.</P>
        <P>I have a major aversion to the word &ldquo;stakeholder&rdquo;.  I know what it means, but I do not like it.  However, I suppose it is necessary to use it in some circumstances.</P>
        <P>I agree with some aspects of Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen&rsquo;s contribution.  I went to two schools, one of which was extremely good and the other appalling.  As far as I could tell, it had nothing whatever to do with the board of management in either case.  I certainly agree that the criterion should be what is best for children.  It is splendid that people give up considerable amounts of time on a voluntary basis to serve on boards of management.</P>
        <P>I may be confusing matters, but I seem to recall Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen saying he had served on some 114 boards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.  I would be concerned if there was a question of a block interest.  The Senator probably corrected the matter after I had spoken on the last occasion.  To my mind, if we have individual volunteers making up the board, they have a very important contribution to make.  However, if there are people sitting on multiple boards simply to represent particular interests, I have less respect for them as &mdash; to use that horrible word &mdash; stakeholders.</P>
        <P>While consultation is generally positive, I am a believer in ministerial responsibility.  If, however, an amendment to change a couple of words were tabled, he might consider it because, as matters stand, the Bill appears almost to confer the power of veto on particular groups.  In circumstances where the Minister was incapable of achieving agreement with the representatives of the patrons, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff association representing teachers, etc., the amendment seems to suggest that failure to secure such an agreement would preclude him or her from taking the action he or she would wish to take.  Again, I could be wrong but that is what appears to be the intention.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I respectfully ask the Minister to consider a slight alteration to the amendment tabled by my two colleagues in order that it would read &ldquo;the Minister after consultation with and having sought the agreement of&rdquo;.  I do not believe it is necessary to obtain agreement.  Engaging in consultation and seeking agreement are good.  During a fractious career &mdash; and perhaps to the surprise of some colleagues in this House &mdash; I have come to be regarded as something of an alpha male within certain organisations.  I have always sought that decisions be made and, if a majority existed, that they be rushed through.  It was actually female members of the various organisations to which I refer who were able to demonstrate that if, after careful discussion, it is possible to persuade everyone to one&rsquo;s point of view, then decisions will be copper-fastened and people will not continually try to reopen the debate on dead issues.</P>
        <P>I suggest that the amendment would be acceptable if the term &ldquo;having sought&rdquo; were included.  The only difficulty which might arise could be practical in nature.  Will the Minister indicate both the number of bodies involved and how many of them would have to be consulted?  Would it be possible to delegate responsibility to someone in order that he or she might engage in the relevant discussions on his behalf?  There are such serious matters arising in respect of education &mdash; from primary all the way through to post-third level &mdash; that it would not be possible for the Minister spend all his time involved in consultations with boards of management.  Perhaps the amendment could be tinkered with before Report Stage.  In that context, the Government&rsquo;s advisers might be in a position to come up with a suggestion which would not tie the Minister into being obliged to hold endless meetings with boards of management but which would still ensure consultation took place and attempts would be made to secure agreement.  The Minister should not be obliged to comply with a requirement to reach agreement with every interest group.</P>

	<P>This debate on this amendment is useful because it has given us the opportunity to discuss other issues.  I acknowledge the way in which the Minister answered my previous question on ethos and the competence of teachers in the context, for example, of the teaching of Irish.  As Senator Mullen pointed out, however, there have been cases where matters relating to the redeployment panel could not be resolved and where teachers were not taken off it as a result of word on the grapevine to the effect that they were not very competent.  The Minister will now have an overarching power which will allow him to appoint such teachers to schools which previously might not have wanted to avail of their services.  Will he indicate what he proposes to do in respect of teacher incompetence?  I accept that I am referring to a small number of individuals in this regard but nevertheless it is a factor.</P><Col N="31"/>
        <P>I acknowledge what Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy said, namely, that it is not always the case that a teacher might be incompetent but rather that he or she might not be well liked.  It is never helpful when information of that nature gets onto the grapevine.  We must be honest and state that a small number of teachers might not be competent.  That is the case with any profession.  What is the Minister doing to resolve this issue?  What mechanisms have been or will be put in place to make the redeployment of teachers easier?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have never come across difficulties involving teachers who remained on the redeployment panel for a long period and who were eventually taken on by schools.  I am extremely interested in what Senator Norris had to say and I await the Minister&rsquo;s response to him.  Did I understand the Senator to have stated that he attended two schools, that one of these was good and the other bad and that whether a school was good or bad had nothing to do with its board of management?  Boards of management are responsible for running schools and that is where the problem lies.  They have both the power and the responsibility but at times they are not encouraged to use the former or exercise the latter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Boards of management may have power but much of the time those boards may not even be consulted.  I have personal experience of this matter and I am aware that the first one will hear about a particular teacher being employed is when one receives a telephone call to ratify his or her appointment.  There might have been no consultation prior to said telephone call being made.  What the Government is proposing will give rise to a vast improvement.  I previously taught many pupils who became teachers and who ended up on the redeployment panel.  I can only describe those to whom I refer as being excellent teachers and I have written numerous references for them because they are the brightest sparks for the future.  We want to retain these individuals rather than educating them and then seeing them leave the country.  The legislation seeks to improve matters in this area.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames referred to the competency of teachers.  What the Minister is proposing in the context of changes to the Teaching Council and in respect of compulsory professional development will be of assistance in that regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome Senator Norris to the debate.  I do not know where he was up to now but he may have been receiving treatment from a psychic because he has anticipated much of the debate that has occurred and a great deal of the etymological exploration of the difference between words such as &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; and &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.  His long years of experience in the Seanad appear to travel with him outside this Chamber.</P>
        <P>Before dealing with the specifics of the amendment, I wish to deal with a number of general issues.  The history of the control and management of our schools is well known to all Senators.  The system in this regard is 181 years old this year.  From 1922, when the State came into legal existence, the manager of a school was a sole person appointed by the patron who, in 92% to 93% of cases, was the Catholic archbishop or bishop of the relevant diocese and usually &mdash; but not always &mdash; the local parish priest.  Under that hierarchy of command and control, being a manager meant that one had absolute power.  That is something many schoolmasters know to their cost.  I include in that regard the late John McGahern who was summarily dismissed from a teaching post in Clontarf because he offended the bishop of the day and the manager was instructed to dismiss him.  In 1976, when the then Minister for Education, Mr. Richard Burke, introduced &mdash; on foot of an election campaign pledge give by the then coalition Government &mdash; the participation of parents, teachers and others, I suspect that in order not to frighten the <Col N="32"/>horses, particularly those in Drumcondra, the words &ldquo;manager&rdquo; and &ldquo;management&rdquo; were retained.  The board of management has expanded to contain ten or eight and Senators are familiar with the present structure.  However, they have never been managers.  It is more accurate to describe them as boards of governors.  They have very limited powers and the real managers of a school, as anybody will tell one, are the principal and vice-principal.  They have the responsibility for the school&rsquo;s day-to-day affairs.  A board of shareholders or directors has a chairman but, in making the educational experience happen every day in our primary schools, the chief executive officer is in my view the principal.  The terminology has been passed out.</P>
        <P>The new section 24(10) to be introduced to the 1998 Act by section 6 of the Bill states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The board of a recognised school may, in accordance with procedures determined from time to time by the Minister following consultation with bodies representative of patrons, recognised school management organisations, recognised trade unions and associations representing teachers, or other staff as appropriate, suspend or dismiss, or both, any or all of the Principal, teachers and other staff of a school, who are to be remunerated out of monies provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Accepting the amendment proposed by Senators Quinn and Mullen would mean it would read as follows, and this is qualified by the debate we had earlier:</P>
        <P LI="1">The board of a recognised school may, in accordance with procedures determined from time to time by the Minister after consultation with and with the agreement of bodies representative of patrons, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff association representing teachers, or other staff as appropriate, suspend or dismiss, or both, any or all of the Principal, teachers and other staff of a school, who are to be remunerated out of monies provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am not sure what safeguard the amendment will necessarily give that is not already there.  The amendment introduces the words &ldquo;and with the agreement&rdquo; following &ldquo;the Minister after consultation with&rdquo;.  We would have consultation and agreement prior to being able to proceed and dispose of a non-performing school or principal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The suggested amendment from the university Senator from the other university panel would include &mdash; based no doubt on practical experience &mdash; &ldquo;having sought the agreement of&rdquo;.  We are back to the philosophical question of consultation and agreement.  I have already said, but I will repeat it for the benefit of Senator Norris who was not here, that I am prepared to work with the social partners, including the representative bodies of patrons and others, to get a working definition of what &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; means and, being slightly repetitious, that &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; does not mean unanimity or veto and &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; does not mean diktat or imposition.  As we have found in the past, sometimes precision in legislation can be too complicated in the area of human relations, which is what we are discussing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reason this is necessary is because in the past when a difficult situation arose one did not have to resolve it there and then before one could hire new teachers.  This is the fundamental difference.  Whether we would repeal all of this following our recovery of economic sovereignty would be a matter for other people.  It is one of the experiences that has come out of last summer.  I must state informally I was told difficulties arose and it was due only to good co-operation from various patron bodies &mdash; I have already paid tribute to one of them, namely, the Catholic Church &mdash; with regard to taking into its schools in southern Ireland a number of teachers not working for schools under the patronage of the Catholic Church but from another ethos.</P><Col N="33"/>
        <P Just="Left">In the logic of what I have rejected and accepted in the past I cannot accept this amendment because it would go back to where we were with regard to consultation and agreement.  The amendment would mean mentioning consultation and agreement in order that it would be a belt and braces approach; the Senators are seeking a consultative process and a process that would require agreement, which is unanimity.  As I see it, this would be a veto.  It is not necessary.  I have no doubt as to the motives of Senators Mullen and Quinn, but it is excessive in the context of where we are and I cannot accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his response which, if I may say so, was very thoughtful and informative, and for which I am grateful. As it is not that late, I do not have that excuse for saying I did not quite follow one objection the Minister raised with regard to the wording of section 24(10) relating to suspension or dismissal.  We are clear that what we propose does not draw in the requirement for agreement before a person can be suspended.  We are discussing the way in which procedures are arrived at.  I do not think there is any misunderstanding there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key word is &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; and whether it should be there with &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;, but if this was all there were between us and the Minister I would happily settle for deletion of the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; in favour of &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; on Report Stage.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that there may be a degree of superfluousness or superfluity &mdash; I will defer to Senator Norris on which is the correct word &mdash; in having both &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; and &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;.  However, as the Minister stated, we are back at the same point on whether the relationship was good in the past.  The Minister hinted it was not good and that too much consultation took place in the past and there was too much waiting on the viewpoint of various parties.  The Minister also cited the co-operative spirit, but this all comes down to the fact that he prefers not to have to depend on this co-operative spirit in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have said what I said about education.  I am not happy that we go from Archbishop McQuaid to the Minister for Education and Skills, and there is a bit of this happening.  As one person involved in the boards of management of schools asked me, is this representative of a new culture and command style in the Department of Education and Skills?  It does not fit the requirements of education.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will respond if I may because this is the meat of the Bill.  Legislation must be precise in how it is drafted.  If one deconstructs section 24(10) and examines it one sees it states the board of a recognised school may &mdash; it then goes to the operative verbs &mdash; <Col N="34"/>suspend or dismiss or both.  The operative agent is the board of a recognised school, and the sentence goes on to qualify how it may make decisions in accordance with procedures determined from time to time by the Minister.  These procedures include: consultation with bodies representative of patrons; recognised school management organisations; and recognised trade unions and associations representing teachers or other staff as appropriate.  These are bodies such as the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN; the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO; the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD; or the Association of Secondary School Teachers of Ireland, ASTI.  Having referred to these, the process then goes to the operative point of suspending for whatever reason the board deems to be appropriate.  With all due respect to the two Senators, I do not see what additional powers or qualifications the board would have if we were to insert the words, &ldquo;the board of a recognised school may, in accordance with procedures determined from time to time by the Minister, following consultation with and with the agreement of bodies representative of patrons, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff association representing teachers, or other staff as appropriate ...&rdquo; suspend or dismiss a non-performing school principal or staff.  This is a case of belt, braces and bicycle clips.  It appears to be superfluous.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide for the amendment of section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001.  This provision clarifies a function of the Teaching Council with regard to programmes of teacher education and training provided by institutions of higher education and training.  Section 38 states:  &ldquo;The Council shall, from time to time, (<i>a</i>) review and accredit the programmes of teacher education and training ...&rdquo;.  This may be interpreted as requiring the council to accredit all of the programmes it reviews.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Bill contains a provision to allow the council to accredit programmes where it is appropriate to do so.  Amendment No. 47 was dealt with as it was grouped with amendments Nos. 6, 16, 42 and 46.</P>

The amendment reads: &ldquo;to delete &ldquo;to be&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, or are to be&rdquo;.  I do not understand this.  Is it the intention to delete the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;or&rdquo;?  The Bill reads, &ldquo;... who are to be ...&rdquo; and the Minister is proposing to insert &ldquo;or are to be&rdquo;.  The verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; is included twice.  It seems confusing, or it might just be my stupidity.  The Minister proposes to delete the words &ldquo;to be&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;or are to be&rdquo;, but they are already included in the Bill.

        <P FLI="0">We are back to the discussion on the issue of redeployment, the concept of which is not defined legally in the Bill or elsewhere.  A lack of precision in legislative drafting will only set the stage for future disputes and possible judicial reviews, resulting in further costs to the taxpayer.  The word &ldquo;redeployment&rdquo; is used by the Department as shorthand for a set of procedures designed to avoid the necessity to pay a teacher&rsquo;s redundancy entitlements at the expense of the autonomy of schools to recruit appropriate teachers and manage the turnover of staff.  Such a mechanism should be nothing more than a temporary solution employed to solve a problem until a more permanent solution can be arrived at and such a temporary solution should not be placed on a statutory footing.</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P>I have no doubt that some very fine teachers make their way from panels onto the staff of new schools or schools in which there is a vacancy.  I am in no way impugning the quality of many teachers who have been surplus to quota and are on panels, but who, ultimately, gets to decide whether to make an appointment?  That is not a matter that should be removed so dramatically away from the influence of school managers of boards of management.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister&rsquo;s informative analysis of the way management has evolved in schools.  He has outlined the <i>de facto</i> position.  I know this to be the case where <i>de facto</i> the manager is often the principal.  That is a source of concern because with the best will in the world it is not ideal that we have strong principals and weak boards of management.  That is the reason the role of chairperson of the board of management is crucial.  It is up to schools, patrons and trustees to ensure strong, informed and competent chairpersons of boards of management are in place.  I make this point as an aside.  I am not in any way impugning or seeking to denigrate the quality of teachers who find themselves on panels, but an issue arises about who, ultimately, gets to make the call about whether to make an appointment to a school.</P>
        <P>When a job is advertised and there is no question of a panel being formed, it is clearly the prerogative of the board of management to pick the best person for the job.  By definition, the use of a redeployment panel system involves the possibility that sometimes the best person for the job will not be chosen, and that is a key issue.  That is why we should view this mechanism as a temporary solution employed to resolve a problem until a more permanent solution can be arrived at.  I have warned of the danger of putting such a temporary solution on a statutory footing.  Redeployment is a fundamental interference with the capability of boards of management to run their schools and recruit appropriate staff.  In reality, different schools, even in physically proximate areas, will have different needs, education models, ethos and so on.  It is about many issues, be it religious values, the Irish language in some cases or basic competence in other cases, and we cannot presume that the needs of every school are uniform.</P>
        <P>Redeployment also presumes that one teacher is the same as the next and has the same skills and training but teaching is not a one size fits all profession.  Different teachers will bring different experiences, strengths and qualifications which may benefit one school more than another, and that is a big issue.  That is the reason this is such an important question.  Foisting teachers upon schools without allowing them to assess applicants for suitability does not sit well with any claim to have children at the heart of our education system.  This has the potential to militate against the pursuit of excellence.</P>
        <P>The Minister has stated that the EU-IMF framework requires redeployment to ensure that the State stays within the limits set by the employment control framework.  Surely making suppressed posts redundant and thereby terminating the employment of the holder of a post rather than redeploying him or her is the more logical and obvious way to achieve those targets.  It is a question we should at least debate.  Keeping the suppressed post holder on a panel and continuing to pay in that respect does not achieve what the Minister claims he wishes to achieve.</P>
        <P>I have raised the question of the employer in this context.  Are we moving to a position where the Department will be construed as the employer?  In many ways that would seem to be the logic that flows from the powers the Minister seeks under this Bill.  The board of management may well be a titular employer but the Department is becoming the entity with all the powers and rights normally accruing to an employer.  That raises the question of whether the Department will be open and subject to all the judicial and statutory processes to which employees are &mdash; those of court actions, employment appeals tribunal hearings, equality tribunal proceedings and so on and dealing with the binding judgments of those fora.  If a redeployment decision by the Minister or his Department were to lead to some kind of miscon<Col N="37"/>duct, or some other issue were to lead to a court action and to an award, where normally the board of management, as I understand it under the law, would be the body with liability in such a case, will there be extra liability on the part of the Department in the future where mischief flows from a redeployment decision made by the Minister?  I would be interested to know if any consideration has been given to that.  These are legitimate questions which flow from the changes the Minister proposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be clear about what we are talking about.  This is a long section and we have moved backwards in terms of chronological pages to address this area.  The operative phrase is &ldquo;in accordance with redeployment procedures determined from time to time by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform following consultation&rdquo; and so on.  Is that the focus of the Senator&rsquo;s attention?  It is the redeployment reference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, this is an amendment about redeployment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The reason for the reference &ldquo;in accordance with redeployment procedures determined from time to time by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rdquo; is the Croke Park agreement and the fact that in return for agreement by the social partners and the representative organisations there would be no compulsory redundancy.  That is the essence of it.  It is couched in this way because one cannot put an agreement such as the Croke Park agreement into necessary legislation, or it would not be advisable or best legislative practice to do so.  That is what that means.  There is an undertaking in return for certain assurances &mdash; with which the Senator will be familiar &mdash; about the permanency of employment commitment from the social partners on the trade union side to be productive and flexible in terms of productivity, which is in the course of being delivered, and that is what is there.  If a person refused redeployment, in some circumstances there might have been another sanction, and that is what this is attempting to address.  Removing that does not give the person any additional cover, rather the position is quite the contrary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Am I right in thinking the Minister is saying that this is embedding the terms of the Croke Park agreement in the legislation by putting the redeployment procedures on a statutory footing?  I am opposed to putting redeployment procedures on a statutory footing in this way.  To quote by beloved father, &ldquo;I am cutting stubbles here&rdquo;; we are both cutting stubbles in revisiting ground that has already been travelled.  This is something that is at best a temporary solution.  There is something imperfect about the concept of redeployment panels for all the reasons I have given in that they raise questions about what is ultimately being prioritised, the best person for the job or the need to keep people in employment.  I am sympathetic to the need for some kind of a balance there.  We want to act justly towards people who are competent teachers and find themselves surplus to requirements in a school.  They have to be looked after as far as possible but there is the balancing issue of the right of boards of management and of the other parties in education, but specifically boards of management, to appoint the best person for the job.  Those are the issues that are in tension sometimes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to assist in that regard.  The intent of the changes being proposed under the new section 24(5) is to strengthen the legal basis for the redeployment of surplus teachers.  In that respect, the Senator is correct.  While having fully efficient and effective <Col N="38"/>teacher redeployment arrangements has always been an objective of the Department, it has assumed, as I said in an earlier response to Senator Power, a critical dimension in the context of the EU-IMF framework.  This is because of the ceiling on numbers under the employment control framework and the imperative of staying within the limit and, as I said, we also have obligations under the Croke Park agreement.</P>
        <P>The allocation of teachers is a function of the pupil-teacher ratio and the population of schools both at primary and secondary level and, by definition, it varies every year because of a decrease in enrolment, an increase in demand or whatever.  There could be an allocation of additional teachers and so on and there must be a basis for it.  A different regime was in place in the past.  If the allocation resulted in a surplus of teachers being in the vicinity, they were put on the deployment panel.  I am being repetitious but the Senator is entitled to hear this in the context of this argument and the debate, for those who will read it, will make more sense.  We are not in that space any more.  In the old days there may have been a few teachers who for whatever reason be it ethos, the patron body or, as Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy and others have said, they may have had a reputation, justified or otherwise, no prospective employer wanted to take on and they could not have been foisted upon them at that time so they stayed supernumerary and the Department absorbed that extra cost.  We do not have that discretion any more.  To encourage redeployment, with a carrot and stick approach effectively, and we cannot fire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  In these days the carrot is having employment and a pensionable job; it may not be in the same place as one is currently employed but many people do not have a sense of that in that we have 440,000 people unemployed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is the view of the section of the Department.  It is considered that we need these extra legal powers to avoid litigation and dispute.  We have endeavoured to have as much consultation as possible with the social partners in regard to this in the area.  I stress that it is not an attempt to undermine or take away the discretionary powers of patron bodies and individual schools to hire or to refuse to hire individual staff.  We have had one year of operating this and we have had a good experience with all involved.  However, the people involved on our side felt it was necessary to have clarification and a strengthening of the legislation in this area on behalf of the Minister.  Otherwise, if I or the negotiating staff within the Department who conduct the negotiations &mdash; it is not the Minister who does the negotiating &mdash; could not get the agreement, we could not employ the extra or new teachers.  There would be an impasse whereby if a school required teacher capacity, we could not authorise it because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would not authorise it.  We would not get sanction for that new employment unless we had cleared out the panel, and that is what we need.</P>

	<P>I will be brief as I do not wish to keep this discussion going all evening.  I am grateful to the Minister for his responses.  There are two questions however.  The Minister said there has been a year of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been one cycle of experience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

	<P>No, but people would say we were lucky.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it not be better to wait and see how it pans out, to see whether this can be achieved through agreement and to see if the current system works?  If the Minister is not sure it is broken yet, why is he seeking to fix it?  He is certainly not obliged by the troika or anyone else to put these redeployment procedures on a statutory footing.  On the other question I asked, has the Minister or his Department given any thought to issues of liability that might arise?  The Minister is putting this on a statutory basis, whereby it will be very much under ministerial control.  There will be consultation but the redeployment procedures will be a ministerial decision.  Does the Minister foresee that this could lead to situations where it could be argued, if there is some type of legal action as a result of a redeployment, that there could be a greater degree of liability on the State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure in what sense liability would fall on the State.  What would it be liable for &mdash; imposing a teacher on a reluctant employer?</P>

        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>b</i>) the conditions attaching to the employment of such a person where he or she is, or is to be, remunerated out of monies provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully committed to ensuring that, to the greater extent possible, only qualified and registered teachers are employed in recognised schools.  Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 currently provides that a person employed as a teacher cannot be paid from the public purse unless he or she is a teacher registered with the Teaching Council.  The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI, have argued for the commencement of section 30 without qualification.</P>
        <P>While the position of employing only registered teachers is a very desirable and logical one, it does not always reflect the practicalities at school level.  Schools may, at short notice, have to engage a person in place of a registered teacher who might be sick or unable to attend school for some other reason.  Despite the high numbers of newly qualified teachers, principals can experience genuine problems in sourcing a registered teacher.  If there were no exception to this requirement, students would almost certainly have to be sent home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill will permit the Minister of the day to regulate the conditions attaching to the employment of an unregistered person in these circumstances.  These conditions can include a requirement than an unregistered person can only be employed if a registered teacher is not available to take up the position; a limit on the length of time for which an unregistered person can be employed; a requirement that an unregistered person have certain minimum qualifications; a requirement that the Minister consent to the employment of an unregistered <Col N="41"/>person; a limit on the subject or purposes for which the person will be employed; and a requirement that the school retain evidence as to why it has been unable to employ a registered teacher.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Much of this has been done administratively.  In Circular 31/2011 issued by the Department in May last year, the employment of an unregistered person is limited to a continuous period of five days at a time, and schools remain under a continuing obligation to source a registered teacher.  Schools must also prioritise registered teachers over unregistered people.  As a result of this approach, if there is an adequate supply of registered teachers, schools will have to employ them over unregistered people.  However, the regulations will ensure that a school does not have to close simply because it cannot find a registered teacher when there is an unforeseen absence.</P>
        <P>I have considered providing exceptions for people in the system who have let their registration lapse and for those whose registration with the Teaching Council was pending at the time of their employment.  I considered permitting the employment of people in teaching positions in these two situations being paid at the unqualified rate of pay.  However, in light of union representations, I have decided not to provide for these two categories and the purpose of amendment No. 17 is to limit the exception to having to be registered to the urgent and very short-term needs of schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 20 is required to correct a printing error in the Bill. I thank Senators for amendment No. 21 dealing with the same point.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 22 and 27 to 29, inclusive, are consequent to the substitution for subsection (7)(<i>c</i>) of a new subsection (8) which provides for the only circumstances in which the employment of an unregistered person is permitted.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 30 to 32, inclusive, are drafting amendments to clarify language in the Bill following advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>The purpose of amendment No. 23, raised by myself and Senators Averil Power, Thomas Byrne, Mark Daly and others, is to remove the unnecessary reference to &ldquo;in so far as possible&rdquo; because the provision already refers to the desirability of employing only registered teachers to teach.  I thank the Senators for their amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the Minister&rsquo;s amendment is to make the provision more limited.  However, it is still regrettable to provide, for the first time, for statutory recognition for unqualified personnel, particularly in the current economic environment when there are so many young, qualified teachers looking for work.  As I did on Second Stage, I urge the Minister to follow through on his commitment to enact section 30 as it stands and not to provide for statutory recognition of the placement of unqualified personnel in charge of the education of pupils.  Our group has tabled a proposal to delete all of the sections relating to the employment of unqualified personnel.  Failing this, important textual changes need to be made which are contained in amendments Nos. 19, 23, 24 and 26.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the teaching of children by unqualified teachers will not be as good as teaching by qualified teachers, just as the worst room in the best hotel is better than the best room in the worst hotel.  However,  from time to time it is impossible to find a qualified teacher, notwithstanding the number of young teachers who are unemployed, and it is more difficult at certain times of the year.  The Minister is making provision for very limited number of circumstances which need to be provided for in legislation because of the Teaching Council Act.  While the legislation is not perfect, it is necessary.  Where perfection is not possible, we <Col N="42"/>have to go with something less.  The provision to impose a limit of five days will give school principals cause to pause for thought considering that a replacement will be required after five days.  Therefore, they will make an extra effort to find a qualified teacher.  A school must show evidence that it has searched to find a qualified teacher.  This is a very important provision in regard to which I support the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>All Members agree that it is preferable to have qualified teachers teaching children, where possible, but there are exceptional cases.  I am in agreement with the Minister on this point.  I taught music which is very much a minority subject and sometimes it was difficult to find a substitute teacher to teach subjects such as music or physics.  A person with a relevant degree who is not a qualified teacher could be employed in such circumstances.  We have to make allowances for such cases, rather than see a school close, as has been cited.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s circular of last May on retired teachers.  This is a proposal that needs to be considered.  Retired teachers on pension are being re-employed.  This is one aspect we need to examine with regard to qualified and non-qualified teachers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very capable Minister who gives consideration to matters.  We had experience of him in this House in previous sessions and it is always a pleasure to discuss matters with him.  I have a couple of questions for him.  He says his initial instinct was to allow teachers who had perhaps inadvertently allowed their registration to lapse or whose registration was pending to be included, but that following the receipt of trade union representations, he changed his mind.  I ask him to explain why he thought it was a good idea because it is and the reasons the trade unions have adopted this attitude.  As I am a member of three trade unions, I am not anti-trade union and happen to think the Minister&rsquo;s party is not socialist enough for my taste.  Therefore, I am not speaking from a right-wing perspective.</P>
        <P>The Minister seemed to talk about persons who were partially qualified.  He did not actually use that phrase, rather I am employing it.  I think he said something about individuals who had some qualification.  What constitutes a partial qualification?  If people are completely unqualified, they are just like goatherds or shepherds, simply keeping students in their places.  If they do not have knowledge, they cannot impart it.  In having somebody who is completely unqualified and has no knowledge to impart to the young people in his or her care, the students concerned would be much better off having somebody who had inadvertently allowed his or her registration to lapse.  If such a person was to give a guarantee that he or she would complete his or her re-registration, or if registration was pending, there would be a much stronger argument for including them than for using persons who were completely unqualified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of brief technical questions.  It may be that the drafters of the Bill have already spotted them, but there are three technical issues to be considered.  One is not so much a technical drafting issue, but in the proposed section 24(7)(<i>c</i>)(ii) there is a reference to the continued established tenure of a person in a teaching position under an existing contract of employment.  The goal of the section appears to be to allow the Minister to provide that certain teachers, most likely those who have already&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>To which section is the Senator referring?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 24.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="43"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On which page?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Page 7.  Section 24(7)(<i>c</i>)(ii) reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) Notwithstanding section 30 of the Act of 2001, the Minister, where he or she is satisfied that it is necessary to facilitate&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) the urgent, temporary or occasional staffing needs of schools,</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) the continued established tenure of a person in a teaching position under an existing contract of employment...</P>
        <P FLI="0">Given that the goal of the section is to allow the Minister to provide that certain teachers, most likely those who already have contracts of indefinite duration or who would be entitled to them under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003, be allowed to continue to be paid from the public purse.  However, the terms used in the subsection are not clear.  If the Minister is seeking discretion to extend and define the exceptions he is carving out of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, surely it would be advisable to delineate that discretion; in other words, I am asking whether there is a need to add appropriate definitions in the interpretation section of the Bill of the terms &ldquo;tenure&rdquo; and &ldquo;existing contract of employment&rdquo;, given that a new power is being given.  It seems there ought to be such definitions.  Perhaps there is a definition somewhere or in other legislation.</P>
        <P>My other two questions are relatively simple.  One relates to the proposed section 24(8) on page eight, line six, which begins with the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding the Act of 2001&rdquo;.  I presume there are a couple of words missing.  Perhaps the missing words are &ldquo;the provisions&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; should be deleted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is superfluous.  </P>
        <P>Section 24(9)(<i>f</i>) reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (<i>c</i>) of subsection (7), regulations made under this section may provide for one or more than one of the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>f</i>) a requirement that a school retain and furnish to the Minister evidence that it has been unable to employ a registered teacher in the place of a registered teacher in a recognised school . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">Am I correct in thinking one of these words needs to be changed to &ldquo;unregistered&rdquo;?  Perhaps I misunderstand the wording, but I would have thought the paragraph should read &ldquo;...evidence that it has been unable to employ a registered teacher in the place of an unregistered teacher in a recognised school&rdquo;.  I apologise if I have mistaken the intent of the text, but it is not clear to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Mary Moran has raised the issue to which I was going to allude, there is no point in going over that ground again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to respond to Senator David Norris.  The intention was to introduce section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 without qualification.  It was absolute in that it did not, as it should have, take account of unusual circumstances.  The net point was that one could not be paid from moneys voted by the Oireachtas if one was hired on a temporary basis and not a qualified teacher.  That was the thrust of the legal advice we received on the <Col N="44"/>section and it was the subject of much discussion at the teachers&rsquo; trade union conferences last Easter.  We changed the position in a circular, not the legislation, by making a recommendation that, where possible, only qualified teachers be employed. In the past a school to be closed could have happily sent its pupils home in the expectation that somebody would be there.  However, that expectation is now unreasonable and does not fit with the reality of home life arrangements where both parents are frequently working outside the home.  The modification mentioned was made.</P>
        <P>There are references to a registration that has lapsed or is pending.  The reason is that the Teaching Council is not a representative of the trade unions; it is the professional organisation of the teaching profession, in the same way that the Medical Council is the professional organisation for doctors and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland is the professional organisation for registered architects and so on.  Significantly, it is the disciplinary body which will withhold recognition from teachers who fail to comply with the terms and conditions of their registration.  Earlier in the legislation, in amending the Teaching Council legislation, we are giving powers to the council to state one can only re-register as a teacher if one has complied with certain requirements in respect of continuous professional development, a standard applied by most professional organisations.  One has to upgrade one&rsquo;s skills and demonstrate that one has maintained one&rsquo;s skills level through a prescribed set of courses.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The great critique of some of the Senator&rsquo;s right-wing colleagues, not his I hasten to add, is that one cannot get rid of a non-performing teacher.  The peer group of the Teaching Council will have the capacity to refuse registration, if it so chooses, and decide that one of its colleagues has failed to meet the standards laid down.  Recently, in the Law Library, a prominent practitioner at the Bar had his licence to practise cancelled because of the publicity surrounding a certain case in which clients had been defrauded of money.  Obviously, I cannot name the case in question.  Clearly, the Bar Council found that a person acting as a barrister had misled his clients and acted fraudulently and against its rules.  Therefore, as a result, he lost his licence to practise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been controversy within teaching circles that the requirement to pay a registration fee of &euro;90 a year with no return service is onerous; it has been the subject of conversation in certain staff rooms.  Some ask why they should pay, given that they will receive nothing in return.  As and from the commencement date of the Bill, the Teaching Council can require payment and do for its profession what other professions do for their members.  That is the thinking behind the provision.</P>
        <P>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen had a query about a particular section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The first issue I raised concerned section 24(7)(<i>c</i>)(ii) which reads, &ldquo;the continued established tenure of a person in a teaching position under an existing contract of employment, or...&rdquo;.  I asked whether this provision was appropriate, given that it would allow the Minister to provide that certain teachers should continue to be paid from the public purse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will confirm the position on Report Stage, if necessary.  I seem to recall from a briefing I received that there is a small diminishing category of persons who were admitted into teaching and have contracts of employment but who would no longer qualify for such contracts today.  However, they are still in good standing.  Therefore, it is to allow me to provide what would be described in another world as a grandfather clause to allow the established tenure of the persons concerned to continue so as to not put their existing contracts of <Col N="45"/>employment at risk.  This is a normal transitional clause when moving from one set of standards to another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>To assist the Minister, there were two other technical queries.  It appears a couple of words are missing in section 24(8) which begins with the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding the Act of&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept responsibility for this.  It  seems to be a drafting issue; the reference should be to &ldquo;a non registered teacher&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Forgive me for asking, but to whom was the Minister referring when he mentioned &ldquo;right-wing&rdquo; colleagues of Senator David Norris?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My right-wing colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Would the Minister care to enlighten us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>No one on this side of the House is saying the alternative should be to send children home if there is not a qualified teacher available.  Except in the case of one teacher schools, this should not be necessary.  Certainly, in the short term it should be possible for the other teachers in the school to fill in for a day or two.  I accept it may have been necessary to do this in the past when so many extra teachers were hired that it was difficult to find a qualified substitute.  If ever there was a time to commence section 30, this is it.  Given that there are so many unemployed qualified teachers, this is the wrong time to give statutory recognition to unqualified personnel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in the unusual position where I am less satisfied after hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I will explain the reason.  On the position of persons who have allowed their registrations to lapse, if this is a tactic to avoid being de-registered for reasons of bad behaviour, which is not likely, that would be a reason not to allow them to continue to teach.  Where a registration has lapsed, the Minister has made a reasonable point on the need to upskill.  However, I refer to someone who had taught successfully for a number of years but in respect of whom there had been a lapse of a year, during which time some minute question of upskilling might be raised.  I note such a person would still have a competence and a qualification in that area.  There can be no argument or the Minister has not advanced an argument that an unqualified person would be a better person to teach the children simply because a person&rsquo;s registration had been allowed to lapse.  Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy appears to disagree because an admonishing hand has been raised.</P>

	<P>That is fine.  It appears as though an opportunity is being missed to hire someone for whom a degree of upskilling has not been achieved at some level but who would be better than someone who was completely unqualified.  Why not let them teach?  While I may have completely misunderstood this provision, I seek clarification of this point.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In response to Senator Norris, for what it is worth I will add my tuppence-ha&rsquo;penny.  When the regulations stipulating that one was obliged to register with the Teaching Council were introduced a number of years ago &mdash; <i>mea culpa</i> &mdash; I was one of those <Col N="46"/>who forgot to re-register at the end of that year.  It simply was a time lapse as I was too busy in the classroom.  I also mentioned this point during the Second Stage debate last week but when I went to re-register, I was obliged to go through all the formalities again.  I was obliged to supply every single result of every university examination I had taken.  Moreover, I was obliged to undergo Garda vetting again after 22 years of teaching, which took a certain amount of time.  I rang the Teaching Council and asked why I was being obliged to do this.  I asked the reason I was being obliged to pay &euro;90 simply to be able to say I was a registered teacher.  This is the reason I welcome the change whereby the Teaching Council will have more power and will ensure the teaching quality is of the highest standard.  I agree we will have better and more compulsory professional development.  As for the business of registering as a teacher, one had a window within the first six months in which one could register without being obliged to produce any documentation.  However, if one failed to so do within that timeframe, one was obliged to go through the process of submitting all one&rsquo;s qualifications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will address my point to the Minister.  While the point raised by Senator Moran is an extremely good and important one, it is from the perspective of the teacher.  I am approaching the provision from the point of view of its value and benefit to the child.  Consequently, the Senator has not actually answered my question, although perhaps the Minister will do so.  I suggest children would be better off with a teacher who is qualified, even if he or she is not registered for some reason, like the case of the Senator, who obviously is a good teacher.  She has taught me a certain amount in the brief time we have spent together in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  She is a classic example of a qualified teacher who, by oversight or overwork or through the passage of time, can be left unregistered.  Such a person is completely qualified and there is nothing malicious or wrong in this lack of registration.  One should not deprive children of that qualification simply because registration has lapsed.  It is a technicality; it is a bureaucracy.  If such teachers re-register or give a pledge to so do, why not let the children have the benefit of a qualified teacher?  Is a qualified teacher not better than an unqualified teacher?  In circumstances in which it is possible, should children not have the benefit of such a qualified teacher if there is no other inhibiting or negative aspect?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>The distinction being made in this regard is the difference between a qualified teacher and a registered teacher.  A qualified teacher has all his or her qualifications but has not registered with the Teaching Council, whereas to be a registered member of the Teaching Council, one must be a qualified teacher.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>In circumstances in which a teacher is not registered or has let his or her registration lapse, he or she can still teach as an unqualified teacher.

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We have not discussed this issue.  Some Members are aware that the amendment refers to a requirement that someone acting on a temporary capacity in a school be subject to Garda vetting and clearance in accordance with standard practice for registered teachers.  There is a clear gap and if someone wishes to be registered, there should be a process to ensure children are protected.  Registered teachers should be subject to vetting.  It is possible that someone could continue to act in a temporary capacity in different schools without this provision.  I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This relates to a proposed new restriction on the hiring of retired teachers by schools.  I raised this issue when we discussed the legislation on Second Stage and there seems to be a particular problem in that despite the number of qualified young teachers who are unemployed, available and looking for work, schools are taking on retired teachers who have a full pension.  As Members noted last week, this may arise because of convenience as it is easier to pick up the telephone and call someone who used to work in the school or a friend of a teacher in a school.  It is wrong, especially in the current environment, as this stops young, qualified teachers from gaining the experience they need to get a permanent job.  It would be a positive step to insert this new requirement.  Retired teachers can still be hired before anyone who is unqualified would get the job but a school should only resort to hiring a retired teacher if it has taken every possible step to secure a young, unemployed teacher for a position.  I hope the Minister will adopt the same attitude that he took towards the last amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be interested in the Minister&rsquo;s reply as the question of hiring retired teachers has been raised previously.  As someone involved in the teaching profession, I know it is important to give people a chance.  I heard this matter being discussed on the wireless and the point was made that the hiring policy would only operate for a short period, and a change might not be of any significant advantage to young people.  On the other hand, any experience is beneficial and I am very happy to support Senator Power&rsquo;s amendment for that reason.  It is important to give young people an opportunity and prevent them from having to go abroad to seek work.  It is tragic that young people involved in so many professions now, including teaching, nursing and so on, should have to go abroad.  They would have received a very good education in the State, at least partially at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense.  If the amendment looks to have the desired effect, I ask the Minister to consider it positively.</P>

There is nothing worse in our current economic position than having a retired teacher who is on a pension and in receipt of a gratuity going back to the classroom and getting paid.  The only circumstances where a retired teacher should be in a classroom is in a voluntary capacity.  That may sound harsh but if such people wish to give of their service to help a school or community in further education, there should be a system where we can avail of the vast experience on a voluntary basis.  Under no circumstances should a retired teacher on a pension be remunerated.  I suggest that idea should percolate across the public service.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(14) The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 shall not apply to the dismissal of a person employed in a teaching position in a school where the dismissal follows directly from the cessation of the remuneration of that person out of monies provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment provides for the insertion of a subsection (14).  Where the Department declines to further remunerate an unregistered teacher and the school cannot pay the teacher, who may have a continuing contractual right of employment with the school, the school and the Department may be sued for unfair dismissal if the school is forced to dismiss the teacher.  Since the situation would be brought about by the Department of Education and Skills, the school should not be liable in the situation and it should be given immunity from suit by the teacher in question for unfair dismissal.  It is a reasonable amendment which I hope the Minister will favour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The provisions contained within the Bill prohibit the Department or vocational education committee from paying an individual who is employed in a school in the <Col N="53"/>place of a registered teacher in a post to be funded by the Oireachtas.  Effectively, the Senator&rsquo;s amendment would appear to insulate an employer from legal consequences of the dismissal of every teacher whose registration with the Teaching Council lapses.  That is a step too far and I will explain the reason.  The Bill does not provide for a direction to dismiss the employee.  That is primarily for two reasons.  First, most teachers are employed by the board of management of their school.  The relationship between the teacher and the Department is not one of employer for most purposes.  An exception to this is pay.  To provide that a person would be automatically dismissed from his or her job if not registered would require the Minister to interpose himself between the teacher and his or her employer, usually the school&rsquo;s board of management.  Therefore, section 30 is couched around a prohibition to pay salary if a person is not registered.</P>
        <P>Second, it may be the case that a person can register with the Teaching Council, possibly within a short space of time, therefore dismissing him or her from a teaching position would seem to be inappropriate and unfair.  I am not sure that it is likely that he or she would be employed for a minimum of two years.  If I am correct the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Acts do not take effect until after two years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not one year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but it is unlikely in that duration of time that a person would stay in the position as unregistered.  The most fundamental point as far as the Department and I are concerned is that we do not wish to confuse the employer-employee relationship, which would be the effect of incorporating the provision in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Why would it necessarily introduce that effect?  The proposal surely operates to the benefit of the school primarily and not the Department.  It does not import the notion that the Department is in the role of employer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is because we would be the third party.  We would cease the payment and become activated in the court on the basis that we had withdrawn money from someone on the basis that we had deemed that he or she would have to be dismissed because he or she was not qualified.  If one gives a person the right to invoke the Unfair Dismissals Acts one is embroiling the Department of Education and Skills for having terminated money because one was not a qualified or registered teacher.  A good lawyer such as Senator Mullen would conjoin not just the board of management but the Department as well.  We do not want to become involved in such cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendment provides that the legislation shall not apply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the very point I make, namely, that we do not want any connection being made with unfair dismissals legislation.  It is not necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not an implication that the unfair dismissals legislation shall apply anywhere.  It is a reassurance to schools that they shall not find themselves in an invidious position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I can return to the matter on Report Stage but the advice I have is that we do not want to specifically introduce a reference to other legislation that comes under the jurisdiction as it does not apply.  I put it to the Senator that his amendment is redundant.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It seems unfair that a school would have liability if someone had to be dismissed solely because the Department would not pay them.

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would also welcome an explanatory note because it seems that there could be a question of fairness at stake.

	<P>I thank the Minister for accepting some of the amendments tabled.  It is probably the first time it has happened in this Seanad.  It is welcome and constructive.  I wish to make a point about a teacher who is pregnant at the time she is dismissed.  The Unfair Dismissals Acts apply in cases where someone has been employed for less than a year implying that legal issues could arise if a person is pregnant.  Has that situation been considered?  In light of the fact that many primary school teachers in particular are women, perhaps it is an issue that could arise from time to time.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 10, to delete lines 32 to 37.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Perhaps amendments Nos. 43 and 44 should have been discussed together because the point is an overall one in that the provision in the Bill relating to the registration of teachers seems to be overly prescriptive for primary legislation.  In practical terms, it appears to make it impossible for a person to apply for a renewal of registration in circumstances in which he or she is abroad for employment purposes and so on.  Under the proposed section 33(2), the council is authorised to make regulations generally.  It would be better if these matters were thrashed out in discussions on the regulations.  Since the previous amendment concerned the holding of discussions with interest groups, I am sorry I did not ask for the amendments to be discussed together.  When debating earlier sections, we discussed the need for people not to be precluded simply because they happened to be abroad when their registrations lapsed.  The council should think through the implications properly and not be so prescriptive.  It might reach the same conclusions, but not tying the matter down in primary legislation would allow for the implications to be considered first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Averil Power&rsquo;s amendment seems to make a good deal of sense, as subsection (4) is unnecessarily rigid.  It is good to be flexible.  The example given was <Col N="56"/>that of a person on holidays for a few days, who was ill or experiencing a family emergency and so on.  It is possible that matters such as registering can be overlooked for a short period.  Therefore, the provision appears to be rigid and as such, a certain degree of flexibility should be allowed in these matters.  Perhaps the Minister might undertake to consider the issue and revert to us with a reason on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Subject to confirmation, I understand the Teaching Council has been consulted on this issue, but I will take on board the spirit of the Senator&rsquo;s comments.  These days, one can apply online, regardless of where one is.  For example, one could use an Internet caf&eacute;.</P>

	<P>If one is computer literate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check, but my understanding is that the Teaching Council was consulted on the matter.  Given that the Senator has raised the issue, we will have an opportunity to revert to the House on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In the old days one was automatically sent a reminder concerning one&rsquo;s driving licence and so on.  For example, if one is like me and has a ten year driving licence, one does not remember having applied for the licence on 4 July or whatever the date was ten years ago.  Would it be possible for a reminder to be sent?  If so, people would have no excuse and Senator Averil Power and I would have little sympathy for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>It is welcome that the Minister will consider some of these points and revert to the House on Report Stage.  I urge him to consider the &euro;90 charge for registering with the Teaching Council.  It is a large amount if a teacher does not find a job.  There should be a means of reclaiming at least a portion of this amount if someone does not secure gainful employment after six months.  This is the least we could do for qualified teachers who cannot find jobs and are in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that the Teaching Council maintains the practice that Senator David Norris advocated, in that it sends reminders.  Considering the matter again, therefore, would be unnecessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>If I understand the spirit of Senator Martin Conway&rsquo;s comments, it is a matter for the Teaching Council which represents 60,000 teachers.  We should not prescribe in primary law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a certain sympathy for what Senator Averil Power is trying to do.  In the legal profession, while one remains a registered solicitor, one can be defined as practising or non-practising.  When the Teaching Council introduces potentially onerous requirements in terms of continuing professional development, CPD, further education and so forth, it may be an issue for younger teachers, in particular, who find themselves abroad for a <Col N="57"/>period and are not in a position to participate in such courses.  The matter should be given further consideration to take these requirements into account.  Perhaps a soft period might be allowed for those who are unable to comply with the requirements within certain timeframes, particularly where CPD is concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Teaching Council will undoubtedly be monitoring this debate, but I will bring the matter to its attention.  In my profession there is a category of unemployed or retired architects.  The same applies in other professions.  One&rsquo;s qualifications are not in any way invalidated but one&rsquo;s income status, to which Senator Martin Conway referred, is registered.  The Teaching Council will make its own decision and I am not in a position to direct it regarding minutiae, nor would I want to do so.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as an deis seo a labhairt ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo anocht.  I will be brief and, with some leeway from the Cathaoirleach, will contribute again when the Minister concludes.  </P>
        <P>It was suggested to me locally, including at a meeting at which Government Deputies were present, that as a matter of policy the Minister for Education and Skills did not visit schools and that as such, there was no point in even inviting him to the school in which the meeting was being held.  Subsequently, I heard second hand that the same issue had arisen for another school.  Is there such a policy and, if so, what is the rationale for it and will it be continued?  After I have heard the Minister&rsquo;s remarks, I might respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The tradition is for the Minister for Education and Skills to be invited to open a new school.  However, I hold the view that a community should celebrate a new school&rsquo;s opening &mdash; possibly the continuation of a school tradition &mdash; by inviting a prominent person from that community.  It reflects a centrist attitude among schools that their only relationship is with the Department of Education and Skills.  Furthermore, some of my predecessors spent a considerable amount of time visiting schools for no particular benefit in the sense of not being present in the Department to progress legislation and the necessary works that required ministerial involvement.  We have a sizable reform programme that requires a great deal of time and attention.  This is my priority, but I have not, as a matter of policy, decided that I will not visit schools.  The record will show that I have visited a number.</P>
        <P>I have a diary meeting once a week and it takes me an hour and a half to go through all of the requests received to visit schools, attend functions or engage in other activities, some of which relate to education remotely, while some are centrally related, for example, meeting groups involved in education.  I visit schools, attend functions and engage in other types of activity, some of it remotely related to education and other elements of it centrally related to education, including meeting groups involved in education.  I have to ration my time as best I can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Minister&rsquo;s comments.  However, what he said makes liars of various rural Deputies who say, when requests are made indirectly through them, that the Minister does not visit schools.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he does visit schools and that he has not visited as many as he would like.  I put it to him that it is crucial that he visits a reasonable number of schools and that he is aware of what is happening on the ground.  </P>
        <P>Several smaller schools are anxious that the Minister visit them to see how they operate.  That would be beneficial.  The special school in Navan which was keen on a visit by the Minister <Col N="59"/>was told that he does not visit schools.  I was present when that was told to them by a Deputy.  I will inform them of what the Minister had to say today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As correctly stated by the Minister, it is important in developing national policy, that practical knowledge be applied.  It is a big occasion for a community when a Minister for education visits a school.  I recall a former Minister,  Ms Gemma Hussey, visiting the primary school I attended, while the former Minister, Mrs. Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, visited the secondary school I attended.  I encourage the Minister to visit as many schools as possible.  I thank him for his clarification on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I visit some schools.  I do not want the impression conveyed that I have made a liar out of anybody.  I could spend three days a week visiting schools.  How do I decide which schools to visit?  I do not see my function as one of visiting schools, except where doing so is necessary or appropriate.  I have on occasion been asked to visit a school and open a new extension and have referred such invitation to a senior party or Government colleague from the constituency concerned, which I believe is appropriate.  In so far as this applies, that will continue to be my policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for coming to the House to take this Adjournment matter.  There has been much speculation and discussion on the decision to cut career guidance teacher numbers.  I would like to come at this issue from a different slant.  There are several secondary schools in my constituency with between 200 and 300 pupils.  As such, they do not have the magic 500 required to have a dedicated career guidance counsellor.  In recent few weeks, I have spoken to a number of part-time career guidance counsellors about this decision.  Some of them divide their time between career guidance and teaching in the classroom.  In other words, they provide career guidance for 11 hours and teach in the classroom for a further 11 hours, which is the ideal scenario in terms of career guidance.</P>
        <P>It is important that career guidance counsellors are involved in teaching for a number of hours but are available to students to assist on issues such as completion of CAO forms and so on.  Also, career guidance offers teachers an opportunity to engage on a one-to-one basis with students with whom they could not engage in a classroom setting.  One of the career guidance counsellors to whom I spoke told me that while previously she engaged in career guidance-teaching on a 50:50 basis, as a result of this cut she would only provide three hours of career guidance.  This means it will only be possible to work in a classroom environment and there will be no one-to-one intervention into the future, which causes me some concern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like many of my colleagues, I did not benefit from career guidance when I was at school.  The one-to-one approach is extremely important.  Removal of this service means vulnerable students will fall through the cracks.  Students whose families can afford to retain professional career guidance will have choices, options and contacts in terms of their aspirations to attend college and so on.  The last thing we want &mdash; I am sure the Minister will agree &mdash;  is for the most vulnerable in our society to suffer as a result of this cut.  This will force school managers to concentrate on the core subjects and career guidance will be an addition, if possible.  It will not be a necessary centre plank of second level education.  I accept that reform in this area was needed and that there are probably better ways of providing this service than has been the case up to now.  I do not believe telling schools this service must now be provided out of budget is the right way to go.  This will force school managers trying to compete with the current points system to kick career guidance down the line.  The brightest always seem to shine and set the <Col N="60"/>agendas within the classroom, leaving the vulnerable students at the back of the classroom, who possibly do not come from a background which instilled confidence in them, to fall through the cracks.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate the Senator's remarks.  We are in the difficult situation of having to reduce our expenditure, a message that must be repeated on a daily basis as people tend to forget it.  In looking at reduction of resources in the secondary school sector I was faced with the option of disimproving the general pupil-teacher ratio.  What persuaded me against that was that, unlike in the primary school sector, such a reduction could result in the loss of a language or science teacher in a particular school, in schools with enrolments of between 250 and 400 as against those with a complement of 1,000 pupils, which is the proposed benchmark in terms of resource or second teachers.  In an effort to have minimum impact on total activity in the secondary school, I felt absorbing guidance counsellors into the general allocation of teachers would have a better negative impact &mdash; if that is not a contradiction in terms &mdash; than would disimproving the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
        <P>Some 42% of 730 secondary schools do not have a dedicated guidance teacher.  There is a requirement on all secondary schools, through the Education Act 1998, to provide for guidance and we will issue a circular to deal with that in a specific way.  I take the Senator&rsquo;s point in respect of guidance, given the difficult times we are in and from what I have learned from guidance counsellors prior to and since this decision was taken, namely, that the pastoral care element of the service as distinct from career guidance has sadly but increasingly become necessary because of the change in Irish society.  The whole school community and subject teacher have responsibilities in this regard.  Young people reflect the stresses and strains of home and are affected by family breakdown, loss of employment and the tensions which can occur within a family from time to time.  A professional teacher will pick up fairly quickly on any changes in the performance in the classroom of students who are normally good at mathematics, English, Irish or whatever.  The person in question may not seek the help of a guidance counsellor in a pastoral sense.  Many teachers engaged in teaching a classroom subject will find themselves engaged in some form of pastoral care.  Where a serious matter arises, it can be addressed by the principals and deputy principals.  I had to make a choice, which I made based on advice.  I know this decision has caused some concern among guidance counsellors.  However, I assured the representatives with whom I met that the circular which will issue to schools between now and commencement of the next academic year will draw the attention of schools to their obligations under the Education Act 1998.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is important that schools are reminded of their responsibilities under the Education Act 1998.    I come from a rural area four hours from Dublin and one hour from Galway and Limerick.  Children going to school in cities and their commuter belts tend to be better informed.  While teachers have expertise in their own fields, if the career guidance element ceases to be a priority, the broad church of knowledge which a career guidance teacher or counsellor is required to possess will be compromised.</P>
        <P>I do not question the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides.  Before the general election he told a Teachers Union of Ireland conference that the country was broke.  He was right and we must repeat this every day.  Like him, I am trying to achieve the fairest and best outcome for eveyone.  I look forward to seeing his circular and its impact in due course.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Baineann an r&uacute;n seo le Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, MFG, Teo.  Seo comhlacht p&aacute;irtn&eacute;ireachta a bh&iacute; ag cur seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtacha ar f&aacute;il do phobal na Gaeltachta, go h&aacute;irithe na cl&aacute;ir &eacute;ags&uacute;la a bh&iacute; ar si&uacute;l acu cos&uacute;il le cl&aacute;r Leader, Regional Development Programme, agus an cl&aacute;r &aacute;iti&uacute;il, Local Development Social Inclusion Programme, LDSIP.  Chuir an comhlacht c&uacute;rsa&iacute; tr&eacute;an&aacute;la i bhfeidhm chomh maith.  Is &iacute; an sc&eacute;im is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute;, i mo thuairim, an ceann a cuireadh ar f&aacute;il faoi sc&eacute;im Leader, mar go raibh an Ghaeltacht in ann bunt&aacute;iste a fh&aacute;il as an sc&eacute;im sin go sonrach nuair a bh&iacute; s&iacute; i bhfeidhm.</P>
        <P>Ar an drochuair, n&iacute;l MFG ann n&iacute;os m&oacute;.  Ar 7 Me&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair anuraidh, rinne bord MFG cinneadh deireadh a chur leis an chomhlacht de bharr impleachta&iacute; tr&aacute;d&aacute;la agus de bhr&iacute; go raibh deacrachta&iacute; ag an chomhlacht f&eacute;in.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute; pobal na Gaeltachta ag cailleadh amach anois.  T&aacute; s&eacute; beagnach c&uacute;ig mh&iacute; &oacute; ghlach bord MFG an cinneadh deireadh a chur leis an chomhlacht.</P>
        <P>MFG was a partnership company, like Louth Leader Partnership or Donegal Local Development Company Limited.  It provided excellent services.  It had staff employed and was administering Leader funds, the only funds available to many small businesses and community organisations.  Since the board of MFG Teoranta decided to wind down on 7 September last year, no services are being provided and no Leader funds are going into the Donegal Gaeltacht because no administration structure is in place.  It is now almost five months since it wound down, yet no alternative mechanism or administration process has been put in place to allow the transfer of Leader funds to Gaeltacht projects.  As a result, the Gaeltacht is losing out.</P>
        <P>I raise this matter in order to find out what progress has been made on the establishment of a new Gaeltacht partnership company located in the Gaeltacht and what opportunities will be available to the former staff of MFG or others who could be employed in the new partnership company.  Does the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have alternative solutions to the problem which has been ongoing for five months?  The people of the Gaeltacht want Leader funds to be made available to projects.  Leader funds available from 2007 to 2013 under Pillar ll of the Common Agricultural Policy amount to more than &euro;5 billion and it is not fair that in the past five or six months Gaeltacht projects have been losing out.</P>
        <P>The rural transport service is also losing out.  Some operators in Gaeltacht areas were not paid before the company wound up.  They are owed substantial amounts of money and unable to find out if they will ever see the money they are owed, even though it was paid by the Health Service Executive to MFG Teoranta which is now in liquidation.  There must be some obligation on the Government to step in and resolve the issue, to end the uncertainty and pay those who are owed money.  They include the former staff of MFG who have, to date, received only the statutory redundancy payment from the Department of Social Protection.  They have not, as yet, received any redundancy payment from the company.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will have some news for us because this issue has been ongoing for far too long.  I understand there are legal and technical difficulties, but they must be resolved and Leader funds restored to Gaeltacht communities which are losing out.</P>

T&aacute; an freagra as B&eacute;arla, ach <Col N="62"/>cuirfidh m&eacute; Gaeilge ar an ch&eacute;ad chuid de, m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir liom.  Comhlacht &aacute;iti&uacute;il do Ghaeltachta&iacute; is ea Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teoranta, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r do Ghaeltachta&iacute; ins na contaetha seo a leanas, Corca&iacute;, Ciarra&iacute;, D&uacute;n na nGall, Gaillimh, Maigh Eo, an Mh&iacute; agus Port L&aacute;irge.</P>
        <P>MFG was an independent company with its own board of management and memorandum and articles of association which had responsibility under company law for the proper stewardship of the company.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has no role in the internal operations of local development-partnership companies.  However, MFG was under contract to the Department and operated a number of programmes both for it and other Departments.  Programmes delivered by it for it included rural walkways, the rural development programme, RDP, Leader, and the local and community development programme, LCDP.  MFG ceased trading on 7 September 2011 and is going though a company liquidation process.</P>
        <P>We understand the difficulty the recent dissolution of the company presents for the staff and project promoters in Gaeltacht areas.  However, it is incumbent on the Minister and the Department to ensure any solution arrived at will ensure the continued effective delivery of services in Gaeltacht areas previously supplied by the company.  Such services must be delivered in the most efficient manner possible and in compliance with all legal obligations, including national and EU obligations.</P>
        <P>No final decisions have been made on an alternative delivery mechanism for RDP support in Gaeltacht areas.  When determining alternative delivery mechanisms for the RDP and other programmes, there are complex legal and contractual issues to be resolved.  The Department is considering both long and short-term solutions to allow the continued delivery of the RDP and other programmes in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that significant progress is being made.  All relevant RDP, Leader, project files have been released by the liquidator and are now with the Department and all project promoters will be contacted shortly.  The Department has had discussions with the European Commission and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the RDP and is working with them to ensure any solutions will be regulatory compliant.  It is the intention of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to find a solution that will be efficient and effective and applied at the earliest possible opportunity.  All relevant stakeholders will be notified once a suitable solution is determined.</P>

    <sTitle>Rent Supplement Payments</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My query relates to the payment of rent allowance directly to persons in receipt of social welfare benefits.  This system was changed a number of years ago in order that landlords would no longer receive the rent allowance and that it would be paid directly to social welfare recipients.  I have received information from a number of agents that recipients of rent allowance are telling their landlords that their rent allowance has been cut.  Of course, landlords are hearing on radio that all manner of cuts have been imposed.  The landlord and the agent will often reduce the rent for the social welfare recipient but the social welfare recipient has overstated the amount of the reduction in his social welfare allowance and he is pocketing an extra few bob from social welfare.  This is the reason I have raised this matter and I ask if it would be possible to revert to the old system whereby the landlord is paid directly by the Department and in this way the amount of the allowance would be known.  The landlord would be paid the rent payable in that particular social welfare area.  I know the Minister&rsquo;s office has conducted research on rent payments.  An agent contacted the Department of Social Protection office in Tralee and pointed out what was happening in reality, that people in receipt of social welfare payments were receiving the allowance and were telling the landlord that the <Col N="63"/>allowance had been cut in order that they could obtain a reduction in the rent of &euro;20 to &euro;40, while the allowance might have been cut by a mere &euro;15.  In such a case, the landlord will have reduced the rent substantially but the guy has a profit of &euro;15 a week or a month.  This is happening in many towns and I know it is happening in the Kenmare area where landlords are being told that allowances have been cut and that they should cut the rent by &euro;50 in some cases.  The recipient is then profiting.  The form should be signed by the landlord detailing the rent amount and this should be sent directly to the social welfare agent in charge of the case file.  There are a number of anomalies in the system.  The rent is now not paid directly to the landlord but there is a lot of money being wasted which could be used elsewhere by the Department rather than landlords and their agents reducing the rent to social welfare recipients and people making money out of the difference.  I suggest the Minister should revert to the previous system whereby the money would be paid directly to the landlord.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support for eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The scheme is intended as a temporary income support payment and is not designed to be a medium to long-term housing support or a permanent solution to a person&rsquo;s housing needs.</P>
        <P>Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant who in turn makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the current arrangements, even with direct payment, landlords must collect the tenant contribution towards the rent, a minimum of &euro;120 per month.  The amount of rent supplement payable depends on the tenant&rsquo;s income.  In some cases tenants pay only the minimum contribution while in other cases tenants make an additional contribution to their rent based on their financial circumstances.  For example, where a person is in part-time employment and receives just 10% of his or her rent directly from the State, the landlord would receive the 10% directly while collecting the 90% from the tenant.  Account will be taken of cases where a tenant is in a lease agreement which has a number of months to go before cessation.  While tenants will be expected to try to renegotiate their rent, where this is not possible payments at the old rate may continue.  However, once the lease has expired the tenant will be expected to find suitable accommodation at or below the new limits in force.</P>
        <P>If the Department were to become involved in the negotiations of rental agreements directly with landlords, the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 96,000 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.  There are no plans to amend the scheme so that rent supplement is the entitlement of the landlord.</P>
        <P>It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short-term need who generally enter the scheme with an existing tenancy agreement in place and leave again when they re-enter the workforce.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be aware that the Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long-term reliance on rent supplement.  The rental accommodation scheme is in operation since 2004 and the new housing policy initiative was announced on 16 June 2011 by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning.  Both initiatives give the local authorities <Col N="64"/>specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement.  Latest figures show that since its inception, over 37,700 rent supplement tenancies have now been transferred from rent supplement to the rental accommodation scheme and other social housing options.</P>
