	<P>I have notice from Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to clarify that the funding currently in existence and being paid to community development projects will remain directly payable to them in future even though it will be going through the county integrated structures.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the plans she has for a national plan for rare diseases.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A number of weeks ago, there were requests from both sides of the House for a debate on women&rsquo;s participation in public life in Ireland following the very successful report in which Senator Bacik was involved.  We asked for a debate this week given that yesterday was International Women&rsquo;s Day.  I ask the Leader if that debate can take place as soon as possible.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ensure we have that debate today because it is relevant.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I got an e-mail, as I am sure many Members did, from a mother of two from Letterkenny who is also a businesswoman.  She started her own business two years ago.  I am sure many Members will have read the e-mail which made for very distressing reading.  The woman states: &ldquo;Today I write in total desolation and in desperation of any hope for me, my family and my business.&rdquo;  She writes that when she sought to have a moratorium on her mort<Col N="372"/>gage extended by her bank, she was refused and her food money now goes to Ulster Bank.  She then describes being refused an overdraft from Allied Irish Banks and refers to a number of other banks in her e-mail.  It is distressing to note that when the woman sought advice from the money advice and budgeting service the advice she was given &mdash; she may have been summarising &mdash; was to close her business and go on the dole.  The sentiments expressed in this e-mail reflect the anger, despair and hopelessness felt by many people.  The systematic failure of the Government to be accountable to citizens has given rise to a widespread sense of rage.</P>
        <P>On child care, in May 2009 the Minister of State with responsibility for children announced the establishment of an independent review group to examine child deaths.  Last night, he announced the establishment of a further review group.  Where is the leadership, responsibility and accountability in government when life and death issues are treated in this manner?  There is no accountability to the Houses for the death in care of 20 young people and the inadequacies in the foster care system.</P>
        <P>A few months ago, when the House debated foster care, many Senators placed on record the inadequacies of the foster care system.  Do such debates mean anything when information such as that published in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>at the weekend emerges subsequently?  The Minister should come to the House to state the position accurately and honestly.</P>
        <P>The lack of responsibility to citizens is also evident the banking sector and we see it in today&rsquo;s disturbing statement by the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, on the report on the lost at sea scheme.  The Ombudsman believes her work has been compromised.  I call for an opportunity to debate her report in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can raise these matters if the House debates the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ombudsman indicated she believes these Houses are not able to do their work, as was clear from the decision to ignore the recommendations of her report.  I could say much more about the widespread anger caused by Government lack of responsibility in these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning, I circulated to the Cathaoirleach a proposal that the Order of Business be amended and that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the following motion be taken as No. 1 on today&rsquo;s business or, failing that, added to today&rsquo;s business: &ldquo;That the Broadcasting Act 2009 (Section 33) Levy Order 2010 [S.I. No. 7 of 2010] be and is hereby annulled.&rdquo;  The broadcasting industry and local radio stations are on their uppers, having lost 30% and in some cases in excess of 50% of income.  Advertising has declined and jobs are being lost.  Surely the House would not divide on this issue as I believe Senators on the Government side share my view on it.  While I have no interest, one way or another, in this matter, it should be debated in the House.</P>
        <P>I ask for the Leader&rsquo;s view on my amendment.  The matter is urgent because the relevant order was signed on 22 January and will enter into force, unless annulled by either side, within 21 days.  The 21-day period will elapse tomorrow night.  I concede that we could discuss the issue tomorrow if a procedural difficulty arises with taking it today.  I am not trying to be awkward.  The introduction of the levy will result in further job losses and cutbacks in local radio stations.   On that basis, I propose my amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1926 which prohibits licensed premises from opening on Good Friday.  As public representatives and legislators, we must examine the reason pubs and restaurants cannot sell drink on Good Friday.  Was this prohibition introduced in the interests of the State or to meet the needs of the churches?  We need to know where we stand <Col N="373"/>on this issues.  Amending the legislation to allow licensed premises to open on Good Friday, especially in Limerick for the match between Munster and Leinster, would be a win-win scenario.  I want to make clear what we would be doing in changing the legislation.  I am not having a go at any church or believer, but if we were to change the legislation, the net effect would be that while churchgoers and believers could abstain from alcohol on Good Friday on the direction of their church, meanwhile atheists, agnostics, sceptics, heretics and others could imbibe should they wish to do so.</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious matter.  Everyone would be a winner and free will would prevail.  The separation of church and State would be maintained and we would render unto Munster the things that are Munster&rsquo;s and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Senator&rsquo;s first proposal amounts to a formal motion which was only tabled today and, therefore, does not comply with Standing Order 26 in terms of notice, it is not in order as an amendment to the Order of Business.  As Cathaoirleach, I am not prepared to accept it on such short notice.  It will be circulated today and included in the Order Paper tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will not challenge the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling but on a point of order, I understand that, even though I said, &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders,&rdquo; it is still unacceptable.  Is that the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should put a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business, calling for a debate today on women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  The Leader promised us such a debate this week.  As yesterday was International Women&rsquo;s Day, it would be timely to have such a debate this week.  As the House is well aware, last October the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights produced a unanimous all-party report on improving women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  The report contains a number of important recommendations and the committee has requested that both Houses of the Oireachtas debate it.  I ask the Leader to ensure we will have that debate in this House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, is committed to participating in it and anxious that it be held.  It was promised for this week, in particular, because of International Women&rsquo;s Day.  It will be an historic debate in that the issue has never been debated on the floor of either House of the Oireachtas.  The committee will be debating the report tomorrow in recognition of International Women&rsquo;s Day, but it is a pity the Seanad is not doing so today.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for a change in the law to allow licensed premises to open on Good Friday.  It is an anomaly that we do not allow them to open on that day.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="374"/>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Christmas Day?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an anomaly; I see the Leader is agreeing with me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am absolutely not agreeing with the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am sorry; I thought he was nodding in agreement.  In 2010 it is no longer acceptable that we are holding to a quaint notion that Good Friday is a day on which alcohol cannot be consumed.  I am not saying we should have drunkenness on the streets.  However, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, let those of us who do not believe Good Friday is a particularly special day choose to do what we want to do in pubs and clubs.  In particular, given the match to be held in Munster on that date, it shows up the pointlessness of the provision.  It is not so quaint when one looks at the bigger picture.  On &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; this morning the issue arose of trainee teachers having to learn how to teach religion.  Religious education is a compulsory subject on the curriculum at our teacher training colleges, six of which are controlled by the Catholic Church, while one is a Church of Ireland establishment.  The latter can give preference in its admission policies to Church of Ireland applicants.  That is also anomalous in this day and age.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I seek a debate on initiatives to improve literacy and reading.  I congratulate Dublin City Council and the organisers of the Dublin book festival which has just finished its three-day run at City Hall on Dame Street.  The premises were transformed by book stalls, poetry and book readings and even a caf&eacute;.  It was very welcome to see the event which attracted large numbers of people.  It is the kind of initiative we should be supporting in this House because it is a way of engaging people in improving literacy levels and reading skills among children and adults alike.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Senators missed out last Thursday but are present today.  I call Senator Mullen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the raising of the issue of the closure of pubs on Good Friday.  It would be useful to have a debate on such issues, especially in light of a recent speech by the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, in which he reflected on the type of model Ireland should adopt in its search for pluralism.  He considered whether we should go for the complete 1789 separation of church and State or whether we should go for something that is more inclusive and respectful of different traditions while at the same time acknowledging the proper distinctions between church and State.  I would shed no tears if there was a change in this law, yet I wonder whether we would lose something, particularly considering how Ash Wednesday is very successfully used by religious and non-religious alike to promote abstention from smoking and making an effort in that area.  Something good can be achieved by drawing on the tradition of Good Friday.  I know people with no particular religious faith who, for example, sometimes give up something for Lent in solidarity with a sick relative or for some such reason.  We should not re-fight the culture wars over this issue.  We should have a debate, but we should also be mindful of the value of traditions and their potential to contribute to people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Senator Bacik.  I support the Church of Ireland as a minority which seeks to ensure its particular tradition is reflected and that there is access to teacher training for members of its community.  This access demonstrates a valuable respect for a minority in our society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of International Women's Day, I draw attention to a stirring article in <i>The Economist</i> entitled &ldquo;Gendercide&rdquo;.  Some 100 million women have gone missing in the world as <Col N="375"/>a result of abortion or infanticide because of sex selection policies, especially in China and India.  I am concerned that the women&rsquo;s movement has lost sight of this.  I am concerned that its members are almost nervous to question the choice of killing a born or unborn female child lest they blaspheme at the altar of choice at which they are supposed to worship.  I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House and inform us of what the Government is doing to raise this troubling issue in international fora.  This is as important as any other human rights abuse in any other part of the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Would it be possible for the Leader to arrange an early debate on the retail sector?  As everybody is no doubt aware, the retail sector, like many other sectors, is facing a crisis, nowhere more so than in the Border area where the sector is challenged by the different VAT rate in the North, a lower minimum wage and 25% of a differential in the currency exchange rate.  In that debate I would like to call on the Government to introduce a scheme to offer subvention directly to retailers in the six Border counties on their commercial rates.  We cannot reduce VAT rates specifically for the Border counties or compensate them for the currency differential or allow them pay a lower minimum wage, but we could provide tangible benefits to retailers to help them price themselves into the market.  We could, for example, give them a 30% reduction in their commercial rates.  This could be reimbursed to the local authorities in question through the local government fund by Government.  This would not be a significant amount, but it would provide support to the retailers of the Border counties who are struggling.  This would be particularly worthwhile in view of the tens of thousands of people employed in the sector.  I call for this debate and ask the Leader to raise the issue with the senior Ministers.  The situation in the Border counties is severe and I urge the Leader to call for innovative action such as that I have outlined in terms of subvention on commercial rates.</P>
        <P>While on the subject of the retail sector, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge Senator Feargal Quinn and the series which begins today on RTE, &ldquo;Retail Therapy&rdquo;, in which he gives of his expertise to try to help retailers in trouble throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that the situation is very severe in the Border counties and I ask that innovative action be taken such as that I have outlined regarding commercial rates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate today to wish the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, well in his retirement from political life.  I particularly wish him improved health.  I was glad to be on hand when the door fell off his helicopter in flight last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a question, of course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is past tense now.  The Senator did a great job on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has had his ups and downs.  We revived him with tea on that occasion as he was shattered, which was understandable.</P>
        <P>In Killarney we have the fine departmental office of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, and now that the Minister is retiring I will be taking a keen interest in the future of that office and how, perhaps, the Government proposes to break up the Department, as we have been hearing so much about.</P>
        <P>I need not stress the importance of Killarney.  The club in which we revived the Minister that day will, as the Leader knows, be hosting this year&rsquo;s Irish Open golf tournament at the end of July, to which everybody here is welcome, and more besides.  We want to boost tourism, which <Col N="376"/>has been suffering to such an extent.  I look forward to hearing from the Leader with regard to the Government&rsquo;s plans for the future of the Department.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on the levy order for radio broadcasters, which is a disaster and is threatening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have ruled on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling; I am just supporting Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments.  I hope the issue will be on tomorrow&rsquo;s Order Paper for discussion.  We do not want to invite more job losses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will have an opportunity to speak on this tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about the threat of job losses.  I am looking at Senator Mooney, a man who knows better than most the importance of radio, particularly local radio.  The Leader is aware of my interest, but we all share the same view on that.  I look forward to hearing the Leader&rsquo;s comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the points raised about amending the Intoxicating Liquor Act in order to bring it into line with today&rsquo;s thinking.  Of course we must be aware of Good Friday.  As someone who grew up with the values of Good Friday, I feel it is possible to accommodate both points of view, maintaining the values of Good Friday while allowing pubs to open for large events such as the planned rugby match, as well as hotels in the area.  I echo the points raised in this regard.</P>
        <P>Also mentioned was the issue of women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  I agree that we should have had that discussion before.  Ideally, we should have it this week, but I realise it will not be possible to snap our fingers and get the Minister in at short notice to have it today.  I listened to a radio discussion the other day on the points raised and, while I may not be agreeable to the list system or the quota system, having jumped many hurdles on my own and never got a leg up in any sense of the word&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Senator herself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I would certainly not want to go down the road of the quota system.</P>
        <P>The issue of grade inflation in schools and universities was mentioned last week.  In view of the planned meetings of the education unions around Easter, perhaps that would be a good time to discuss more fundamental issues.  Why do young people entering third level institutions not have a more rounded education?  They may have engaged in rote learning, obtained their points and achieved success.  I ask that this be kept on the agenda.  We should have a discussion on curricular reform and other fundamental issues in education.  We do not need to discuss grade inflation; that comes afterwards.  The issue is the roundedness of young people and how they move from A to B to C.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I too received the letter Senator Fitzgerald received from the woman in Letterkenny.  I replied to it straight away because of the note of despair in it.  I am not surprised that people feel like this on a day, for example, when one of the main banks reported losses of &euro;3 billion but rewarded its directors, apparently proportionately, with bonuses of &euro;3 million.  One person honourably refused to take it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the controversy regarding Good Friday, I am sorry this has happened and I call into question the decision of the rugby authorities.  It is outrageous to schedule such a match <Col N="377"/>on Good Friday.  I am old enough to remember when Sunday was a day that was reverenced in this country.  Now it is the largest commercial day because we are lackeys of the British multinationals.</P>

	<P>That is not just a religious position, although I take a religious position.  It is good for people to have a day of rest.  Sunday in Dublin was a beautiful day and I know that many employees of stores in Dublin and across the country are forced to work.  I certainly do not join this populist rush to say we should open pubs and desecrate Good Friday.  I have one other point.  I am very concerned at receiving material from the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, indicating that she asked that her special report on the lost at sea scheme be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  That was defeated in a D&aacute;il vote along party lines, which was an astonishing subversion of democracy.  I am not prejudging the issue, although it seems that certain applicants did not get the compensation that many feel they should.  That issue is not for us to decide but what concerns us is the decision not to refer the report to the appropriate committee for decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out in the discussion held in the Seanad that there was no finality and there was a gap in the legislation.  I express my concern on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers, I wish to raise with the Leader the question of the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  I am very much in favour of keeping the <i>status quo</i>.  I am quite mindful that we have pluralism in this country but notwithstanding that, when in Rome we do as the Romans do.  If we went to the UK or Denmark and there was a jubilee for the monarch, we would show respect for that.  It is not too much to ask that we would show respect for Good Friday and request that the match between Munster and Leinster be put on a different day.  That is not to ask too much and it would show respect for the day and responsibility in the use of alcohol and liquor.  There are only two such days in the year.  I respectfully suggest it is essential for us to show respect and responsibility in the consumption of alcohol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions for the Leader.  The former Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, got &euro;100,000 in disappointment money when he resigned his Cabinet post.  I was struck yesterday in seeing six mothers on International Women&rsquo;s Day who wanted me to highlight a particular case.  They are flood victims and are disappointed not to have yet received one penny in aid.  I am looking for the Leader&rsquo;s help on this as both he and I know about the humanitarian aid being made available for flood victims.  None of them has received any insurance money.</P>
        <P>These people are being discouraged in applying for humanitarian aid because they have been told it will be means-tested and people will not qualify.  That is fundamentally unfair as these people did not cause the floods.  They are now paying two electricity and heating bills and I ask the Leader to intervene personally and speak to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, and see that these people get their fair share of humanitarian aid as a matter of urgency.  These people are feeling let down by the Government.</P>
        <P>There is a crisis in child protection in this country.  Why are children dying in care from non-natural causes?  What is going on in the country?  These children have been failed once by their parents and families and they are now being failed by the State.  Children are disappearing from care and there is no national outrage.  It does not make sense.  The Minister of State with <Col N="378"/>responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, must come in to explain to the House the deficiencies and problems in care.  Is it a problem with staff?  The fundamental issue is that 14 children have died of non-natural causes so what is the problem and what is going on?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>As a vintner I can reflect on the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  To take Senator Bacik&rsquo;s argument to its natural conclusion, it seems we should also be open on Christmas Day.  I, for one, would not like to ask my staff to come in on Christmas Day.  We must modulate the argument and the discussion should not take place in the context of a sporting event.  The confluence of sport and alcohol is most unfortunate in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a debate we should have but not in terms of maximising the value of a sporting event.  I agree with Senator Norris as it would be disruptive to a day I enjoy as quiet and meditative.  That is my choice.  I am of the view that the event in question will impinge on that choice.  It is worth engaging in a debate on this matter.  However, it is most unfortunate that it will take place in the context of a sporting event.  As a vintner, I understand the pressure on people to meet targets and make their businesses work.</P>
        <P>I support most, if not all, of what Senator MacSharry said in respect of retailing.  There is a need for a review of the burden local government financing places on the business sector.  I am of the view that this burden must be spread.  The relevant Minister is giving active consideration to this matter, in the context of the various options that ought to be available, and should be supported in that regard.  The current system is unsustainable.  That system has led to appalling planning decisions being made, particularly as development levies have driven decisions to grant permissions.  The consequences of the latter can be seen in the context of the massive amounts of retail space that is available but unused on the boundaries of our towns.</P>
        <P>I encourage landlords to shoulder some of the burden by examining the possibility of accepting turnover-related rents.  Landlords could join retailers in risk-sharing and encourage the revival of town centres simply by entering into new arrangements based on turnover-related rents.  I appeal to them to give consideration to this proposal.  The other alternative is that they will obtain absolutely nothing from the system under which they currently operate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on local radio.  I raised this matter with the Leader two weeks ago and he indicated at that point that he would be willing to allocate time for a debate on it.  What is happening has the potential to put one or two local radio stations out of business in the coming months.  The Minister should be brought before the House immediately in order that we might engage in a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>Ministers should stop publishing the findings of reviews.  If any further reviews are carried out, it will be an indication of the failure of Government policy.  I provide health care to some of the most unfortunate people and I am aware that some of the children in respect of which questions have arisen could not have been saved, regardless of any action that might have been taken.  In addition, in some cases no attempt was made to save these children.  There is no need for another review to be held behind closed doors.  There is a need for Members to discuss, openly and frankly, what can be done to protect children who are currently in care.</P>
        <P>Many good issues are raised on the Order of Business.  Unfortunately, however, it seems that they are given 90 seconds of air time in the Chamber and this is as far as matters go.  I ask the Leader to try to schedule some of the very important debates that are requested by Members &mdash; whether they relate to children, radio stations or the economy &mdash;  in a way that would allow everyone to contribute in the interests of bringing about positive outcomes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Members in requesting a debate on the impact of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, particularly in light of the controversy that has arisen.  To a large extent, I agree with Senator Dearey that it is unfortunate that the need for this debate has arisen in the context of alcohol being available for a sporting occasion.  The country is currently experiencing the most adverse impact as a result of the abuse of alcohol, which is a drug, particularly by young people.  Alcohol abuse is a fact of life.  Two issues arise in respect of this matter.  The first of these, in respect of which I stand open to correction, is that alcohol will be available at Thomond Park &mdash; which has a licence and which is, therefore, in a position to serve drink &mdash; during the match that is due to take place there on Good Friday.  There is a difficulty in that publicans in Limerick are aware that, at a time of severe economic difficulty, over 25,000 people will be coming into their city for the match.  These individuals, naturally and rightly, see the match as an opportunity to boost business but they will not be able to do so because they are prohibited from serving alcohol on their premises on the day in question.</P>
        <P>The second issue that arises is that Setanta Sports took a commercial decision to switch the game from Easter Saturday to Good Friday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>This decision has nothing to do with alcohol, the Intoxicating Liquor Act or Munster Rugby, rather it is to do with money.  It is similar to a decision taken by another group outside this country in respect of the recent soccer friendly between the Republic of Ireland and Brazil, which led to this country&rsquo;s economy losing millions of euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the rugby authorities?  Do they not have some responsibility in respect of the match being held on Good Friday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>We must place matters in perspective.  There are certain mores which one must respect.  Over 90% of the people of this country subscribe to being Christian.  If one visits any of the Muslim countries and if one begins to engage in an argument or a debate on alcohol, one would soon be told where to go.  This has nothing to do with tolerance or intolerance; it has to do with reflecting the majority view &mdash; in fact the overwhelming majority view as even those who are agnostic accept that Good Friday has a special meaning for the Christian belief.  To consider that we would have a debate on changing the liquor laws to facilitate drink on Good Friday because of a sporting event, notwithstanding the economic impact it would have on Limerick and I sympathise with them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Irrespective of where we stood on the invasion of Iraq, and I supported it, we must all agree it was very moving to see Iraq go to the polls yesterday and in <Col N="380"/>particular to see the range of women candidates, from the most secular to the most committed Islamic.  That is the peg on which I propose to ask the Leader to consider a debate on the nature of Irish identity and the Irish Republic and what it is to be Irish.</P>
        <P>I am an atheist.  I believe in a civic republicanism.  I do not believe we can impose any religion on anybody else but at the same time I am realistic enough to recognise that in the rush to secularise the country, which is being pushed on the back of the current embarrassments of the Catholic Church with regard to child abuse, we are in danger of making the same ahistorical mistake as other generations.  I am old enough to remember when one could not get served in Irish in Dingle nor be answered in Irish in a shop.  I remember when the Irish language and Irish music were despised and that changed.  I remember when everyone said there would be no peace in Northern Ireland and there is a kind of a peace there.  We cannot predict the future.  We cannot predict in a country that is littered with the ruins of Christianity how future generations might like to respect and value Christianity.  Senator Norris has an unerring feel for the pulse of the public.  There is something odd about having a rugby match on Good Friday in a country where every corner churchyard, village and town is impregnated with Christian symbolism.  It just feels wrong.  In the rush to secularism we should be careful to tolerate all views and tolerance does not mean permitting; it means permitting while disapproving.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>This House should acknowledge what I would regard as a very important show of independence, sovereignty and compassion by the Irish Government.  I refer to the courage displayed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in bringing the plight of the people of Gaza to the very heart of Europe in recent days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>He went there and briefed his colleagues afterwards.  It is important to remember that very often it is stated that small countries follow on the coat tails of the big powers.  Ireland has proved once again that this is not true regarding this country.  It is particularly significant that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of this Republic was the first such Minister to set foot in Gaza since Israel levelled that particular territory and massacred 1,400 people, most of them women and children.  If the rest of the countries do not speak up then it is important that our voice be heard wherever the opportunity arises.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated it quite clearly; the conditions existing in Gaza are absolutely horrific and inhumane.  It is amazing how silent people can become.  The same countries were very quick on other occasions to speak out and become involved in war-mongering to push their ideas.  We must ask why we are so silent when we see the misfortunate people of Gaza suffering.  We must ask Israel, a friendly country and &mdash; I accept what Senator Harris stated on the previous occasion &mdash; a democracy, to allow building materials into Gaza and enable the misfortunate people there who suffer day in and day out to rebuild their territory and have some opportunity of a humane existence.  If we do not do so we should stay silent for all time on human rights issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I ask the Leader whether, before the close of business tomorrow evening, we can reach agreement across the House on the broadcast levy, as proposed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which will have potentially devastating effects on local radio, in particular.  There is no need for the House to divide on the issue.  Members on both sides are on the same page when it comes to the levy.  We should have that discussion before the close of business tomorrow evening.</P><Col N="381"/>
        <P>I agree also with Senator Fitzgerald and others who have referred the Ombudsman&rsquo;s comments carried in the media today on the lost at sea scheme and how the issue was handled in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I ask the Leader for his view on how we might progress the issue because of the serious disparity that has emerged between Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly and the Government parties.</P>
        <P>I join Senators Norris and Fitzgerald in raising the case of the businesswoman from County Donegal who e-mailed us yesterday about the plight of her family business which she set up a couple of years ago.  She has been advised she would be better off closing it because of the entitlements she would receive if she were in receipt of social welfare, as opposed to keeping it open.  That is a shocking statement on the current situation in the country.</P>
        <P>When will we have the debate on banking which the Leader has been promising us for one month?  It is especially required, given the recent report on what has been going on in AIB and the annual report that has just been published.  We should have the debate as soon as possible.  What is the point in calling on the Order of Business for a debate if we cannot have one?  I do not know what the Leader is hiding or why we cannot have the discussion sought.  There are a number of office holders in the Department of Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>

	<P>It should be possible to get one of them to come to the House as soon as possible for a discussion on banking.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators, in particular Senator Mooney, who have spoken about pub opening hours on Good Friday.  In this instance, it seems the campaign is being driven by the rugby authorities and a particular television company.  As someone who enjoys a drink, I believe pubs should be closed on more than just two days in the year, for which a strong case is to be made.  Religion should be left out of the argument.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the rush to secularism, to which Senator Harris referred.  We had a curious case in County Kerry over the weekend in which a statue was moved.  It was put up on the day the Second World War broke out, 3 September 1939, yet it cannot survive the machinations of the Health and Safety Authority which indicated that it was a threat to health and safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The day the Second World War broke out was the day there was thunder and lightning at the all-Ireland hurling final.  Kilkenny won by a point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I was given many reasons as to why the statue had been removed, of which health and safety was one.  Another was that it might give offence.  We are now rushing to remove all religious symbols from hospitals, Garda stations, Leinster House and other places without any policy being formulated.  Are we removing everything?  Are we going to use health and safety as an excuse to remove religious symbols without being clear on what we are doing and why we are doing it?  I ask the Leader to organise a debate, not only on the issue of opening on Good Friday for the match but on the broader issue of whether we want to remove all religious symbols from State buildings.  If that is the policy and decision of the Government, so be it, but let a decision be taken, rather than use health and safety as an excuse to remove a calendar in Limerick one week and a statue in County Kerry in another.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in asking the Leader for a debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  I hope the judge who will deal with the case will not interpret the legislation in such a way as to give permission to pubs to open on Good Friday.  It is important to tackle the invasion of secularism and through it, money, that has become the god in Ireland. <Col N="382"/> It is imperative to maintain the values that have been given to us.  At a time when the church has not shown leadership, it is incumbent on the civic authorities to do so and to stand up for that in which they believe.  As a practising Christian, I believe that Good Friday is a day to which we should hold firm and there should not be a change in this regard at all.  I join with Senator Norris in suggesting a reversion to the position whereby Sunday becomes a day of rest and leisure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>That said, I ask the Leader for a debate on the role of the Ombudsman and through such a debate, on the role of Parliament.  I commend the bravery today of the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, who was dead right.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Parliament no longer is accountable and Ministers no longer are either responsible or accountable.  When will there be accountability and responsibility in this House?  For example, Members should consider the vulgarity of Allied Irish Banks today in respect of the money it paid to its executives and directors at a time when citizens are bailing out banks.  It is wrong, vulgar and sends the wrong message.  When will Members have a debate on banking?  Second, I seek a debate on social partnership as this country is on the verge of collapse.  Industrial relations have not gone through the roof but have collapsed and no longer exist.  It is incumbent on the Government to show leadership and such a debate should be held in the House before the Easter recess.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, sits at the Cabinet table.</P>

	<P>As it is men&rsquo;s day once again today, I also seek a debate on the subject of women in politics.  However, those women who are in politics find it extremely difficult to get items on the agenda.  While I have sought a debate on domestic violence for quite some time, it has not taken place.  Similarly, a debate on the wider issues pertaining to education also has not taken place.  Rather than paying lip-service to the idea of women in politics, those women who are in politics should be listened to and those people they represent should be honoured by addressing those issues they seek to have addressed.  I call on the Leader to do such a thing because Members have been waiting for a debate on domestic violence in particular for a long time.  For some reason, the importance of this issue does not appear to register.  Consequently, I call on the Leader to make it a priority to deal with some of the issues Members, not necessarily women, have raised.  I refer to domestic violence because it is an issue about which I have sought a debate from the Leader, as have other colleagues, but which has not happened.  It is time to listen to the women who are in politics.</P><Col N="383"/>
        <P>I consider myself to be a good, true Republican and as such, I believe in the separation of church and state.  I have listened to and respect people who have faith.  While it is a tremendous thing to have a strong faith, it is another matter for the church to rule the state as such, which is part of the problem we have had in this country.  As for the subject to which Senator Daly referred, rather than moving calendars and statues, one must remember the ethos that operated within many hospitals in particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s contribution in respect of the controversial statutory instrument that places an unfair financial burden on many independent radio stations nationwide.  Were this proposal to go ahead, it would be absolutely insane.  A Labour Party proposal was made at the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources last week, which even was supported by some on the Government side, which called for the annulment of the aforementioned statutory instrument.  This would be the sensible thing to do.  In the current climate, we must be conscious of and examine seriously any Government proposal that could result in job losses.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of the annual report of AIB, which was published just before lunch.  As I told the House last week, the bank got &euro;3.5 billion in taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Last year, it paid its top executives &euro;3.6 million.  The ex-chief executive officer&rsquo;s salary was nearly &euro;900,000, the managing director received &euro;833,000 and the former chairman picked up &euro;203,000 for his endeavours at the bank.  This is shameful.  When we eventually have a debate on banking, will the Leader bring the Taoiseach to the House?  This is Government policy.  Unfortunately, the obsession is not with job creation or protection.  Rather, a morbid obsession with the banks has seen &euro;3.5 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money being given to a bank that pays the sums mentioned to its top executives.  It is disgraceful and despicable.  Many people are losing their jobs while the banks are throwing people out onto the streets.  Those who have jobs are not guaranteed job security in the current climate.  We need an element of reality.  We need the Government to stand up to banks.  I would welcome the debate whenever it is held.  I urge the Leader to arrange for it with due haste.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to state my disgust with the fact that we are not having a debate on women&rsquo;s participation in politics today.  We are in a position to have a debate on the Irish language tomorrow despite yesterday being international women&rsquo;s day.  To some, this might not be as great an issue, but one should consider our child protection services, which are in crisis.</P>

	<P>Consider issues like anorexia, an issue that my good colleague, Senator Feeney, has been raising since the beginning of this Seanad, and domestic violence.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children is not a full Minister despite the fact he should be.  During the reshuffle, which, please God, will be soon, I call on the Taoiseach to consider creating a full Ministry for children.  The area badly needs one.  Given the suffering, stress, hardship and significant issues with which the Minister of State must deal, his should be a full Ministry.  This matter is worthy of debate.</P><Col N="384"/>
        <P>These might not even be issues if we had more women in politics.  This is the bottom line.  Our country has a cultural problem in voting for and supporting women.  There are more women in politics in Dublin than there are down the country, for example.  This matter must be debated.  It might seem like a sop, the lip-service to women to which my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Malley, referred, but it is not.  When the report on symphysiotomies is published by the Department of Health and Children, for example, it must be debated.  We have a huge cultural problem in dealing with the rights of women and children.  Had we more women in politics, there would be no issue.  We badly need a debate.</P>

	<P>I join other Senators in calling for a debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  When I was growing up, we talked about the leisure society, but it now appears we are working longer hours than ever.  My colleague, Senator Dearey, has told me about a good retail principle: &ldquo;Sell as much as possible in as small a space as possible in as little time as possible&rdquo;.  That is a good principle.  We should also look at the question of Sunday trading.  I would like to see Sunday as a day of rest, which is what I grew up with.  Having one day of rest in a week is a good principle.  Things can work in both directions.</P>
        <P>It is important to have a debate on the media, for which many Senators have called.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is committed to dealing with the local radio issue which has arisen as a result of the fall in advertising revenue and the introduction of the levy.  There is huge pressure on local radio stations and the last thing we want to <Col N="385"/>see is them going out of business.  I believe the Romanian Senate has called for a debate on the content of the media.  It was proposed that there was far too much bad news in the media and that there should be a quota for good and bad news.  The proposal was unanimously passed.</P>

	<P>I am trying to listen to all of the women in the Chamber.  It is important that we debate the question of domestic violence which is not simply one for women.  The feminisation of society is also important.  Men must take on these issues.  It is crucial that we all address these issues and have a proper debate on them.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Buttimer and ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to resume the talks on social partnership.  Aggression is building and people are upset and annoyed.  I know the Government will do everything in its power to resume the talks.</P>
        <P>Like other female Senators, I am annoyed.  I noted the debate on the participation of women in politics in my diary for this week and went to the trouble of preparing for it.  Any subject with a feministic ring to it is put at the end of the agenda.  I have been calling for a debate on anorexia nervosa and bulimia for the past two and a half years but it has not been held.  Neither has the debate on domestic violence.  We would like to see both subjects debated.  It is about time women Senators stuck together and let this be known.  Female Members on the Government side will not be voting in favour of Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment but we will voice our concerns.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to read in <i>The Irish Times </i>that Bishop Willie Walsh of Killaloe had expressed the view that the Pope should meet victims of clerical abuse.  I say, &ldquo;Well done, Bishop Willie Walsh&rdquo;.  I hope we will have many more debates on child protection, particularly the protection of children who have been abused.</P>

	<P>In the past 18 months I have called for a structured debate on the difficult economic and financial position in which the country finds itself.  I ask the leaders of parties and groups in the Seanad to agree to a meaningful and structured debate on the challenges facing the country.  The calling for debates on various subjects has become a charade, with little progress being made.  A structured debate on the economy and our financial difficulties would be meaningful.  I ask for a structured debate on NAMA on an intermittent basis in order that its success, or otherwise, can be followed.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the supports and services available to older people.  A raft of supports and services are available to them but they are somewhat disjointed.  We need joined-up services and supports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I defend the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, who has been an outstanding Minister of State since he was given this responsibility.  As little as eight years ago children had hardly any rights.  The Minister of State has done much to place children&rsquo;s rights before us.  It is only fair to mention what he has done.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Quinn in what he says about the irresponsibility of public sector unions.  It is disgraceful that they can close unemployment offices, while people who are struggling to make a living are denied services.  Unions are laying down conditions for discussions with the Government.  Those who are threatening to pull the plug on schools and other services should <Col N="386"/>have their wages stopped, as they are not doing their jobs.  I call on the Taoiseach to take this matter seriously.  If workers in the public service need to be sacked, that should be done.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Bacik, Mullen, Twomey, John Paul Phelan, O&rsquo;Malley, McCarthy, McDonald and Feeney called for a debate on women&rsquo;s participation in politics and, in most cases, expressed their disappointment that the debate had been postponed.  I had agreed that it would take place today.  It had been a pleasure to do so and I was looking forward to the debate immensely.  Many colleagues had prepared for it and were delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the subject.  However, on Thursday last I received a request from the Minister of State with responsibility for equality issues, Deputy Moloney, who is in New York and asked that the debate be postponed.  I tried to arrange to have another Minister come to the House but the Minister of State said he very much wished to be present for the debate and to update the Seanad on the world conference on women&rsquo;s affairs, which he is attending in New York.  I agreed to his request and the debate will take place in the week after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  I apologise to colleagues.  I was fully committed to arranging for the debate to take place today.  I look forward to it with bated breath, to say the least, and to hearing the contributions of all Members on the question of encouraging women to participate in public life.  I fully support the proposal and have done so from the very first day Senators McDonald and Corrigan raised the matter in the House.</P>
        <P>Many Senators referred to the difficulties being experienced in the banking sector.  In the next full sitting week, the week following St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the Finance Bill will be debated for three full days on the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  I will allow the longest time possible to spokespersons and other Members who wish to speak on anything which concerns them, including NAMA and all the challenges facing the Minister for Finance.  This has been requested by the leaders of the various groups.</P>
        <P>I share Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s views on children in care and the unbelievable story carried in one of last Sunday&rsquo;s newspapers.  I have no difficulty asking the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come to the House.  He attends Cabinet and heads up his own office.  This has been a huge step forward by the Government, which we all welcome.  We look forward to assisting him in any shape or form because the challenges facing him are enormous.  They are greater than anyone realised when the office was set up, and I wish him well in his deliberations.</P>
        <P>With regard to Senators who called for a debate on the O&rsquo;Reilly report, I will consult the leaders following the Order of Business to see how we might enhance and progress this proposal.</P>
        <P>Many colleagues are concerned about the Broadcasting Act 2009.  One of the main reasons I stood for election as a Member of the Oireachtas was to regulate local radio because it was unlicensed at the time.  Senator Mooney is a broadcaster all his life and many other colleagues will recall the huge success of unlicensed radio in the past.  A broadcasting Bill came before the Oireachtas for consideration in 1989 to regulate local radio and given the contribution it makes to communities, we should do everything we can to ensure local radio stations remain viable.</P>
        <P>One section in the Act sets how to calculate the broadcasting levy.  This is applied to the BAI budget for the relevant year and applied on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to each broadcaster&rsquo;s net turnover.  It is extremely important that it is there and any surplus in levy income can be refunded to the industry.  I have no difficulty in trying to assist colleagues.  I spoke to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources briefly about this yesterday.  He is doing everything he can and he fully understands the industry has suffered a massive reduction of 30% in advertising revenue, as is the case in all other sectors.  We will do every<Col N="387"/>thing we can to support them and I will discuss further with colleagues how we can assist the request that has been made.</P>
        <P>Senators expressed serious concern about the Good Friday issue.  Senator Mooney put this in a nutshell.  It is unfortunate that the sporting event is taking place but there are 363 days in the year, other than Good Friday and Christmas Day, for all sporting organisations or anyone else no matter what is his or her religious belief.  I fully support leaving Good Friday as a day of abstinence.  I like to think I represent the majority of people on the island of Ireland.  I understand the minority viewpoint but, as a Christian, I fully support Good Friday, which is a special family day.  Nothing, including the television rights of a foreign television station, should interfere with our way of celebrating the crucifixion of the good Lord on Good Friday.  That should not be allowed.  I fully support every colleague who uttered his or her beliefs and genuine concern about this.  Hands off Good Friday and Christmas Day.  We have 363 days to sell liquor and make profit after that.  I hope it will stay that way.</P>
        <P>Many colleagues called for a debate on literacy but I have already agreed to a debate on education.  The future of our country depends on education.</P>
        <P>Senators MacSharry and Dearey called for an urgent debate on the retail sector.  This is of huge importance for the future.  As Senator Dearey said, turnover is related to rent and everything should be done to keep retail outlets open because they employ people and have been giving a service for two and three generations.  There are people in family businesses going back 70 or 80 years and for the first time the family name may not be over their doors in three months because of the difficulties they are in.  No one seems to care in some cases.  Senator MacSharry pointed out that a 30% reduction in local authority rates, especially in the Border counties, is not an unreasonable request.  In 2001 all rates were to be reviewed but, nine years later, only two local authorities have reviewed them and they were reduced by 30%.  This request should be examined immediately by the Government and I will pass it on to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government following the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Coghlan in wishing the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, well and I hope he makes a speedy recovery.  He has been an incredible and tremendous performer.  He came to the House many times.  I recall the 1997 budget when Deputy Cullen was a Minister of State.  I, as Leader, gave Independent Members an opportunity to discuss a budget for the first time.  The debate began at 6 p.m. just as the Labour Party was making its contribution in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister came into the House with few briefing notes to make his contribution.  Those of us who were present could see the huge potential he had.  I wish him all the luck in the world.  He has made a meaningful contribution through his membership of both Houses and I wish him well in the future.</P>

She feels strongly about this and I suggest she raises this on the Adjournment.  I will do everything I can to assist the Senator in her quest.</P>
        <P>Senators Harris and Daly commented on Iraqis going to the polls.  I share Senator Harris&rsquo;s delight that this day has happened and that many women candidates participated in the election.  He referred to what it means to be Irish, the importance of the family and the family&rsquo;s role in our society.  I fully agree with all the issues regarding the family.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; congratulated the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the plight of the people of Gaza.  He was the first EU Minister for foreign affairs to visit there since the Israeli invasion and to witness the dreadful situation in which the people find themselves.  A total of <Col N="388"/>1,400 people have lost their lives.  I agree with Members that we must stand up to this aggression and we must support the people of Gaza.  If human rights are to mean anything, Ireland, as a small nation, must stand tall on this issue and use its influence to bring this issue to the attention of the EU or larger nations.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer and Feeney called on the social partners to return to the negotiating table.  A good suggestion was made that the Taoiseach should participate and allow talks to proceed on the basis of co-operation which we have seen since 1987.  Ireland has been a leader in what can be achieved when there is a consensus on all sides and it has never been more needed that it is now.  I look forward to the day the Taoiseach and the social partners get around the table again in the coming weeks to take Ireland into the 21st century, which is what we all want to see.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Malley, Feeney and McDonald called for a debate on domestic violence.  I will make this a priority and I will come back to the House tomorrow with a date for this.</P>
        <P>Senators Quinn and Butler referred to the obligation on the unions and they raised serious concerns about the unions&rsquo; announcement regarding schools, hospitals and social welfare offices.  I fully support their call.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney congratulated Bishop Willie Walsh who called on the Holy Father to apologise to the victims of clerical abuse.  I join the Senator in expressing thanks to the bishop for his utterances.  I heard the radio interview and I support the wish that the Holy Father would avail of the opportunity and do what Bishop Walsh has quite correctly called for.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Callely called for a debate on NAMA and on the challenges facing our country.  The Finance Bill will be taken in this House the week after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day at which time all these issues can be discussed.  The Cabinet reshuffle will also take place around that time.  I will examine the position then with colleagues to arrange when debates will take place on the progress of NAMA and credit availability as well as on all the challenges facing the country.  I can assure Members this Leader will not be found wanting in allocating time on a fortnightly or three weekly basis in terms of reviewing the position and assisting the Minister for Finance of the day with our proposals and views.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely also called for a debate on the issue of support and services for older people, for which I agreed to make time available a few weeks ago.</P>

        <P Just="Right" el="0">&mdash;(Senator David Norris).</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>When we adjourned on the previous occasion, I was pointing out that the major deficiency in the Bill was the degree to which it did not specifically mandate or require a quota of domestic bio-fuel production.  In other words, the legislation is not sufficiently tight in a requirement to fill, to the greatest degree possible, the 4% quota from domestic production.</P>
        <P>I also bemoaned the fact that it was not proposed to introduce the required amendments on Report Stage.  While the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, accepted the validity of our arguments and their merit, spirit and objective, he indicated it was not proposed to accept them on Report Stage and that amendments would be made in the D&aacute;il.  I will return to the reason it is imperative that they be accepted in the Seanad, namely, that Irish jobs may be at stake.</P>
        <P>The 99% volume purity standard is the recommended standard used by the majority of European Union member states.  Its purpose is to prevent tariff engineering and ensure states do not avoid import duties and taxation by producing bioethanol domestically or importing substandard bioethanol relative to the European standard.  The objective of the amendment is <Col N="390"/>to create a level playing pitch for domestic processors of bioethanol and domestic producers of raw material.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the objective of my amendments Nos. 5, 12 and 13 is to highlight the importance of domestic production of raw materials for bio-fuel production, as well as domestic processing.  My amendments would also require the ministerial review of the legislation to take cognisance of domestic production and processing.  We would not have a difficulty if the Government were to table alternative amendments or change the wording slightly, provided they achieved the same objectives as this group of amendments.  If the Minister proposes to table other amendments, I ask that he do so on Report Stage.  I will explain the reasons.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, argued that we must remain in compliance with European Union and World Trade Organisation guidelines and, as such, that we could not unfairly restrict imports.  The proposed amendments are fully consistent with EU trade guidelines.  It is noteworthy that the requirements they set out have been implemented in many other EU member states.  Industry representatives with whom my party has spoken indicate that the Minister of State&rsquo;s argument does not hold up, given that many member states have accepted standardised contents of bioethanol.  Moreover, the cost of the proposals in terms of an increase in the price of petrol and diesel would be minimal, amounting to only 0.4 cent.</P>
        <P>As to the contention that we must adopt the same position as the United Kingdom, I suspect it would have to follow suit should we adopt these proposals rather than the reverse because it imports a high proportion of the bio-fuels it uses.  This argument is, therefore, unsound.</P>
        <P>The CEO of Green Biofuels Ireland, in his lobbying, drew our attention to the fact that the Bill had been introduced later than intended.  The Minister of State argued that acceptance of our amendments could further delay the legislation.  If they are accepted on Report Stage in this House, the relevant statutory instruments could then be sent to the European Commission.  We have reason to believe they would be approved quickly, thereby enabling the legislation to be enacted and implemented by 1 July.  I gather the jobs of 22 people in County Wexford may be at stake if we delay the legislation unnecessarily.  The way to avoid delaying the Bill is to accept the amendments on Report Stage, draw up the statutory instruments and submit them to the European Union.</P>
        <P>During the previous debate on the Bill I outlined the basic tenets of the Fine Gael Party, namely, that we must support domestic production, ensure food production is not displaced by the production of raw materials for bio-fuels either in Ireland, where this is not an issue, or in Brazil and other countries.  We must ensure agricultural production is not displaced in Brazil and elsewhere and rainforests are not cut down.  The introduction of standardisation in Europe would assist in achieving these objectives.</P>
        <P>I commend the amendments to the Minister.  We would be pleased to accept any changes to our amendments should the Department believe they are necessary.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendments on Report Stage to enable the Bill to be passed and the deadline of 1 July for its implementation to be met.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I trust I will be allowed to comment on the disappearance of Senator Keaveney from the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.  On a more serious note, I support the group of amendments in the names of Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and others.  The Minister will agree that the thinking behind the amendments is at the core of the legislation and in line with what he and everyone else is seeking to do in the promotion of a bio-fuels industry.  During the interesting debate on Second Stage, Senators were at one concerning the desirability of ensuring that the maximum possible amount of alternative fuels, including bioethanol, would be in use in every mechanised vehicle in this country.  It is obviously good for the economy and the environment.  The missing piece of the legislation, however &mdash; and particularly for those of us who want to see the development of a native bio-fuel industry in our own constituencies &mdash; is the provision of domestic obligations.  The 4% target is achievable and quite modest, but under the legislation as drafted, presumably the 4% will be made up almost entirely of imported fuels.  Whilst that may be important for getting bio-fuels into the system, it will do nothing in the long-term to develop a native industry.  We must therefore tweak this legislation however we can to provide opportunities and incentives thus promoting the growth of a bio-fuel industry across the country.  This is particularly the case for areas that hitherto had a strong sugar beet industry, including Mallow, Carlow, Thurles and Tuam.  Generations of farmers were involved in the production of sugar beet for those sugar plants.  There is a great opportunity for many such people or their successors to turn their land, farming skills and machinery into the production of bio-fuels.  The Minister has been discussing this aspect of the energy sector with various farming organisations, but this is the first legislative opportunity we have had to lay down a marker and try to put incentives in place for the development of a native bio-fuel industry.  Previous attempts to do so have not succeeded to a significant degree.  In the former sugar beet areas, many people have proposed project ideas to introduce crops and process bio-fuels.  While the Bill does not shut the door on that prospect, it does not open it either.  I hoped this legislation would open a welcoming door for native bio-fuel production.  If it succeeded in doing so, it would transform the rural environment and economy by creating jobs.</P>
        <P>From his discussions around the Cabinet table, the Minister is aware of the current plight of Irish agriculture.  Options for farming families are shutting down weekly, yet here we have a genuine win-win situation to develop new farming opportunities to grow energy crops and <Col N="392"/>satisfy our environmental obligations, while generating real jobs, income and hope for rural Ireland.  I appreciate that we are on Committee Stage, but hopefully some time will be given before Report Stage for the Minister to consider this range of amendments.  He may also wish to develop his own thoughts and table his own amendments to that effect.  As the House of the Oireachtas which gives greatest deliberation to legislation and which sees most amendments accepted, it would be opportune for the Seanad finally to put in place legislation which included obligations on bio-fuels.  It would support Irish farmers and, by extension, the agricultural industry and rural areas generally.  I hope the Minister will heed what we are saying.  We made the same points at even greater length on Second Stage.  The Bill presents a once in a decade opportunity for such legislation to have a meaningful and positive impact on rural life and the agricultural sector in particular.  The Minister should give our arguments careful consideration because we would all gain as a consequence if he responds positively to these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is an issue close to his heart and I know that he has been openly committed to what we are doing here.  This legislation is welcome and while we have tabled amendments, this is a serious attempt to open up the debate.  I hope he will see his way to meeting our point of view on the Bill.</P>
        <P>Since the debate last week on Committee Stage, I put some of the points that arose to those working in the industry and others.  It is important to put those matters clearly on the record.  In his statement, the Minister of State said that we must remain compliant with EU regulations and WTO guidelines on trade, which means that we cannot unfairly restrict imports.  It is crucially important to recognise that nothing that we are proposing here in any way goes against either the EU regulations or the WTO guidelines.  I think the Minister of State threw in a red herring at that point.  As we understand it, the proposed amendments are fully consistent with EU trade guidelines and do not restrict imports unfairly or unduly.  In addition, they have been proven to be WTO-compliant, as evidenced by their implementation in other EU member states.  Both Germany and France import Brazilian ethanol, but not for fuel use.  It is important to recognise that as a direct response to what the Minister of State said in his reply to the debate on Second Stage.  He also said that the amendments from us largely suggest that Ireland should mimic the fuel standards in place in other member states, including Germany and France, which serve was an effective barrier to outright competition.</P>
        <P>Essentially, the Minister of State was saying that there are two separate tariff codes &mdash; one for denatured or industrial, and the other for food grade or agriculture.  One is significantly higher than the other.  It is important therefore to recognise the impact of what we propose for price increases.  The Minister of State was a bit disingenuous, but I will not go any further than that.  He said the latter is significantly higher at 19.2 cent per litre versus 10.2 cent per litre.  Someone who was not listening closely would come to the conclusion that what we are proposing would increase the price by 10 cent per litre.  To put this in context, however, it should be explained that bioethanol will constitute only 5% or 10% of petroleum blend, whether one goes on the E5 or E10 regulation.  Putting it all together, with the difference between the existing and proposed tariff, the equivalent price increase to the consumer, if any, would be less than 1 cent per litre either way.  That is crucial to our argument.  When we come to a conclusion on all of this and have put it all together, we need to be sure about what we are doing.  Let there be no doubt about it; there is no evidence from other EU markets, which have implemented the 19.2% duty on the 2007 tariff code, that there is any impact on pump prices.  If we are wrong about this, I would like the Minister to revert to us on it.  We are putting these amendments forward in good faith, having undertaken research, including talks with industry representatives and others.</P><Col N="393"/>
        <P>I do not think the Minister of State was fair in his response to us concerning his points on compliance, guidelines on trade, and the cost per litre.  He also said the European Commission would have to be notified under the 1998 directive, as this type of initiative would be deemed a technical regulation.  There is no doubt about that.  However, notifying the European Commission of the change in a technical regulation is no more than a formality.  If it is more, we should know.  The European Commission is, and has been for some time, familiar with the German scheme and with similar schemes in many other member states.  Therefore, it is a distraction to introduce this argument.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed with the response of the Minister to the three points I have made.  I know the Minister a long time, but this seems a completely defensive response.  We did not put our amendments forward in order to have a go at the Department or the Minister.  They were put forward in good faith.  The Bill is a good one and helps us move forward in a progressive manner.  However, this House examines legislation, sees what is good in it and makes suggestions.  I had hoped there would be openness towards our suggestions.  Where we see problems with issues, we suggest another look should be taken at them.  I will certainly evaluate closely the response from the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that from a national perspective the only substantial problem with the course of action proposed is that the United Kingdom has not adopted such a measure and given that we import 60% of our road transport fuel from the UK, such a measure would have the potential to increase costs to Irish consumers substantially as they would have to be supplied with a different blend of bioethanol.  That is probably the most challenging of all the points made.  I would like to put on record the industry&rsquo;s response to us on that.  If what I say misleads the Minister or the House, please correct me, because we put forward our amendments in good faith.  I recognise that this is a technical issue, but the reference to the UK as not having adopted this measure is misleading and does not pose an issue as inferred.  Indeed, it demonstrates a lack of understanding in differentiating between two very different products, sourced from different parts of the world and technically handled in very different ways.</P>
        <P>Most Brazilian fuel ethanol is transported to Europe in bulk tankers in an undenatured state.  Normally, it is only denatured at the point of receipt into the member state to benefit from the lower tariff and technical requirements.  Most of it is brought into Rotterdam and subsequently broken down and then distributed across Europe.  Best practice recommends that blending takes place as close as possible to the point of distribution.  Hence, the point of blending tends to be the destination member state.  Currently in Ireland, bioethanol blending usually occurs at the point of receipt in the bond &mdash; whichever bonded facility it goes into.  With regard to petroleum, we currently import approximately 50% of our requirements from the UK, 35% through Whitegate and the balance from Scandinavia, through Derry.  We have been reliably informed that all the oil majors in Ireland will have blending capacity and undenatured ethanol at their facilities by the end of the year.  This has been confirmed separately to me as being correct.  Topaz, in Whitegate, already has full capability.  Even if oil companies opt to blend in the UK or mainland Europe, these are pan-European suppliers that already supply some member states with a product similar to the Irish specified product.  All that matters is that the bioethanol coming into Ireland satisfies the definition under the bio-fuels legislation, which must comply to Taric code 2207 1000 and EN 15376.  I want this on the record because when the Minister of State came back to us on the points we raised, he did not deal with the issues.</P>
        <P>What I am doing here is coming back to the Minister on the issues.  I believe everything I have said is technically correct.  I am relying on other information, but I have tried to confirm its sources and believe it is true.  If it is true, it confirms what I said last week, namely, that what we propose has many attractions, for the Minister and the State.  It increases tax revenue to the State, is a boost for the agricultural industry, leads to carbon dioxin capture and therefore <Col N="394"/>reduces our need to offset or invest more money in offsetting.  I recall that before the Minister came into office, he took a strong view against the provision in the 2007 budget for the &euro;270 million being put aside for offsetting.  I agreed with him at the time and said that here.  Another attraction is that the measure creates employment in various parts of the country and provides support for the agricultural industry, rural development and various processing facilities, including the one in Waterford-Kilkenny.  The arguments against it do not stand up.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made an unusual statement.  He said he would listen to our arguments and try and bring some measures forward to meet our needs.  That was a positive response.  However, it was not very positive of him &mdash; we found this difficult to understand &mdash; to say he would not do that until Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I am now aware amendments can be introduced on Second Stage.  The Seanad is the anvil on which the arguments have been hammered out.  Therefore, we should mould, shape and conclude the Bill here.  We need to bring the argument to a conclusion now.  If the points I have raised are incorrect, we need to argue the case again and come to a conclusion on it here.  We can do that on Report Stage.  I do not feel the need or desire to bring this to a vote here, because the House should not divide on the issue.  We should convince each other through argument and through providing plausible and cogent responses to each other&rsquo;s positions and in that way find a compromise position.</P>
        <P>I do not want us to be arguing about the issue.  I want the Minister to recognise that what we have said was said in good faith and to respond to it as positively as he can.  If there are reasons what we propose is in some sense bad for national policy or not in compliance with national or international policy, or WTO or EU regulations, let us hear that and then let us deal with the issue again.  In the meantime, I urge the Minister to accept our amendments or agree to bring forward similar ones on Report Stage.  We put them forward with the best of intentions to support what is good and important legislation.  I look forward to a positive response from him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  As he is probably aware, we had a very good debate here last Thursday on this legislation.  We have all been well informed by the industry, which has taken a keen interest in the legislation as it is of tremendous importance to it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I listened carefully to what was said here last week by both Members and the Minister of State.  I do not agree with the implied criticism of the Minister of State with regard to points 1 and 2 of the e-mail on ethanol.  He was fairly honest and straightforward in that regard.  However, point 3 needs clarification.  The e-mail stated that with regard to notifying the EU Commission of the change in technical regulation, under directive 98/34/EC, this should be a formality.  It went on to state the EU Commission was very familiar with the German scheme, along with similar schemes implemented in many other member states over a considerable period of time.  We need clarification from the Minister on that.  I understood after debating the issue last week that it would take approximately three months to go through the process of recognising the change in technical regulation and that this was a factor that might delay the Bill.  I understood it was for that reason the suggestion was made by the Minister of State that the amendment would take place in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I fully subscribe to, and have heard the Minister emphasise on occasion, the need for a focus on job creation.  All legislation should now be employment-proofed across every Department.  That is the challenge facing us at least for the next decade.  The Minister, in other legislation he has introduced and initiatives he has taken, has been positive in making such a contribution and creating a climate for the creation of jobs in the short to medium term.  I support the change in the definition of bioethanol to provide for an alcohol content of at least 99% by <Col N="395"/>volume.  This would at least encourage the emergence of indigenous industry and production, which would be to our benefit.  It is important that this be implemented.  Based on what I heard on Miriam O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s programme on Saturday, there could be a lot riding on the outcome, apart from the actual jobs, before the next presidential election.</P>
        <P>Belview Port, the site of the proposed bioethanol plant, is close to my own home town, although not as close as it is to Senator John Paul Phelan who, I am sure, would correct me if I said it was.  I am within 20 km of it.  Much closer to me, in fact, is Green Biofuels Ireland Limited, which is the only up-and-running bio-fuels project.  Others have received licences but I do not think they are anywhere near production or have even commenced construction of their facilities.  Perhaps I am wrong; I may be corrected on that.  What is special about Green Biofuels Ireland &mdash; which would appeal to any supporter of sustainable practices &mdash; is the extent to which it reuses and recycles.  More than 80% of the company&rsquo;s raw materials, which are cooking oil and tallow, are sourced in Ireland.  Thus, it is taking waste products and turning them into bio-fuels, which is to be commended.  It is producing 34 million litres of bioethanol.  If I remember correctly from the previous day, we were saying that 4% of all our fuel use, which is the amount required under the bio-fuel obligation, would amount to somewhere around 220 million litres.  The company has plans, assuming the climate and the legislative and commercial environment are amenable, to double its capacity in the not-too-distant future.  This should be encouraged.</P>
        <P>The company has a real difficulty with this amendment and the delay in the passage of the Bill.  Its consultants have been in touch with Senators O&rsquo;Reilly, Norris and O&rsquo;Toole and, it is to be hoped, Senator McCarthy, because I provided it with the names of all four Senators in order that it could bring them up to speed.  The company&rsquo;s difficulty is that its excise relief is to run out on 1 July and should the bio-fuels obligation not be in place by then, it will find itself unable to trade, which will have drastic consequences.  I ask that we consider this complication together with the Minister.  Perhaps, as has been suggested by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, an amendment could be made in the Seanad to enable the Minister in due course, having obtained EU approval, to introduce a statutory instrument.  I ask the Minister to indicate whether this course of action would be suitable and whether any such statutory instrument in the future will incorporate this amendment with regard to the alcohol content of the bioethanol product.</P>
        <P>We have had a good debate, which is testimony to the scrutiny that Bills receive in the House.  I hope the Minister will be able to respond positively to the points being made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and his advisers did a good job when the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was not here the last day, but it is particularly important that the Minister with direct authority in this area be here.</P>
        <P>The Minister is highly intelligent and diligent so I will not rehearse all the arguments.  I imagine that either his advisers have acquainted him with the arguments made or he has read the debate.  It was quite technical and some of us spoke at considerable length.  The point was generally agreed by both the Minister and his advisers and by all parties in the House &mdash; which is important &mdash; and there was a general consensus that we had won the argument.  The only obstacle was a technical difficulty.  As Senator Walsh has said, we wish to work together in this regard.</P>
        <P>The arguments revolve around two issues, the first of which is Irish jobs.  It is important we maximise the capacity to produce employment.  The other is the impact on the environment, both domestically and, to a smaller extent, in countries such as Brazil.  I will not go over the arguments again.  I was obliged to leave the House to take a telephone call so I hope I am not reiterating too much of what has already been said.</P><Col N="396"/>
        <P>I accept the good will of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and of course the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan.  In what I say I am not implying any malign intention, but it does appear that some of the statements, especially in light of the briefings we have subsequently received, may have unintentionally misled.  For example, the amendments are in fact completely consistent with trade guidelines for the EU.  They do not unduly or unfairly restrict imports.  The provisions have been proven to be WTO compliant, as evidenced by their implementation in other EU member states.  During the previous debate I and other colleagues read a list of the other European states, of which there are at least eight, that already have such provisions.  I also put on the record the fact that an international committee was established with representation not only from the United States and the EU countries, but also from Brazil itself, and it was positive in this regard.  I do not see where there could be any objection.  Germany and France import Brazilian ethanol, but not for fuel use.  In 2009 Germany imported 4 million litres of undenatured ethanol from Brazil.</P>
        <P>The statement that suggested there might be a price hike at the petrol pump that would be unwelcome to Irish consumers could also be held to mislead.  This must be put into context.  Bioethanol will constitute a 5% or 10% petroleum blend &mdash; E5 or E10 &mdash; and the difference between the existing proposed tariffs is 9 cent per litre.  Thus, the equivalent price increase, if any, to the consumer would be 0.45 cent and 0.9 cent per litre for E5 and E10, respectively.  There is no evidence from any other European markets, following the introduction of exactly the same kind of tariff legislation, that there was any jump in price at the petrol pump.  This argument needs to be ruled out.  I am not suggesting any malign intention, but I suggest there is likely to be no impact whatever at the pump.  The main driver of petrol prices at the pump, in any case, is the international oil price.</P>
        <P>The notification to the European Commission of the change in the technical regulation should be just a formality for the reasons I have mentioned.  There is a suggestion that this might be a diversionary tactic by the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  I am sure this is not true.  Everybody in this country is seeking the creation of jobs.  I would like to ask specifically, if my colleagues have not already asked, whether the notification has already been submitted, because there are lead times involved.  In addition, there are a whole series of arguments about the United Kingdom not having adopted this measure, but these are also unrealistic and I am sure the companies involved have already made this clear to the Minister.</P>
        <P>I believe we won the argument on Second Stage and there was general agreement on the issue.  The Minister signified he would consider the meaning of the amendments, but at a later stage.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has dealt with the question of whether it would be technically possible or appropriate to introduce it on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  My colleagues and I have worked hard on this and it would be appropriate for this to be done in the Seanad, which is possible.</P>
        <P>I know there must be formal notification.  The problem is the regulation must rest with the European Commission for three months and other member states have an opportunity to object, which might cause another three-month delay.  The process has already been delayed from 1 January to 1 July, which is approximately six months, and a further delay would have serious consequences in possible loss of employment and a possible closure of the firm, which has a capacity to deliver.  That would be a disaster.  The excise relief is running out under the mineral oil tax, MOT, scheme II.  The bio-fuel obligation must be put in place no later than 1 July 2010, as indicated by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources already.</P>
        <P>I am serious about this and will table an amendment on Report Stage which might resolve the issue.  I would be very happy for the Minister to introduce it.  Very often in legislation <Col N="397"/>passed by this and the other House, there is the equivalent of the unenumerated constitutional rights.  We have a broad outline of the Bill and we also have reserve powers of the Minister to introduce further measures by regulation.  That means the Bill can be passed but we make clear that the power to make regulations is implicit in the Bill, setting out certain quality standards that might be applied.  Once the Bill is passed, we should draw up a statutory instrument setting out the requisite standards and present that to the European Commission under Directive 98/34/EC.  That would allow the changes to made, as requested, on Committee Stage and also allow the Bill to proceed as planned.</P>
        <P>The Minister should respond directly to that technical measure.  Will he accept that kind of amendment or will he introduce it on Report Stage?  This meets both requirements of the European Commission and the urgent necessity for the Bill to be passed in a form that makes the necessary changes allowing for the development of this important industry.  It would also allow the possibility of perhaps 1,000 jobs in what is an economic blackspot.</P>
        <P>There are two questions for the Minister.  What is the current state of play with regard to notification and has this already been submitted?  The Minister has already agreed that the arguments in the Seanad have prevailed so will he accept an amendment in the Seanad on Report Stage which will allow the Minister to make the appropriate changes by regulation and the creation of statutory instrument?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not repeat the arguments that have been made by Senators Norris, Walsh and O&rsquo;Reilly.  They have raised the specific issues relating to Green Biofuels Ireland in New Ross and proposed a mechanism by which the difficulty can be resolved.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to that proposition.</P>
        <P>I spoke at length during the first debate on Committee Stage of the legislation and documents from Ethanol Ireland and this company in New Ross have been circulated, to which Senator Walsh has referred.  They outline some of the difficulties with the current position.  I do not see a reason for a division in the House as it is often the case that the Government cannot accept Opposition amendments because they may not have been drafted correctly, etc.  I do not see why a Government amendment could not be made on Report Stage to encapsulate what has been proposed in previous discussions in the House and pertinent to the group of amendments we are now discussing.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, indicated towards the end of his contribution that he was becoming more positive on the idea of amendments being accepted on Report Stage in the Seanad.  He spoke about accepting them in the D&aacute;il but I do not see why they could not be accepted at this juncture in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Senators previously spoke on the need to accept these amendments as proposed and I am particularly interested in them.  The facility proposed for the port in Waterford is very close to where I live and the south east is and has been an unemployment blackspot, even through the Celtic tiger and especially since the collapse of the construction sector in this country.  There are significant difficulties with employment across the country and especially in the south east.</P>
        <P>The region was home to the sugar beet factory in Carlow town and it only recently closed.  There is a ready source of product which can be processed into ethanol from the agricultural community in the hinterland which exists in the south east.  For those reasons, I hope the Minister will be in a position to give a positive indication to the House in his response and to accept the proposed amendments.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer a couple of the direct queries before tackling the nub of the issue.  Senator Burke asked about licences but there are no licences for bio-fuel production currently.  Under the mineral oil tax relief scheme there are 18 companies which are able to facilitate production of bio-fuels.  A large number of them have gone into production and five have plants here.  One of these, Green Biofuels Ireland, has been mentioned by a number of contributors and it is an excellent example of how we can produce bio-fuels from waste.  It employs 23 people and is a perfect win-win solution.  It solves a waste problem and is assisting employment in an area where we have had difficulties.  We all have a common and agreed sense that we must increase employment potential, protect existing jobs and create new opportunities.  We can do it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, was listening and indicated that we had to consider different options.  He did not rule anything out and we have not done so in this debate.  We have looked at overseas examples and the UK regime was cited on a number of occasions.  As I understand it, one of the considerations there is that it will have many plants producing ethanol from wheat which would already meet standards we are talking about.</P>
        <P>It has been a very useful debate and in the Seanad we have been able to tease out an important issue.  I am very happy to come back to the Seanad having considered the arguments.  On the basis of the discussion we have had, we can agree to act to promote indigenous industry.</P>
        <P>My priority is to encourage growth in the use of bio-fuels in Ireland and specifically in the development of the indigenous bio-fuels industry.  The main premise of our obligation is to underpin the developments of the Irish bio-fuels market.  I wish to ensure those who have already made a foray into bio-fuel production continue to develop their businesses, such as the one in New Ross.  We wish to protect those jobs and see other production facilities set up with a sound business case from the very start.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I confirm on that basis that the Bill when presented on Report Stage in the Seanad will contain an amendment which will allow for the introduction of this type of measure by order.  Making the type of amendment put forward by a number of Senators previously is not straightforward and as the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, outlined last week, inserting a required standard for fuel is effectively a technical regulation as set out by Directive 98/34/EC.  This requires us to amend a copy of the draft regulation &mdash; the legislation in this case &mdash; to a detailed form and send it to Brussels for comment.  The waiting period in this regard is three months.  During this time we cannot pass or enact legislation containing this text.  If another member state objects, a further three months is automatically added to the waiting period while the Commission examines the complaint.  Were we to attempt to insert the explicit provision in this Bill, it would substantially delay the coming into force of the obligation because it would most likely be October before we could hope to have the legislation passed.  This could have caused considerable commercial difficulties for some of the companies to which reference has been made and which are already operating here.</P><Col N="399"/>
        <P>I have indicated that the bio-fuel obligation will be introduced by July and I do not wish to impede progress further by going down the route of inserting fuel standards at this point in the legislative process.  Instead, I propose to amend the text of the Bill on Report Stage in order to provide the Minister with the power to make an order specifying the fuel standards that will be required to apply under the obligation.  We will move ahead with the Bill on that basis.  When the legislation is enacted, I can draw up a statutory instrument in which will be set down the measure required around specifying a Taric code.  This can then be put through the notification procedure in due course.  My officials are working with the Office of the Attorney General with regard to preparing the text of the amendment for Report Stage in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>While I do not accept the amendments tabled by Senators, we have come up with a mechanism which achieves the same effect.  I hope Senators, in their wisdom, with their great intelligence, breadth of knowledge, understanding, human glorification, etc.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I welcome what the Minister said.  He has done exactly what Members on all sides have urged him to do.  This is a very good day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I also welcome the fact that he has given a commitment to introduce on Report Stage that for which those on all sides have argued, namely, a provision relating to dealing with this matter by way of statutory instrument.  That is an extremely important development.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to our extraordinary technical knowledge.  I am not sure I could claim any such knowledge.  However, one thing I am good at is taking a brief on the hoof.  We were provided with clear and specific briefs by various interests, particularly those representing the industry.  I thank them for this because, with the help of the briefs to which I refer, it was possible to master a number of highly technical issues, as well as the broad sweep of ideas.</P>
        <P>The fact that Seanad &Eacute;ireann has acted in a united capacity and has not been antagonistic or imputed false motives to the Department, the officials or the Minister has been of assistance.  We have behaved in a constructive way and our business has been accomplished as envisaged under the Constitution.  The Seanad is normally seen as a venue where constructive amendments which will improve Government legislation can be mooted.  I am glad we were able to convince the Minister as to the veracity of our arguments.  It is possible, even likely, that he already had this change of mind.  At least, he was faced by a united front within the Seanad urging him to introduce the change.  If its introduction was not always so firmly on his agenda &mdash; which is always possible &mdash; then the Seanad has done a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P>Members on all sides spoke passionately and convincingly in respect of the amendments.  I welcome the fact that the general thrust of the amendments tabled in my name and that of Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, in respect of which he and Senators John Paul Phelan and Walsh argued, has been accepted.  Senators John Paul Phelan and Walsh have a particular interest in this matter because it relates to their home base.  I do not believe this was an electoral gambit or that the Senators were merely doing this on behalf of the constituency in which they live.  This is a matter of passionate concern for all people, not just Members of both Houses.  To be able to do something to provide jobs at a time when the position on employment is so difficult is extremely important.</P>
        <P>I was somewhat bemused by Senator Walsh&rsquo;s reference to presidential elections.  I am not sure if he was referring to the election of the president of some farming organisation or a somewhat more elevated office.  I do not see what we are discussing as having any great rel<Col N="400"/>evance to presidential elections, although we may be rewarded for having done a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s intervention and record my appreciation of the fact that he has not adopted a defensive posture in respect of the very worthwhile and practical suggestions made.  The objective of our amendments is to secure existing jobs in the processing and agriculture sectors and to create further employment.  I am happy that this objective will be achieved, albeit via the use of a statutory instrument.  In the context of protecting jobs in Wexford, it is important that we meet the deadline relating to the legislation.  Senator Walsh has an immediate concern with regard to these jobs.  However, the creation of new jobs or the retention of existing ones is a matter of interest to every Member of the Houses.</P>
        <P>I am glad that the matter will, as the Minister indicated, be dealt with by way of statutory instrument and that our objective will be achieved.  All we are doing is creating a level playing field for Irish producers.  That is a reasonable position to want to advance and I am satisfied it will now happen.  I share Senator Norris&rsquo;s pleasure about the fact that the Minister has taken our arguments on board.  That is gratifying for us because we invested a great deal of effort in drafting and discussing the amendments.  That is our job and is what we should be doing.  It is good to know, however, that there has been a positive outcome to our work.  In such circumstances, I will be happy to withdraw the amendment in my name.</P>

	<P>I concur with what has been said.  This is a matter of both local and national interest.  Promoting the indigenous sector in respect of the production of the 4% specified is something to be applauded.  The Minister has not only shown common sense, he has also again shown that he is prepared to listen and accept sensible amendments, for which I commend him.  His actions are not unique but neither are they common.</P>

Someone could put up a notice on an obscure page.  Granted it would be published on the worldwide web but it would be in an obscure place so no one would see it.  If it is published by the agency it should be published on the agency&rsquo;s website.  The terminology &ldquo;of the body&rsquo;s website&rdquo; is used in other legislation, for example in the definition of &ldquo;relevant Internet website&rdquo; in section 3(c) of the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Bill 2010 which was published by the Minister and recently passed by the Seanad.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Members are resuming the debate on the Bill at a critical stage.  Fine Gael has tabled three amendments that were discussed at length on the previous occasion.  Amendment No. 10 proposes that &ldquo;greyhounds should be exempt from the limit of six litters, subject to veterinary approval&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 10  proposes that &ldquo;greyhounds should be exempt from the requirement that a bitch is not to be mated inside 12 months from the previous litter&rdquo;, while amendment No. 14 proposes that &ldquo;greyhounds registered through the Irish Coursing Club should be exempt from the micro-chipping requirement&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>These amendments have been tabled because of the greyhound industry&rsquo;s genuine concern that, if the Bill is passed as drafted, it will prove a real threat to the industry&rsquo;s viability.  Given the breeding of champion dogs in Ireland and its high reputation here and abroad, I wish to point out an important statistic, that is, 77% of the dogs racing in the UK are Irish bred.  This tells me that the industry means much to our economy.</P>
        <P>On the last day we debated the Bill, I pointed out at length what would occur if Fine Gael&rsquo;s amendments were not accepted.  Good brood bitches that are in demand will be exported to other jurisdictions.  As a consequence, Irish racing and the Irish greyhound industry will no <Col N="407"/>longer be recognised as being successful.  This is a genuine concern for the industry and should be a concern for us as public representatives.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing that, to date during this debate, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has been unwilling to consider many of Fine Gael&rsquo;s amendments despite their being reasonable and being tabled in a genuine attempt to protect the greyhound industry.  We have no difficulty with introducing strict regulations on puppy farming.  That was what the Bill was about.  We referred at length to the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 and its role in respect of the Irish Coursing Club&rsquo;s authority over the breeding of greyhounds.  We also pointed to the various inspection and licensing regimes for the industry.  We have a real fear that, if we have more layers of inspection, bureaucracy and so on without any reference to the 1958 Act, we will close down large sections of the industry.</P>
        <P>The Government has invested in many greyhound tracks in the past ten or 15 years.  I will give credit where it is due because the Government invested in the greyhound industry and upgraded and modernised many tracks.  Waterford city has the Kilcohan Park track, which I remember as once being dilapidated.  It is now a state-of-the-art track with restaurant facilities that is regularly visited by many families.  It is a significant success and a good piece of infrastructure for a city or community and has been replicated throughout the country.  The Irish Greyhound Board is making a considerable investment in Limerick, but in this Bill we are saying it is a viable industry in which we will invest while at the same time posing a threat to the industry&rsquo;s fundamentals.  The reason the industry exists is the successful breeding and racing that have taken place for many years without complaint.  It has been successful and managed well, but we are introducing a Bill that will threaten everything.</P>
        <P>Many people are listening to this debate because they rightly have concerns about the industry&rsquo;s future.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, is not considering Fine Gael&rsquo;s amendments.  As I have stated on the public record, if amendments were forthcoming from the Government side, from the Green Party or Fianna F&aacute;il, that would meet the concerns highlighted by this side of the House, I would be willing to withdraw our amendments.  However, there seems to be no effort to come over to our way of thinking.  This is a pity because the Bill and its amendments have rightly been debated at great length by many of our colleagues from all sides of the House.  If the Bill is passed in its current form, it will be too late to cry about running down the industry.  Now is the time to effect change.  For this reason, Fine Gael has tabled these amendments.  Some Government Senators have spoken in support of our amendments, so I urge them to talk to their colleagues and Ministers, including the Minister responsible, and consider our amendments before it is too late.</P>
        <P>I could say much more, but we will pursue these amendments.  I hope the Minister or his officials, even in the past week, had an opportunity to consult the wider public and the industry and see the common sense in Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals.  The greyhound industry is concerned the Bill will be detrimental to its existence.  I hope the Minister of State will take my opinions on board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to the House.  I have not spoken on Committee Stage although I contributed on Second Stage.  I have listened to and been present in the Chamber for all of this debate and I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendments.  I come from an area like his and, I suspect, the Minister of State&rsquo;s.  Indeed, the latter is familiar with rural south County Kilkenny.  Many people besides farmers and others involved in agriculture are involved in the greyhound industry and have a number of breeding greyhound bitches.  It has been a part of their way of life for generations.</P><Col N="408"/>
        <P>Even before I entered the Oireachtas, I saw how seemingly innocuous legislation had serious knock-on effects for people.  This Bill is potentially devastating for greyhound breeders and others.  On Second Stage, for example, I mentioned hunt kennels.  The Bill is the thin edge of the wedge in respect of what are loosely termed as country pursuits.  I urge the Minister of State, as a representative of the largest Government party and one that, unlike some of the other parties in government, has roots in rural Ireland, to reflect on what is being proposed.  The 1958 legislation governing the greyhound industry already imposes an inspection regime in which greyhounds must be documented and records kept.  What is proposed in the Bill is a expensive duplication of the current provisions.  I listened to every contribution and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, did not seem to acknowledge this duplication or the fact that the greyhound and hunting sectors are already regulated, subject to inspection and must keep records of the dogs produced.</P>
        <P>The Bill was introduced following calls from a number of Senators and Deputies concerning puppy farming.  Senator Cummins was the first Member to raise the issue of the inhumane treatment of young dogs in the industry.  Everyone welcomes the sector&rsquo;s regulation but the Bill will cover areas that are already well regulated.  There is no need to regulate them again because they are already subject to stringent criteria.  It also places an unfair burden of cost during a difficult time in every walk of life.  I urge the Minister of State.  I have read the amendments and cannot see why they cannot be accepted.  The greyhound sector, the specific matter dealt with by the amendments, is already the subject of regulation and inspection.  It is not as if people are getting off scot free.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As Members of the Oireachtas, we have received many e-mails in recent days from people stating we should include the greyhound breeders and hunt kennels.  They are already subject to rigorous inspection.  From inception, the aim of this legislation has been to regulate puppy farming.  If we want to do anything for animal rights, puppy farming should be banned outright.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this legislation, as it could have a devastating effect on a way of life, not merely on people&rsquo;s pockets.  Many of my neighbours who are rural people, although not farmers, have a few greyhounds and one of their few pleasures in life is to walk them every morning and evening and perhaps go to Kilcohan Park in Waterford or the greyhound track in Kilkenny city.  When we have seen investment by the Government and from elsewhere in upgrading greyhound stadiums, it is bizarre to consider placing extra charges and impositions on greyhound breeders.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State who represents the rural-based party in government will look to the people he knows who are involved in the greyhound industry and ensure they are not subject to a ridiculous form of double inspection.</P>

	<P>The relationship between the 1958 Act and the Bill has been mentioned.  There is duplication between the two.  I cannot understand why the Minister did not take this into consideration, but perhaps he did.  There is duplication in the regulation, registration and identification processes.  </P>
        <P>This is a well run industry.  Like the two previous speakers, I come from the south east.  As a very young girl I saw how well run coursing was and how the integrity of the industry was protected at all times.  The Bill needs to be rethought.</P>

We all support rural pursuits <Col N="409"/>and want to protect rural Ireland.  We do not want to see the urbanisation of everything.  I support the rural sports with which I grew up and about which I heard in my youth.  The 1958 Act must be reconciled with this Bill.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senators Coffey and John Paul Phelan in asking the Minister, at the eleventh hour, to accept the amendments.  At a time of economic crisis the country requires the Government to be pro-enterprise and pro-jobs.  The Bill has the potential to destroy the greyhound industry which will have an impact on tourism, employment and our sporting life.  It will also affect our balance of trade because greyhound industry exports are worth &euro;35 million per annum.  Senator Ormonde referred to rural pursuits but the Bill will have a profound effect on all of Ireland.  I commend her for her remarks.  However, it is fine to say one thing in the Chamber but the real truth emerges when we go through the T&aacute; and N&iacute;l lobbies.  I challenge the members of the leading Government party to be true to their roots and de Valera, if that is what they stand for.  He would not have supported the Bill.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The 1958 Act allows for regulation.  I worry when I receive e-mails from people who have neither the courtesy nor the courage to sign their names.  I am neither a ruralite nor an urbanite.  I support the rights of those involved in an industry and a sport which creates jobs and does no harm.  On any greyhound track one will see people who are creating employment.  Greyhound owners and trainers are decent, honourable and hard-working.  They have regulation and self-regulation.  They know what is right and what is wrong.  A number of people who have spoken to me are for and against the Bill.  If the Government is serious about the operation of dog breeding establishments and compliance with regulation, why have negotiations not taken place with the bodies involved in the industry?  Why has the Minister shown no willingness to listen?  The e-mails we have received from representatives of the greyhound industry have shown them to be open to dialogue and consultation and willing to embrace regulation and a hands-on approach.  The Government is missing a golden opportunity.  Perhaps Fianna F&aacute;il has decided the Seanad does not matter but that it will move mountains to ensure the Bill is passed when it is debated in the D&aacute;il. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am dealing with those amendments.  The Minister does not have a clue about requirements and definitions regarding litters and bitches.  I would say he has never set foot on a greyhound track or spoken to a trainer or owner.  He has no understanding of the industry.  There is an obligation on the Minister of State to stop the Bill in its tracks and recommence negotiations and dialogue with all concerned.  The Bill is flawed and unfair.  It does not deserve to be passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of my Fine Gael colleagues and those of Senator Ann Ormonde on these amendments.  The Bill, unfortunately, goes down the wrong road.  Huge pressure was applied to the Government to take action on the question of puppy <Col N="410"/>farms and solve an obvious problem.  There is unanimous support for the regulation of puppy farms and the closure of many of them.  Legislation to that effect should have been generated, debated and enacted in a very short space of time.  Such a speedy turnaround of legislation should be the way of political life.  Unfortunately, factors have intervened and what should have been a straightforward Bill has grown out of all proportion.  Commitments given to various groups and associations have been breached and we are now debating and possibly dividing on a section which should not be included in the Bill.  I concur with Senator Buttimer regarding the economic issues involved but, given the current economic state of the country and leaving aside the political arguments, the public expects us to spend 95% of our time in both Houses discussing the economic plight of the country and putting forward ideas and solutions to address it.  The average citizen would be bemused and amazed that we have spent days discussing this legislation which should have simply provided for regulations to control or, if necessary, shut down puppy farms.  The Minister&rsquo;s over-the-top approach to the legislation is a little disappointing.</P>
        <P>I refer to the amendments and the impact of the Bill on the greyhound industry.  I agree with colleagues who have expressed serious concerns about its negative implications.  We have all received representations and communications from various parties on the matter but all of us, especially those who represent rural constituencies, are aware of the economic and social impact of this industry.  It is the only social outlet for many people.  It is a successful indigenous industry into which the Government, through the horse and greyhound fund, invested tens of millions of euro to develop stadia, encourage people into the industry and generate employment and tax revenue.  We should try to strengthen and develop the industry further.  Senator Buttimer also referred to the export element.  A cost benefit analysis of the industry would stand up to the highest scrutiny as a successful rural Irish enterprise.</P>
        <P>With a few strokes of his pen, the Minister is seriously threatening the industry.  Senator Buttimer asked whether he has ever attended a greyhound race meeting.  I do not know but he represents the constituency in which Ireland&rsquo;s premier greyhound track, Shelbourne Park, is located.  I am sure he knows the track, how many people work there and how many people attend meetings every week of the year, yet the legislation is a grave and present threat to the industry.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State represents a rural constituency, he has knowledge of the issues we have raised.  I ask him to advise the Minister not only to move with caution but to be willing to be big enough to engage reverse gear.  When we commenced the debate on the legislation some weeks ago, there was a general fear that a Pandora&rsquo;s box would be opened.  What should have been straightforward legislation which would have received the unanimous support of the House unfortunately will create new challenges for rural Ireland and rural pursuits.  We debated the issue of hunt kennels, their registration, promises made and commitments broken, to which we will revert.</P>
        <P>With regard to greyhound breeding, the regulations governing the Irish Coursing Club are exceptionally strict and proper, accountable and transparent, and they work. In theory, we know what it is supposed to do but we do not know how it will work in practice.  The current registration regulations operated by the ICC have worked effectively for many years but the Minister is willing to cast that aside and change the rules of the game.</P>
        <P>It would be much preferable if we did not have to divide on the amendments but we must make a statement if the Minister of State and his colleagues are not willing to come forward with new thinking.  The decision on this legislation will be made in this House because we are giving it the time it deserves.  My fear is that it will be rushed through the Lower House without significant debate and analysis.  If progress is to be made and common sense is to be reapplied <Col N="411"/>to the legislation, it will have to happen in this House.  I hope the Minister of State will not only impress our concerns and those of his party on the Minister but that he will get him to move and that he will reassure us he will report progress and fresh thinking on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>Earlier we discussed the bio-fuel legislation and the need to give a little boost to rural Ireland.  We could list a plethora of rural industries that are under pressure or that have disappeared.  Fortunately, the greyhound industry continues to perform well and it would be disappointing and regrettable if the legislation, which at its genesis was appropriate in that it was intended to regulate puppy farms, harmed our greyhound industry.  Will the Minister of State think carefully about this and impress on his senior colleague that he should think again about the steps he proposes to insert in this section into which he is perhaps being pushed by the more extreme elements of the animal rights lobby, bring common sense to bear and not break something that is fixed?  There is no need for the section because the greyhound industry is well regulated, administered and controlled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the comments made by other Senators on both sides of the House.  As somebody who has visited greyhound tracks at home and abroad, I can attest to the entertainment provided by racing.  We must be careful about any law that could potentially damage the economic viability of the industry.  I fully recognise we must ensure animal rights remain the priority in legislation.  Having also listened to Members on the Government side, it is clear the Minister has failed to demonstrate why the 1958 Act does not cover animal rights in sufficient detail and he has failed to convince the House it is right to enact this legislation and reject these amendments.  We have spent three days debating this issue.  We have spent longer on this section than we did on many sections of the NAMA legislation.  The Minister of State will have spoken to the Minister before he came to the House.  We made our concerns clear to the Minister last week about double regulation of the industry.  He has yet to come back to us with sufficient reasons for this and, because of that, we have no option but to vote in favour of the amendment and against the Bill.</P>

	<P>I am speaking to amendment No. 14.  Given the record of the ICC, the integrity of Mr. Dick O&rsquo;Sullivan and what he has said about this matter, we should not impugn the club&rsquo;s integrity.  What is being attempted in this regard in the Bill is unnecessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coffey has tabled three simple amendments.  I will not labour the argument in support of them other than to say that I believe this legislation has the support of Members on all sides of the House.  There is agreement on the Government side of the House to the amendments put forward by Senator Coffey.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider accepting these good amendments.</P>
        <P>This legislation is being put in place for a specific purpose but it impinges to a great degree on the greyhound industry.  That is the problem that arises and the reason Senator Coffey has tabled amendments Nos. 10, 10 and 14</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is being said regarding this section would not instil confidence in the Bill among those in the greyhound industry.  Furthermore, what the Minister proposes in this respect does not augur well for the industry.  We have invested heavily in greyhound tracks and in this major industry.  I have no doubt that the ban on coursing in England will be lifted and I am led to believe that will happen soon.  A former Deputy and Senator, Liam Burke, was one of the last <Col N="412"/>people to win the Waterloo Cup.  If that comes to pass and if this legislation is passed in its current format, any bitches that have had six litters will be exported to Northern Ireland and to England.  That would be a great loss to this country given the substantial investment by the State and taxpayers in the development of greyhound tracks and new stadiums with state-of-the-art facilities.  The Government proposes a system of double inspections, double registrations and double fees, for which there is no need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coffey has made the fair point that if the Minister of State indicates he would facilitate what is proposed in these amendments, he could envisage withdrawing them.  He has given an undertaking that what is proposed in these amendments is based on veterinary advice and so forth.  These are practical amendments and I hope the Minister of State will accept them.  What the Minister, Deputy Gormley, proposes in this respect is to the detriment of the industry and will not instil confidence in it.  It is regulated already under the 1958 Act.  The fees and registrations applicable are regulated under that Act.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to give an undertaking that the fee, registration and the inspection aspects of the greyhound industry will be reviewed for Report Stage and, if he does so, Senator Coffey may consider withdrawing his amendments.  To impose a huge burden of second registrations, second fees and second inspections on the greyhound industry does not instil it with confidence nor does it augur well for it.  It shows that we in this Parliament are not displaying any confidence in a State board that has pumped millions of euro into this large industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>A tremendous relationship exists between greyhound breeders and their veterinary surgeons and this is recognised by everybody in the business.  Amendment No. 10 proposes that greyhounds should be exempt from the time limit of six litters subject to veterinary approval, which we consider to be a very acceptable amendment.  This is accepted practice.  If breeders are acting with the support of their veterinary surgeons, surely that should be sufficient.  There is no element of animal welfare concerned in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 10, as I stated previously on this matter, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is obviously not aware of the provisions in his own Bill.  He is certainly not aware of the situation with the cycle of bitches that are breeding, which we discussed at length last week.  The Minister is not aware of the situation.</P>
        <P>On the question of microchipping, a duplication, or possibly a triplication, of requirements is being proposed, because there is already provision for microchipping, ear tags and tattoos.  Instead of providing for animal welfare, we will be accused of causing cruelty to animals with all the requirements to be complied with under this Bill.  What is proposed is ludicrous and it is proposed by a Minister who is unaware of the rural way of life and certainly unaware about the breeding of dogs in this country, be they greyhounds, hunting dogs or any other dog.</P>
        <P>I have been told that Fianna F&aacute;il has a bundle of amendments to put forward but that they will be proposed in the other House.  If we are debating this Bill in this House, why are those amendments not being brought forward here?  We know that many Members of Fianna Fail are opposed to what is proposed in this Bill, but they are shackled by their colleagues in government in regard to the Bill before us and other obligations they have put themselves under in the new programme for Government.  That is the reason proposals such as the reasonable ones we have put forward have not been brought forward by Members on the Government side of the House.</P>
        <P>Are we going to let a small number of people dictate how policy towards rural life will operate in this country for many years to come?  It is disgraceful that this Bill is being pushed through in this manner.  The Minister was not even aware that there was a duplication of requirements in terms of this legislation and the 1958 Act when we raised it with him previously. <Col N="413"/> This is the type of legislation we are being asked to pass in this House.  The Minister is not aware of what is in the Bill and we are being asked to push it through.  It should not be allowed.  I hope that Members on the Government side of the House will use their good sense to throw out this Bill or to amend it in a proper manner because they will not be forgiven if they allow it to go through in its current state.  The people of rural Ireland will not tolerate this type of dictatorship.  That is what is happening in this Bill.  I hope the Fianna F&aacute;il Members will put forward their amendments in this House on Report Stage and have the courage of their convictions in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P><b>):</b> The Minister in his earlier contribution to the debate stated that he did not propose to accept the Senators&rsquo; amendments to sections 14 and 15.  The amendments taken together would have the effect of having two separate regulatory regimes for dog breeding establishments, one for the greyhounds and one for all other dogs.  This would create an unfortunate precedent in the legislation by making exemptions for particular breeds of dogs.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators are of the view that the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 addresses the welfare of greyhounds to a sufficient extent.  That Act is aimed at promoting the industry and does not expressly provide for the welfare of dogs.  I do not foresee a potential overlap between the Bill and the reference to breeding in the 1958 Act as it merely states that the Irish Coursing Club has responsibility for breeding and coursing.  This Bill promotes the welfare of the dog in the breeding establishments whereas the 1958 Act concerns itself with the regulation of the industry with no mention of greyhound welfare in the Act.</P>
        <P>Section 44 of the 1958 Act allows for investigation by authorised officers at the race track, race meetings or where greyhounds are on public sale.  However, it is important to note that the authorised officer&rsquo;s powers are limited to these said areas.  Section 46(1) sets out power of entry and inspection.  Again, the authorised officer&rsquo;s powers are limited to inspection in the vicinity of the race track, authorised coursing grounds, places where greyhounds are on public sale or places where greyhounds are trained for reward.  The authorised person does not have the power to enter and inspect the place where the greyhound is bred, kept or, indeed, trained as the provision only applies to an area where the training is for the purposes of reward.  It appears that the provision would not apply to the vast number of greyhound owners who train the dogs themselves rather than use the services of a professional trainer.</P>
        <P>The duties of operators of dog breeding establishments under section 14 are more comprehensive and reflect the purpose of the proposed legislation.  Article 12 of the greyhound trainers regulations, which has been quoted extensively in the debate, deals with the condition of kennels only.  Reference is made to the general layout, that the kennels are kept in a clean and good condition and that muzzles and feeding bowls are kept in good condition.  There is no provision made in respect of suitable food, drinking water, bedding, etc. in these regulations.  While I will give further consideration to varying the 12-month time period between litters in paragraph (<i>f</i>), subject to veterinary advice, it is my intention that section 14(<i>e</i>), the limit of six litters to each bitch, should remain in place as recommended by the working group.</P>
        <P>In regard to the issue of identification of dogs under section 15, the greyhound industry has a practice of marking each greyhound with a tattoo.  There is a view that this is sufficient and, therefore, greyhounds should be exempt from this provision.  It is difficult to support this view as the two forms of identification are completely different.  The microchip enhances traceability and enables access to the dog&rsquo;s details at any time in the State or outside it by an authorised officer, a veterinary surgeon, a dog warden or an animal welfare organisation.  This can only aid the process of improving the welfare of the dog.</P><Col N="414"/>
        <P>The aim of the Bill is promote, improve and protect the breeding conditions and welfare of the breeding dogs.  There are notable distinctions in this Bill from the 1958 Act which are the duties imposed on dog breeding establishments, the extensive powers conferred on the authorised officer to enter and inspect a breeding establishment, the ability to serve an improvement notice and the power of the local authority to serve a closure notice and require the operator to cease breeding or keeping dogs at the establishment.  Therefore, the proposed amendments cannot be accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I argued the last day that animal welfare in regard to greyhounds is covered by the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, the Long Title of which states: &ldquo;to provide for the reconstitution of the Irish Coursing Club and its recognition as the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds&rdquo;.  The Minister of State quoted the regulations which state:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(1) The kennels of any person applying for a licence to carry out the duties of a public or private trainer shall be inspected beforehand by a Control Steward or Stipendiary Steward, who shall report on the general lay-out, etc., to the Board.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(2) The kennels of a public or private trainer shall be periodically inspected by a Control Steward or Stipendiary Steward, who shall make a report to the Board.  If the Board is satisfied that the kennels are not properly kept, the Board may suspend or revoke the licence of the trainer concerned or take such other disciplinary action as it may deem necessary.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(3) Trainers shall ensure that kennels, muzzles, feeding bowls, etc., are kept in a clean and good condition.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">If that is not animal welfare, we must be speaking a different language.  Those regulations clearly spell out animal welfare issues.  If they are not adequate, as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government tried to claim in this House last week, and in doing so cast a slur on the organisation of and controlling authority in the greyhound industry, the proper and appropriate place to address that is in the 1958 Act under which the regulations and the inspection controls can be revised.  That is the appropriate place to do that rather than introduce another red herring, another Bill, more bureaucracy, more costs and more threats to the viability of an indigenous industry.  That is what is going on here.  It is about time we were up-front and were given the real reasons this is being introduced.</P>
        <P>The last day the Minister claimed he was not introducing this as a Trojan horse to carry out inspection of the greyhound industry.  From what I have heard today, I contend that is exactly what he is trying to do.  The 1958 Act is the appropriate legislation to address the issue of inspections and standards in the greyhound industry because it clearly outlines that the Irish Coursing Club is the controlling authority for the breeding of greyhounds.</P>
        <P>As Senator Burke stated, there will be court cases if there are instances of poor standards and solicitors will argue the case about which is the correct legislation under which to take an action.  Legislation should be clear, succinct and without ambiguity.  We are introducing ambiguity in this Bill.  We are introducing anomalies and duplication and we will cloud over a whole area.</P>
        <P>As I said the last day, we are taking from the fundamental basis of this Bill which is to regulate puppy farms.  We are detracting from the whole debate on them.  My colleagues in Fine Gael and I will continue to voraciously defend the rights of the Irish greyhound industry and its good name and reputation which was slurred in this House by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  We will put this amendment to a vote.</P>

	<P>The response of my colleague, Senator Coffey, was comprehensive and strong.  The arguments the Minister of State made in defence of the Minister&rsquo;s position and thinking have been undermined comprehensively by Senator Coffey.  The 1958 legislation, which has been referred to, can, if deemed insufficient, be amended to deal with any doubts, fears or queries which the Minister of State&rsquo;s office may have in regard to the greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>The most significant comment made by Senator Coffey, with which I fully concur, is that a number of sections of the Bill are distracting from what should be at its core and what should unite us all rather than divide us, namely, dealing with the puppy farm issue.  The Title of the Bill, the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, should be changed if we cannot make progress on these amendments because it is no longer just the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill.  It is quite clearly a thinly veiled attack on the greyhound industry.  We have seen this with other sections on hunt clubs, rural pursuits and rural sports.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the way Government works and that the Minister of State is simply reading the thoughts of the Minister into the record.  I do not believe what the Minster of State read is his own thinking.  Clearly, he is not being given any discretion on the matter.  It is disappointing that he is not at least in a position to say he will think further about our proposals before Report Stage.  Much of the time of the House is taken up with futile divisions, the outcome of which we know in advance.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to display a modicum of flexibility and common sense by indicating that he will cause his senior Minister, Deputy Gormley, to reflect on this matter.</P>
        <P>At a time when the country has grave economic problems and citizens expect the House to discuss the economy, unemployment and the housing and banking crises, it is disappointing that we are obliged to spend days discussing this legislation as a result of the inflexibility of the Minister.  He and a small group of people are attempting to use this legislation to lash out at aspects of rural life, including rural sports, with which they are uncomfortable.  If he wants to shut down hunting, let him introduce legislation and debate its merits with us.  If he wants to close down the greyhound industry, let him say so and set out his ideas because I am sure they will be roundly rejected by the Oireachtas and members of the public.  The Minister is using the legislation as a Trojan horse, a phrase I believe I patented on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should show some initiative and indicate that he will relay to the Minister in advance of Report Stage the views of Senators, including those from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  It would be ludicrous if, as a result of meanderings in the background, the Bill were fundamentally changed in the D&aacute;il.  This debate was initiated in the Seanad which is devoting hours and days to discussing it.  The Minister should, therefore, set out his final thinking on the matter in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to be a little more forthcoming, independent and original in responding to the comments made in reply to his initial intervention.  The statement he read could have been compressed into two lines, namely, that the Minister does not propose to change his mind and does not respect or accept the bona fides of the Irish Coursing Club or greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey outlined the legislative background to the regulations governing the greyhound industry.  That the industry has become so strong and developed into such an international success story providing significant employment must surely indicate it is doing something correctly.  The Bill will blow apart its good work.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect further on the position he has adopted and provide some hope that progress can be made and decisions reviewed.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P>The decision to hold a review in 12 months is a kick to touch of Ronan O&rsquo;Gara proportions.  We want something more immediate.  Will the Minister of State offer us something better on Report Stage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State indicated that the main reason he could not accept the amendments was that he did not want two different standards of regulation in place.  The Bill proposes that the greyhound and hunting sectors be subject to two different inspection, registration and fees regimes.  From what I and all those with whom I have spoken can see, the current regime serves its purpose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We do not have large numbers of complaints about inhumane treatment of greyhounds, certainly not in my part of the world.  While an issue arises regarding the humane euthanising of greyhounds at the end of their lives, the Bill does not propose any changes in that regard.  Instead, it clouds the issue by providing that an area that is currently governed by one Act will in future be governed by two Acts.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in this regard contradicted the current position.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford stated the House should discuss issues other than this at this time of economic crisis.  Everything comes back to the economy and the economic issues discussed daily in the House.  The greyhound industry is a vital part of the economy in rural areas and urban centres which have greyhound stadiums.  It is estimated the industry is worth &euro;560 million annually to the economy.</P>
        <P>Having listened to all the contributions made on Second Stage and Committee Stage, I note Green Party Senators have not yet spoken on Committee Stage.  I believe a small number of Green Party members promised their support for the renewed programme for Government and introduction of the National Asset Management Agency in return for the enactment of legislation on animal rights in a number of areas.  A former Green Party councillor whose name I cannot remember stated on &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; or Matt Cooper&rsquo;s radio programme on the evening before the Green Party conference to discuss the renewed programme for Government that the party would vote for the programme and NAMA on the basis that animal rights legislation would be introduced.  This Bill reflects that.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the Minister of State believes in his heart and soul the statement he read into the record a few minutes ago.  He, like me and many other Senators, comes from a rural area and knows the value of the greyhound industry and the rural way of life.  Like Senator Ormonde, I believe he can see the merit of the argument made by Senator Coffey in the amendments and the need to avoid duplicating the current system, as is proposed in the Bill.  We seek only that the Minister of State indicate that he is prepared, prior to Report Stage, to consider some of the amendments tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>When he spoke in the House on this group of amendments the Minister did not appear to realise that as a result of his proposals, the provisions of the 1958 Act will be duplicated.  That this would be the effect of the legislation did not appear to have entered his head until it was suggested by a number of Opposition Senators.  Perhaps some sense of reality will dawn and a thriving rural industry will be kept alive unhindered by this type of Trojan horse legislation, to use Senator Bradford&rsquo;s description of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to the Minister of State, I was reminded of a delegate to the county board in Cork, the late Mick &ldquo;Langton&rdquo; McCarthy, who, when he did not get his way, used to throw his hands up to heaven and ask: &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;  I must ask the Minister of State where he and the Government are going with this legislation.  It is extraordi<Col N="417"/>nary that having had light regulation in the banking sector, we are choosing to impose double regulation on the greyhound industry.  What does that tell us?</P>
        <P>Perhaps I am misreading the position but the greyhound industry &mdash; owners, breeders and trainers &mdash; must register stud dogs and mating, provide a declaration of litter and have an identification procedure for pups and the naming of adult greyhounds.  As Senators Bradford and Coffey mentioned, the 1958 Act covers the welfare and operating procedures of the greyhound industry.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, which I know is not his own, is disconcerting because it questions the control steward.  What does that say about the control steward and the industry as a whole?  Are we questioning the integrity of those involved in the greyhound industry?  The Bill fails to make a distinction between greyhounds and what I would term pet dogs.  I recognise the importance of animal welfare and Senator Bradford mentioned the mistreatment of dogs in puppy farms.  To put it in simple language, however, the Minister&rsquo;s arguments, not just today but in general, are weak, uninspiring and ill-informed.  In addition, they fail to recognise the way in which the 1958 Act governs the management of the greyhound industry in a variety of situations.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State seriously telling this House that the licensed trainer, owner, breeder and the greyhound industry&rsquo;s governing body are not in compliance with the 1958 Act and are not doing their jobs properly?  Is that what he is saying?  I appreciate that Fianna F&aacute;il Members are in difficulty over this matter, as is the Government, but the time has come for them to stand up for rural Ireland.  I do not represent a rural area, even though my origins are in rural Ireland, but I can see the benefits of the greyhound industry to this country.  Senator Burke cited the last Irish dog to win the Waterloo Cup and, in this regard, we should appreciate the employment the industry has created at greyhound tracks throughout the country.</P>
        <P>If the former Ministers, Joe Walsh and Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, were in Cabinet, I wonder if this Bill would be before us now.  Members of the Cabinet do not seem to appreciate the important benefits of the industry to this country.  This Bill is a bit like the over 70s medical card issue last year, which was not politically proofed.  Now that this legislation is in the second half of the 5.25 at Curraheen Park, so to speak, the Minister has discovered it has been caught on the last bend.  He will go back to the D&aacute;il and thus upset his Senators who are being forced to suffer the ignominy of voting for this Bill.  Meanwhile, their colleagues in the Lower House will vote through a different type of Bill.</P>
        <P>I wonder if, in preparing this Bill, the Minister of State read the submission by the Irish Greyhound Board.  I do not think he did.  He has an obligation to discuss this legislation further with the relevant stakeholders.  A working group was established to progress the Bill but, since introducing it, the Minister has listened to nobody.  The Opposition has put forward reasoned arguments, as have Fianna F&aacute;il Members, yet we have reached a roadblock.  It would be wrong to force Members to vote on the Bill when there is a better, alternative system.</P>
        <P>Are we seriously going to put jobs and millions of euro per annum at risk in this industry to appease a few people in the Green Party who do not necessarily understand the operation of the greyhound industry?  They see it in a certain guise through a prism which I am afraid to describe.  They are seeking an Ireland where everything is as they wish, but that is the wrong place to be.  This section of the Bill will have a profound impact, so I hope the Minister of State will have the common sense to withdraw it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, questioned the bona fides and integrity of all involved in the greyhound industry.  In my opinion that was an absolute disgrace.  Are we going to see the colour of his money by having some amendments from the Government side of the House?  Will there be any Government amendments to this Bill?  If not, we are wasting our time and should get on with voting on the important amendments <Col N="418"/>before us.  If that is the situation, it is regrettable that we will not have any input from the major party in Government.  It appears they are being dictated to by their Green Party colleagues in this regard.  They are lap-dogs, rather than greyhounds.  The Bill is being led by so-called animal rights figures.  We have heard that to get support for the NAMA legislation, people were brought on side by offering them legislation such as that which is now before us.  The Bill, however, is not worthy to be brought before the House because of the inaccuracies, duplication and cost to those involved.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is incredible we have not had Government amendments.  We have heard the reasoned thoughts of Senator Ormonde about the Bill but I am disappointed we have not had amendments from the senior Government party.  I understand the Minister of State is only reading what the senior Minister has given him, so his hands may be tied in that regard.  I do not think the Minister of State, no more than myself, believes that animal welfare is at the core of this legislation.  Well over six years ago, I was the first Member of this House to raise the question of puppy farms.  This legislation should have been confined to that matter, as it was supposed to be, rather than being extended to hunting, the greyhound industry and anything else the Greens might like to include.  If the Bill dealt with puppy farms, as it was supposed to, the Bill would have passed through the House in a couple of weeks.  However, that is not what it is about.  We are dealing with a Green Party agenda here &mdash; an anti-rural way of life agenda &mdash; and we are going to call its bluff.  We are also going to call the bluff of Fianna F&aacute;il on this.  Too many Fianna F&aacute;il Members are saying one thing &mdash; what they believe &mdash; yet they are prepared to run with the type of legislation put before us.  That is despicable.  It is probably time we called a vote on this.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 15, subsection (4), line 3, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 14(4) currently reads that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; issue guidelines on the operation of dog breeding establishments and the compliance by operators of dog breeding establishments with this Act.  The effect of amendments Nos. 11 and 12 would be that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; issue guidelines on the operation of dog breeding establishments and compliance by operators of dog breeding establishments with this Act upon this Bill being enacted.  If guidelines are to be regarded as essential for the motive and purpose of the Bill to be accomplished, it is essential for such guidelines to be in place on the enactment of the Bill so as not to delay any further the good effects of it.  People may also be assured of certainty in the implications of the Bill with regard to the regulatory and inspection regime that will apply to dog breeding establishments.  I hope the Minister of State will surprise me and give an answer in the affirmative, saying that at the very least the Government will look seriously at bringing forward an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 11 and 12 together and do not propose to accept either amendment.  Section 14(4) allows the Minister to introduce guidelines for the operation of dog breeding establishments.  As outlined in my Second Stage contribution, it is my firm intention to put these guidelines on a statutory basis after full consultation with the interested parties following the enactment of this Bill.  The consultation process will help to ensure the guidelines have as broad an acceptance as possible.  The proposed amendment No. 11 is therefore unnecessary.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 12 seeks to have the guidelines introduced upon the Bill being enacted.  Such a provision could be counter-productive as I am anxious to ensure the draft guidelines undergo full consultation prior to being signed into law.  It is not unusual for the primary legislation to provide for statutory guidelines and for such guidelines not to be in place on the enactment of legislation.  I do not deem it appropriate that the statutory guidelines may not benefit from the broad consultation and the critical analysis required to ensure they will be put in place upon enactment of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has reminded me of a story I heard about a man who went to his doctor and informed him that he thought he was Tom Jones, to which the doctor replied &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not unusual&rdquo;.  The Minister of State appears to use the phrase &ldquo;not unusual&rdquo; in order to justify the inaction of the Government.  It is clear the Bill need not take effect until such time as the guidelines are ready.  In such circumstances, it is no more than good administrative and governmental practice &mdash; no less than we should expect &mdash; that the Bill should come into force when the guidelines are ready.  There does not appear, from what the Minister of State indicated, to be any coherent or sensible reason as to why this should not be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>In the interests of clarifying the position, I wish to state that the Bill will be enacted but that it will not be commenced until the regulations are in place.  They will both, therefore, come into force at the same time.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 12 not moved.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite what the Minister of State indicated, this section will have serious implications for the greyhound industry.  The Minister of State said it will have little or no impact on the industry and that it is purely an animal welfare measure.  I have already outlined to the House that the 1958 Act adequately covers the animal welfare element relating to the control and standards which should apply in respect of greyhounds.  If that Act is inadequate, it should be amended and we should not be introducing further provisions by means of the legislation before the House.</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister of State and the House that the greyhound industry is worth over &euro;560 million per annum to the economy.  Almost 11,000 full and part-time workers are employed in this industry.  Some 77% of the dogs raced in the UK are Irish bred.  If this section, as it stands, is passed, it will mean that champion brood bitches that have already bred six litters will not be allowed to breed again in this country.  As a result, those bitches will be exported to another jurisdiction where they will continue to breed.  However, they will no longer be considered Irish brood bitches and greyhound racing in this country will be at a loss.</P>
        <P>An aspect of this which has not yet been discussed relates to the amount of money raised for charity &mdash; sporting clubs, good causes, hospital facilities &mdash; at Irish greyhound tracks.  Over &euro;7.5 million was raised for charity at Irish greyhound tracks in 2007.  The figure now stands at approximately &euro;7 million per annum.  That is an indication of the amount of money generated by the industry.  The legislation before the House, in favour of which Senators on the Government benches will vote, will have a major impact on that industry.  I remind those Senators and the Minister of State that people throughout the country are paying close attention to this debate.  They are listening to what is being said and watching how Members are voting.</P>
        <P>I have seen correspondence from Government Deputies and Senators assuring people in the greyhound industry that they will support and address their concerns.  There is no evidence of that in the House this evening.  Government Senators are voting against extremely reasonable Fine Gael amendments that are designed to protect the greyhound industry.  It has been brought to my attention that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, in an address to people from the greyhound industry who were attending an awards ceremony, assured all and sundry that the Bill would not affect the industry.  Is it the case that the Minister of State knows that amendments are going to be tabled in the D&aacute;il?  Such amendments should be introduced in this House, which has debated the legislation at length.  The Bill was initiated in the Seanad and this is the appropriate forum in which to debate amendments to it.  It would be a slight on the House if Fianna F&aacute;il has prepared amendments to the legislation but does not propose to introduce them until the Bill is taken in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>This section will sound the death knell in respect of the breeding of champion greyhounds in this country.  We will be opposing it on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us place this matter in perspective.  The greyhound industry is worth &euro;560 million and provides employment to 11,000 people on a full and part-time basis.  In addition, the export market relating to the industry is worth &euro;39 million.  Next week the annual festival will take place at Cheltenham, the Mecca of the horse racing industry, at which Ireland will showcase the talent of its horses and the sportsmanship and professionalism of its jockeys and trainers as being the best in the world.  If the Bill is passed, as Senator Coffey stated, many <Col N="423"/>greyhounds will be exported to other jurisdictions and will no longer be seen as part of the Irish brand.</P>
        <P>If the Government, the Minister of State and those opposite are happy with a situation whereby brood bitches from this country will be exported, then they should pass the Bill.  However, if we are serious about retaining the 11,000 jobs to which I refer and about supporting the industry, it is my contention that the Bill will do a serious disservice to the people in Cork with whom I am familiar who are involved in the industry.  These individuals are professional, are concerned with regard to their support and the industry and they want to ensure that excellent standards apply.</P>
        <P>I also heard about the comments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, in Limerick at the weekend.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, clarify what his colleague meant when he stated the Bill would not affect the industry?  Is it being stated that the people in the industry with whom I am familiar, namely, the Lynch family, Noel Holland, the O&rsquo;Callaghan family of Macroom, the McKenna family and Paul Hennessy, do not observe what the explanatory memorandum refers to as &ldquo;the duties of operators in relation to the conditions in dog breeding establishments&rdquo; or that they are not concerned about the industry or their sport?  I do not believe that to be the case.</P>
        <P>I beg to disagree with the Minister of State in respect of the 1958 Act.  I want the officials from the Department to take note of what I am about to say, particularly in view of the fact that they are driving matters in respect of this aspect of the legislation.  Those in the industry will be obliged to comply with regulations relating to the registration of stud dogs and mating practices, the declaration of litters, an identification procedure in respect of pups and the naming of adult greyhounds.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has a need to serve his constituency and to cater for some of his friends and supporters.  The Green Party has made a virtue of getting rid of political patronage and of refusing to accept corporate donations.  This legislation represents that party pandering to people in its niche market, namely, those who cannot distinguish between the different forms of greyhounds, dogs, hounds etc.  We are not discussing mongrel breeds.  This is about the industry.  The duties of the operator are well known to the Irish Greyhound Board and the associations of the owners, trainers and breeders.  They are also well known to those who act as control stewards and on behalf of the industry.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins made a very telling point: there is a relationship between the greyhound owner, the trainer and the vet that does not apply in any other part of the dog industry.  The explanatory memorandum reads, &ldquo;Section 14(5) provides for the Minister to invite representations on draft guidelines, consider representations received and publish guidelines in relation to dog breeding establishments&rdquo;.  Has the Minister engaged with and met people involved in the greyhound industry?  Will the Minister of State tell the House whether he has done so?  If he has, what was the outcome?  What was the nature of the deliberations?  Has he taken on board what was said in any part of them?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State, as the second man in charge, prepared to approach the Minister on behalf of the Members of this House, some of whom are members of the same party as the Minister of State and spoke admirably in favour of the Fine Gael amendments but went through the lobbies to vote the other way?  I hope changes will be made.  By his renunciation of the amendments, the Minister of State is casting a slur on people involved in the greyhound industry.</P>

	<P>Thank God, you did not.  Whether we like it, the Bill is an attack on the greyhound industry.  There are people involved in it who provide employment, take the Irish name worldwide and make the country proud.  If the Bill is allowed to pass as it stands, we will tell a different story, whether the Minister of State and the Members opposite like it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 14(2) reads, &ldquo;The operator of a dog breeding establishment shall keep such records as may be prescribed at the dog breeding establishment and shall make them available for inspection by an authorised person or the local authority&rdquo;.  What is meant by an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;?  Who will this be?  Is it a vet, a dog warden or anyone involved, or supposedly so, in animal welfare?  Could it be someone involved with the animal liberation crowd?  I have spoken about their activities and involvement in this country and the threats they have made to people involved in the industry and breeders.  Ordinary decent dog breeders are afraid of them.  The Bill will mean having the names and addresses of establishments and everything else on show for them to examine.  No wonder those involved in the greyhound and dog industries are concerned about having their names and registration details on public display.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State aware of what the Minister of State, Deputy Power, meant when he spoke at the function last week?  I suggest it is an abuse of the House if the proposals and promises made at that function are not discussed here.  We have not even received an indication from the Minister of State that the amendments will be introduced on Report Stage.  Was the Minister of State, Deputy Power, merely preaching and saying what people wanted to hear, <Col N="425"/>while we in this House have nothing with which to back it up?  That is what is happening.  It is an abuse of the House if one Minister of State tells the greyhound industry that changes will be made, while in this House, when there is an opportunity to make those changes, amendments are not tabled and there has been no indication they will be tabled on Report Stage.  If that is the case, it is an obvious abuse of and slur on the House.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State indicate what his feelings are on this matter and state whether the Minister of State, Deputy Power, was correct in his assertion that the Bill, as proposed, would not be passed, as significant amendments would be made?  If that is the case, when will the amendments be tabled?</P>
        <P>These are questions which should be answered in the House.  If we are to be treated with contempt, let the Minister of State say the amendments will not be introduced in this House but may be introduced in the other House.  Otherwise untruths have been told to those involved in the greyhound industry.  We need to be clear and above board in the House.  The Minister of State should tell us, the industry and the breeders of dogs, irrespective of whether they are hunting dogs or pets, exactly what is going on.  Otherwise we are being treated with contempt.</P>

While I am disposed towards accepting Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment, I must give it further consideration in consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel.  The amendment would have the effect, as does the present draft subsection, that all dogs would be required to be microchipped while in the establishment.  However, it may offer additional clarity.  I will revert to this with an amendment, if appropriate, at a later Stage.  As I have indicated previously, this Bill is about transparency in the industry, about providing a level of protection to dogs and breeding establishments and about providing assurances to customers regarding <Col N="427"/>dogs&rsquo; welfare.  By ensuring that all dogs in such establishments are microchipped before leaving the establishment, the legislation will greatly encourage the maintenance of proper standards.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 15, lines 41 and 42 and in page 16, lines 1 to 5, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P><Col N="428"/>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(1) The Local Authority may designate such and so many of its officials and/or veterinary practitioners who are employed by the Department of Agriculture as &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There is much concern regarding the definition of the &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; who will be involved in the inspection regime put in place by the Bill.  Section 16(1)(<i>a</i>) states that a local authority may appoint veterinary practitioners.  We would not have a problem in this regard, as vets have qualifications and backgrounds in this area.  It is section 16(1)(<i>b</i>) that has caused the greyhound industry and dog breeders significant concern.  There is no clear definition of an authorised person.  Rather, the Bill states: &ldquo;persons connected with animal welfare with whom an arrangement has been entered into under section 15(3) of the Act of 1986&rdquo;.  This definition is too vague and many people are concerned that &ldquo;persons connected with animal welfare&rdquo; could mean anyone.  What qualifications and backgrounds would these persons have?</P>
        <P>Many genuine people are involved in organisations such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, but I suggest these organisations have been infiltrated by animal liberation extremists.  I will not name names but it is a real concern that people who have been involved in sabotage and in threatening people who are involved in country sports are also involved in these organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What evidence does Senator Coffey have for that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Senator evidence in a few moments.  There is an obvious concern that the provision to employ people connected with animal welfare will allow people without qualification, from any background and whose involvement in illegal practices or threatening behaviour has not been checked, to carry out inspections.  It is a matter of public record that people who are involved in animal welfare in Ireland have connections with people who have criminal records with regard to animal liberation in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  I can present evidence of this if I am required to do so.  </P>
        <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is real concern among greyhound breeders about these people, who make no secret of their intentions and have said they would like to see an outright ban on greyhound racing.  A number of months ago, the website of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals stated that the society&rsquo;s long-term objective is to have greyhound racing banned in Ireland.  These are the people to whom the Bill would give authority to inspect people involved in the greyhound industry.  If the Bill, as currently drafted, is passed there will be neither objectivity nor fairness in the inspection process.</P>
        <P>I do not cast aspersions on everyone connected with animal welfare.  Much good work is done in this area.  However, a minority is enough to do damage.  That is what people are afraid of.</P>
        <P>Inspections must be carried out in an objective, fair and professional manner.  While Opposition Members have no objection to veterinary practitioners inspecting dog-breeding premises, we are not happy with the very broad and vague definition in the Bill of &ldquo;persons connected with animal welfare&rdquo;.  The Minister must address this matter, which is of grave concern to those in the industry.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael amendment proposes to delete the subsection which includes among those who may be authorised to carry out inspections &ldquo;persons connected with animal welfare&rdquo;.  We propose to clarify that definition by substituting the following, &ldquo;The Local Authority may designate such and so many of its officials and/or veterinary practitioners who are employed by the Department of Agriculture as &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;</P><Col N="429"/>
        <P>The Minister of State comes from a rural constituency.  He knows that farm inspections are carried out by people who are under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and who are accountable to their employers, the Department and to the Oireachtas.  We would prefer to see the definition of authorised persons fully clarified.  They should come from the same categories as those who already inspect farms or are veterinary practitioners.  That is a reasonable and practical proposal.  People who are known to have problems with the dog-breeding industry and whose views of the industry are known not to be objective cannot be allowed to inspect it.  Such people cannot be given the power to close down breeding establishments.  That is a real concern and that is why we have tabled this amendment.  People whose backgrounds have not been scrutinised cannot be appointed as inspectors.</P>
        <P>The greyhound and dog-breeding industries deserve more clarity and definition.  We ask the Minister to consider this reasonable amendment.  All law should be easily enacted and easily enforced.  We do not want to create further divisions in our society and further problems for industries which are indigenous and up-and-running.  We want an inspection regime which people can stand over and is authorised by the Department.  Anyone who is given authority to inspect must have a proper and clear background.  The definition in the Bill does not allow for that.  I ask the Minister of State to address this matter.</P>
        <P></P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the amendment proposed by Senator Coffey.  The people involved in the dog breeding industry have a great love of animals and a commercial interest in the maintenance of the highest standards.  They police their establishments very well.  When I met them the issue about which they expressed greatest concern was this section of the Bill.  That is why I indicated to my colleague that I wanted to speak on this amendment.  </P>
        <P>Those involved in any inspection process, no matter what aspect of life is being inspected, should be entitled to due process, objectivity and a fair system in which they can have confidence.  If people from animal rights groups carry out inspections they may, in a number of cases, endeavour to be fair and get it right.  However, people in the industry will not believe they are objective or fair and will feel threatened by them.  This will give rise to a sense of alienation.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey described very well the range of people within the animal rights movement.  We applaud the many wonderful volunteers in the animal rights movement but this does not make them suitable to become inspectors.  The Bill requires a qualified and objective inspectorate which is outside the industry stakeholders.  Nursing homes, for example, could not be inspected by members of an interest group in that area.  This is a bizarre concept.  I do not know how it was ever thought of.</P>
        <P>Animal rights activists have a particular position.  In some cases they take an adversarial position towards particular breeders.  It would be bizarre to set such people up as an inspectorate.  This is reminiscent of Stalinist Russia and is not acceptable.  A legal case might arise as a result of such a system.  We have established due process and natural justice and a system where people have rights, an appeals process and objective standards.  That is why we would accept veterinary surgeons as inspectors.  They are familiar with legislation, they deal with animals on a regular basis and understand the establishment.  We would also accept designated officers within the employ of county councils although in an ideal world all inspections should be carried out by veterinary practitioners employed by the Department.</P>
        <P>The idea that one would accept an amateur person without training, however well intentioned, to inspect breeding establishments does not bear thinking about.  I hope the good sense of the Minister will prevail.  Even if he does not accept the wording of Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amend<Col N="430"/>ment I hope he will accept the principle that such an inspection regime would be bizarre and table a Government amendment on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister wants to eliminate puppy farming.  No one objects to that.  If that had been the sole objective of the Bill it would have been unanimously passed in 20 minutes.  That should be what we are about.  Surely that is objective No. 1 but objective No. 2, in so far as this relates to the regulation of the commercial dog breeding sector, should be the creation of harmonious regulation, a satisfactory <i>modus vivendi </i>and a working structure that will go on into the future.  Surely it is not to start conflict from day one.  Whoever thought this up should be awarded a PhD in idiocy.  It does not bear thinking about and given the Minister of State is a solid country man, he will immediately identify that.</P>

	<P>I am absolutely flabbergasted by the Senator&rsquo;s conduct.  He will not even let me speak now.  He is a bully.  He has not allowed me to speak.  If he had listened to what I said, he would have heard me say that thankfully, he qualified his point.</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley on the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is almost 25 years since the Control of Dogs Act, to which the amendment refers, was passed and there have been no difficulties.  The two previous speakers in referring to those involved in animal welfare mentioned Stalinist Russia and said they are unable to carry out their duties.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly stated he would have no problem dealing with somebody appointed by the local authority but this is provided for in the legislation.   He agreed fundamentally with what is in the Bill.</P>
        <P>There is no need to vilify animal welfare inspectors.  The Senators have done nothing but engender fear among those who are regulating&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Senator said I clarified the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need to bring fear into animal welfare.  This is what we should be worried about, not that anybody has any interest other than the welfare of animals.  That is what we should concern ourselves with.  The amendment, therefore, is not necessary.  We should have faith in those who work for our local authorities and who were appointed on the basis of their suitability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a part of me that wonders how I can follow Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s histrionics, given she overreacted to what Senator Coffey rightly said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should address his comments through the Chair and to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>This section is a gross insult to the greyhound industry and dog breeders, as Senator Coffey said.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley should have taken time to read the explanatory memorandum, which refers to those connected with animal welfare.  I agree with her that we should have a serious debate and the Bill should fundamentally be about animal welfare.  Everybody accepts the requirement of duty of care in respect of animals but I challenge the hypothesis put forward by the Senator that those who purport to be concerned about animal welfare have only animal welfare as their concern.</P>
        <P>I would love to hear Green Party Members on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Senator to comment on their unwritten statement of intent to get rid of the greyhound industry.  Senator Coffey tabled a reasonable amendment, which calls for the designation of an official or veterinary practitioner by the local authority to become the authorised person.  Given the Government, of which the Minister of State is a member, has imposed a prohibition-embargo on recruitment to the public service, where will these personnel be drawn from?  Who will be the designated officer?  Will local authorities have to transfer officials from the roads, environment and planning sections to staff the newly created posts?  What does that say about the control steward or the veterinarian?</P><Col N="432"/>
        <P>The Government uses the great phrase &ldquo;will liaise&rdquo; a great deal.  The excellent debate pack presented by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service refers to the issue of enforcement and its cost.  If, for example, Cork City Council or Cork County Council say they do not have the money and cannot engage in enforcement and they refuse to carry out this function, what happens then?  The cost of enforcement, according to the debate pack, &ldquo;will vary according to the circumstances of the local authority functional area&rdquo;.  Will that be the case?  Legislation is meant to be balanced and fair and the same for all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s colleague was.  She lost the plot a little.</P>
        <P>I refer to the level of compliance, the method of enforcement and who will be the authorised person because the definition of an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; is not clear.  I appreciate where Senator O&rsquo;Malley is coming from.  Many people involved in animal welfare have the right intention and are well motivated.  I may fundamentally disagree with them and abhor what they attempt to do in some cases.  We need to clarify the point at issue.  I cite the example of  the former manager of the Cork greyhound track, who is now retired.  Is he eligible to be an authorised person or is a member of one of the groups concerned with animal welfare who communicates anonymously with us by e-mail or letter eligible to be an authorised person?  Have the veterinary officers in each local authority area any role to play in this?  Will they be the authorised persons in this respect?</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey asked what duty the ISPCA will have.  Many interpretations could be taken from the wording of the section.  It is considerably vague and it needs to be clarified.  I did not catch all of what the Minister of State said on this section but I gather he referred to the fact that the Minister was willing to engage.  That is strange given that up to now there has been no willingness on his part to do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State misinterpreted my question when I asked about the level of consultation.  I asked and ask again in the context of this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am speaking to the amendment.  I apologise for using the wrong terminology.  Subsequent to the publication of the Bill and to the working group&rsquo;s recommendations in the interim report, did the Minister or officials or agents of his engage with people involved in the greyhound industry?  Was there clear engagement subsequent to the publication of the Bill?  </P>
        <P>If we allow this section, as currently worded, to be passed, we will change the goalposts for every other Bill that will have a detrimental and knock-on effect on other industries.</P>
        <P>Senator Reilly referred to nursing homes and this is a valid point.  I have no vested interest in the greyhound industry.  The point that has been missed on the other side of the House is that in this section we are talking about economics, tourism, sport and approximately 11,000 jobs.</P>

	<P>When I served on Galway City Council we had a difficult time in this area because we had only one dog warden to deal with the issues related to dogs.

        <P>Under this amendment tabled by Fine Gael, it is extraordinary that well qualified country veterinary practitioners could not be employed in regard to this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct.  It is only veterinary partitioners who are working for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Private veterinary practitioners, as laid out by the Bill, are well qualified people with many years experience as veterinarians.  They have worked with dogs all their lives and are well respected by the greyhound industry and every other industry.  It would not be possible for local authorities to employ those people.</P>
        <P>It is also extraordinary that Fine Gael, which currently controls most of the local authorities is considering that it would be unacceptable to have the double safeguard of a local authority appointing a country veterinary practitioner and that country veterinary practitioner being suitable to the local authority.  That is not possible under this amendment unless that person is employed by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  This amendment is nonsense.  That is what is needed.  This Bill will allow people who have a great deal of experience in the area of dog control to work in that area.  It will allow local authorities to appoint such people.  There is a safeguard in the Bill.</P>

	<P>It states that &ldquo;the Local Authority may designate such and so many of its officials&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Cork local authorities, about which Members spoke, have such well qualified officials but are we talking about taking somebody from water services and putting them into dog control?  This is nonsense.  Many local authorities do not have suitably qualified officials.  If they have such officials, the difficulty is they are already working flat out.  That is the reality in every local authority.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is suggesting that local authority officials, who are working flat out, and Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food veterinarians, who are also working flat out and not able to cope, should be used for this purpose.  The section suggests something very sensible, namely, that anybody who is suitably qualified as a veterinarian or anybody known to the local authority who is suitably qualified and has been involved in animal welfare for years may potentially be designated as a person suitable for inspections.  This amendment is farcical and the section should stand as it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the debate and read with interest the Minister&rsquo;s proposals and a lighter thought struck me.  Our former colleague &mdash; I do not believe we can name people &mdash; who left the employment of this House and her political party some weeks ago because she felt her party leader was not providing for her proper employment prospects, would be a possible contender to be deemed an authorised officer under this section.</P>
        <P>If we had dealt with section 17 in advance of section 16 and if we had deliberated on the powers of the authorised officer, which are very substantial and far-reaching, we would have tread very carefully when we debated who could take up those positions as authorised persons.  As we said on Second Stage, the designated authorised persons will have significant responsibilities, significant discretion and significant decision-making entitlements.  That is why it is important we are happy with the people who will hold the title &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I agree with a previous speaker in regard to the thinking behind the Fine Gael amendment.  Since we began discussing the legislation some weeks ago, the main concern expressed by this side of the House and by speakers on the other side of it is that while there is something very laudable about the backdrop to the legislation and while we all support the necessity to regulate and, if necessary, shut down puppy farms, there is a fear that somehow written into the Bill are sections which could impact negatively on some of our traditional country pursuits and county sports, in particular.  We must, therefore, try to be a little bit cautious in how the legislation is written.</P>
        <P>There is a possibility of a coach and four being used in regard to the appointment of authorised officers.  Not only can the local authorities appoint authorised officers but as we see with section 15(2), they can allow other organisations to appoint them.  Authorised officers will not only be appointed by the local authority.  The local authority can enter into an agreement with other organisations which can appoint authorised officers.</P>
        <P>On the basis that we are talking about a position which has great responsibility and great powers, it is crucial that Members of this House and all those affected by the legislation, in particular those who must work within the rules and regulations laid down, are content and comfortable with those appointed as authorised officers.  The Fine Gael amendment prescribes that veterinary practitioners only be allowed to carry out these duties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It also states officials of the local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>As with any amendments tabled, the wording may not be 100% perfect.  If the Minister of State is willing to accept the spirit of our amendment, minor drafting details can be resolved.</P><Col N="437"/>
        <P>Everyone must recognise that the way the section is written could, in theory, provide for any person to be appointed as an authorised officer.  A previous speaker asked whether it was likely that local authorities would allow any person to be appointed.  The answer is that we do not know but the legislation allows for that possibility.  We need to tighten up on that possible cause of dispute.</P>
        <P>As this debate has progressed, it is disappointing that we have moved further away from the starting point which was everyone&rsquo;s unanimous view that puppy farming should be tightly and properly regulated and that some of the scare stories we have heard should be no more.  However, some of the excessive phraseology in the legislation is leading to a little difficulty in that regard.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider carefully our suggestion.  In response to early queries, he said there would be a review in 12 months.  For this legislation to operate in a way that satisfies all and causes no further doubt as to its impact in its early stages, it is important authorised officers satisfy any doubts by virtue of their qualification and veterinary expertise.</P>
        <P>Section 15(2), which allows a local authority to enter into an arrangement to appoint so many members of staff to be authorised persons, needs to be redrafted.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board our amendment which, despite all the drama of the past half an hour, is a sensible check which will allay fears.</P>
        <P>I accept the majority of Members want to put in place legislation which is worthwhile, workable and has no hidden agenda.  Any loose sections which could be abused and misused must be amended.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board what is our very reasonable amendment which will make life easier for all of us in trying to support this legislation.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment.  As the amendment makes perfect sense, I do not understand Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in&rsquo;s comments.  It proposes that local authorities should be able to appoint as authorised inspectors officials such as litter wardens who double up as dog wardens and are known as community wardens or by similar names in certain local authorities.  Such persons and veterinary inspectors employed by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are a wholly appropriate group of people to be employed in the inspection of dog breeding premises.</P>
        <P>It is almost unbelievable that if passed the Bill will allow people with a direct and specific interest in this area to carry out inspections of dog breeding premises.  Inspections should be carried out by someone who is independent and removed from the argument surrounding the issue.  Community alert and neighbourhood watch committees do not and should not investigate crime.  The proposed measure is similar.</P>

These are strong powers to grant to people who may be directly involved in the process.  For this reason, the amendment should be accepted.</P>
        <P>I know many people who are involved in animal rights groups and do not have any objection to them.  They are thoroughly decent and sound people.  I have, however, listened to people such as this character, Bernie Wright, who represents an animal liberation organisation and whose stated objective is to end dairy farming and trout fishing.  Such individuals will be eligible to be appointed as authorised persons if the Bill is passed without amendment.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is directly related to the amendment.  Under subsection (1) a local authority may appoint as authorised persons veterinary practitioners and any persons connected with animal welfare with whom an arrangement has been entered into under section 15(3) of the Act of 1986.  Subsection (2) goes further and reads: &ldquo;A body with which a local authority has entered into an arrangement under section 15(3) of the Act of 1986 may, after consultation with that local authority, appoint such and so many of its members of staff, as it considers appropriate&rdquo;.  Under this provision, if a local authority decides to subcontract the entire process of inspecting dog breeding facilities, the subcontractor may, following consultation with the local authority &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; appoint whoever it wants to be an inspector.  In those circumstances, anyone can be appointed an inspector.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael Party amendment is simple and straightforward and seeks to limit persons who may be involved in the inspection of dog breeding facilities to individuals employed by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or local authorities.  It would make common sense to accept it.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="439"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose the Senator&rsquo;s proposed amendment which would have the effect of excluding those connected with animal welfare from being appointed as authorised persons.  It is important to remember that this provision continues the good practice provided in section 15 of the 1986 Control of Dogs Act whereby a local authority may enter into an arrangement with persons connected with animal welfare.  This provision has been helpful to local authorities and has been implemented responsibly.  For this reason, the continuation of the provisions of section 16 should not give rise to concern.</P>
        <P>I restate the provisions in the 1986 Control of Dogs Act.  Under section 15(3) of the Act, &ldquo;a local authority may enter into arrangements with any other local authority, or with the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or, with the consent of the Minister, with a person connected with animal welfare, for the exercise of all or any of its functions&rdquo;.  This provision has enabled the proper functioning of the Control of Dogs Act and allowed local authorities to enlist the assistance of expert advice and assistance in their duties.  I am not aware of any instances in this jurisdiction where the activities of any person used by local authorities have been successfully challenged or of any cases of abuse or misuse of the position.  I am somewhat concerned, therefore, as to the reason there is such opposition to the extension of a practice that has been in place since 1986.</P>
        <P>Senators have raised the fears expressed to them that extreme animal rights activists would inveigle themselves into being appointed as authorised officers and this would enable them to invade dog breeding establishments.  This scenario is somewhat fanciful.  Local authorities are well aware of the responsibilities attendant on the appointment of an authorised officer under the Bill and are likely to be careful in respect of those persons they appoint.</P>
        <P>It should be a matter of reassurance to Senators that the provisions in the Bill have been in place in a similar form since 1986.  The dog statistics compiled annually in the Department indicate that over the years, approximately half of local authorities have subcontracted significant elements of the dog control functions to animal welfare organisations, generally the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  That so many local authorities have built up a long-term relationship should reassure Senators that they will only act responsibly in appointing authorised officers and that such authorised officers will act responsibly in the performance of their duties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The amendment is a genuine attempt to provide a clear definition of the term &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;.  To clarify the matter for Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, a local authority official can be a veterinary official of that authority, accountable to that authority and fully responsible.  A departmental veterinary official is already accountable to the Minister and Department for which he or she works.</P>
        <P>The wording of the Bill is too vague.  It states that an authorised person can be a person connected with animal welfare under section 15 of the 1986 Act.  However, as other Senators noted, following consultation with the local authority, a member of a voluntary charitable organisation may be appointed as an authorised person.  I reiterate that the majority of such organisations do great work which I admire but there is a significant risk that they will be infiltrated by any Tom, Dick or Harry given that any person may be appointed an inspector under the terms of the Bill.  Such a scenario would pose a major threat to the well-established dog breeding industry.</P>
        <P>I do not have a problem with proper scrutiny of puppy breeding establishments and the introduction of appropriate standards.  The rogues who have given the industry a bad name should be rooted out.  While the Fine Gael Party supports these objectives, the Bill, as drafted, proposes to give enormous powers to people about whose background and qualifications it does not provide clarity.  The amendment provides a clear definition of an authorised person in requiring that he or she be a local authority official or a veterinary officer of the Department <Col N="440"/>of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The latter already visit farms as part of their daily work.  Rather than placing an additional burden on the Exchequer by appointing additional officials, as proposed in the Bill, to enter farms and places where dogs are bred, the amendment would ensure this function is captured under the inspections carried out by departmental veterinary officials.  It is a reasonable amendment which attempts to introduce clarity, objectivity and fairness, all of which are important in due process and law.  I am addressing real concerns about the industry.  I have stated there are people involved in animal welfare organisations who have a dubious track record with regard to animal liberation and pose a threat to individuals legitimately involved in country sports, including hunting and greyhound racing.  Those involved in these rural pursuits are not breaking any law; they are only doing what previous generations did.  They are concerned that the Bill will affect the viability of these pursuits, in the process threatening their existence.  I can appreciate their concerns, which is why we have tabled amendments to protect an indigenous industry that dates back many generations.</P>

        <P>On the point concerning costs and whether local authorities will be in a position to meet the financial demands, Senators will be aware that the legislation provides for a charge on dog breeding establishments, which runs from &euro;400 for an establishment with more than 12 bitches and up to &euro;3,000 for those with 200 bitches.  There will be an income stream to local authorities which have such breeding establishments in their catchment areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has mentioned an income stream for local authorities.  On Second Stage, former Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca said that, even with the proposed charges, local authorities would have a shortfall in excess of &euro;1.6 million.  I do not know how these two items can be married because, while the Minister of State is saying there will be an income stream, there will still be a shortfall.  There are double standards; the right hand does not seem to know what the left hand is doing.  The former Green Party Senator told us that there would be a deficit of &euro;1.6 million, but the Minister of State says there will be an income stream, as if extra moneys will come in to the local authorities and there will not be a shortfall.  We are at sixes and sevens.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply to my question about the cost of enforcement, I wish to quote an example.  In the response to a parliamentary question Deputy Varadkar was told that the revenue accruing from the sale of dog licences in 2007 was &euro;2.9 million, while the cost of delivering the local authority dog control service was &euro;5.4 million.  Therefore, as Senator Cummins said, there will be a shortfall.  What will happen when that occurs?  A local authority will arrive at a point where it will not be able&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one observation to make on the amendment.  Given that there is a punitive dimension to the Bill with significant fines for non-adherence to its provisions, surely inspectors will have a quasi-judicial function.  Since they will have to be objectively independent, a court case is possible in this regard.  It does not add up.  I hope the Minister of State will respond to this point.</P>

	<P>On the funding of authorised inspectors and the cost implications of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is moving away from the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment concerns how authorised persons will be resourced, either by the local authority or the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The Fine Gael amendment clearly refers to staff already employed in either of these agencies.  Departmental inspectors are already visiting farms; therefore, it is a matter of restructuring the system to allow for inspections of puppy farms.  I am suspicious and concerned that the greyhound industry and other sectors are being used to fund this inspection regime, when, in fact, they are already being inspected and pay licence and registration fees.  I am concerned that the reason the greyhound industry is included in this legislation is it is seen as a mechanism to fund the inspection regime under the Bill.  I certainly hope that is not the case, but perhaps the Minister of State can clarify the matter.</P>

<P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
   
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in mentioned the appointment of staff as authorised persons by local authority members.  I do not think members of local authorities have appointed any staff to local authorities since the time of rate collectors, or at least since the time of sheep dipping committees when sheep dipping inspectors were appointed.</P>
        <P>Section 16(2) mentions &ldquo;[a] body with which a local authority has entered into an arrangement under section 15(3) of the Act of 1986&rdquo;.  How does the Minister see this working?  Will the people appointed be full-time members of local authorities, or will they be appointed on an agency basis?  The Minister said when he was here that this would be self-financing in view of the extra fees that would be charged, including two fees charged to the Irish Greyhound Board along with two inspections.  Does the Minister see these authorised persons being appointed on a part-time basis, or will they be full-time employees?  Who will they be reporting to?  Will they report to the chief veterinary officer of the local authority?  This is an important point.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned some agencies from which people could be appointed, such as the ISPCA.  Could the Irish Greyhound Board or the coursing clubs, for example, propose people for appointment as inspectors?  Senators Coffey, O&rsquo;Reilly and others mentioned an important point with regard to the independence of the inspectors.  All local authorities currently use their own staff, such as veterinary officers, to inspect abattoirs and so on.  These people are truly independent and they should be the ones who conduct inspections.  I cannot go along with the appointment of inspectors from vested interests by the local authority, whether on a full-time or part-time basis.  The regulations accompanying this section should state that the full-time staff of the local authority from the veterinary section will be the authorised persons to carry out such inspections on farms.</P>
        <P>This is important in view of what could happen further down the road.  The greyhound industry in particular represents off-farm income for many farmers.  There is an issue with regard to the spread of animal diseases among pigs, poultry and other farm enterprises.  Diseases such as brucellosis could be carried from farm to farm.  It is important the chief veterinary officer of the local authority is really in charge and that the people employed as inspectors are full-time employees of the local authority.  No representatives of vested interests, whether from the ISPCA or the greyhound or coursing industries, should be carrying out inspections.  The veterinary officers in my local authority area, whose work I have observed over a long period, have always been truly independent.  That is the way it should be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The point made by Senator Burke about the spread of diseases is of importance.  Proper practice should be observed in this regard.</P>
        <P>I will not labour the point, but I would like a response from the Minister about the possibility of a challenge to the legislation.  I genuinely fear a challenge on the basis that people with a vested interest cannot act as objective inspectors.  I fear that the appointment of a person from an animal rights group could be open to challenge, given that there are significant fines involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the comments of the previous two speakers.  I would prefer the inspectors to be staff of the local authority, who know the area.  They are professionals.  We have all worked with local authorities and we know their veterinary departments.  These are the professionals who should be vetting anything to do with animal welfare.  No outsiders should be brought in.  It should be left to the local authority; they have control and they know the area.</P>

	<P>I ask those who have spoken on this Stage and earlier Stages of the debate to replace the word &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; with &ldquo;children&rdquo; and then make the same arguments.

	<P>The first person mentioned in section 16 is a veterinary practitioner and there is a follow-on from that.  That has been the experience to date in local authorities.</P>
        <P>To respond to the question that there may be a challenge, I said earlier that I am not aware of any instance in this jurisdiction where the activities of any person used by local authorities has been successfully challenged or where there has been any case of abuse or misuse of the position.  That is after almost a quarter of a century during which the legislation has been place.  It has been effectively implemented by the local authority system.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke raised the matter of staff.  Different local authorities would have different levels of activity in dog breeding in their jurisdictions and catchment areas.  Some have very limited dog breeding establishments and some may have a large number.  It will be a matter for local authorities to establish the level of activity in the area and the appropriate response.  It may be a part-time position in some areas and it may involve an existing officer dealing with dog welfare.  A vet or an authorised officer may also be appointed on a part-time or full-time basis.  It will be a matter for the local authority to establish the need to respond to the level of activity in the catchment.</P>

	<P>We have given this much discussion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  We are told the costs will be neutral to the Exchequer but will the Minister of State clarify that to the House?  I quoted an example earlier relating to dog licences, where &euro;2.9 million was raised in 2007 with a cost of operation at &euro;5.4 million.  Will the Minister of State outline to the House the cost of this and who will incur that cost?</P>
        <P>I will revert to my earlier fundamental point despite protests from the Members opposite.  What happens where a local authority may not be able to provide the service as outlined?  I am concerned on a number of levels about the cost.  I do not mean to pre-empt the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply but he has the potential to ask the greyhound owners, trainers and breeders to foot the bill for this.  Is that the intention?  What will the cost be and will there be an annual licence fee increase?  What difficulties does the Minister of State see in the administration of the scheme and could there be a case where there will be a loss of revenue to the local authority?</P>
        <P>I would like to see the cost structure being properly outlined and explained.  There must be proportionality in the process.  I appreciate that the fees cannot all be outlined in the Bill but will they be reasonable relative to the costs for the industry?  The Minister of State should respond to the issue as there are significant implications for the industry.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for clarification on the section.  He stated that it is up to each local authority, when they have gauged the number of people who have registered, to decide on the appointments with the veterinary surgeon.  It can go down the other route of employing a body like the ISPCA and entering into a contract.  That body may be better organised on the ground and the local authority could contract it to work on its behalf.  That is my reading of what is in the Bill and what the Minister of State has said.  There are two routes the local authority can travel; it can do it on its own or employ a body like the ISPCA.</P><Col N="447"/>
        <P>Once it goes down the route of employing a body and entering into a contract, will the body report annually to the local authority?  Will the body charge a fee to the local authority?  How does the cost work out where the local authority farms out the work to a body like the ISPCA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the local authority retain control even if it delegates responsibility?  Will the body used report to the vet of the local authority or to the senior personnel?  That is a very important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>There were a couple of points.  There is an opportunity for the local authority to second or contract the services of a body.  That is the position in many local authorities currently under the Control of Dogs Act and some of these were outlined by Senator Boyle.  That is an existing practice.</P>
        <P>With regard to involvement of the local authority, it is worth mentioning that there has been no challenge in this jurisdiction under the legislation I mentioned, which has been in use for almost a quarter of a century.  There has been no case of abuse or misuse of a position.  There is a good track record from people who have been employed by the local authority under the Control of Dogs Act.  This legislation concerns the welfare of dogs, although many other issues have been brought into the debate.</P>
        <P>I outlined the fees earlier and they are contained in legislation.  It would require a change in legislation to alter the fees.  Where 12 bitches are kept, the fees are up to &euro;400.  For more than 200 bitches, the figure is &euro;3,000.</P>
        <P>We expect that the new system in respect of dog breeding establishments will be cost neutral to the Exchequer.  The provisions relating to increasing dog licence fees will only reduce the losses local authorities incur at present in the context of providing dog control services.  The new charges for licence fees will raise an estimated &euro;4.3 million.  This compares with a figure of &euro;2.8 million in 2008.  The cost of the service in that year was &euro;5.7 million.  Local authorities are currently meeting their responsibilities under the legislation relating to the control of dogs from within existing resources.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) remove without warrant any animal from premises which he or she has reasonable grounds for believing are being used for the operation of a dog breeding establishment, if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that such removal is necessary for the protection of the welfare of such animal,&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  Section 19 provides for a closure notice to be served on an establishment if there is a serious or immediate threat to public health or animal welfare.  Section 19(2)(<i>b</i>) enables a local authority to require an operator to rehouse all dogs.  In addition, it provides that such removal be at the operator&rsquo;s expense.  Non-compliance shall be an offence.  The proposed amendment makes no reference to who will pay for the removal and, therefore, it would likely fall to the local authority to absorb the costs.  I am also wary of pre-empting the provisions of the animal welfare Bill which is being prepared by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment would alter section 17(2) in order that it would read:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">When performing a function under this Act, an authorised person may, subject to any warrant under subsection (4), be accompanied by such . . . members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or such other persons as may be necessary for the purpose of assisting the authorised person in the exercise of his or her functions under this section and the authorised person, member or any such other person may take with them into the premises such equipment as they consider to be necessary.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There are two aspects to the amendment.  The first is the idea that once an authorised person is entering a premises, he or she might be accompanied by certain other individuals who might be necessary for assisting him or her in the job he or she is obliged to do.  The second aspect is that the authorised person and those accompanying him or her should be allowed to bring onto such premises any equipment that is deemed to be necessary.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I listened with great interest to colleagues&rsquo; impassioned contributions on the subject of authorised persons and bodies with which local authorities might enter into arrangements which might, in turn, nominate authorised persons.  It is clear that there is a long-established practice of involving third parties or agencies with a track record in the field of animal welfare.  What is important is that we should not involve those with a negative agenda of a generalised and prejudicial kind in respect of the establishments or owners thereof which they are supposed to be inspecting or visiting.  Once a local authority has responsibility for nominating authorised persons of a particular status and as long as there must be an authorised person on the premises, the necessary protections are in place.  If an issue were ever to arise in that regard, the Minister and the Houses would have the capacity to deal with any mischief that might arise.</P>
        <P>Once an authorised person is going onto a premises, he or she must be in a position to do his or her job.  To fulfil his or her duties, an authorised person might be obliged to bring cutting equipment, for example, onto a premises.  If the legislation is to have any meaning or efficacy, then provision should be made in respect of the possible scenario to which I refer.  An authorised person might also be obliged to bring with him or her individuals who would be technically deemed not to be authorised.  In that context, would veterinarians not employed by the Department or a local authority, those employed by the emergency services or whomever be considered, in technical terms, as being unauthorised?</P>
        <P>This is a reasonable amendment, particularly in light of the fact that anything which occurs on a premises would take place under the watch and in the presence of an authorised person.  On that basis, I hope the Minister of State will accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendment is unnecessary as section 17(2) does not limit the number of other authorised persons that can accompany an authorised officer in performing his or her functions.  Furthermore, the legal advice is that it is not necessary that it be stipulated in the section that such persons may take equipment with them.  I do not, therefore, propose to accept the amendment.</P><Col N="449"/>

	<P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 19, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(7) A person who fails to comply with an improvement notice or a direction of the District Court under this section shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I am hopeful of a much better turnout in support of this amendment.  It seems, as a matter of public policy, that a responsible political party, particularly one which has the luxury of supporting such amendments from the Opposition, must support an amendment that would simply have the effect of promoting respect for a decision of the District Court and an order for improvement.</P>
        <P>Section 18 establishes the procedure for improvement notices but fails to establish any offence for failing to comply with such a notice.  The implied threat may be that failure to comply will result in a closure notice but that may be seen as draconian in the specific circumstances.  Therefore, such a closure notice might be revoked on appeal.  Therefore, it seems that, for this legislation to have proper effect and be properly applicable, it would be more effective if there was an equivalent of what we find in section 19(2)(<i>e</i>) which states a closure notice may contain the statement, &ldquo;If the operator of the dog breeding establishment concerned contravenes the closure notice, he or she shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  Section 19(7) provides that a &ldquo;person who contravenes a closure notice or a direction of the District Court under this section shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Sauce for the greyhound is surely sauce for the pup.  I would have thought that, if it was appropriate to include such a provision in section 19, it was also appropriate to include it in section 18.  Why is it that a person who fails to comply with an improvement notice or a direction of the District Court will not be guilty of an offence but that a person who fails to comply with a closure notice or a direction of the District Court in that regard will be?  In view of the need for consistency, apart from anything else, the amendment cannot be rejected.  Surely those who have difficulties with aspects of the Bill and what it requires by way of a regulatory inspection regime cannot have a difficulty with the rule of law, a decision of the District Court or a requirement that people comply with whatever orders are made.  I propose the amendment on that basis and I will ask for a vote on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The effect of the proposed amendment, while well intentioned, might be too draconian.  The Bill has been carefully drafted to provide for an escalation of measures.  It is not envisaged at this point that non-compliance with an improvement notice would constitute an offence.  Rather, it would be a matter for the local authority to move towards enforcement of the notice by making an application to the District Court to have the establishment removed from the register under section 18(<i>d</i>).  It is thought that the threat of removal from the register would have the desired effect on the operator.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that local authorities would build a relationship with dog breeding establishments operating in their functional areas to ensure implementation of appropriate welfare standards.  We must allow breeding establishments the space to implement the measures outlined in the improvement notice.  Section 18(2)(<i>c</i>) provides for a stated period in which the improvement notice must be implemented.  The notice can be appealed to the District Court within seven days of serving the notice.  If the notice is ignored, the local authority can progress to a closure notice under section 19.  A person who contravenes a closure notice will be guilty of an offence.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s response and although I like some of the people involved I am likewise disappointed with the response of the main Opposition party.  It seems to be bad public policy to deliberately turn down an amendment that would have the effect of providing that a failure to comply with an order of the District Court would be an offence.  As the Minister said on section 18 and the improvement notice, it is not just a matter of what an authorised officer may decide, it is a matter that may end up before the District Court in the event of the improvement notice being appealed to the District Court and the District Court might make an order in favour of what the authorised officer decided.</P>
        <P>I have great difficulty with the decision to not provide that it would be an offence to fail to comply with the order.  What seems to be happening reminds me of the famous phrase from scripture that the meek shall inherit the earth, but the Government&rsquo;s approach in this case is &ldquo;the meek shall inherit the earth if that is alright with you fellows&rdquo;.  The Government does not seem to have the courage of its convictions on the Bill if it does not require that in the event of non-compliance with an improvement notice a person would be guilty of an offence and that a District Court order should be required.  On that basis I regret that the Minister will not accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>An improvement notice is issued by a local authority.  A balance has been struck.  A dog breeding establishment can appeal the decision to the District Court.  Then there is the threat of removal from the register.  It is intended that each local authority would build up a relationship with dog breeding associations.  In most cases they are responsible bodies.  The ultimate sanction of the court order is available.  The amendment is too draconian and what is in the Bill is more balanced.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek further clarification on this point.  It is clear from the legislation that two scenarios could arise; I propose that failure to comply with an improvement notice would be an offence.  The legislation provides that the person may appeal the improvement notice to the District Court.  The implication is that the District Court, as is clearly laid out in the legislation, may affirm or revoke the notice.  The legislation as drafted does not provide in this section that where the District Court makes a decision on the improvement notice that has been the subject of an appeal that it would be an offence at that point to fail to comply with an order.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will happily withdraw the amendment if the Minister gives me a commitment that he will either bring forward or accept an adjusted amendment, which would at least require that it would be an offence if a person fails to comply with an order of the District Court on an improvement notice.  I accept there is a distinction between a failure to comply with an improvement notice order from a local authority or from an authorised officer.  If you will pardon me mixing my animal metaphors, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, it is a horse of a different colour to suggest that it would not be an offence for a person to fail to comply with an order of the District Court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the point being made by the Senator but I do not wish to see failure to comply with an improvement notice turned into an offence.  It is not an offence.

    <Title>Community Development.</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>On 25 November 2009 the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs gave the go-ahead to start winding down and closing 180 community projects.  Twenty to 30 of those projects are already closed down, supposedly as part of a review procedure.  I understand 11 are appealing to the Labour Relations Commission through their union.  </P>
        <P>The funding for community development programmes is ring-fenced for 2010 but the uncertainty sets in thereafter.  The programmes accept that funding will pass through the county integrated structures and have no problem in that regard.  They merely reasonably seek that it remain ring-fenced for them, as they fear this will become a blunt instrument otherwise.  As matters stand, projects have two weeks until the end of March in which to devise the work plan that will mean that from the end of this year they will no longer own their own premises, any minivans for which they fund-raise or youth clubs they might build.  This is mad and wrong and community groups are annoyed by it.</P>
        <P>I will cite two community projects in County Cavan, namely, South West Cavan Community Development Project Limited and the Community Connections Community Development Project as examples of best practice.  South West Cavan Community Development Project Limited has helped 64 community groups.  It has helped them to draw down funding to acquire personal alarms for older people or help in the establishment of cr&egrave;ches and child care facilities.  A recent notable case is the child care facility at Ballymachugh which is of a very high standard.  The community development projects have provided facilities across all age groups and social classes, both in built-up areas within their remit and more isolated locations.  One notable contribution is made by the Rural LIFT transport project which also is very strong in the area of west Cavan in which the Community Connections Community Development Project operates.  It also has a newsletter and a number of good projects.</P>
        <P>It is worth mentioning that community development projects are equally effective and necessary in inner-city Dublin and other inner-city areas.  Consequently, this is not simply a rural affair but also affects urban areas in great need.  It spans age groups and all scenarios.</P>
        <P>Community development projects have already experienced two budget cuts which they have accepted in the context of the times in which we live.  Consequently, my proposition does not pertain to additional moneys, nor does it constitute a whinge about the loss of existing moneys which can be argued a separate occasion.  The projects seek the security of knowing that money will be ring-fenced for them in the future.  Consequently, they do not seek extra funding and accept the cuts laid out for them.  An important point is that they have no problem with the money passing through the integrated county structures.  They simply request that the money <Col N="453"/>being paid to them and which has been ring-fenced for 2010 will continue to be so ringfenced in 2011 and 2012.  They wish to be able to plan for the future and have security and fairness.</P>
        <P>Nationwide, community development projects have had great achievements in respect of individuals, community groups, youth groups, older people, children&rsquo;s groups, cr&egrave;ches, rural travel schemes, inner-city development and so on.  Such achievements have been secured across the entire gamut of human activity and range of voluntary activity.  Interestingly, 2,000 volunteers participate in projects being supported by community development projects.  The people involved who have such major achievements to their credit are highly reasonable, committed to what they are doing and have the requisite expertise.  Incidentally, it also is worth mentioning that there are strict auditing structures, involving annual auditing and strict efficiencies.  As a result, there is no question of money being wasted or of malpractice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not seek additional budgets or to upset a plan to pass moneys through the county integrated structures.  Similarly, there is no lack of auditing or proper financial practices.  I only seek to ensure the future security of community development projects.  In other words, the voluntary personnel and groups they support in urban or inner city areas nationwide should have the security of such support and knowing that such coalface activity will continue on an ongoing bass.  Essentially, that is my proposition.  I, therefore, ask that the money be ring-fenced for community development projects at the same level as previously and that such funds be allowed to pass through the county integrated structures.</P>

        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and welcome the opportunity to update the Seanad on the current position on the new local and community development programme.  As Members will be aware, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established in 2002 against a background of concern at the multiplicity of structures and agencies through which local and community development schemes and programmes were delivered.  It inherited a number of local and community programmes with diverse structures which had been operated under the aegis of several Departments.  Clearly, there was an inherent danger of fragmentation of services and the diffusion of resources.  The cohesion process initiated by the Department a number of years ago to address these issues resulted in a significant reduction of local delivery structures for a range of rural and local development programmes.  Until last year, there were almost 100 partnerships or local development companies and Leader companies in operation.  The cohesion process has resulted in that number being reduced to a total of 53 entities providing full county-wide coverage across the country.  However, the Department still has a wide agenda of reform to advance.  The next phase which is under way concerns improving and joining up the outputs of programmes, as well as further consolidating structures.</P>
        <P>As has been outlined previously in both Houses, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has perceived the need to redesign the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, and the community development programme, CDP, drawing on best international practice and to support their ongoing evaluation.  The LDSIP and the CDP were that Department&rsquo;s two main social inclusion and community development programmes and were delivered through separate local delivery structures.  These programmes came to an end on 31 December 2009 and were superseded by a new programme, namely, the local and community development programme, LCDP.  The aim of the new programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between the Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  The LCDP preserves elements <Col N="454"/>of good practice from the CDP and LDSIP programmes and will enhance monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.</P>
        <P>An implementation strategy, involving the stakeholders, is under way for the LCDP roll-out in the course of 2010.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has set out a model for integrated service delivery and structures at a local level which would involve, among other things, the reconstitution of the voluntary boards of the CDPs from the end of 2010.  It has taken care in the implementation strategy for the new programme and allowed more than enough time to ensure the objective of integrated service delivery can be achieved.  The Department and Pobal are providing a range of supports to ensure the process is successful.</P>
        <P>I am aware there is opposition among some CDPs to the model for integrated service delivery and structures at local level set out by my Department.  However, maintaining the <i>status quo</i> was never an option given the issues relating to the delivery of the old programmes, the concerns of the Committee of Public Accounts about the multitude of structures in the system, the criticisms in the McCarthy report and the current budgetary reality.</P>
        <P>Our aim is to preserve and protect the volunteers on the current boards of CDPs by giving them new roles on advisory councils for the programme locally without the burden of company law requirements.  This will reduce significantly the level of reporting to my Department and the Companies Registration Office, CRO.  It will also have the useful spin-off of reduced overheads for audits, payroll and other back-office costs and will maximise the impact of available funding at the front line.  However, it has been conveyed to CDPs and local development companies that if better models are proposed by them, these will be accepted as long as they achieve integrated and cost effective service delivery.  It is also important to note that no decisions are required on any of these issues until mid-2010 at the earliest.  Even then, the objective will be to secure local agreement on all issues before any final decisions are taken or implemented.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have been able to ring-fence funding for community development projects for 2010 and to maintain it at 2009 levels.  In few other areas of public spending has it been possible to do this.  The Senator will appreciate that ongoing funding for 2011 and beyond will be subject to budgetary considerations at the appropriate time.  Neither is it possible to speculate on any terms and conditions attached to the LDCP funding that is to be made available to the local development companies from 2011 onwards.</P>
        <P>My overall aim is to ensure that, notwithstanding the difficult budgetary position, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme and better integrated actions.  As previously indicated, my primary concern in this most difficult economic climate is to make every effort to ensure the front-line services provided by or supported through my Department, especially those focused on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities, are protected and to minimise overheads and ancillary costs.</P>

	<P>While I fully appreciate that this is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s brief, I am anxious that he convey my opinion to the Government and the relevant Minister.  We are not referring to not sending funding through the local county structures.  There is no problem in that regard or concerning the reductions.  Rather, we want the funding to be spent by the CDPs and given to them directly.</P>
        <P>If something is not broken, why fix it?  The CDPs are doing a significant job and are properly audited and managed.  Their process can be transparent and money would go through local <Col N="455"/>structures.  The proposal is not tenable and I ask the Minister of State to bring this message to the relevant Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to place this motion before the House.  I welcome the Minister of State and compliment his fortitude on this marathon day in the House.</P>
        <P>The motion before us is about the need for a national plan on rare diseases.  I pay tribute to the Irish Platform for Patients&rsquo; Organisations, Science and Industry, IPPOSI, which has done considerable work alongside other umbrella bodies and organisations.  According to IPPOSI, &ldquo;to be considered rare a condition should not affect more than a limited number of people out of a whole population&rdquo;.  Herein lies the difficulty.  Given the rarity, fewer voices are calling for help.  For this reason, we need a national plan for rare diseases.  I pay tribute to Deputy Stanton who raised this matter with the Minister for Health and Children in the Lower House last week.  It is important we create awareness.</P>
        <P>IPPOSI has identified three large hurdles faced by patients with rare diseases, those being access to correct diagnosis, a lack of information and scientific knowledge and access to treatment if it exists.  Living in the 21st century, it is important we recognise the steps humankind has taken.  We put a man on the moon, yet there are people who are unable to get an answer as to why they are sick and why they are unable to identify what is wrong to find a treatment.  As we all know, delays in access to treatment have a detrimental effect in some cases, setting back patients&rsquo; recovery.  It is important we provide a national plan that outlines practical solutions, puts research at its heart, allows patients access and provides for them.</P>
        <P>Speaking at a recent conference entitled Patients and Researchers: Partners for Life, the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, recognised: &ldquo;that for rare diseases, the plans and strategies have to integrate the various elements of care including diagnostics, treatments, rehabilitation, access to drugs and information and that this will involve a national plan to bring all these strands together&rdquo;.  We need a cohesive plan and I urge the Minister of State to put one in place as a matter of urgency.  Those living with rare diseases live with uncertainty and the unknown.  We must provide them with as much help and as many practical outlets as possible to make their lives the best they can be.</P>
        <P>According to the figures provided by IPPOSI, 3% to 5% of our population, approximately 140,000 people, are affected by rare diseases.  Professor Eileen Treacy stated: &ldquo;Inherited metabolic disorders are 2-3 times as prevalent in Ireland as they are in the UK&rdquo;.  This statement underlines our need for a national plan for those living with rare diseases.</P>
        <P>In June, the EU Council of Ministers recommended a concerted action across the EU by 2013.  Given the conference speech given by the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, it seems that the plan is only in preparation.  In the Lower House last week, the Minister for Health and Children discussed the need for a plan and preparation.  Many organisations and groups aiding those living with rare diseases in their day-to-day lives are in serious fear.  We should be able to assist in the sourcing of treatment but we cannot in many cases because there is no national plan.  I am asking the Minister of State, as the Government&rsquo;s representative, when the plan will be published and whether it will fully address the three hurdles identified by IPPOSI.</P>
        <P>As with all aspects of life, we must provide hope, assistance and, most of all, knowledge.  Every body of work and knowledge on rare diseases has, at its core, the demand for greater collaboration.  We must identify and link centres of expertise in the field of rare conditions to <Col N="456"/>assist people.  I hope the Minister of State&rsquo;s response will contain a positive outcome and that a national plan for people with rare diseases will be delivered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The European Union has been developing an action framework in the field of rare diseases.  Ireland has supported the proposals in this area which concluded with a Council recommendation in June 2009.  The key elements are that member states, including Ireland, develop plans and strategies for rare diseases and that this be completed by the end of 2013.  In the context of a proposed rare disease plan for Ireland, this will include actions in a range of areas.</P>
        <P>The national plan will need to consider the appropriate information systems for rare diseases.  There is added value in adopting international definitions for rare diseases and to learn the lessons on the most appropriate registries that can be used to plan and manage services.  The identification of centres of expertise for rare diseases will be a key priority under the plan.  Allied with this is the organisation of suitable health care pathways so that patients and professionals know where the most appropriate care can be provided.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, it will be important that the identified centres and reference networks link in with their European counterparts on all these issues including health care professional training.  The development of a research infrastructure with appropriate financial support is a further priority. This is an area where there is obviously added value in working with our European partners on programmes for rare diseases research.</P>
        <P>In November 2009, two important documents were launched, the action plan for health research prepared by the health research group and the Health Research Board&rsquo;s strategic business plan.  While each document has its own particular focus, taken together they represent a coherent and complementary approach to building a health research system that will see Ireland become a leading international centre for world class health research.</P>
        <P>Research represents hope for many of the rare disease patients who are without cure today.  In Ireland, many people are affected by a rare disorder, but many more individuals could unknowingly have a rare condition.  Having a national rare disease plan would be an important step towards establishing a systematic and co-ordinated approach to dealing with some of the many challenges posed by rare conditions.</P>
        <P>Access to orphan medicines is an issue which is key to effective clinical management. In Ireland the elements exist to have a transparent process to ensure equitable access to orphan drugs as well as to incentivise orphan drug development through our strong pharmaceutical and bio-tech industry in this country.  Because of the small market, investment in medicinal products and devices for people with rare diseases is limited. As a result, the price for many of the treatments is such that it is impossible for them to meet conventional criteria for cost-effectiveness.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has asked the HSE to explore a mechanism whereby a ring-fenced drugs budget could be put in place to cater specifically for people with other rare diseases.</P>
        <P>The action plan for rare diseases adopted by the Council of European Union will provide the basis for our national plan.  The Minister is encouraged by the recent joint conference on rare diseases organised by IPPOSI, GRDO and MRCG and that there is strong support from all stakeholders for this development.  She would like to acknowledge this as well as the support from individual disease organisations and industry.</P>
