	<P>I have received notice from the Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the long-term position of both Lifford Community Hospital and the Rock Hospital, County Donegal, and clarify if these hospitals will be subject to closure in the future.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ciaran Cannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to indicate the reason work has not commenced on phase 2 of the Loughrea regional water supply scheme, County Galway, considering that it was listed as a scheme to start in 2007.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to make a statement on the future role of F&aacute;ilte Ireland training centres in providing training courses for people who are unemployed in Cork, Dublin and Waterford and make reference to the 2007 to 2009 figures.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re National Economic and Social Forum and National Centre for Partnership and Performance, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2010 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to resume at the conclusion of No. 1 and adjourn at 1.30 p.m., if not previously concluded; No. 3, statements on job creation, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m., on which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons; No. 4, Prohibition of Depleted Uranium Weapons Bill 2009 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.  The business of the House shall be interrupted between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, has the House decided to change the time for Private Members&rsquo; business from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.?  It was always held at 5 p.m. but for the past two weeks has been held at 5.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, last week&rsquo;s arrangement was agreed by the leaders because the Minister would not be available until 5.30 p.m. and we wanted to give him two hours in the House.  Apart from that, it is always from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Private Members&rsquo; business between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m today?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it will be between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., as stated clearly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>With due respect, the Leader&rsquo;s comments are incorrect.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges has decided that on weeks when the House does not sit on a Tuesday, Private Members&rsquo; business will begin at 5.30 p.m.  The reason is that if it were to start earlier, with the long Order of Business, the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and other Members would not get to contribute to the debate.  On weeks when the House sits on Tuesday, it will begin at 5 p.m.  Last week, owing to a problem with a Minister, there was an agreement with the Whips that on that occasion it could begin at 5.30 p.m. as a one-off.</P>

	<P>A question for the Leader, please, not for any other Member.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This is serious, given that we have such critical issues that must be dealt with.  Yesterday we discussed the banks, job creation and the critical decisions that need to be taken to ensure credit starts flowing.  This morning Fine Gael placed a copy of the report, TF &mdash; A Case Review 1983 to 2002, on the Order Paper.  I want the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, with special responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, to attend the House today to explain why this report was not published by the Government.  I, therefore, propose an amendment to the Order of Business that time be allocated today for a debate on the matter.  This case review, published by Fine Gael today and laid before both Houses, concerns a young woman who died in care.  She had come to the attention of the child protection services at eight months of age.  We have heard much about children who die in care, of which there have been 20.  We have heard about the Murphy and Ryan reports on historical child abuse.  This report effectively documents what is happening in our child protection services today.  It is most serious that the Minister has not published this report and it is appalling it has taken eight years from the death of this young woman to have the report made public.  It is appalling the Government has not published it but sought to keep this report secret, even though the Minister of State with responsibility for children has said it is in the public interest that reports such as this are published.  It is equally disturbing that in this report there are 48 recommendations about child protection.  Have these 48 recommendations been implemented and, if not, why not?  If it is in the public interest for the author of the report to make these recommendations, surely it is in the public interest to ensure they are published.  It is important that Senators and Deputies get an opportunity to <Col N="235"/>debate these recommendations.  We have spent much time in this House talking about historical child abuse; this report is about modern child protection and how it is run in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a sad reflection on the Taoiseach and the Government that this report has not been published and that it is eight years since the child died after an appallingly sad and difficult life.  I move an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister comes to the House to discuss this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Broadcasting Act was passed last year and one aspect of it concerns paying for the regulation of local and national radio through a levy imposed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  That is not unusual &mdash; it is regular and correct that those being regulated should pay for regulation.  However, following the most challenging year in the history of broadcasting, with a reduction in the budget of RTE amounting to &euro;80 million, staff cutbacks and cutbacks in costs, where measures had to be taken to remain in business, it is beyond nature, beggars belief and is completely unfair and inexplicable that the authority has issued a levy to increase costs for local and other radio stations.  This order was issued in the last week of January and either of the Houses of the Oireachtas have 21 days to annul it.  I ask the support of the Leader and his party in recognising that it if this goes through it will lead to more job losses and cutbacks at local level for local radio and national radio.  This is inexplicable, unfair and unacceptable and we should take a stand to recognise what is happening on the ground.  I ask for the views of the Leader on this.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is discussing it and it is the view of most committee members, including Government members, that this should be put on hold.  The only way this can be done is by annulling the proposal.  I will be proposing a discussion on this issue on the Order of Business next week.</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on the first item on today&rsquo;s Order of Business, although I do not object to it.  This is reducing three quangos and nobody objects to that.  The House should know that the functions of these quangos must be done somewhere else and this must be explained.  The public is under the misconception that one can cut back on quangos and everything will continue.  This is like not answering phones or not doing something else.  Someone is not receiving a service if everything that was done is not being done now.  I do not object to what is being proposed and I will support it eventually but there is the issue of having it explained to the House.  We are now dissolving the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership &amp; Performance in the dissolution order.  I do not object to this.  The functions will be taken over by the National Economic and Social Council and this must be explained and debated.  I will go along with it but I would like time to debate the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment proposed by Senator Fitzgerald calling for a debate on this most disturbing report, which is of deep concern to all of us.  In 2010, with all the revelations and reports we have had, we are still seeing such immense failings in our child protection system.</P>
        <P>I also seek a debate on banking on a day when the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> states AIB will impose a 0.5% hike in mortgage rates, causing immense hardship to many consumers.  The reason for this increase is that the bank has posted enormous losses of &euro;2.3 billion for 2009.  We know why this is so, the bank over-lent and gambled on risky developments.  It holds assets of &euro;21 billion linked to property and construction and is facing 1,000 job losses.  The most bitter pill for the taxpayer to swallow is that the Department of Finance has stated the Minister for Finance cannot do anything about the mortgage rate hikes even though we know <Col N="236"/>there will be a race to the top as other lenders raise mortgage rates.  We need a debate on this.  We have put billions of euro into these banks yet the Department says the Minister cannot stop them raising their interest rates, nor can he get the banks to increase credit and lend to small businesses in need of credit.  We need an urgent debate on this.  It is a very strong argument for the Labour Party&rsquo;s policy of nationalisation of the banks.  It is most disheartening to see the Green Party fiddling while the economy crashes and burns and to see the parliamentary party of the Green Party playing pass the parcel with ministerial offices and the spoils of office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik would like that parcel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik would like the hassle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is most unedifying.  In the criminal system there is much criticism of the rotating door in the prison system.  It would be more damaging to see a rotating door in the Cabinet as Green Party Ministers come and go out of office in order to give everyone a share of the spoils.</P>
        <P>I also ask for a debate on third level education.  As someone who has been involved in third level education for many years, I was very concerned at reports of concerns about grade inflation.  We need to debate this as a matter of urgency to ensure there has not been unjustified inflation in grades.  We must also take on board concerns of Google and other big employers, particularly on a day when we are debating job creation.  There is a difference in grade structures across different disciplines and we must be mindful of this.  Generally, grades in the sciences, mathematics and engineering tend to be higher because the scale used for marking is broader and goes up to 100, whereas in arts and humanities we do not tend to mark that high.  There has been pressure on many universities to raise grades at the top end in the arts and humanities faculties because externs are telling us to do this.  We must consider this in the context of international comparisons and the differences between the disciplines in third level.</P>
        <P>I also ask for a debate on women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  The Leader indicated he would provide an answer on today&rsquo;s Order of Business on whether we will have that debate next Tuesday.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Boyle tweeted on it &mdash; it must be important.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senators who have said child protection is one of the most important issues facing the House.  I support the calls for a debate in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator vote with us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>He will change his mind again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senators Bacik and Fitzgerald for the Minister of State to come to the House urgently to discuss the frightening case of the child who was moved between 20 bed and breakfast establishments.  That is how the HSE looked after her before she eventually died.  It is appalling, even though so much time has passed, that the Government has still not published the report.  How will we ever learn if we do not debate and find ways to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations?  I urge the Leader to give this matter his utmost attention and find ways to ensure such a scenario never happens again.  If a child is taken into care, the unfortunate mother who is unable to look after him or her puts her faith and trust in the State.  In this case, we reneged and let her down.  We left her in a situation where her child died.  She is one of many.  It is a terrible indictment of the State that we do not care for the most precious, our children.  I urge the Leader to give the matter urgent attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement last night by the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy John Curran, of the Government&rsquo;s intention to ban the sale of certain substances in head shops.  This is a welcome development.  I understand they will be banned under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  It could take up to three months to do this but I urge him to do it sooner than that, if possible, because vulnerable young people are being drawn to these shops every weekend.  These substances cause horrific harm and damage to them.  I compliment those who protested outside head shops and, in particular, pay tribute to Members who have been calling for the past two years for these shops to be closed and the substances they sell to be banned.  I also thank those who contributed to the recent debate.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and-or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to debate the difficulties the new TETRA digital communications system which is routed through Garda station masts is causing for television reception?  I raised the matter last week and ask the Leader to schedule a debate, if not before the break for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, as soon as possible afterwards, because this is causing a great deal of concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments about the BAI.  It is extraordinary that it should bring forward a proposal for a 30% increase on its 2009 budget.  Many small radio stations are on the margins and it is peculiar that the body charged with the guardianship of their interests should place them at risk.  It is a little like upward only rent reviews.</P><Col N="238"/>
        <P>Will the Leader keep the House informed of developments in the investigation into possible Garda leaks relating to the forced resignation of Deputy Trevor Sargent?  If, as the newspapers are reporting, the information was maliciously released by a source within the Garda, it should concern every decent and honourable parliamentarian.  This would not be the first time for such an event to happen.  During the 1997 presidential campaign a Garda file on the brother of one of the candidates, Mr. D&oacute;nal de R&oacute;iste, was released at a time when it was calculated to do damage.  This is serious because cannot have the police force interfering in the political life of the country.</P>
        <P>As we meet, Ezra Nawi is appearing in the High Court in Jerusalem for the hearing of an appeal against his conviction for an assault on two Israeli soldiers during an illegal demolition of Palestinian housing, despite the fact that the newsreel film showed him clearly taking stones from some of the Palestinian protestors while saying, &ldquo;This is a peaceful protest&rdquo;.  He disappeared inside the house being demolished; two soldiers went in after him and he emerged dishevelled saying, &ldquo;Please, do not beat me,&rdquo; yet the judge, in a remarkable echo of the Denning judgment, preferred not to face the appalling vista that the police were lying, even though other policeman had previously lied in similar cases.  This is a campaign, as described yesterday by a colleague, &ldquo;to silence a democratic voice&rdquo; in one of the only democracies in the Middle East.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Wilson&rsquo;s comments regarding head shops and the fact that the Government has moved quickly in this regard, particularly the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  The Government made a decision yesterday and it is about time these shops were closed.  The issue was highlighted on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; on Monday night which gave some idea of the problem but the programme was not greatly balanced because no Government representative was in attendance to explain what we were doing in this regard.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Will the Leader arrange a monthly review in the House of State companies in order that we can discuss relevant issues?  For instance, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, now known as the injuries board, was established by the Oireachtas in 2004 and is operating well.  It was supposed to operate without a State subsidy but in 2008 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment allocated &euro;820,000 to it, while in 2007 the sum allocated was &euro;438,000.  These amounts were related to legal costs in the case of O&rsquo;Brien <i>v</i>. Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  These issues should be discussed in the House.  The Leader was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which was very much involved in the establishment of the board.</P>
        <P>Regular reports should be made to the House by State bodies such as the Dublin Airport Authority, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the National Roads Authority in order that we can discuss issues affecting them because there is a vast pool of talent in the House which should be exploited and utilised to a greater degree.  We should discuss issues with the appropriate Minister and make suggestions for the development of these organisations, given that we have such an excess of talent in the House which is bursting at the seams&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I join Senator Fitzgerald and others in asking for the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs to come to the House as a matter of urgency.  It is extraordinary, given that the Government is supposedly concerned and holding <Col N="239"/>a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights, that we have had a failure to protect children amid secrecy.  When will the Minister publish the report mentioned?  If we are serious about protecting children, why has there not been proper accountability, transparency and communication by the Government?  When will this happen?  When will there be an end to cronyism by Fianna F&aacute;il and its cohorts in the Green Party?  </P>
        <P>I am amused by Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in.  Government is not about the &ldquo;Siege of Ennis&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lanigan&rsquo;s Ball&rdquo;; it is about governing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is about showing leadership, creating jobs and having a vision to get Ireland back to work again.  The only jobs in which Green Party Members are interested are their own jobs.

	<P>Some weeks ago I raised the issue of the report of the Pensions Board on the difficulty in which we find ourselves regarding pensions.  I note with interest that there are some undercurrents of trying to force the retirement age upwards.  I understand the Government is today scheduled to publish proposals for future pension arrangements.  In light of all that has happened and reflecting the marketplace, will the Leader arrange a debate on pensions at the earliest possible time?  It strikes me as appropriate in light of the expected publication of the new proposals.</P>

	<P>Can the Leader indicate whether Government amendments will be tabled?  Having listened to the previous speaker talk about job creation, I concur with Senator Buttimer that it is very important and a debate will take place in the House today in that regard.  Separately we need to look at an issue which is very wide ranging and needs to address many related issues, including the minimum wage and social welfare payment rates.  I refer to the area of competitiveness.  For us to create jobs, this country must become more competitive, but we are not at present.  Therefore I ask for a debate on the issue of competitiveness.</P>

	<P>The Minister should come to the House to explain why it is proposed.  Yet again we see a regulator that is willing to impose costs on independent businesses as opposed to making hard decisions about itself.</P>
        <P>I support what Senators Fitzgerald and McFadden said about the need for a debate on this report.  For too long a vision of child care for children in need was the inside of a bed and breakfast, and we can see the tragic consequences.  The report which Senator Fitzgerald mentioned needs to be debated urgently.</P>
        <P>Last week I asked for a debate on restructuring ministerial portfolios.  We have heard the view of the Green Party on the matter today and it needs to be clarified.  Its Ministers are punching below their weight and earning more than they are worth.  They should come to the House to explain why something like this is relevant and important when, as Senator Buttimer has said, more than 420,000 of our fellow citizens are without a job at all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Wilson&rsquo;s comments on the alacrity with which the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, has responded to the issue of head shops.  Approximately ten days ago one of the national newspapers carried a report of a boy of about 12 or 13 whose mother had to come and collect him after he took one of these substances and he did not know where or who he was.  That is an indication of what is taking place.  In the previous Seanad, when I was Government spokesperson on health and children, a report was published by a sub-committee of which I was a member on the adverse side-effects of pharmaceuticals on society.  Will the Leader invite the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, to the House to discuss the issue of ordering drugs on-line?  This is a very serious matter.  While there are checks, a certain amount of illicit substances are getting through under the guise of being something else.  We need to have a meaningful debate on how we can tackle what is literally the poisoning of our young people.  Ultimately people depend on Members of these Houses to introduce legislation to put those cowboys and cowgirls out of business permanently.</P>

	<P>Last week we had a very timely and lively debate in the House on special needs.  At that time the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, in a scripted speech accused me of making a political football of children with special needs.  Prior to that, last spring in Leinster House he said he would go public on me if I said that all children with special needs could not be mainstreamed.  On 9 December he threatened to sue me personally if I continued to make remarks on special needs cuts.  My question to the Leader is as follows.</P>

	<P>I did not interrupt anybody on the other side of the House.  Members on the other side of the House should listen to what I have to say.  The very same banks are going to penalise businesses and individuals by increasing their interest rates, including mortgage rates.  We should not allow that to happen as major shareholders in the bank.  We should also direct AIB to sell off its assets abroad and put the money into the bank here just as the foreign banks operating here are doing.  They are consolidating their positions.  It is time for the Government to indicate that the bank must sell off its overseas assets and invest it in jobs here.  We need to control the charges banks are imposing on businesses.  If we do not, it will put them out of business.  I call on the Minister to come to the House to discuss the situation as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I compliment the Government on moving with dispatch in identifying substances sold in head shops that are proposed to be banned.  While complimenting it on its speed, I wonder whether it is going far enough.  In that regard, I prefer what the Labour Party has suggested in its draft planning and development Bill, namely, that we would consider changing our planning laws to require a change of use for premises and that people would have to apply for planning permission to set up these head shops.  The Labour Party made a similar <Col N="242"/>proposal in the past in regard to sex shops and is proposing to take these two issues together.  That is much more courageous but I wonder whether even that is going far enough.  It is not beyond the limits of human ingenuity for us to devise some legislation that will allow us not just to prevent the establishment of these places in the future but to target the ones currently in existence.  There seems to be a timidity at Government level about that.  I do not believe it will work.  If we identify a set of substances some other new set of substances will appear on the horizon and we will be eternally playing catch-up.  I ask for further consideration of that and this forum might be a useful place to have the debate as to the precise mechanisms we should come up with to target not just the head shops but the people who offer home deliveries of these substances and so on.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Bacik raised the issue of the need for a debate on education, which I raised yesterday along with others.  I would be grateful for a debate on that issue.  As somebody who teaches personal development in a third level college I recognise that when one is teaching self-esteem as part of the module one wonders if one fails one&rsquo;s students will one be contributing to lowering their self-esteem.  A serious issue arises about how colleges go about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I share the view that those assets should be sold and that money brought back to Ireland.  We should include in that the National Treasury Management Agency.  Any funds we have abroad should be brought home to be invested in Ireland.  We would be well served by a debate on that issue.</P>

	<P>Questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the issue of head shops, Senator Mullen asked if we are going far enough.  He is right.  We must address the cultural phenomenon these shops are <Col N="245"/>creating.  They are located on the main streets of our towns and are making drug taking, illicit or otherwise, seem like a mainstream activity.  When it comes to enforcement the ban on substances is extremely welcome, and the Minister is to be commended for it, but we must consider enforcement in terms of sitting on this new cultural phenomenon, so to speak.  It is a planning enforcement issue as well and there is a range of planning methods we must consider in regard to these shops including change of use, opening times and so on because they will morph from substance to substance.  They will continue to peddle their wares in their shop windows and reinforce the sense that these substances are normal and mainstream.  That is the wrong message and we ought to have the Minister come into the House to discuss the issue of head shops from a planning enforcement point of view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not call Senator McCarthy on the previous occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  Can I begin by welcoming Senator Dearey to the House?  I wish him well in his role as a Senator.  I pay tribute also to D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca who is no longer a Member.  She was a fine Senator and a very good colleague.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of Allied Irish Banks raising its interest rate by 0.5%, leaving the gates wide open to other lenders to do the same.  I have raised this issue consistently in this House.  There are thousands of families who have been thrown out on the side of the street by the vultures in our banking system.  People who could not wait to make enough money during the economic boom are now inflicting the worst form of turmoil on any family in terms of their possessions, that is, throwing them out on the side of the street.  It is not good enough that the taxpayer is bailing out that bank to the tune of &euro;3.5 billion.  It has reported record losses and it is now turning on the hard-pressed mortgage payer.  I repeat a statistic I mentioned here about three weeks ago.  An increase of 0.5%on a &euro;200,000 mortgage is approximately &euro;60 per month extra on a family.  That is a good deal of money for some people to come by.  It is vulgar, disgusting and abhorrent that this Government is allowing the banking system to get away with that type of vulgarity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to most of the Members this morning and everyone seems to be going around with two planks on their shoulders, which is not a great way of approaching matters.  I notice that nobody came in here to praise the Government for the proposals that came out yesterday via the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the IDA on the potential for job creation here.  Everybody seems to have forgotten that.  That is something that is positive and it is being done to try to tackle the unemployment problem.  I would appreciate it if the Leader would examine the possibility of us having a debate on the report which came out yesterday because pegging mud at each other across this Chamber or the D&aacute;il will not do anything for those who are unemployed or seeking to address the economic position.  Positive news should get the same amount of time in this House as the negatives.</P>
        <P>Finally, I want to comment on head shops.  If we do not do something about this issue and it is driven underground, we will have a real problem.  We already have to deal with the problem of cannabis factories in private houses which are rented mainly by non-nationals and who then put the drugs on the market.  I would be grateful if something could be done about this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the many requests made by Senators to the Leader, including in particular the issue raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole regarding the 30% increase in the broadcasting regulatory imposition on local radio stations.  As the Leader will be aware, I have a small interest in Radio Kerry.  It is a serious imposition that will affect a lot of jobs.  Some of the stations will be made marginal and in danger of going out of business.  That would be bad <Col N="246"/>for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I strongly agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that the order should be annulled.</P>
        <P>Does the Leader accept that no individual is above policy and, if so, will that be a guiding principle behind in the delayed reshuffle or perhaps a reason for its postponement?  Will it depend on a twit, a tweet or a twitter?</P>

	<P>As somebody who represents County Louth, I warmly welcome the announcement by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, of a new cross-Border initiative to enforce parking fines and toll evasion penalties on motorists travelling between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The initial project will begin today and will run until the end of November.  Data on vehicle ownership will be transferred between the two jurisdictions under a high level of security.  The project shows how far we have come as a country and a nation because it would have been unthinkable ten or 15 years ago.</P>
        <P>I welcome the news of a 40% increase in sales in February 2010 over the same month last year as result of the car scrappage scheme.  Incentives can work in certain sectors and perhaps the scheme will act as a model for the future.  Consumer confidence is key to restoring the economy.  We have seen a boost in confidence in the motor industry and this can be repeated across many sectors in order that we would start to see the green shoots.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of what was said today in the House, perhaps we should hold a debate on cronyism.  I do not mind which Minister attends because they are all at it.  Perhaps it would be appropriate that the debate on State agencies and semi-State companies should highlight the extraordinary curse of cronyism in this country.  What has been said by Senators on both sides is perfectly fair.  Both of the main parties and the Labour Party have always regarded semi-State directorships as the spoils of war.  They put their own people into positions of authority and influence when they entered office and as they departed.  Instead of merely exchanging insults on the Order of Business, let us expose this terrible curse on our semi-State companies, some of which are doing a very good job but have been discredited by people who were appointed because of party political allegiances rather than merit.  There is no point in accusing each other over the practice because everybody is at it.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that No. 1 appears to be the most important matter on the Order Paper.  I do not know what its implications are but it may be the beginning of something significant.  The motion provides for the abolition or merger of two of the partnership quangos.  I would have thought such a development would have warranted discussion in this House.  I would welcome a decision by the Government to dismantle the partnership industry and remove partnership junkies from positions of authority.  It is time all the quangos that sprung up because of social partnership are dismantled as that structure vanishes.  However, we should not let it be rammed through as if nothing is happening.  This is a matter of great significance and it deserves to be discussed at length with a Minister who can tell us what is going on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on the report that came to light this morning.  This report was initially due to be published in September 2008 and even though the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children gave a commitment on 6 October 2009 to publish it last year, this was not done.  I wish to highlight two comments from the report which set the context for understanding it.  The first was from a social worker who wrote in May 1998 that the young girl concerned was extremely vulnerable and not receiving adequate care.  The second was from a psychiatrist who conducted an assessment of the child in 2000 and described the provision of care for the girl since she left her grandmother&rsquo;s home in 1997 as nothing short of disastrous.</P><Col N="247"/>
        <P>When the Murphy and Ryan reports were published there was considerable hand wringing, headshaking and tut-tutting.  We look back with some disdain at the society of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s which supposedly condoned this kind of carry on.  We feel a certain sense of superiority, believing this could not possibly happen in the Ireland of the 21st century.  The fact is, however, it is still happening every day.  It is a pity Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in is no longer in the Chamber because he assured us once again this morning that the rights of and care for children were at the centre of the Green Party&rsquo;s ethos even though, over the past two months, the Green Party has shown more interest in debating how we care for dogs in this country.</P>
        <P>Childline has reported a 25% increase in its calls last year, including 11% increase in calls relating to abuse and welfare.  This Government still deems it acceptable that 38% of these calls went unanswered.  Children are crying out for help but nobody is available to answer them.  That is the legacy and that is why I call for an urgent debate on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that we are debating job creation between 2.30 p.m. and 5 p.m., is it proposed that part of the debate will be given over to the Green Party&rsquo;s attempts to get a few jobs in Government, as was exposed in the national media?  Is that party&rsquo;s policy on rotation to be adopted as Government policy for future job creation?  Perhaps the Leader would enlighten me on that when he responds to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>When will we have our long sought debate on banking?  Yesterday in the other House, the Taoiseach stated his belief that NAMA would free up credit to the economy.  Numerous Government spokespersons, including in particular the Minister for Finance, have admitted that was never the intention for NAMA but the Taoiseach nevertheless made this claim once again yesterday.  When will we have the debate on banking?  We have sought it for three weeks and there is no indication of it taking place.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Callely in seeking a debate on pensions.  Yesterday I raised the issue of pensions for the spouses of self-employed people.  The Government is in the midst of publishing proposals on completely reforming the pensions regime.  We are led to believe that mandatory pensions will be introduced for all workers and that the pension age may be increased.  We should have that discussion at the earliest opportunity.  Finally, where does the Leader stand on the issue raised by Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan, Norris and Donohoe, the fees and levies being imposed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on independent local and national radio stations?  Last year, the average revenues of local radio stations decreased by over 30%, yet the authority is seeking a 27% increase in its budget this year.  Most sectors of the economy are in decline and pressures on employment in broadcasting as well as in other sectors are very strong.  Does the Leader consider it appropriate that the regulator of independent broadcasters should seek to increase its levy by 27%, thus putting more pressure on employment in the sector?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Today&rsquo;s announcement that the unemployment figures for February remained roughly the same as January&rsquo;s is cold comfort to the many people who have lost their jobs over the past year.  If there is any doubt about how desperate people are to retain their jobs, one need look no further than Naas, County Kildare, where Green Isle Foods workers are on hunger strike in an effort to get their jobs back.  The Labour Court has stated the jobs are rightfully theirs.  Will the Leader use his good offices to try to ensure the situation in Naas, which is getting more desperate by the day, is rectified and to get all parties involved to talk together so everybody can emerge from this with their head held high?  I am sure that is possible.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader also give the House a progress update on the two Bills relating to management companies which are currently before the House?  We have concluded Second Stage and <Col N="248"/>are awaiting Committee Stage.  When does he expect those Bills to come back from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, McFadden, Buttimer, Donohoe, Regan, Dearey, Coghlan, Cannon and John Paul Phelan expressed shock and horror at the case highlighted in the House this morning, regarding which an amendment to the Order of Business has been proposed.  That a young woman died in the care of the State is a shame and tragedy and should not have happened.  Everything relating to what happens to people in care is a great concern for every Member of the Oireachtas, regardless of party.  Although the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, was before the House last week, I have no difficulty with inviting him back on foot of the issue highlighted by the Senators and placed on the Order Paper by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Fitzgerald.  I give the House my commitment that I will do everything I can to ensure this debate takes place at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senators Callely and Hannigan expressed their serious concerns about jobs.  Our special debate on jobs will start at 2.30 p.m.  With regard to Green Isle Foods and the unfortunate people who are on hunger strike, which was raised by Senator Hannigan, I sympathise with everybody concerned.  I saw the television coverage last Sunday evening.  I hope common sense can prevail and that everybody can get around the negotiating table so these people can get on with their lives.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Norris, Donohoe and Coghlan spoke strongly in support of local broadcasting stations.  I have received correspondence from Mr. Albert Fitzgerald, chief executive of Midlands Radio 3.  It is not fair that the levy is being increased from &euro;5 million to &euro;7.6 million when trade is down approximately 30% across all sectors in Ireland, not just in local and national radio and television.  This is an unfair request.  I will contact the Minister&rsquo;s office to ascertain if it can be discussed in this House and to find out what the Government can do about it.  Given the downturn in the economy, the alternative is that part of the licence fee be given to local radio to ensure it survives.  Local radio is the foundation of local communities.  It has been to the fore in highlighting volunteerism and everything that is good in local communities.  All sides of the House fully support it.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Ross referred to No. 1 and called for a debate on semi-State bodies.  This is a timely call and I will allocate time for that debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Butler, Hanafin, Dearey, John Paul Phelan and others called for a debate on banking and the challenges it faces.  I note the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said yesterday that Allied Irish Banks results were not a surprise given the crisis that has hit the banking sector over the last number of years.  He said the results show the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is &ldquo;forcing the banks to finally face up to the reality of their bad loans&rdquo;.  The banks engaged in excessive lending to speculative property developers and NAMA is making the banks take the losses on these property loans up front.  This is borne out by the large losses AIB reported yesterday.  The Minister continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">Were it not for NAMA, the banks might still be nursing their loans in an attempt to spread their losses over a prolonged period.  This might benefit their shareholders, but it would choke the prospects of economic recovery.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I agree with my colleagues that increasing interest rates to protect shareholders and placing mortgage holders under undue extra pressure is unacceptable and that we should do everything we can about this.  The Government will be watching it very closely.  On the one hand, the banks must be allowed to survive but, on the other, they must play fair with people during this <Col N="249"/>massive downturn in the economy.  Full nationalisation of two other institutions might not be right for the country.  There are various examples of other institutions which perhaps the Government would prefer not to have.  While the bank shares are trading on the Stock Exchange there is an opportunity for people to assist and participate.  I have no difficulty with organising a debate on this very serious issue for everybody in this country.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik and Mullen asked for further debates on education.  I have no difficulty with that proposal.  Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in quite correctly pointed out that the Labour Party supports rotation of Ministers.</P>
        <P>Senators Wilson, Leyden, Glynn, Ellis and Mullen congratulated the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, on banning many of the items being sold in head shops.  It will take three months for the ban to be put in place.  It was also pointed out by Senators that the planning regulations should be examined as a matter of urgency.  Members of local authorities can introduce by-laws relating to opening hours and the other issues which have been highlighted in the House in recent days.  Opening a shop or keeping it open at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. when the discotheques are over or the restaurants and chip shops are closing, or standing outside such premises and offering these drugs is unacceptable.  Local authority members have a duty to ensure this does not happen in their areas.  They hold their annual conference this week and I exhort them to do everything they can to assist in dealing with this terrible plague and challenge for our young people.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson also spoke about the new digital antennae that have been placed on Garda stations in County Cavan which are interfering with television signals.  I have already conveyed his strong views on this to the Minister.  It will be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris highlighted the allegations mentioned in the newspapers today.  I will pass on his views to the Minister on the resignation of the former Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, who was very supportive when in office.  He was very efficient and is a great loss to the Government.  He will be back in government at another time to assist and display his talents, as he did in the past two and a half years.  I wish him well.  Senator Norris also expressed his strong views on the position in the Middle East, with which we all fully agree.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden asked for a monthly review of the performance of State boards.  Senator Ross also called for a special debate on the matter.  Such a debate would be timely.  The Seanad can play a leading role in this regard.  We will endeavour to ensure such a debate takes place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Callely and John Paul Phelan raised the issue of pensions.  As we all know, a special press conference will be held this afternoon when the new pensions policy of the Government will be rolled out.  We can debate the issue in the House in the very near future.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn called on the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, to examine the serious issue of the ordering of drugs on-line.  It is one about which the Minister of State has to do something.  I will pass on the views of the Senator to him after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames called for another debate on children with special needs.  A debate on the issue took place last week.  She expressed her strong views on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, whom I have known for a long time and who has been a distinguished Member of both Houses.  He is a very good listener and doing everything he possibly can.  On having a further debate, he has always been very forthcoming and supportive in coming to the House.  I will have no difficulty in assisting colleagues seeking to help those with special needs.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis congratulated everyone involved on the proposals made by the Government and the IDA which were announced yesterday, as well as the report.  It is something we should <Col N="250"/>discuss.  Senators will take it on board in their contributions to the debate on job creation this afternoon.</P>
        <P>Senator Carroll outlined and welcomed the announcement made by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to deal with the cross-Border issue mentioned.  The announcement is welcome and I thank the Senator for bringing it to the attention of the House.  He also welcomed the 40% increase in the number of car sales, the success of the scrappage scheme and the boost given to consumer confidence, which is very uplifting.  The first indicator of an upturn in the American economy will be in the motor industry, as has been the case, as the bankers will tell us, in the past 100 years.  It is the one sector of manufacturing everyone watches.  It is also the first to give an indication of a downturn.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross also called for a debate on the performance of semi-State bodies.  I have given a commitment in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the two Bills to which Senator Hannigan referred, I will revert to the House tomorrow on the matter on which I received correspondence recently.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall recap although we have spoken at length on this section.  Many colleagues contributed their concerns about this section as currently drafted.  On the previous occasion, Fine Gael proposed tabling an amendment to exempt operators of establishments registered to the Irish Greyhound Board because we believe there is adequate provision for regulation and control under the Greyhound Act 1958 which is administered under the auspices of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would also have a role in regard to supervising the operations of Bord na gCon.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It was felt the Bill introduces further regulations, supervision, bureaucracy, and, in effect, duplication of many of the controls and inspection systems already in place.  We have concerns that additional charges for those involved in the greyhound industry could threaten the viability of what is a reputable, well regulated and successful indigenous industry.  As a result of greyhound breeding and track successes, as well as coursing successes, the greyhound industry has had high exports over many years and has a very good name internationally, which can be seen in the number of Irish derby winners not only in Ireland but abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This section needs to be properly thought through.  Earlier in the debate, I said the Bill needed to be cross-referenced with the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 so that, if there are <Col N="252"/>common areas, they could be joined up rather than just adding another layer of inspection, costs and bureaucracy to what already exists.  This is a genuine concern.</P>
        <P>I have already outlined the standards and controls in the greyhound industry with regard to DNA profiling, tattoo ear-marking and the like with regard to existing establishments.  Many greyhound trainers do not even own the dogs they look after.  There is another category of people who rear greyhounds as a livelihood.  They take on greyhound puppies, rear them until they are approximately one year old and then release them into training.  No breeding whatsoever is carried out in any of these establishments yet the Bill seems to be catch-all legislation which gives no recognition to previous legislation and the regulation system already in place in the industry.</P>
        <P>The issue of the definition of a bitch was highlighted to the Minster.  The Bill states that establishments which have six bitches or more will be deemed a &ldquo;dog breeding establishment&rdquo; where the bitches are more than four months old and capable of being used for breeding purposes.  One could have six bitches in an establishment that are being reared or trained with no intention to breed from them.  Another establishment could have five bitches which could all have a litter of puppies but the establishment will not be covered by the Bill.  There are anomalies in regard to how we deem an establishment to be a breeding establishment rather than a training or rearing establishment.</P>
        <P>We on this side of the House feel many areas of the Bill have not been properly thought through.  If the Bill goes through as currently drafted, it will be a very real threat to what is a vibrant greyhound industry which was built up over many generations and has a very positive profile in regard to the breeding lines of champion greyhounds.  If this section is passed as it stands, it will certainly threaten what has been a very successful indigenous industry.  In a climate of job losses and given that the economy is under serious pressure, we are shooting ourselves in the foot in this regard.  We should be strengthening industries such as the greyhound industry rather than adding further layers of bureaucracy that will increase costs and drive people out of the industry because they will not be able to afford to remain in it.  It will be a sad day if that happens.</P>
        <P>We are not happy with many aspects of this section.  We hope the Minister will indicate to the House that he will make amendments to address our concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Coffey for his contribution.  He indicated on Committee Stage last week that he will propose a revised amendment which would have the effect of excluding greyhound breeders from the registration charges provided for under this Bill.  I do not propose to apply the same exemption from fees to the Irish Greyhound Board as I did to the Hunting Association of Ireland-affiliated members.</P>
        <P>The Hunting Association of Ireland sought exemptions from the inspection regime and the licence fee requirements proposed in the Bill.  The Hunting Association of Ireland assured me it already maintains the highest voluntary standards in its establishments.  In recognition of the not-for-profit basis of these activities and in response to the representations on its behalf, I decided to provide exemption in the legislation in respect of the payment of registration fees only.  Notwithstanding the fact the Hunting Association of Ireland has made it clear that its premises operate in accordance with the comprehensive and appropriate standards, I have not excluded Hunting Association of Ireland affiliated hunt clubs from the requirements of the proposed inspection regime, and I have made this clear in a number of my contributions in the Seanad.</P><Col N="253"/>
        <P>Senator Coffey pointed out that the regulation of greyhounds is governed by the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  The Act, by virtue of its Title, is to provide for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing and for the better control of greyhound race tracks and coursing grounds.  The Bill before the House seeks to have the protection and welfare of all dogs in breeding establishments at its core.  I do not understand the argument that this Bill will introduce a second regulatory regime for the greyhound industry in that it seeks exclusively to establish mandatory conditions for the breeding of all dogs, including greyhounds in dog breeding establishments.  The Bill will supplement the provisions in the 1958 Act and ensure that regulation will improve the reputation of the Irish dog breeding industry, including greyhound breeding, which would benefit the industry in the long run.  It is unclear how the Bill as proposed would prove excessively burdensome in terms of fees and welfare standards to greyhound breeders who should already operate to high voluntary standards.  This is an important point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remind Senators that in its submission to the working group in 2005, the Irish Greyhound Board welcomed any regulation that would ensure the welfare of all dogs is protected and policed.  This is what the Bill aims to achieve.  I agree it is self-evidently in the interests of greyhound breeders that their greyhounds are well maintained.  For that reason, I believe they should have little difficulty in complying with any regulatory regime under this legislation.  I further add that the Irish Greyhound Board in the same submission stated &ldquo;the greyhound industry does not wish to circumvent or compromise any welfare initiatives&rdquo;.  I submit to the House that exempting greyhounds from regulations under the Bill would do both.</P>
        <P>Such regulation has to be funded and it is not my proposition that the taxpayer would be asked to fund this regulatory regime.  It is only proper that the cost of the regulation should be met by the sector being regulated and which will benefit from this regulation in the long run.  The charges proposed in the Bill for breeding establishments are quite modest.  The potential income stream from greyhound racing and coursing should render such establishments well placed to meet the registration fees proposed in the Bill.  Therefore, I do not propose to extend the limited exemptions in section 13 to any other organisation.</P>
        <P>My office is in receipt of a letter dated 16 February 2010 from the CEO of the Irish Greyhound Board, Mr. Adrian Neilan, in which he states the welfare standards of greyhounds are maintained by registration, ear-marking and DNA profiling, inspections by 20 control and stipendiary stewards and attendance at all stadia by veterinary surgeons.  This is also the point made by Senator Coffey.  It is important to point out that these activities are, in the main, conducted in the vicinity of the race meetings and are for the sole purpose of recording matings, litters, namings or transfers of greyhounds.  The correspondence does not instance any inspection regime for greyhound breeding establishments for dog welfare purposes.  I reiterate the 1958 Act and this Bill have a completely different emphasis and therefore, I do not propose to accede to the exemption proposed.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister, but I am most disappointed with the content of his response for reasons I will explain.  He referred in detail to the 1958 Act, in particular the Title.  It states the Act is to provide for the reconstitution of the Irish Coursing Club and its recognition as the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds.  It is clear that the Act relates to the breeding of greyhounds and gives such authority to the Irish Coursing Club.  This is stated in law and should be recognised.  The Act is accompanied by a stack of regulations, of which I have copies.  There are pages of regulations which apply to the greyhound industry, greyhound tracks and racing facilities.  However, they also apply to the control stewards and how they carry out their business.</P>
        <P>I refer to the greyhound trainers&rsquo; regulations of 1961 which read:</P><Col N="254"/>
        <P LI="1">12.<b>.</b>&mdash;(1) The kennels of any person applying for a licence to carry out the duties of a public or private trainer shall be inspected beforehand by a Control Steward or Stipendiary Steward, who shall report on the general lay-out, etc., to the Board.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) The kennels of a public or private trainer shall be periodically inspected by a Control Steward or Stipendiary Steward, who shall make a report to the Board.  If the Board is satisfied that the kennels are not properly kept, the Board may suspend or revoke the licence of the trainer concerned or take such other disciplinary action as it may deem necessary.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister is trying to tell the House that the 1958 Act has no bearing on how standards are upheld in establishments in which greyhounds are kept.  The law is in black and white in front of us, with the associated regulations.  It proves there is a very robust regulation and standards system for greyhounds covered by the Act.  The Minister is being dismissive in saying the new Bill will have little or no effect on the greyhound industry because it will.  It will introduce more bureaucracy and overheads and costs to an industry which is already struggling, an indigenous industry which has been successful over many generations.  It is a retrograde step if extra controls are to be introduced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would have no problem if the Minister had decided to cross-reference the Bill with the 1958 Act or bring together the supervisory elements of the two in some way.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials could be inventive in doing this but this has not even being attempted.  Instead there will be added layers of bureaucracy and regulation which will place significant burdens and costs on the greyhound industry.  It might not bother the Minister or his party too much but it certainly bothers me that we are to introduce measures which will, in effect, kill off an industry which has been built up successfully over many years.  The Minister may shake his head but that is what will happen.  There will be added costs and pressures on an already struggling industry.  That is not the way to go.  The Act, as I outlined, significantly provides for regulation, control and the supervision of standards within the greyhound industry.  The Bill is a backward step.  The Minister said he would not be accepting the amendment but I appeal to his partners in government.  Some Members on the Government side suggested they would bring forward amendments and the Minister said he was expecting amendments from Fianna F&aacute;il.  I hope they will have the common sense to see that this indigenous industry is under threat from the Bill and that they should table amendments to exempt the greyhound industry from its provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This Bill is a joke.  The Minister should withdraw it and meet those involved in the greyhound racing sector to iron something out which would be achievable.  As Senator Coffey rightly noted, the Bill has not been cross-referenced with the 1958 Act.  It is an absolute joke and a cod.  It will mean two registrations, two inspections and two chips in a dog&rsquo;s ear.  At some stage I predict there will be a court case.   Senator Coffey has rightly pointed out that he would be very happy if the Bill and the Act were cross-referenced.  If there is a dispute about whether kennels are up to scratch under the Act but may be under the Bill, there will be a court case and it will be the greatest joke of all.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider amending or withdrawing the legislation to allow for one inspection regime, one registration regime, one inspection fee and one microchip per dog.  Otherwise, we will have two chips, two inspections, two registers and probably a host of other bits and pieces.  This is a small country but the greyhound industry is big.  We are making a joke out of it in this instance.  I, therefore, plead with the Minister to withdraw the Bill and not to make a laugh of the 1958 Act.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am confused.  I am not clear &mdash; neither are those working in the greyhound industry &mdash; on the substance of the Bill.  When I read it I understood it was to regulate commercial puppy breeding establishments.  The greyhound industry is in a different category.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to explain the purpose of the Bill again.  There will be two regimes.  Is it correct that the Irish Greyhound Board operates a licensed trainer register?  Is it correct that the greyhound industry has its own licensing system and registration body and that a new body will be introduced under this legislation?  There seems to be duplication.  I listened to other speakers and have read all the material.  I come from a county in which the greyhound industry is the main industry and people have talked to me about the issues involved.  However, the more I talk about them, the more confused I become.  The 1958 Act and the Bill seem to be at loggerheads with one another.  Perhaps we should start with the 1958 Act and see if it has anything to do with registration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister has been let down, by his officials and others, on the Bill which has not been properly cross-referenced with the 1958 Act.  As Senator Coffey said, the 1958 Act clearly states the controlling authority in the breeding of greyhounds is the Irish Coursing Club.  The Minister has said the greyhound industry should be subject to checks, while Senator Coffey has clearly stated what is contained in the Act.  Coursing clubs and the industry as a whole have inspection regimes in place in the interests of the welfare of greyhounds.  On a couple of occasions bedding and everything else concerned with the breeding of greyhounds are inspected.  The Minister is trying to introduce legislation that runs contrary to the contents of the Act.</P>
        <P>Appropriate welfare standards are in place in the greyhound industry.  There is no denying that defined and recognised infrastructure has been put in place to support the regulation and control of the industry which operates a register of all matings and litters born.  Adult greyhounds are named in the case of transfer of ownership.  All stud dogs and brood bitches are DNA profiled.  Each greyhound is marked with a tattoo for identification purposes.  We are talking about duplication when we talk about microchipping, ear-tagging and tattoos and will end up with cruelty to animals.  It will run contrary to the principle of the Bill we are discussing.  If we mark dogs with tattoos, attach microchips and ear tags, they will not be able to come out of their bedding because they will have so many tags.  It is laughable that such duplication is being advocated in the Bill.  Duplication is what we are talking about.</P>
        <P>As Senator Burke said, the Minister should revisit this matter and introduce a proper Bill that is cross-referenced with the 1958 Act.  When most Ministers introduce legislation, they ensure everything is cross-referenced, but that has not been done in this instance.  The Minister&rsquo;s response was incorrect.  He mentioned that the greyhound industry should be subject to inspection.  It is already subject to inspection under the Act.  Senators on this side of the House want the best animal welfare system to be in place.  It is already well regulated by the industry in question.  Those involved have said that if the measures suggested by the Minister are put in place, they will decimate the industry.  The Minister spoke about the working group.  He only listened to certain of its recommendations.  There was a minority report in that regard.</P>

	<P>A former Member of the House, D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca, has said that, even with the proposed charges and licensing regime, local authorities will still have a shortfall of &euro;1.6 million.  These charges will have an effect on local authorities and, in turn, taxpayers.  I agree with what the Minister is trying to do.  As I mentioned, when I raised the issue of puppy farms in the House six years ago, I was one of the first Senators to do so.  We need to regulate certain practices and eliminate others, but the measures proposed by the Minister in the Bill go way beyond this.  He is trying to regulate a well regulated industry which is in trouble.  He should go back to the drawing board and return with a proper Bill we could all support.  Such a Bill should eliminate puppy farms, which is what this legislation was supposed to be about.  I do not know why the Minister has gone beyond this.  Perhaps he has been listening to people with other views on these matters.  I refer to animal welfare and animal liberation groups, for example, which may have wanted to have their say on the Bill.  I suggest the Minister&rsquo;s proposals will defeat what he genuinely intended to do in this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was struck by some of the remarks made by Senators on both sides of the House.  The suggestion that a greyhound might have a chip in both ears reminds me of the story of the fellow who was regarded as being very balanced because he had a chip on both shoulders.  I listened to what Senator Ormonde had to say about growing more confused as the debate continued.  That is not an uncommon experience in this House.  The more we debate them, the more complex the issues sometimes seem to become.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware that I support his attempts to establish a regime of regulation and inspection in the Bill.  However, a couple of questions emerge strongly from the exchanges we have just had.  Is the Minister satisfied that the regime of regulation and inspection that applies to coursing clubs and greyhound breeders, as provided for in the previous legislation, is adequate and efficient for that section of the industry?  It is important that he answer that question at this point.  Does he believe this new regime is necessary for the sections of the industry covered under the old legislation?  If he believes this, can he explain why an exemption is provided for hunt clubs but not for coursing clubs and greyhound breeders?  What is the distinction that justifies an exemption for hunt clubs but not for others?  Is there any sense in which this is about revenue?  Is it a case of using one section of the industry to raise the funds that are necessary to inspect another which is currently unregulated?  If that is what this is about, is it fair?  Those are the questions I would like Minister to answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have probably spent the guts of an hour debating this point.  It would be easy for the Minister to dispose of it by telling us whether the existing regulations and inspections will be superseded.  If not, why not and why do these additional regulations need to be put in place?  If the Minister provides a clear and precise answer, we will probably be able to move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to be clear and precise, as Senators have requested.  It needs to be understood this is an animal welfare Bill.  I accept that the 1958 Act which has been mentioned was introduced to encourage the greyhound industry.  I ask Senators to believe me when I say I am not trying to undermine the greyhound industry in any way.  I hope they accept <Col N="257"/>my bona fides in that regard.  I am trying to provide adequate protection for dogs.  Those citing the 1958 Act are doing so erroneously.  It is not about animal protection or welfare.</P>
        <P>I would like to give the House some statistics to emphasise the difficulties we are facing in the greyhound sector.  I have received statistics about this breed from all parts of the country.  In 2008 some 1,045 greyhounds were put to sleep.  That represents approximately 10% of the 10,069 dogs put to sleep in Ireland in that year.  As a percentage of all dogs put to sleep in each local authority area, greyhounds accounted for a range from 0% in the Westmeath County Council area to 38% in the Galway City Council area.  The Galway figure may be an anomaly, as it may be the case that the Galway city pound takes many dogs from rural parts of County Galway.  When I examined these statistics, it was clear to me that we had a problem with stray greyhounds.  It appears that when greyhounds are no longer useful as racing animals, they are often dispensed with.  We have to examine all the animal welfare issues that arise in that context.</P>
        <P>I am listening to what Senators are saying.  If they want me to ask my officials to ensure all our bases are covered, in terms of legislation, I will do so.  I am the last person who wants this to be challenged in a court, as suggested by Senator Paddy Burke.  I will return on Report Stage to ensure all i&rsquo;s are dotted and all t&rsquo;s crossed.</P>
        <P>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen inquired about hunt clubs.  As I stated earlier, they are not exempted from inspection.  I took into account that they operate on a not-for-profit basis.  While I may have the chip on both shoulders, I hope it is a balanced approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not referring to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>On the other hand, I have to take into account if a hunt club is a commercial activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot make exceptions when it comes to animal welfare.  I can make exceptions if I find too much of a financial burden or risk is placed on a person.  Animal welfare includes all bodies in question from the DSPCA&rsquo;s pound to a hunt club.  I have been assured by the hunt clubs and others that they have high standards of animal welfare.  If they believe they are adequately covered under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 and the standards in place are fine, there should be no problem.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I will return to it on Report Stage, as I do listen to what Senators raise, to check if any anomalies exist, that we have covered our bases or that there needs to be cross-referencing.  I do not believe so but as Senators have pointed out, due to the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, some exception from this provision might have to be made.  That could be counterproductive from an animal welfare point of view, however.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator referring to the figures for those put to sleep?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  If they were not euthanised, does the Minister want them left to live in a kennel somewhere?  The Irish Greyhound Board takes a responsible approach to how it manages greyhounds which are no longer racing.  The board has refuted the Department&rsquo;s figures on stray dogs.  In recent research it did with county council dog pounds, it found 151 greyhounds were put to sleep one year, which comes to 1% of the total.  The Irish Greyhound Board also funds the greyhound-as-pet scheme and the retired greyhound trust which successfully re-homes many greyhounds when their racing careers are finished.</P>
        <P>The board has to be realistic too.  That is why the euthanisation of greyhounds can also be a humane end to a greyhound&rsquo;s life rather than abandonment.  There is a responsible approach in this regard.  The Minister has introduced a red herring to justify a Bill which is not complete.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not address my point on the Bill&rsquo;s definition of a &ldquo;bitch&rdquo; as being a bitch over four months old capable of being used for breeding purposes.  Anyone will tell the Minister that any four month old bitch is not capable of breeding or having a litter.  We must come up with some realistic definition of a bitch.  I have suggested it should concern whether a bitch is capable of breeding.  That should be the yardstick as a definition and not picking out of the air four months as a figure.  Anyone could tell the Minister that it would not apply to the breeding cycle of a bitch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Greyhound Board already charges its breeders under the 1958 Act.  This Bill proposes specific charges for greyhound breeders which in effect will amount to a double charge.  Does the Minister agree with this?  Does he believe the industry can afford it?  There is no need for this penalising charge or for a double inspection.  The Minister referred to the figures of greyhounds put to sleep every year.  As Senator Paudie Coffey rightly pointed out, regardless of what legislation is introduced, greyhounds will still be put to sleep every year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened carefully to Senator Paudie Coffey disputing the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the desirability of greyhounds being euthanised when their racing careers are over.  I am glad they do not do that to politicians who no longer run for office.  As to whether an animal welfare problem arises as reflected in the statistics given is beside the point.</P>

	<P>The Minister said the primary purpose of the 1958 legislation was not animal welfare.  Is the Minister therefore claiming the existing regime would not be sufficient to guarantee the welfare of animals?  If the proposed regime is necessary to amend what is already in place, I can see the case for requiring some level of a charge.  I, however, sympathise with those who feel they will be subject to double charges.  Will the Minister clarify whether the charge made by the Irish Greyhound Board is not necessarily for animal welfare services <i>per se</i>?</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems to me the greyhound industry is being penalised twice.  I do not believe this is right as two separate issues are involved.  The provision in the 1958 Act is broader in its scope and has nothing to do with welfare while the provision in the Bill does.  Will the Bill overrule the relevant section in the Greyhound Industry Act 1958?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>This represents the duplication of charges as well as of regulations.  We are talking about putting an extra charge on the greyhound industry when there already is a regime under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 which deals with the obligations <Col N="259"/>of the greyhound industry to animal welfare.  This Bill suggests the bodies involved, the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club, are not fulfilling their obligations under the 1958 Act, a serious charge.</P>
        <P>The Minister claims up to 10% of all dogs put down each year are greyhounds.  As the Minister can give that statistic, I would be interested to hear the percentage of greyhounds in the total dog population.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P>I refer the Minister to section 12 of the Greyhound Trainers&rsquo; Regulations 1961:</P>
        <P LI="1">12.&mdash;(1) The kennels of any person applying for a licence to carry out the duties of a public or private trainer shall be inspected beforehand by a Control Steward or Stipendiary Steward, who shall report on the general lay-out, etc., to the Board.</P>

        <P LI="1">(3) Trainers shall ensure that kennels, muzzles, feeding bowls, etc., are kept in a clean and good condition.</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) Where possible, trainers shall ensure that stud dogs or bitches in season are not kennelled in the vicinity of the kennels in which greyhounds entered for races are kept.</P>

This is superior legislation in dealing with animal welfare.  I must emphasise it is not my aim to undermine any particular industry.  I am simply introducing this legislation as a means to deal with a problem that has emerged over the past number of years with regard to animal welfare.

I believe the Irish Greyhound Board is doing a magnificent job throughout the country.  It has nurtured the sport and led to it being a world-class sport.

The reply of the Minister has brought into question the capability of the Irish greyhound industry to act under the 1958 Act in regard to animal welfare.  That is an appalling statement about an industry that is prized in the country.  The industry has brought much recognition to the country and brings tourism to this country.  It also creates many jobs.  I am astonished at the reply of the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister will revert to me on Report Stage about the statistic he mentioned about dogs put down.  I asked the Minister what percentage of greyhounds make up the dog population in the country.  The Minister must have that information available and we hope to have it provided to the House.  There is no point in throwing out statistics if the Minister does not have the full information.</P>

	<P>I did not hear the view of the Minister on the definition of a bitch, which is fundamental to the question of what is considered a bitch in this Bill.  In the draft version of the Bill it is described as four months.  I would like to know if the Minister intends addressing the definitions.  I am astonished to hear the reply of the Minister.  We are now getting to the nub of the issue.  We were concerned there would be duplication of regulation and standards with regard to animal welfare.  Opposition Members fully support the idea of proper animal welfare standards in this country but the Minister has admitted to the House that the present system, under the auspices of the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club, is not adequate.  In other words, those bodies are not doing their jobs.  I remind the Minister that State boards are running the agencies.  I remind the Minister they are under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  I would like to hear the Ministers of those Departments respond to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government saying agencies under the remit of those Departments are inadequate and are not doing their job.  The Minister gave due recognition to the Irish greyhound industry, to its importance as an indigenous industry for tourism and how reputable it is internationally.  The Irish Greyhound Board &mdash; Bord na gCon &mdash; and the Irish Coursing Club have major reputations internationally.  It is a sad day when the Minister says the job they do is inadequate.  It is a serious charge and the Minister should retract it.  The current debate takes away from the aspirations of the Bill as drafted, which is to address the maltreatment of puppies in puppy farms.  That should be the focus.  In this case a catchall Bill is spreading into other areas already legislated for and it is unacceptable that the Minister makes this comment about the Irish greyhound industry.  He should retract his comment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 10<i>b</i>, 10<i>c</i> and 14<i>a</i> are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10<i>b</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, subsection (1), between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>f</i>) greyhounds should be exempt from the limit of six litters, subject to veterinary approval,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Brood bitches in the greyhound industry rarely have more than three litters, unless they are very successful.  Putting a limit of six litters on successful brood bitches in the greyhound racing industry would lead to the exportation of some of our best breeding bitches.  If a bitch does not breed successful litters of greyhounds, there will not be a demand for her.  She will not be marketable and will not have high value.  She will not be used for further breeding.  However, if she breeds winners and they have success on the track or coursing fields, there will be a big demand for them, not only in Ireland but also internationally.  Greyhound breeding lines have been established over many generations.  As I said earlier, they are well regulated through the <Col N="262"/>DNA profiling of stud dogs and bitches.  The information has been well recorded for everyone to see.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In a successful greyhound breeding establishment, when a bitch produces successful litters and reaches the limit of six as specified in the Bill, there will still be a demand for her.  The most obvious course of action will be for the owner of the establishment to export her to another jurisdiction, resulting in a loss to the Irish greyhound industry.  It will not have the effect the Minister seeks which is to limit the number of litters a bitch will have because she will continue to have them elsewhere.  We believe the deciding factor as to whether a bitch should produce more litters should be veterinary approval based on the health of the dog.  That is a decision for the owner and the vet in each case.  It is reasonable to exempt greyhounds from the limit of six litters subject to veterinary approval and we hope the Minister will accept the amendment.  We do not want to encourage the export of the most successful brood bitches to other jurisdictions, as it would obviously have a serious impact on the greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 10<i>c</i> reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, subsection (1), between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&rdquo;(<i>g</i>) greyhounds should be exempt from the requirement that a bitch is not to be mated inside 12 months from the previous litter.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The season cycle of a bitch may vary.  As drafted, the Bill does not show a clear understanding of the breeding cycle of a bitch.  If a bitch had puppies in January, she might not come into season for ten months in October.  If she has to wait until she comes into season again after that, it will be 22 months between litters.  As drafted, the provision could lead to a gap of two years between litters, which leads to questions about the viability of breeding successful greyhound pups.  If we are to limit the number of litters and the time between having a litter and mating again, it will have an enormous impact on the international reputation of good racing dogs produced in Ireland, which would be a serious backward step.  I, therefore, ask colleagues on all sides of the House to consider reasonable amendments to correct the wording used in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 14<i>a</i> reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Greyhounds registered through the Irish Coursing Club should be exempt from the micro-chipping requirement&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As outlined previously, greyhounds are tattoo marked and registered by the Irish Coursing Club.  They are easily tracked through the forms of identification used, as are their owners and breeders.  We now have an additional requirement in this legislation to micro-chip them.  If the micro-chipping were universal, one could say there was some logic in the argument, but it is not.  The micro-chip that might be introduced in this legislation does not have universal recognition, and these dogs race in venues throughout the world.  There is no requirement for a micro-chip for greyhounds because they already have body markings in the form of tattoos on their ears and DNA profiling that I would say is better than most breeds going back generations.</P>
        <P>I understand, and the Minister might clarify this, that the Department and the Minister&rsquo;s officials admit that the working group established in 2005, to which he has so often referred, agreed unanimously to exempt the greyhound industry from micro-chipping.  The working <Col N="263"/>group in which the Minister put so much faith in all his argument until now unanimously agreed to exempt the greyhound industry from micro-chipping, yet we see there has been a turnaround in the Bill as drafted in that micro-chipping for greyhounds is included in it.</P>
        <P>There is much confusion about who and what the Minister is listening to with regard to this Bill.  He seems to be listening to everybody on the one side rather than the reasoned representative views of those in the greyhound industry.  For that reason we are tabling this amendment that greyhounds registered through the Irish Coursing Club should be exempt from the micro-chipping requirement.  It is an unnecessary requirement because identification of greyhounds is already well established and properly managed.  We believe the amendments are reasonable and hope that some of the Members on the Government side or the Minister will support them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The greyhound industry has always been regulated by the Department of Agriculture and when one reads this Bill one knows the reason for that.  The lack of knowledge of the greyhound industry that is highlighted by what has been included in this Bill is disgraceful.  From much of what is contained in this Bill there appears to be no knowledge of greyhounds.  The limit of six litters is unreasonable and not practicable.  As was stated earlier, greyhound owners and breeders have a close working relationship with their veterinary surgeons and the industry depends on the breeding of successful brood bitches to maintain a vibrant and healthy breeding market.  That has been the lifeblood of the greyhound industry.  On the mandatory requirement to allow 12 months elapse before a bitch is mated, Senator Coffey outlined the position in that regard but the Bill shows a complete ignorance of the greyhound cycle which can vary from six to 24 months.  There appears to be no understanding of greyhounds from what is contained in this Bill.  It is an effort to decimate the industry through lack of knowledge.  I will accept the bona fides of the Minister regarding animal welfare but the lack of knowledge of the greyhound industry shown in the content of the Bill is appalling.</P>
        <P>There is no point in going into the area of micro-chipping and ear-marking of dogs.  It has been dealt with, and what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  The Minister quoted the working group to us in reply to a previous amendment but we have given another recommendation of the working group which the Minister is disregarding.  He may think he can have it both ways but he cannot.  He cannot quote the working group to make one point and then forget about it on another matter.  What is happening with this Bill is disgraceful.  The more it is teased out, the more people will realise there is a lack of knowledge of the greyhound industry and even of the cycle of a greyhound.  Animal welfare is not to the forefront where this Bill is concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in going over the issues outlined by my colleague, Senator Coffey.  He has tabled three simple amendments, Nos. 10<i>b</i>, 10<i>c</i> and 14<i>a</i>.  They are common-sense amendments that the Minister should accept.  Amendment No. 10<i>b</i> deals with the exemption from the limit of six litters which Senator Coffey said should be by veterinary approval.  I fully agree with him because an independent veterinary surgeon will be under the control of the local authorities.  Senator Coffey is in agreement with that but says we should have an independent veterinary surgeon who would be the arbiter on this aspect.  It is very simple.  Common sense has been dispensed with in many parts of this Bill.  Senator Coffey is taking a common-sense approach and if these three amendments were included in the Bill, they would improve it.  I urge the Minister to accept them.  They are common sense and it is for the good of the industry, which is the purpose of this debate.  It is also for the good of animal welfare, and we have taken that into account on this side of the House.  Along with everybody else, we want the welfare of dogs to be of the highest standard but at the same time we want this industry to thrive.  We do not want it to be exported.  What will happen, as Senator <Col N="264"/>Coffey pointed out, is that the top dogs in this country will be exported.  That will be the case, especially for counties along the Border such as Louth, Meath and so on.  It will be easy for breeders in those counties to cross the Border into Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Bill will have serious consequences for the greyhound industry and I urge the Minister to accept Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendments.  They will make it a better Bill that can be more easily operated and it will be better for the industry as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We might be getting into the politics of the bedroom somewhat but having heard what Senator Coffey said, I am inclined to think this is a matter that can be left to veterinary surgeons and breeders.  Without knowing much about it, it strikes me that the proposed amendments relating to the breeding are reasonable.</P>
        <P>Regarding the third amendment, I have tabled an amendment requiring micro-chipping for dogs over eight weeks old or at least before they leave the kennel.  There may be some merit in the exclusion of greyhounds from that if the grounds for such an exclusion are based on animal welfare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I know nothing about the limit of six litters.  I am not knowledgeable in that area but I would imagine that the veterinary surgeon would be a key person in deciding each case.  That is obvious to me.</P>
        <P>We are talking about protection and welfare, and this is a welfare Bill.  We have the identification procedures under the 1958 Act and now the Minister plans to add the micro-chipping requirement.  The dogs have tattoos on their ears and now we have micro-chipping.  This is a double identification, which goes back to my point about duplication in terms of the 1958 Act and this Bill.  I would like the Minister&rsquo;s views on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not intended to contribute but Senator Mullen put his finger on it.  The veterinary profession has a pivotal role in this area.  We cannot legislate for a broad spectrum because each dog will differ.  I am sure the Minister is doing the best he can to safeguard animal welfare and I will reserve further comment until I hear what he has to say.  Senators Mullen and Ormonde raised valuable points and Senators on all sides of the House have a deep interest in this long overdue Bill.  The time we spend on it will be well spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  The working group recommended against microchipping greyhounds because of concerns that the practice could affect performance.  Since then, however, a comprehensive report produced in the UK revealed that microchipping does not affect greyhound performance.  Legislation is being drafted in that jurisdiction to microchip greyhounds.</P>
        <P>I was not casting aspersions on the greyhound industry when I said in a previous contribution that the animal welfare provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 are not adequate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>

	<P>Allow the Minister to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="265"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendments would have the effect of creating separate regulatory regimes for dog breeding establishments, one for greyhounds and a second for other breeds.  It is as simple as that.</P>
        <P>The Bill seeks to put the protection and welfare of all dogs in our breeding establishments at its core.  It is the intention to ensure that regulation will improve the reputation of the Irish dog breeding industry as a whole, including greyhound breeding.  This will benefit the industry in the longer term.  It is unclear how the Bill as proposed would prove excessively burdensome to greyhound breeders in terms of fees and welfare standards given that they should already operate to a high voluntary standard.  I do not wish to add further complexity to the new regulatory regime.  A number of contributors on Second Stage made the point that good legislation is that which is not overburdened by exemptions.  I would create difficulties if I introduced too many exemptions and I do not intend to set down an unfortunate precedent in legislation by making exemptions for particular breeds.</P>
        <P>The working group&rsquo;s recommendations on microchipping were made at a time when we did not have the UK report to hand but we now have clear evidence that microchipping does not affect performance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>What about duplication?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am imagining a scenario in which greyhounds are reared alongside other breeds in a kennel.  Are we to make an exemption for the greyhounds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>They already have identification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is missing the point completely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>He does not understand it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am describing the reality of the situation.  Is that all right?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that greyhounds already have identification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not all right.  His argument would be fine if an identification regime was not already in place.  That system goes back generations and greyhounds are subject to DNA profiling beyond any other breed.  They also have tattooed ears and registration cards.  If this regime was not in place I could understand the Minister&rsquo;s argument.</P>
        <P>Microchips are being introduced in the UK because of the integrity and identification problems in that jurisdiction but that does not imply Ireland has the same history.  The working group in which the Minister places so much faith unanimously agreed to exempt the greyhound industry from microchipping because it acknowledged the identification systems that already existed.  He has shifted the goalposts quite a distance from that recommendation.</P>
        <P>As Senator Cummins has noted, the Bill appears to lack a clear understanding of the breeding cycle of a greyhound bitch and the demand for successful racers.  It will obliterate the Irish greyhound industry and its international reputation because we will end up exporting our best brood bitches and their litters will no longer be considered Irish racing dogs.  It is a massive industry, although I an not sure the Minister acknowledges the benefits it brings to the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="266"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>If he did, he would listen to us.  We still have time to address the issue and I appeal to him to reconsider his position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Every time the Minister speaks, he casts further aspersions on the Irish Greyhound Board.  The Irish Coursing Club operates a register of all matings, litters born, adult greyhounds named and transferrals of ownership.  All stud dogs and brood bitches are DNA profiled and all greyhounds are earmarked with tattoos for identification purposes.  Litters are inspected by control stewards jointly appointed by the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish Greyhound Board.  Clearly the Minister lacks confidence in this supervisory activity.</P>
        <P>As Senator Coffey pointed out, the Irish Greyhound Board is a State body which operates under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It would appear from this section and the amendments to it that the Minister does not share our confidence in the board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister wish to reply?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be claim and counter claim.  I understand the needs of Opposition Members and adversarial politics but the Senators&rsquo; claims cannot be substantiated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Is identification not in place?</P>

	<P>Allow the Minister to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators are trying to make the case that, first, I am undermining the greyhound industry and, second, I have insufficient respect for it.  Neither claim is true, however.  Horseracing, the greyhound industry and other rural pursuits are vital to our tourism sector.  I have seen the press releases put out by RISE and other organisations.  I am sure Senators are aware of the campaign which is currently underway.</P>

	<P>None of the Senators&rsquo; claims stands up to scrutiny.  When it comes to rural pursuits in general, I have no difficulty with angling or shooting.  The programme for Government makes no mention of hare coursing or fox hunting.  The accusation that we are undermining the greyhound industry by stealth is nonsensical and does not stand up to scrutiny.  I have listened to the contributions of Senators Mullen, Glynn and Ormonde, who take the view that we should include an amendment relating to veterinary advice and so forth.  I will examine and discuss that to ascertain whether it makes sense or whether it would undermine the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am not approaching this with a closed or blinkered mind.  I am anxious to ensure we have the highest animal welfare standards while ensuring a viable industry as well.</P>

    <Title>Job Creation: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Job creation is at the top of the Government&rsquo;s agenda.  It is the driving force behind so much of our work in stabilising the public finances and getting the banking system working again.  It is the reason at a time when there is a significant current budget deficit, we are continuing to invest so heavily in our capital programme, in building necessary infrastructure and investing so much in enterprise, research and development.  The challenge presented by the live register figures is one the Government is working hard to overcome.  We are conscious that people across the country want to know what actions we are taking to ensure Ireland will be best positioned when this period of economic turmoil comes to an end.  If we have been remiss in regard to anything, it is in getting the message to the public about what we are doing.</P>
        <P>While I will elaborate on a number of these points, I want to set out a portion of some of the work the T&aacute;naiste has undertaken as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, together with me, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, in the period to date.  The initiatives taken include, among others, job creation through research and development and the development of intellectual property assets in Ireland; the introduction of the employment subsidy scheme to help retain jobs in vulnerable exporting companies; the introduction of the enterprise stabilisation fund to help protect jobs in exporting companies hit by current difficulties; mandating comprehensive strategy reviews in IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development; putting in place a code of conduct for business lending to SMEs enacted in order that SMEs know where they stand in regard to the banks; and establishing a credit supply clearing group to tackle the credit supply issue, establish the facts and take on the spin and myths in order to get to the bottom of what we are trying to do, that is, make sure credit flows to the small and medium business sector.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing on a proposal to the Government for the establishment of a targeted loan guarantee scheme.  We have successfully introduced a commitment by central government to pay its debts to business within 15 days rather than 30.  There has been a revamp of public procurement policy to ensure greater access to  public contracts.  Two separate Company Law Acts have been introduced, the first to toughen our company law regime against potential abuse and the second to ensure Ireland is best positioned to maximise the attraction of job <Col N="268"/>creating foreign direct investment.  We have achieved the introduction of new tax changes to support jobs.  We have also secured the introduction of a PRSI exemption for employers creating new jobs this year.  We are targeting enterprise funding and resources at new areas for job growth such as the green enterprise sector.  Despite the financial position, we are prioritising and investing significant capital moneys in research and development, science, technology and innovation for future job growth.  We are rolling out a new marketing campaign to encourage investment in Ireland from our foreign direct investment target markets and promoting Ireland as the innovation island internationally.</P>
        <P>We have put in place an unprecedented level of training and activation measures to assist those seeking employment.  We have established new and innovative programmes to keep people in jobs which are deemed vulnerable and to get graduates work experience.  We are opening up training and activation opportunities to private and voluntary sector providers through the &euro;20 million labour market activation fund.  There are new types of F&Aacute;S courses to train and retrain people for jobs in new sectors such as the green economy.  There has been an increase in the number of places available on community employment schemes.  There has been a successful application of the European globalisation fund for former Dell employees and two other applications are in progress for other large-scale redundancies.</P>
        <P>I am confident the Government is pursuing the correct policies which will enable the economy to once again return to growth and, more importantly, employment creation.  As a small, open economy, Ireland is especially reliant on foreign trade.  We are focused, therefore, on ensuring we can take advantage of the upturn in international growth and trade.  Encouraging and positive trends are visible.  In recent months, for example, international organisations such as the IMF and the OECD have upgraded their economic forecasts.  In its most recent update in January the IMF forecast global economic growth would expand by 4% in 2010 and 2011.  This represents a substantial upward revision from its previous forecast published in October.</P>
        <P>Established trading partners such as the United Kingdom, the eurozone and the United States are all expected to experience growth in the medium term, representing renewed opportunities for our exporters.  Similarly, Irish exporters are making inroads into less familiar emerging markets in which growth remains buoyant.  In the past 18 months Irish exports have performed extremely well in comparison with our international counterparts, which is significant.  There has been a global recession and a downward trend in international trade, yet Ireland&rsquo;s exports have held up well, something which should be recognised and promoted.  We should send every positive signal we can nationally to encourage a change in mindset and point out that Irish exports are competitive and finding markets at this very difficult time.  It is worth examining the export figures and noting they have stabilised and that there has been growth in some areas during a time of world recession, which is significant.  The issue of competitiveness which feeds into the cost of our exports is something which is also having an effect.  The early indications for 2010 with regard to exports, something on which I can only adjudicate based on the flows of trade through ports until we have proper collated data, suggest the trend is that exports are being retained, something everybody in the House will welcome.  Our goal is to maintain and enhance the policy environment which has facilitated this resilient performance and that will drive future export growth.  We estimate that every job in Ireland associated with exporting sustains another job in the domestic economy.</P>
        <P>International investment will continue to be a key driver of employment, exports and growth.  We will continue to market Ireland as a location of choice for the newcomer and existing investors.  In September the T&aacute;naiste launched the IDA&rsquo;s new innovation-focused overseas market campaign designed to position Ireland as the pre-eminent location for companies seeking to invest in future innovation.  During 2009 we won a total of 125 foreign direct investments. <Col N="269"/> Almost 70% of these came from existing IDA clients who are making further investments in this country, reinforcing Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a key strategic global business hub.  Again, that is very important.  There has been a rationalisation by many multinationals in recent times because of the international recession.  It is very significant, therefore, when companies located in Ireland continue to invest here.  We are confident that this will continue.  That focus of attracting foreign direct investment into Ireland is critically important and the IDA is charged with that responsibility.  Any time we go abroad we consistently promote the country.</P>
        <P>There are only a few issues that are critically important.  I have stated this on many occasions in both Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere.  There is a world recession.  Politics is often played out and we have our cut and thrust debates within the parliamentary system but we must base arguments on fact rather than have fictional debates.  There are a number of simple facts.  Yes, there is a world recession and a financial credit crisis.  It is true that Ireland has inherent difficulties because of the international aspect but equally there was our dependence on property for a number of years, with the accompanying problems that flowed from that source when the financial credit crisis came along.</P>
        <P>Critically, Ireland is still attracting foreign direct investment.  There are several reasons for this.  We have a very flexible educated workforce.  We also have a tax and regulatory regime that is conducive to investment and doing business.  In the broader context our reputation as a location that is both foothold into Europe and, vice versa, springboard into the United States, is recognised internationally.  Because of our investment and infrastructure over recent years there are many other ways in which we are seen as a hub for internationalisation.  The financial services centre is critically important but is often forgotten in commentary.  It is a very impressive success story.  Again, it is internationally recognised and is among the top 15 financial services centres in the world in terms of the amount of funds managed there.  Approximately 25,000 people are employed in the centre.</P>
        <P>We will continue to promote Ireland as a centre for inward investment but it is important that when people speak, in this Chamber or anywhere else, they base their debate on the facts.  These have been outlined in previous speeches and I shall continue to outline them today.  Otherwise we undermine ourselves and make it more difficult to convince people to look on Ireland as a location.  I urge Senators and everybody concerned to keep to the facts in this debate.</P>
        <P>In these turbulent economic times, it is extremely significant that many of the world&rsquo;s leading companies continue to invest in Ireland in a wide array of activities including high-end manufacturing, global services and research, development and innovation.  In absolute numbers, Ireland is moving up the global rankings in employment in research and development, having risen from 19th to 11th in the latest global location trends survey.  That is a testament to the science, technology and innovation, STI, strategy being pursued.</P>
        <P>During 2010, IDA Ireland will continue its work to capitalise on our quality workforce, creativity, international attitude to business, attractive incentives for research and development and favourable tax climate to attract multinationals to set up base in Ireland as a launch pad for markets in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.  Already in 2010, there have been seven IDA supported announcements in Dublin, Galway and Tullamore and there will be a further significant announcement for the north east this week.  We are also working to develop opportunities for Ireland to become a key European hub for the international funds industry.  In this regard, I look forward to the proposed changes in the Finance Bill to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s competitive edge.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has tasked the IDA with developing a new strategy for the future direction of foreign direct investment and this will be published shortly.  It will include specific initiatives <Col N="270"/>which the IDA will undertake to retain existing and secure new foreign direct investment.  This strategy will identify opportunities in foreign direct investment international competitiveness so we can maximise our potential to attract markets, while stressing the importance of restoring our relative foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland delivers a wide range of supports to Irish companies, targeted at the specific requirements of clients throughout all regions to ensure they develop to their full potential in terms of innovation and exports which, in turn, will stimulate job creation.  In recognising the significant changes in the current economy both in Ireland and globally, Enterprise Ireland has prepared a recovery strategy to identify actions that will be undertaken to help clients.  The agency has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of its client base.  The Department is drawing up a new strategy at present as our previous one came to the end of its natural life in 2009.  This new strategy will look at key and emerging markets to see where Ireland should have a presence in supporting indigenous industries that seek markets on a continual basis.  There is fluidity in the world.  Periodically certain markets may go into recession while other parts may be in boom time.  We have to be able to identify those markets and anticipate to the best of our ability where we should have a presence.  In recent years there have been enormous rates of growth in Brazil, India, Russia and China, for example, which are known as the BRIC countries.  There are other emerging markets where we must have a focus and a presence.  It is critically important that the Irish Government, through its agencies, supports indigenous Irish industries that are trying to step outside the island, find international markets and internationalise themselves.  Enterprise Ireland has been very successful in supporting those types of companies.  We sometimes forget that Irish companies have been very successful in internationalisation.  One need only consider CRH, Glanbia or Kerry Group, for example.  There are more than 80,000 people in the United States employed by Irish companies.  People may not realise that.  There are many companies to which we can point both for their experience and as an indicator that Irish companies can be successful.  They may have a competitive advantage, as they do in many areas, but they also have the innovation, ideas and research facilities and entrepreneurship.  They have been successful in stepping outside the island and finding international markets.</P>
        <P>The county and city enterprise boards continue to provide support for small businesses in the start-up and expansion phases.  Job creation is an inherent consideration in the activities of the boards.  In 2010, the county and city enterprise boards will continue to assist micro-enterprises throughout the country by direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters and also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice designed to help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation and boost employment creation.</P>
        <P>The development of the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; or innovation-based economy is the key challenge facing Ireland as we lay the ground for economic recovery.  We are well aware that our enterprise and investment landscape must continually transform itself to stay competitive.  The model we strive for today as the basis of our economic renewal is the smart economy<i> </i>which builds on our dual strengths of innovation and entrepreneurship.  The Government has made a major commitment, through substantial public investment in the strategy for science, technology and innovation, SSTI, 2006-2013, to making such a transition to the smart economy.  This whole-Government strategy comprises research and the application and commercialisation of the fruits of that research, across six Departments.</P>
        <P>In December 2008, the Government reinforced the importance of the investment in the SSTI through the paper, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; a framework for sustainable economic <Col N="271"/>renewal, which prioritised continued investment in science and engineering infrastructure and research.  For us, building a smart economy is about the development and application of human capital &mdash; the knowledge, skills and creativity of people &mdash; and our ability and effectiveness in translating ideas into valuable processes, products and services and, ultimately, into employment.</P>
        <P>In this context, Science Foundation Ireland is playing a critical role in building our competitive academic research base while maintaining a strong focus on excellent research.  This work has been highly rewarding.  Today researchers funded by Science Foundation Ireland are connected to over 300 companies in Ireland which support the employment of 56,000 people.  The objective of the research and development programmes administered by our state agencies is to harness the benefits of research collaboration for the benefit of the Irish economy.  This entails building up a strong cadre of indigenous firms and attracting and further embedding leading multinational companies here.  This is the essence of the Government&rsquo;s strategy for STI and it is proving to be the engine of economic growth.  At this time of scarce economic resources, the Government has allocated &euro;600 million to STI departments and agencies in 2010.  We are confident the net gain from such sustained investment will be more and better jobs.</P>
        <P>If we look back over progress made in recent years, it is clear investment in the higher education sector is now having a significant impact in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s human capital development, feeding through to the attraction of foreign direct investment and commercialisation.  For example, last year 49% of the IDA&rsquo;s foreign direct investment wins were research, development and innovation-related.  These were valued at &euro;500 million and built upon initial investments made through Science Foundation Ireland and the Higher Education Authority.  We are working to encourage indigenous enterprises to prosper.  Evaluations of State support for research and development show that research and development performing companies have higher rates of growth in turnover, exports and employment and much higher productivity and export intensity than low research and development performing companies.</P>
        <P>New high potential start-ups will make a substantial contribution to export and job growth.  In 2009 Enterprise Ireland supported 73 such companies across a range of knowledge-intensive sectors, including life sciences, biotechnology, medical devices and telecommunications, and a number of specific niche areas such as compliance and risk management.  These companies are expected to create significant numbers of new jobs in the next three years, demonstrating that entrepreneurs across the country are capable of creating high value, export-focused businesses which support employment.  Only by implementing these policies and targeting our limited resources can we hope to position Ireland as a competitive, innovative location in which to do business, grow business and employment and create prosperity.</P>
        <P>Ensuring enterprises receive support to assist them through the current difficult period is the key to safeguarding employment.  This is why the Government has introduced a broad range of enterprise support measures.  Last year it introduced the enterprise stabilisation fund which aims to support viable but vulnerable companies experiencing difficulties because of the current economic climate.  Companies receive funding to support a range of activities, including market development, productivity improvements and development.  In 2009, &euro;58 million was spent on 181 projects, supporting approximately 7,500 jobs.  The fund continues to attract a high volume of applications in 2010.</P>
        <P>My colleagues and I are also keen to support small and medium enterprises and I am particularly aware that there is a difficulty for some businesses in accessing credit.  To address this issue, the Minister for Finance announced in budget 2010 a new credit review system which will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks, particularly for SMEs.  This new system will inform the Government as to what further action might be necessary to secure the <Col N="272"/>flow of credit to Irish enterprises and, through publication of the analysis from the review process, help to ensure the performance of the banks participating in NAMA will be transparent to all.</P>
        <P>The Government is conscious of this situation.  To take what has happened in recent years, the bank guarantee was introduced on 29 September 2008 and was a critically important decision by the Government.  At the time there was panic in international markets and a financial meltdown following the collapse of Lehman Brothers earlier that month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was wondering when Lehman Brothers would be mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a very important first step in making sure we did not have a systemic run on the banks and economic meltdown in Ireland.  We moved on to nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank but, importantly, we also had a capitalisation programme for the two major banks, following which Mazars prepared an analysis of lending to SMEs.  We are aware that businesses are finding it difficult to access credit.  Following the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s recent announcement in the Budget Statement of a credit review body under Mr. Trethowan, it will be set up quickly and will work to ensure that if people are being refused credit, an appeals mechanism will be available independent of the banks.</P>
        <P>The banks also have a fundamental role to play.  The relationship between them and the people has fundamentally changed through the guarantee and the capitalisation programme.  The banks have an obligation to shareholders and, equally important, the State to ensure credit flows through the broader economy.  Any retraction of credit has an immediate impact on the ability of companies to trade and continue to retain or create employment.  For that reason, I urge the banks which I have met on numerous occasions to ensure that, when they analyse a business plan, they consider it in the most positive frame of mind possible and that they positively consider lending money.  They have become risk averse.  We must change this culture to ensure they step up to the plate and honour their commitments under the previous capitalisation programmes in order that they can play a critical part in ensuring we return to growth in 2010.  As I have stated on a number of occasions, if Senators or Deputies have information in this regard, they should pass it on to the credit supply clearing group in my Department.  Where a business has been refused credit and believes it should have been granted it, given its viability and the creditworthiness of the individuals concerned, this should be highlighted.  We want to have that type of information to bring it to the attention of the banks through the credit supply clearing group.  Senators and Deputies should feel free to forward such information to the group which will pursue the issue through the mechanisms set up within the Department.</P>
        <P>Last year the Government introduced the enterprise stabilisation fund which aims to support viable but vulnerable companies experiencing difficulties because of the current economic climate.  We supported more than 181 companies, helping to retain 7,500 jobs.  Applications for the fund are coming in quickly in 2010.  Some might say it is only 7,500 jobs but we need only talk to any of the individuals whose jobs have been retained to know it is significant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>It is similar to the figure for two multinationals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>It would require significant foreign direct investment to create 7,500 jobs.</P>
        <P>The live register figure for February shows there has been a stabilisation of job losses.  While it might be said it is at a high figure, we must welcome the fact there has been stabilisation.  Last year 26,000 jobs were lost in February and 30,000 in January.  Twelve months on, while there has been a major rise in unemployment, seeing the figures stabilise in what traditionally <Col N="273"/>is a very difficult month is welcome.  Obviously, this has come very late for the many thousands who have lost their jobs.  However, we must get to the bottom of the recession curve before we will be able to see light at the end of the tunnel.  All of the international commentators and analysts recognise that we are on the right path, although it is a difficult and painful one for many.  Recessions are not easy, particularly for the vulnerable and those in the public sector who have experienced wage reductions.  The Government is acutely aware of this point.  I suggest to the House that it has been recognised internationally that what the Government is doing, difficult as it is for many, is necessary.  It had to take decisions to protect our international financial sovereignty.  There is now commentary that that sovereignty is under threat in other countries simply because they did not take the decisions required of them to ensure they would have international credibility.  International credibility is of huge significance for Ireland for a number of reasons, including that we are borrowing a lot of money to maintain services, we are trying to attract foreign direct investment and we have a very important financial services centre.</P>
        <P>An additional measure to support enterprises in retaining their employees was the employment subsidy scheme which was introduced last year.  Between 2009 and this year, we are investing a total of &euro;135 million in the scheme, under which enterprises receive a subsidy of up to &euro;9,100 for each subsidised job retained.  There have been two calls under the scheme.  Applications in response to the second call are still being assessed but it is expected that, between the two calls, approximately 80,000 jobs will be either directly or indirectly supported.</P>
        <P>The enterprise stabilisation fund and the employment subsidy scheme reflect the Government&rsquo;s commitment and determination in assisting companies to come through this difficult period.  Between the two schemes, we are investing &euro;235 million directly in enterprises, safeguarding thousands of jobs and securing our enterprise capability in the process.</P>
        <P>The Government is also encouraging employers to create new jobs by reducing the costs associated with employment.  Under the employer jobs PRSI incentive scheme, where an employer creates a new job and takes on a person who has been unemployed for six months or more, he or she will be fully exempt from the liability to pay PRSI for the first year of that employment.  This will give employers an 8% to 10% saving on employment costs for each new job created and actively encourage the creation of new employment when it is most needed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The PRSI exemption for employers creating new jobs this year is in addition to the maintenance of the substantial capital investment programme across government.  This includes the national development programme and implementation of key Government programmes such as the &euro;425 million rural development programme 2007-13, under which some 12,000 jobs will be created, and the &euro;1 million invested each week in the home energy savings scheme, providing work for some 3,690 registered contractors.  A grant is available to make homes more energy-efficient.  The scheme was also designed to retrain people from the traditional construction areas and move them into the area of home energy installations such as installing boilers, wood-burning stoves and insulation.  It provides employment opportunities for many of those in difficulties because of the downturn in the construction sector.  The Government is also investing substantially in the provision of key infrastructure such as broadband, in respect of which the number of subscribers has doubled during the lifetime of the Government, and electricity generation from local renewable resources, in respect of which, at 15%, we have already met our target for 2010.</P>
        <P>The Government remains fully committed to upskilling the unemployed in order that they will be successful in getting back into employment.  The lesson to be learned from the previous recession in the 1980s is that people must be retained as close as possible to the labour market in order that those who fall out of employment into unemployment are at least provided with <Col N="274"/>training programmes in order that they can more easily re-enter the labour market.  If people are removed from the labour market, they often lose their confidence, their skills sets may no longer be required and they drift into long-term unemployment.  Of all the blights in society, the blight of long-term unemployment is something we cannot allow happen at this time of high unemployment.  The Government is hugely conscious of the need to ensure we provide training and upskilling programmes for those who find themselves unemployed.</P>
        <P>My colleagues and I are proactively leading the Government&rsquo;s response to Ireland&rsquo;s unemployment level and driving implementation of the framework for sustainable economic renewal.  The Cabinet sub-committee on economic renewal is also ensuring a co-ordinated approach across Departments in response to the rising numbers of unemployed.  This approach has included a substantial increase in the number of job search, training and work experience places available to unemployed persons.  We are also focusing our resources on a number of key cohorts of the unemployed, including the lower skilled, the long-term unemployed, those under 35 years of age and those formerly employed in the manufacturing, construction and retail sectors.  These cohorts have been prioritised, as they are most likely to drift into very ong-term unemployment.  The Government is investing substantial resources in tackling our unemployment problem.  For instance, my Department will invest over &euro;1 billion in the provision of a range of labour force measures this year.</P>
        <P>As regards job search supports, in 2009 F&Aacute;S employment services, together with the local employment services, doubled their capacity.  The annual referral capacity under the national employment action plan rose from 78,000 persons in 2008 to 147,000 last year.  The additional resources allocated by the Government to tackling the rising unemployment rate have also enabled my Department to significantly expand its activation training and work experience places.  This year the total number of training and work experience activation places funded by my Department will be approximately 147,000.  This compares with the 66,000 places delivered in 2008 and the 130,000 places delivered last year.  The bulk of this additional provision has been due to the increase in the number of training places on short-term courses for the unemployed.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S now provides modular-based training in order that participants can pick which modules they most require to improve their skills and ultimately increase their employability, while maintaining a close link to the labour market.  In addition, training courses are being delivered in innovative formats such as on-line, blended learning and night courses.  In this way we are providing for a range of delivery methods, in addition to the traditional classroom approach, which enables more people to access the services of F&Aacute;S.  In addition to the places I have just mentioned, this year Skillnets and F&Aacute;S will be providing almost 10,400 training places for the unemployed or those engaged in short-time working.  Owing to the economic downturn, many individuals are working for two or three days each week and receiving social welfare payments for the days they are not working.  Both Skillnets and F&Aacute;S are providing training opportunities for those who find themselves in this position.  Individuals participating in these programmes can avail of training on the days they are not working while retaining their social welfare entitlements, subject to the normal social welfare rules applying.  This means that the individuals concerned will now be able to use their reduced working week as an opportunity to upskill themselves, thereby improving their employability.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the large numbers under 25 years who are unemployed.  This is the reason it has decided that this cohort will receive priority access to the State&rsquo;s supports for the unemployed such as the F&Aacute;S employment and training services.  The T&aacute;naiste has also asked F&Aacute;S to make significant prioritisation of services for those under 25 years a key element of its provision in 2010.  An initiative has also been put in place to immediately activate 18 and 19 year olds, instead of waiting the usual three months for automatic activation.</P><Col N="275"/>
        <P>The main specific provision for early school-leavers continues to be training at community training centres and vocational education committees under the Youthreach programme.  The Government is maintaining the 6,000 places available under this programme at a cost of approximately &euro;110 million.  Another important initiative of particular relevance to this group is the work placement programme which offers 2,000 places, of which 1,000 are for graduates.  Participants in the programme gain work experience for a period of up to nine months and may retain their social welfare entitlements, subject to the normal social welfare rules applying.  This work experience will significantly improve their chances of securing paid employment in the future.  The Government has implemented a variety of measures which will support around 4,000 redundant apprentices to progress their apprenticeships.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for affording me the opportunity to outline the wide and varied spectrum of measures the Government is taking to cultivate the growth of employment in the economy.  I have been present for many debates in this House about unemployment and job creation, the economy and access to credit for small and medium-sized businesses and the broader economy.  Public representatives on all sides of the House have firm views on the issue of how the current difficulties are to be tackled.  A number of factors must be continually promoted and highlighted.  Ireland is not the only country affected by recession.  Most of our trading partners are in recession.  The United States of America is the largest economy and currently has an unemployment rate of 10%.  It is disingenuous, therefore, for some commentators to almost suggest this is the only country finding it difficult to come through the economic crisis and with financial difficulties because of the credit crisis, with rising unemployment.  Many countries in the eurozone are also finding this a very challenging time.  I agree there are inherent difficulties in the economy which exacerbate the problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;at any of the commentary from the IMF, the OECD and the European Union, it can be seen that very few foresaw what would happen which culminated in financial meltdown across the world in 2008.  It will have to be dealt with on a transnational basis.  It would be very difficult for the Government on its own to deal with the fallout from an international credit crisis.  It has to be dealt with at European level, at G20 level and probably at <Col N="276"/>G8 level.  The larger countries need to come together to try to find some mechanism to make sure there is enough liquidity going back into the global economy.  More importantly, they need to ensure the measures that are put in place do not stifle or stymie globalisation, growth and trade.  They need to make sure we do not have the type of activity we saw in the financial services sector.  I refer, for example, to the unregulated movement of capital and the outflows that caused some of these difficulties, which are inherently international in nature.</P>
        <P>I am just making the point that when we have debates of this nature, we should stick to the facts.  We should point out where we are and acknowledge the difficulties we are in.  It is equally important to acknowledge that opportunities are available to this country.  It can position itself to become more competitive, for example by ensuring the workforce is ready.  During a period of increasing unemployment, it is important to invest in skills and retraining in advance of the upturn.  All the figures suggest that a global upturn is on the way.  That has been suggested by international commentators.  The IMF has upgraded its forecast to approximately 4%.  We have to position ourselves to make sure we take advantage of that.  At the same time, we have to promote Ireland as a place for inward investment continually.</P>
        <P>Education is another key area in which I see substantial potential.  People from other countries come to Ireland for educational purposes &mdash; to learn English and to obtain third and fourth level qualifications such as doctorates.  There are significant opportunities for Ireland in this area.  When students come to this country, they pay to do courses and to stay in digs.  There is an immediate spin-off from that.  It is also of longer-term strategic value to have students coming to this country to be educated.  When they go back to their own countries, they retain the links they have forged with Ireland.  If they get involved in business at a later stage in their lives, they may become key business influencers in their own countries.  Their backgrounds may also lead them to become key academics, researchers or politicians.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is repetition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>This should be part of our longer-term strategy.  We must be conscious of the continuing need to promote Ireland as a centre of excellence for learning, which is something that has come under attack in recent days.  The Minister for Education and Science has announced that the perceived dumbing down of diplomas and other third level qualifications will be investigated.  While I do not accept that such dumbing down is taking place, I believe we need to ensure that the integrity of the educational system is protected.  It is important for Ireland to be recognised internationally as a place of educational excellence.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators during this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  Although I like him and think he is a good Minister of State, I have to say we have listened to 45 minutes of pure tripe from him.  I refer in particular to the last part of what he had to say.  I will absolutely confine my remarks to the facts, but I will not be lectured by anybody from Fianna F&aacute;il on what was said in this House or the other House about our reliance on property.</P>
        <P>I had the privilege of serving as Fine Gael&rsquo;s spokesperson on finance for five years, during which time the current Taoiseach held the position of Minister for Finance.  Every time he came into the House, I raised my concerns about Ireland&rsquo;s over-reliance on property.  On one occasion, he almost laughed at me as I expressed my concern about the future of the property bubble.  That is a fact.  It is on the record of this House.</P>
        <P>Every time Deputy Bruton responded to a budget, he said we are too reliant on property.  Until recent years, he was laughed out the door by people on the Government benches.  It is absolutely wrong to suggest that nobody was criticising the Government, politically or other<Col N="277"/>wise, in this regard.  To claim that nobody made the point that we could not continue indefinitely down the road we were following is not based in fact.  I wish the Minister of State had based the part of his contribution that dealt with this issue in fact.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with a number of the points made by the Minister of State in his speech.  I agree with his comments about the Irish Financial Services Centre, which is an excellent facility that is continuing to expand.  The Opposition supported the recent Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009, which sought to harmonise some of our accountancy practices with US practices, because it will allow us to continue to attract foreign direct investment to the IFSC and the rest of the country.  We were happy to co-operate in that regard.</P>
        <P>I would like to take issue with a number of other points made by the Minister of State, however.  He referred on a number of occasions to the IMF&rsquo;s forecast of 4% global economic growth between this year and next year.  No one is forecasting that Ireland will enjoy 4% growth this year or next year.  It does not matter what the Government might think about the IMF forecast for the rest of the global economy.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also referred to the county and city enterprise boards.  Having spoken to representatives of my local enterprise board, I understand the funding given to such boards has been cut in some way.  The county and city enterprise boards will have reduced funding to give to small and medium sized enterprises, which avail of such funding under normal circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke at length about the &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo;, which is an example of a catchphrase that causes people&rsquo;s eyes to glaze over when they hear it.  It sounds good but, in practice, the public does not see the Government implementing the smart economy.  Although I could not argue with most of what the Minister of State said about it, we are not seeing any proof that it is coming to fruition.  That is my bugbear with the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Government&rsquo;s key investments in infrastructure.  I cannot say I disagree with the investment in roads infrastructure.  While it has improved in recent years, our broadband infrastructure remains pathetic and abysmal.  Many businesses across large tracts of the country &mdash; I refer to rural Ireland in particular &mdash; do not have access to broadband.  We also need to consider the whole question of how far down the global league table we are when it comes to next generation broadband.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention a number of other facts.  Unemployment has increased threefold over the last three years.  That is a fact.  A further minor increase in unemployment over the 12 months up to the end of February was announced today.  It is a personal disaster for the approximately 2,000 additional people who are on the live register.  According to today&rsquo;s figures, some 437,000 people are on the live register.</P>
        <P>Unemployment is a personal disaster for those who lose their jobs, their families and their communities.  It is also a disaster for the economy.  We correctly invest money in our education system and in training schemes to ensure that people can get jobs.  It is important for people to be able to contribute to society in terms of taxation and to feel good about themselves.  The link between unemployment and issues of self-esteem was a significant problem in the 1980s.  I do not think any of us wants to revisit that problem, but we are there now whether we like it or not.</P>
        <P>Over the eight years I have spent as a Member of this House, I have continually listened to Fianna F&aacute;il Senators talking about how unemployment is so low.  I must admit I have not heard them referring to unemployment levels as often during in the last 12 months.  It is worth pointing out that there are more people unemployed now than there were when Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats came into government in 1997.  The absolute figure at present is 437,000.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>I am disappointed the T&aacute;naiste is not here to explain her recent comments on young people who emigrate.  What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s own position on this matter?  This is the big bugbear I have with the last 12 years of Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  The Government had an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that our economy did not return to the bad days of the late 1970s and the 1980s, but we now have wholescale emigration again.</P>
        <P>Many friends of mine have left the country.  Most of them are younger than me.  I am 31 years of age.  Many people in the group that left school and college just after me have had to leave the country.  The T&aacute;naiste said on the BBC a couple of weeks ago that such people are making a lifestyle choice.  The Minister of State spoke about what the Government is doing to help younger people who find themselves on the live register.  It is shocking that one third of men under the age of 25, but of working age, are unemployed at present.  I do not believe the Government is doing enough to try to get this cohort of people into gainful employment.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the fiscal and banking crisis.  The reality is that the Government&rsquo;s proposals and plans &mdash; its efforts to solve our banking crisis &mdash; have been an absolute failure to date.  Yesterday, AIB announced its disastrous results and we will have even more disastrous results from Anglo Irish Bank soon which will present the Government with the two options of either further capitalising the banks to the tune of &euro;12 billion or nationalisation.  In recent weeks Government spokespersons, including Senator Donie Cassidy, have referred to the desirability of opening a new national recovery bank, which Fine Gael first proposed almost a year ago.  I was surprised to hear the Taoiseach yesterday in the Lower House claim NAMA would ensure money would flow through the economy.  We have been told by different Government spokespersons, especially the Minister for Finance, that this was not what NAMA was set up to do.  The Minister of State was correct to say, in pointing out our banking difficulties, that money is not flowing in the economy.  However, what the Government has done heretofore has not worked.  I have no confidence, and neither does the public, in what the Government will do from hereon in.</P>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank is an unmitigated disaster.  It was mainly concerned with the operations of large developers and, therefore, had no systemic importance.  There is now speculation that it will require even more significant re-capitalisation soon.  It should have been wound up in an orderly fashion but the Government decided to inject billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money into a white elephant.  It will never operate properly as a bank again.  In years to come, we will be looking at investigations into why the Government made its decision to nationalise the bank and capitalise it to the extent it has.</P>
        <P>If yesterday&rsquo;s announced tax returns for the first two months of 2010 are replicated for the rest of the year, there will be a &euro;1 billion hole in the Government&rsquo;s fiscal figures, meaning its plans to solve the fiscal crisis look to be in some difficulty already.</P>
        <P>Three weeks ago, a Private Members&rsquo; motion was devoted to youth employment during which I pointed out how we must examine the measures responsible for the large increase in employment, particularly through foreign direct investment, in the mid-1990s.  On that motion, Senator Shane Ross said Ireland&rsquo;s low corporation tax rate may need to be lowered further as many other EU jurisdictions have introduced a similar if not lower rate.  We should be examining a cost-benefit analysis of the potential gains of increased employment rates versus lower tax revenue.  EU membership was also instrumental to our success in the mid-1990s which was recently reinforced by our last vote on the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>While I have been critical of social partnership, it did deliver social cohesion, making us attractive to foreign direct investment.  We certainly do not have social cohesion now.  While I believe social partnership was responsible for many of the difficulties that emerged in the latter <Col N="279"/>part of the Celtic tiger, we really need it now.  I urge the Government to do what it can in that regard in the next several months.</P>
        <P>Our educated workforce also made us attractive, a feature acknowledged by the Minister of State and whose comments on it I agree with.  It is not whether our education system is working adequately but rather how it is perceived overseas in multinational boardrooms.  This week serious reservations were expressed by several large employers about third level education standards.  While I accept the Minister of State has not dismissed them, they must be addressed.  We must strategically set about answering these critiques to ensure the perception of our education system remains strong.  We must also ensure it can justify the marks its students receive and is fit for purpose as the economy develops.</P>
        <P>I apologise if I started somewhat angry but I disagreed profoundly with the Minister of State&rsquo;s closing comments that no one saw the current economic difficulties emerging.  Few saw them as happening quite as quickly as they did but many had serious reservations for some time about the tax incentives introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government to incentivise property development.  Much of that property across the State will not be occupied for the foreseeable future.  There is no use in retrospectively throwing stones at one another across the floor of the House.  We must look to the future and job creation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to the House who carefully outlined the Government&rsquo;s positive proposals for job creation.  It is important to bear in mind the Government itself cannot create jobs but it can create the economic climate that will encourage inward investment and new jobs.  The Government produced the policy document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy, which was the first positive approach to attracting new high-tech industries.  We will need a highly educated workforce to fit into such an economy.  Costs must be reduced to attract new industries and companies to Ireland.  Cost competitiveness, along with the quality and availability of the workforce, will be important factors in assisting a company in deciding to locate in Ireland.  Ireland largely depends on fossil fuels for energy production, fuels which are fast running out.  To ensure high quality and reliable power supply to new industries, the Government is building a new interconnector.</P>
        <P>The green energy programme, which I proposed many months ago in the House, has been introduced by the Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The national energy efficiency retrofit programme now employs 16,000 people from the construction industry.  This year, the Department has increased the grants available which will bring another 5,000 people to work in the programme.</P>
        <P>Last year, I invited the Spirit of Ireland organisation, a national project for energy independence, to make a presentation in the audio-visual room in Leinster House.  I propose that all Senators and Deputies listen to the proposal.  The group is in the House today meeting with the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It could create up to 100,000 new jobs in the construction of five new power stations, which will be run by turbo and wind energy that will get us away from our dependence on fossil fuels.  In itself, that would create close to 50,000 new sustainable jobs.  It will also guarantee a new energy industry for this country.  This is what the smart economy is about &mdash; being smarter, more efficient and using natural resources better.  That is why we must move to the smart economy.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan spoke about the bad old days but the bad old days will always come around.  The US, one of the biggest countries in the world, had the worst recession in the 1930s and is now back in the same situation.  No one can say we will not get into a recession again.  I have seen five recessions, three of them in the UK and two in Ireland.  The blame game is pointless.  The job of Members, in government and in opposition, is to be constructive <Col N="280"/>and find solutions.  We find solutions in the new proposals outlined in today&rsquo;s debate.  These debates are important.</P>
        <P>McDonald&rsquo;s will spend &euro;12 million on four new restaurants creating 250 new jobs.  This is very welcome.  Probiotec Limited will establish a new European manufacturing operation in Dundalk, which will start off with 70 new jobs.  That is welcome because it is a sign we are producing the correct climate, with low taxation, which acts as an incentive for companies to move to Ireland.  Having a local market of 500 million people in the EU is also an incentive and is vitally important.  There is further investment by Apple on Grafton Street, with 25 new jobs being created in a shop selling retail goods for Apple.  These are positive developments and I encourage the Opposition and the Government to listen to all proposals.</P>
        <P>Our biggest problem is that we cannot provide sufficient capital to small and medium-sized enterprises.  They are crying out for credit.  The banks&rsquo; proposal is to increase rates by 0.5%.  That will add &euro;60 to the average household mortgage when the Government introduced a budget that tried to reduce costs.  The banks are adding costs.  I would also force AIB to sell its overseas assets, which are worth &euro;1.9 billion or &euro;2.3 billion depending on what commentator one listens to.  Most of the banks are running down their investments in other countries and it is time we considered that.  Instead of providing capitalisation of &euro;4 billion, we would only have to provide &euro;2 billion.  It is important we consider every aspect of where we can capitalise and spend less money on banks.  If we have a controlling share in the banks, I suggest the Minister outlines guidelines for lending and identifies a certain number of billion euro that should be provided from the banking sector for investment in new job creation in small and medium-sized enterprises and multinationals.  We must consider where are the opportunities.</P>
        <P>I do not want to go over time and want to ensure we have an orderly finish to the debate.  Although the Minister of State is not responsible, I ask him and the Minister for Finance to consider the matter of finance for small businesses.  If we keep them open we retain jobs; if we close them our expenditure increases by &euro;20,000 per employee.  We have an obligation to ensure these people remain in business for as long as possible.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for taking time to discuss this important issue.  I will refer to the banks&rsquo; response to small business, community employment schemes and enterprise boards.  I compliment the IDA and Mr. Barry O&rsquo;Leary on the announcement on Monday in Athlone of 50 new jobs, with the possibility of 200 jobs.  It is warmly welcomed.  Athlone is managing to hold its own because it is lucky to have the Defence Forces, Athlone Institute of Technology and the Department of Education and Science.

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>The positive announcement on Monday shows the IDA is always plugging away trying to source new jobs for Ireland.  It shocked me that county enterprise board funding was cut by 35%.  We need to support small businesses more than ever and to create new small businesses.  I am incredulous that we are cutting enterprise boards to such a degree.  Small businesses are the bread and butter or the mainstay of our country.  Small businesses exist in every single town and village in the country and they keep communities alive.  County enterprise boards represent these voiceless people and provide advice to them.  In the <Col N="281"/>Westmeath area the county enterprise board runs programmes attended by over 800 people per year.  It runs over 60 programmes and represents craft businesses, food businesses and engineering businesses.  I must reiterate and explain how important these are to the community.  They provide valuable services to the Westmeath and Longford area.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland focuses on exports.  County enterprise boards support those who have fewer than ten jobs in the business.  Our family business is a pet shop that employs two people.  We are on our knees and if it was not for my sister&rsquo;s husband, who has a decent job, we would have closed the business.  It is about hanging on and that is where county enterprise boards come in.  They give advice and ideas to people on how to retain business.</P>
        <P>The most extraordinary statistic in the global economic survey report was that 90% of small businesses employ fewer than ten people.  A total of 2,500 SMEs employ 800,000 people, a staggering figure.  I have known this in my heart and this survey supports my theory.</P>
        <P>This leads me to the outrage that is our banking institutions.  I warmly welcome the possibility of a merger between Permanent tsb, the EBS and other smaller banks.  If the two larger banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, are pushed to one side, the proposed conglomerate might be more willing and able to support small business.  More than half of SMEs have been refused funding.  Some were told following an initial telephone call or meeting that they need not complete an application for credit because they will be refused.  That is an outrage when one considers the billions of euro we have put into supporting the banks.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler requested us to come up with solutions.  The banks should be instructed and we should have this control and power when the Oireachtas and NAMA are supporting them to tell them what to do and how to support small business which are the mainstay of the State.  The banks say they approve nine out of every ten loan applications but most SMEs cannot even get to the stage of completing an application form because they have been told by their bank manager that they need not apply.  That statistic is disingenuous.</P>
        <P>I attended a meeting of Westmeath County Council yesterday.  The council debated the jobs that need to be carried out around the county and the fact nobody is available to do the work because of the public service recruitment embargo.  One councillor asked why all the people who are signing on cannot be put on a community employment, CE, scheme and encouraged to work in local authority areas.  I acknowledge this could raise industrial relations issue with unions and so on but there are ways around this.  F&Aacute;S through CE schemes gave a fantastic start to many people in the past.  F&Aacute;S was the provider of CE schemes in the past and I cannot see why this cannot be done again.  It is Fine Gael policy to introduce more of these schemes.  For example, they could be established to employ people to improve the shorelines of Lough Ree and Lough Ennell, to paint buildings and so on.  So much work could be done.</P>
        <P>There are three ways to create jobs and I would like the Minister of State, in particular, to comment on cutting 35% of the county enterprise board budget.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I congratulate him on his comprehensive contribution.  I also welcome Senator Dearey, as I did not have the opportunity to do so previously.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State gave us a comprehensive report and I always like to look at the glass as half full rather than half empty.  Over the past few weeks, a few positive developments have happened with a number of foreign companies taking on new employees or announcing new jobs.  That is positive because had the downward trend continued, we would have been in serious trouble.  Nobody likes to read the figures highlighting the massive number of people unemployed, especially those aged under 25 to whom the Minister of State alluded.  That is a tragedy.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>A great deal has been done for apprentices but a number of them are caught in a dilemma in that they had almost completed their apprenticeship with different companies, which went into liquidation, and they cannot secure their qualification.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, about this in the House and I acknowledge the issue is being worked on but I ask that it be treated with urgency.  It is disheartening for these young people.  Some of the proposals F&Aacute;S is coming up with are ridiculous.  Perhaps the organisation was too liberal in the past but it is no good now to go to the other extreme.  We must move on and give young people an opportunity.</P>
        <P>We have never had an awful lot of employment in my part of the country but we were fortunate in our local communities to have indigenous industries and, thankfully, they are still going strong.  For example, Ballyhaunis still has Dawn Meats, Western Brand Chicken Limited and engineering companies such as Cashels Engineering Limited.  They may have cut the hours of workers but they continue to give employment and everything should be done to help and encourage them and to ensure they are kept going.  They are a major asset to south and east Mayo and to parts of counties Sligo and Roscommon.</P>
        <P>Not enough use has been made of Ireland West Airport Knock in my county.  The airport has a large land bank, which is zoned for industrial use.  The IDA, the county enterprise board and a number of Departments are working together to make sure something gets off the ground similar to Shannon Development.  I ask the Minister of State and his Department to give every support to this enterprise.  It is the jewel in the crown and it is well situated to take up the slack for many areas.</P>
        <P>He mentioned education in his contribution.  It is still the most important factor.  The introduction of free education in the mid-1960s by Donogh O&rsquo;Malley took a while to seep through the system but when it did, we were on the crest of a wave with a young, vibrant educated people who were ready to take up the jobs coming on stream.  Everything possible should be done to keep that going.  This is close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s heart.</P>
        <P>He alluded to the banks, as did a number of Senators.  The banks are not being fair and they are not doing right by the people given the amount put into them by the State.  They are not giving back anything.  The Minister of State said he has talked to them and asked them to make money available to small businesses.  It is vital they do so and the sooner the better.  At present they are not doing it and it is causing immense problems for businesses.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke at length about research and development, which I regard as vital.  It is good to know we have, I suppose, a friend in a high place, the new Commissioner, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, and that research and development is in her remit.  I hope the Government will work closely with her to get whatever is available from the European perspective for research and development.</P>
        <P>Many grants have been given to support jobs, which I welcome.  However, I have one gripe.  I recently heard of a case of a man who applied for a job through the community employment scheme only to be told after the interview he was not eligible because he had worked for 15 weeks in the previous 12 months.  He was in receipt of unemployment assistance and went to work for 15 weeks which showed he was willing and wanted to work.  Now, because he worked for those 15 weeks, he cannot get on the community employment scheme.  Rules are rules and nobody knows more about them than I do.  However, I believe that is bordering on the ridiculous.  A person who genuinely wants to work should be given every encouragement to do so rather than placing obstacles in his or her way.  I ask the Minister of State to review the matter.  I know it goes across a few different Departments and comes primarily under the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  To tackle unemployment we must retain and create jobs, which should be the top priority for Government.  The haemorrhaging of jobs has been the most significant contributor to the state of the public finances.  The Government has been too focused on the issues of banking and public finances to the relative neglect of the unemployment issue.  Training and education initiatives must be prioritised to enhance the skills of those in employment and increasing the employability of the unemployed.  There has been much fanfare about the smart economy but little concrete action.  It is only through reviving economic activity and reducing unemployment that the fiscal crisis can be properly addressed.</P>
        <P>Ireland must effect a major economic transition from a property-dependent economy to an export-led economy.  We must build strong indigenous firms as well as attracting foreign direct investment.  It means putting in place infrastructure that complements the knowledge economy and ensuring investment is channelled towards enterprise and infrastructure.  Crucially, it means investing in people at all skill levels.  The knowledge economy will not be built just by talking about it.  We need concrete action to build up the firms we have and support job creation with realistic economy-wide and sectoral strategies.</P>
        <P>Labour is proposing to establish a jobs fund to support a new jobs strategy.  This fund would not be allocated through the conventional Estimates system.  Instead, Departments and agencies would be required to submit business cases to a Cabinet task force which would evaluate them and distribute resources accordingly.  Measures to be supported by the fund would include additional resources to support enterprise, sectoral development strategies, a major skills and work experience drive, and fast-tracked and high priority capital projects.  Obviously the issue of costs, as highlighted by an bord snip nua, must be addressed, but the overriding concern is the need to support enterprise and enhance employment creation.  Certainly, there is a requirement for better analysis of the outcomes of spending programmes.  Money must not be wasted.</P>
        <P>Ireland has suffered considerable reputational damage as a result of the banking crisis but still offers important attractions to overseas investors.  These must be preserved, including the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  We might even consider reducing this tax rate as one of the previous Senators suggested.</P>
        <P>Greater attention must be focused, however, on the development of indigenous firms in high value added activities.  Enterprise supports provided through State agencies have a vital role to play in helping firms to start up and grow.  They provide assistance and knowledge at critical phases in the life of a firm.  When the system is functioning at its best, a firm can draw on a range of formal and informal resources, including contact with other firms which can share knowledge and experience.  The role of the enterprise support agencies is also vital in understanding market conditions and demanding improved performance in return for assistance.  The enterprise support agencies will function best when they operate in a coherent network that emphasises the importance of market knowledge.</P>
        <P>Merging the Film Board into Enterprise Ireland, as proposed by an bord snip nua, for example, risks the loss of specialised expertise with minimal savings in return.  Enterprise strategy should be focused not on the withdrawal of supports but on their extension and development.  The criteria for support should be extended.  These would include, for example, support in certain circumstances for import substituting firms as well as those with an export focus.  The range of interventions should also be expanded.</P>
        <P>The employer job PRSI incentive scheme is welcome but I question the need to restrict the scheme to people who have been on the live register for at least six months.  If a person has lost his or her job, why apply this restriction?  Will the Minister of State reconsider this requirement?  I have mentioned to him the length of time &mdash; currently 22 weeks &mdash; for unemployed <Col N="284"/>people to have their application for benefit processed.  Although I risk being accused of going on about it, it is vital to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Greater focus and resources should be placed on using the county and city enterprise boards to support small business start-ups.  The eligibility criteria for support from the county and city enterprise boards should be re-examined to promote activity.</P>
        <P>An bord snip nua highlighted a rapid rise in spending on science technology and innovation and the inadequacy of formal evaluation of this spending.  It does not provide adequate justification for its proposal to centralise and cut spending in this area.  This approach risks an excessive targeting of resources on a limited number of areas.  We must maintain investment in a diverse range of knowledge areas and enhance the capacity of the system to develop commercial applications for research activities.  This should be built into the STI funding system.</P>
        <P>It is also important to develop sectoral strategies to be pursued by relevant agencies.  The maintenance of the Irish Film Board, for example, should form part of an overall strategy for developing jobs in creative industries.  Labour has also recently published proposals for developing so-called green jobs, to which I will refer later.  It is important that short-sighted proposals in the an bord snip nua report are not implemented.  For example, the suggestion that tourism marketing budgets be cut is particularly ill-advised given the fall-off in numbers coming to Ireland and our loss of market share, especially from Britain.  Rather than cutting marketing spend in the UK, there is a strong case for expanding it.</P>
        <P>The jobs fund would be available to support sectoral strategies in a number of areas, with particular emphasis on food, tourism, creative industries and green jobs.  In its document entitled Just the Job, the Labour Party has set out a series of initiatives to provide training, educational and work experience opportunities for those without work, including an earn and learn scheme that keeps people in employment while upskilling, a graduate and apprentice work placement scheme for 30,000 young people, reducing the qualifying period for the back to education and the back to work enterprise allowances, a tax-back scheme to fund full-time study, mobilising further education colleges and institutes of technology to respond to demand for retraining, a skills exchange to help maximise the expertise available for retraining, and additional resources for literacy programmes.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Throughout the bubble years there was a rapid expansion in the scale of the public capital programme.  Economic circumstances have now changed, and there is a need for a re-assessment of investment priorities.  A new national development plan should be drawn up based on a fresh assessment of key economic and social investment needs.  This should be explicitly linked to the requirements of enterprise strategy.  Given the fall in tender prices across the economy there is scope for a substantial reduction in the capital programme without affecting the volume of activity.  We must support capital investment projects that can be rolled out quickly.  These should include a major schools building and prefab replacement programme, an additional allocation to the warmer homes scheme as part of the compensating measures accompanying the carbon tax, and other initiatives supporting training needs, including capital provision for further education.</P>
        <P>It is internationally accepted that renewable energy projects have the potential to create new employment and replace jobs in traditional industries that are unsustainable.  In Germany, for example, the number of jobs in the renewable sector is now greater than in car manufacturing.  Initiatives aimed at taking advantage of these opportunities must be put in place immediately.  Earlier this year, Bord na M&oacute;na announced the creation of 300 sustainable clean energy jobs over the next five years.  The jobs will be created in green energy, resource recovery and environmental solutions using innovative green technologies.  That is the future for job creation <Col N="285"/>in Ireland.  The future can be good for Ireland but we must exploit the opportunity and make it happen.</P>
        <P>Key to success for the indigenous sector is credit flow from the banking sector and despite what the banks say when they appear before committees of these Houses, the evidence on the is that this is not happening.  I heard what the Minister of State said earlier but greater pressure must be brought to bear on banks to release the essential credit to viable businesses.</P>
        <P>I want to raise some questions regarding the former SR Technics workers who are seeking funding under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.  Has the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment provided the additional information to the Commission as requested?  Why was the application to the globalisation fund made so late and not straight away when they were let go?  Can the Government provide a bridging loan to the DIT in the meantime until the funding comes through?  Will the matter be resolved before the workers&rsquo; jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit runs out on 3 April 2010 when will they face a means test for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  It is nice to meet him.  I was almost freaked out by the welcoming comments made to me last week, namely, that my background in business qualified me to be an expert in business.  I will make it clear.  In the overall economy I am a bottom feeder.  I take product in, add value and sell it on.  It takes me and nine others to do that and we are employed gainfully in doing it, but it is the people I rely on &mdash; my customers &mdash; many of whom are involved in exports, who are the real wealth creators.  That is the great engine of wealth creation in any economy.</P>
        <P>While I would be glad to be in receipt of any help as an employer, for instance, with the PRSI holiday when taking on an unemployed person, what I would really like to see emanating from these Houses is an attack on costs that would allow our exporters to work more productively and successfully.  It is on export led manufacturing and services that I want to focus my attention initially.  I will refer also to finance for job creation, the often complex and frustrating experience small and medium-sized businesses and State agencies enjoy, how we can deal with that and begin to ramp up in terms of scale and speed the potential of SMEs in a number of sectors.</P>
        <P>On the question of costs for exporters, there is a tacit acknowledgement that our PRSI rates in this country are high at 10.75%.  We must examine that in a clear sighted way and determine whether it is a block towards attracting investment into the country and a factor that makes our potential exporters less competitive.  We must do that in a clear sighted way and assess all the costs incurred by exporting businesses through the lens of job creation.</P>
        <P>Another example would be utility costs, which probably have further to fall.  The burden of local government finance needs to be shared more widely so that local authorities can be more flexible in their dealings with companies in terms of development levies, rates and other charges.  I work closely with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on the way local authorities can cut a less burdensome deal with businesses, especially exporting businesses.</P>
        <P>We do some things really well in this country, including food, financial services and software development, but I see energy as the next great export.  The east-west interconnector has been referred to.  Ultimately, there will be a connection to mainland Europe that ought to allow us export what we are abundant in, namely, naturally generated electricity through either tidal or wind power.  That is an export area towards which we are only slowly ramping up.  It is an area on which we need to focus much more attention and, ultimately, the green jobs &mdash; a term I <Col N="286"/>hate although it is probably forgivable to use it in this context &mdash; that will emanate from it will be many.</P>
        <P>Indigenous companies that are exporting are heroic in many ways.  Our peripherality on the edge of Europe means it takes a particular kind of effort and individual to become a manufacturing or a service exporter.  I am aware of several in my part of the world who have dedicated years of their lives, and in some cases much of their windfalls or pensions, to developing new ideas for Ireland.  They want to work here because they are loyal to the country.  I pay tribute to their heroic efforts.</P>
        <P>In regard to credit, very often for an SME a &ldquo;no&rdquo; from the bank seems to be the end of the idea but that should not necessarily be the case.  There is a way in which our enterprise agencies and county enterprise boards can begin to engage in a more creative way with SMEs regarding credit if the bank is saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and they have been saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  While there are signs this may change soon, it is not a reason not to look elsewhere for liquidity.  For instance, for companies with a market value of &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million there is the possibility of a secondary listing on the stock exchange.  A few SMEs may have to merge to create that kind of value but the merging of smaller companies to create an entity that can attract finance is something our enterprise agencies should be examining more creatively.  As long as debt was cheap, and it was during the Celtic tiger years, other ways of raising money went out of favour, but they need to come back into favour and one way in which that is possible is through venture capital and equity.  I am aware that Enterprise Ireland, for instance, runs a type of venture capital scheme for high potential worth businesses, but that could be extended to enterprise boards to allow them get involved at a more local level with smaller companies that are experiencing great difficulty accessing credit.  They should be encouraged to examine that idea, even if it means they have to develop skills in company merging and so on.</P>
        <P>The third point I want to raise is the interface between enterprise and the agencies.  The previous contribution was heavily laden with reference to agency support for SMEs, but very often it is one frustration after another for those SMEs.  I am talking about the view from their side of the fence.  There appears to be an inability at times to speak the same language, and that must be tackled.  The area is complex but we need to intensify the relationships between dynamic SMEs and, in particular, research teams in our institutes.  Research and development needs to be better informed by the market and the emphasis should be on supplying products to the marketplace because we are in a jobs crisis.  While research for the sake of it may be worthwhile in the good times, it is not something in which we can indulge at present.  We must emphasise the job potential of any research project undertaken in our colleges and institutes of technology, as well as the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises to deliver.</P>
        <P>I am particularly interested in the smart grid idea, that is, the development of registered power zones throughout the country so that devices can talk to one another and respond to the supply and demand of electricity.  This is an area in which dozens of small and medium-sized enterprises could be established because a world of new product is needed to create the smart grids.  The concept is still in its infancy in Europe and although we are slightly behind the wave, we can catch up.  Research teams can get together with dynamic local small and medium-sized enterprises to create products that can deliver the smart grid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  In any economic crisis the first tangible and damaging result is the loss of jobs.  In Ireland, the abundance of opportunities that presented to younger people over the years of the boom are now sadly lacking and our brightest and best are on the dole queues or contemplating emigration.  These are tragic times for our country.</P><Col N="287"/>
        <P>It will not be easy to address this problem and a number of initiatives will be required.  I am sure I am not alone in confessing that I do not have the answer but I see areas where changes made now would make it easier to create jobs.  We need to offer incentives to employers to take on new employees.  The greatest barrier to workforce expansion is the lack of need and many employers struggle to find work for their existing employees, never mind create new positions.  Despite this obstacle, it remains the case that some workplaces have the capacity to create jobs and we need to do everything in our power to incentivise them.  In particular, we need to expedite the PRSI holiday scheme announced in the budget for newly created jobs.  Currently, PRSI contributions by employers run at about 10%, which is a huge disincentive for them to employ staff.  A similar scheme existed prior to the 2010 budget but it has been closed to new entrants and its replacement has yet to be published.</P>
        <P>We also need to investigate the minimum wage.  I have previously addressed this issue in the House.  Nobody wants to see our citizens working in sweatshops but equally we do not want them scraping by on the dole.  A mechanism exists for companies to pay less than the minimum wage where they are unable to afford the agreed rates.  While it is regrettable that employers are forced to do this, it would be far more regrettable to force people out of employment and onto the dole.  I question whether we have the mechanisms we need to oversee the minimum wage rates set by the various joint labour committees and registered employment agreements.  The recent Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 was a missed opportunity to change the regime and perhaps we ought to revisit the issue in light of subsequent experience.</P>
        <P>We need to enable and encourage unemployed people to upskill.  This objective could be aided by a review of the restrictions placed on people seeking to access F&Aacute;S and VTOS retraining schemes.  Most of these schemes require an applicant to be unemployed for a number of weeks or months and while there may have been good reasons for this requirement in the past, we need a far more flexible system today.  Let people who want to access the schemes do so at the earliest opportunity.  A change to this requirement would be very helpful for the young people who, as I noted earlier, are among the worst affected.</P>
        <P>Equally important for the people who are lucky enough to get an offer of employment is the decision about leaving the safety net provided by the social welfare system.  Nobody wants to stay on welfare but people risk losing benefits once they enter the workforce.  I ask the Government to explore ways of allowing people re-entering the workforce after a period of unemployment to keep certain benefits, as is currently the case for medical cards.  The cost of such a measure would be minimal and it would pay for itself if it acted as a further incentive to work.  I acknowledge, however, that I am speaking about the small minority of people who are lucky enough to gain an offer of employment and that we must focus the majority who are not in that category.</P>
        <P>The driver of our knowledge economy is education.  I want to highlight the Government&rsquo;s shocking failure to map out a roadmap for the third level sector.  Despite its great importance to society and the economy, a coherent mission statement does not exist for the sector.  I do not propose to be prescriptive at this stage nor am I urging that colleges be run centrally.  I am simply advocating that the third level sector be given goals towards which colleges are encouraged to work.  This would eliminate some of the mission creep seen in certain institutes.  I understand a working group under the auspices of the Higher Education Authority has been created and I strongly urge the Minister for Education and Science to expedite its deliberations and work towards the creation of a strategy with a strong focus on graduate employability.</P>
        <P>As for college courses, Senators have discussed in recent days the worrying practice of grade inflation.  It would be dangerous for the country if this type of behaviour affected the reputation of our institutions of higher education.  Does course design change with the times?  I am a <Col N="288"/>strong believer in Newman&rsquo;s idea of the university as a provider of holistic education, especially in respect of the humanities.  I have often argued that students pursuing courses in engineering, medicine and other applied disciplines should also be exposed to the humanities as part of their education.  However, we must also move with the times in course design.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a recent issue of the alumni magazine of my <i>alma mater</i>, NUI Galway, I read about a new course in the faculty of commerce designed in collaboration with local businessmen, notable among them Padraig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh of Aer Arann.  Business people give a considerable amount of mentoring to final year students so they can learn practical skills and the course requires from the students a demonstration of entrepreneurship.  This is a timely response to the crisis because we need graduates who can hit the ground running and think outside the box.  That mindset needs to permeate the culture of our third level institutes and their graduates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on job creation.  Last week, we had a debate on unemployment, which is obviously the biggest issue facing the country at present.  I welcome the opportunity to make a few new points and to reiterate others that were made in the last couple of debates.  This is a subject we must discuss on a monthly basis at least and if people can suggest new innovative approaches, they should be listened to with an open mind by the Government.  I am sure that will be the case.</P>
        <P>First, it is important to acknowledge that the latest unemployment figures are a cause of relief, if not celebration, given that when the figures are seasonally adjusted they show there has been a reduction of 2,300 on the live register.  That is the most positive news we have had with regard to unemployment for the last couple of years.  I hope it represents a stabilisation, but there is a long way to go when one considers that approximately 12.8% of people are unemployed and that 28.4% of those are under 25 years of age, which is the highest rate of youth unemployment in Europe.</P>
        <P>The Government has undertaken a number of good initiatives.  There was the IDA announcement earlier this week about its focused approach and the prioritisation of gateway cities under <Col N="289"/>the national spatial strategy.  I welcome this very much.  It is a shame that after the national spatial strategy was launched seven years ago to much fanfare we did not follow that blueprint in a more rigid fashion.  Occasionally, there were Government announcements which made reference to the national spatial strategy when it suited but more often than not they avoided mentioning it if, as was the case in many instances, the policies being pursued or the announcements were not necessarily in line with investing in the nine gateway cities and the hubs.</P>
        <P>Over the last couple of debates I have had the opportunity to highlight some of the things I have worked on, such as a paper on entrepreneurship education for Ireland.  I will not discuss all the proposals highlighted in the paper but Ireland is one of the few countries in the developed world which has not embraced the need to introduce an integrated policy of entrepreneurship education to run from primary school through to third and fourth level education.  I hope there will be more progress in that regard.  I have spoken to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science about it and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and the other Ministers responsible for enterprise are favourably disposed towards it.</P>
        <P>Last week, there was also an opportunity to discuss an integrated labour policy.  There are anomalies between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with its focus on employment and the Department of Social and Family Affairs and its responsibility for unemployment.  We must have a single integrated Department for labour where unemployment is not seen as a social welfare issue but as an employment issue, on which F&Aacute;S and employment assistance is focused.  There are abuses and we must be cognisant of that, and if it was a Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment rather than social welfare issue, we could be more focused.  I have been given two anecdotal examples from sources I believe in my constituency of Sligo-North Leitrim.  One is a cr&egrave;che which interviewed 29 people for three positions.  No individuals were prepared to take a full-time job.  They preferred to work for three days so they could claim social welfare for the other two as they liked the lifestyle that would result.  That is fundamentally incorrect and we should not facilitate it.</P>
        <P>There is also the anomaly whereby an adult with an adult dependant on the minimum wage gets approximately &euro;340 per week whereas an adult dependant who is not working but is on social welfare get approximately &euro;10 less than that.  I am not arguing for a decrease in the minimum wage or for increasing unemployment assistance but there is an issue in that regard.  That has been demonstrated in Sligo today, where people have said they would prefer to work for just three days and claim social welfare for the other two.  That is wrong and an abuse; it should not be allowed.  Ireland does not have much of a future if we work on that basis.  There is also anecdotal evidence of a transport company which put all its employees on a three day week.  Now that the company is a little busier very few are prepared to go back to a five day week because, again, they prefer that lifestyle.  They can work for three days and claim social welfare for the other two.  These are the issues on which we should focus.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to be involved in an analysis to be undertaken of the allocation of resources towards entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  This involves Dr. Tom Cooney, who is a research fellow with Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, Professor Anders Lundstr&ouml;m, founder of the Swedish Foundation for Small Business Research, and Professor David Storey, professor of entrepreneurship in the University of Sussex.  I was pleased to meet with the T&aacute;naiste and other Ministers last week about the research programme.  It will carry out an analysis of all entrepreneurship expenditure across all Government Departments.  The results will be known later this year and will assist the Government in targeting expenditure and maximising the outcomes from expenditure in the enterprise area.  I welcome this analysis.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to retail employment in the Border counties.  A very serious situation has emerged in the last number of months, if not years.  There are a number of anomalies such as <Col N="290"/>a differential of approximately 30% in the minimum wage, the sterling-euro exchange rate, a difference in VAT rates, although the 0.5% decrease in our VAT rate has improved matters since the last budget, and the fact that people are crossing the Border to shop.  I do not and cannot blame people for seeking value for money.  However, this is a very serious issue for the six Border counties and must be addressed.  I call on the Minister to consider actively the introduction of commercial rates subvention for retail businesses in those counties.  That could be done through a fixed percentage decrease in rates by each of the local authorities in those areas, which could be refunded to the local authorities through an increase in their allocation from the local government fund so they are not penalised for supporting retailers.  This would be of great benefit to retailers in those areas and ensure that retail employment can continue.  In Sligo alone, 2,500 people are connected with employment in the retail sector.  However, like shops in all the towns throughout Ireland, many shops are having difficulties and this has been exacerbated in Border counties by the price differentials as a result of the minimum wage, VAT and so forth.  Directly subventing commercial rates would be an innovative approach and something tangible the Government could do for retailers in those six Border counties.  Indeed, Sligo Borough Council reduced rates by 2.5% for businesses this year.</P>
        <P>Another initiative in Sligo, which other counties might have mimicked, is what is called the Fair Dealer campaign.  The trade union movement has joined with the chamber of commerce and a number of retailers to focus on where they can reduce prices and directly compete with cross-Border shopping.  It is an innovative campaign.  In Sligo they have introduced a &ldquo;Love Sligo&rdquo; retail card which is distributed to all members of the trade union movement, students in the institute of technology and anybody else who is prepared to take it.  It gives discounts in the participating stores.  In fairness to the innovation and commitment of those retailers, who are trying to save employment and support enterprise in the area, the Government should be seen to try to match that.  Obviously, it cannot reduce the VAT rate for just those six counties or give that type of assistance.  We could reimburse the local authorities, through the local government fund, which would give the retailers concerned additional resources to help them further reduce prices and compete with colleagues on a cross-Border basis.  As a republican, I am a strong advocate of a united Ireland but until we have a universal VAT rate and minimum wage, we will have these difficulties in the Border counties.  Many initiatives have been taken to create employment.  Let us ensure we can maintain them in the retailing sector in the Border counties through innovative approaches such as a subvention in respect of commercial rates.</P>

	<P>I raise an issue which I have raised in the House on a number of occasions, that is, the attitude the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, has taken towards emigration and the creation of jobs for young people.  I wish to focus on the fact that in the past two years the number of people under the age of 25 years who have lost their jobs is 104,000.  They account for almost 60% of the total number of job losses in the economy.  These are the people who are bearing the brunt of the changes which have taken place in the labour market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that.  Those bearing the brunt of the changes which have place place in the labour market and the economy are young people.  They do not have a voice or representation which other parts of our society enjoy.  </P>
        <P>On young people and emigration, in the past few weeks the T&aacute;naiste has been questioned twice regarding her role in the matter.  I would like the Minister of State to take the opportunity to outline the view of the Government.  I saw the T&aacute;naiste being questioned on BBC on whether she accepted the level of involuntary emigration.  She refused to answer the question and at one point said young people were emigrating for fun.  It is true; I saw it with own eyes.  She went on to say it was not a bad thing that our best and brightest were going abroad to look for work in other economies.  The transcript is available at the BBC.  When she was questioned, she did not deny it.  A week later, when she was asked on &ldquo;Primetime&rdquo; on RTE if she accepted the level of involuntary emigration, again she did not answer or acknowledge the question.  If we have a Minister running the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and making a statement that it is not a bad thing that some of our best and brightest are going abroad and that some are going for fun, what does that say about our hope to deal with the issue of youth unemployment?  The emigration of our best and brightest is not policy, rather it is a dereliction of duty and a catastrophe.  I would like the Minister of State to indicate to the House his views on the matter, as the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment appears unwilling to do so.</P>
        <P>One reason this is a disaster for the country is that in previous times when the economy experienced emigration, people returned home.  I was lucky enough to be able to do so, like many people my age.  We were able to return because two things fell into place.  First, the national finances were strong which allowed the creation of employment and people like me return.  Second, there was a focus on job creation measures and strategies which focused on young people and getting emigrants to return home.</P>
        <P>I have four suggestions to make to the Minister of State which would be worthy of consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I was interrupted many times by mobile phones.  I would be grateful if the Chair gave me one minute to complete my contribution.</P>
        <P>More could be done to select industries to receive support targeted at job creation for young people.  What is happening in the gaming industry is an example.  Some two thirds of the people working in electronic media are under the age of 35 years.  More should be done to integrate measures in the social welfare system in order to allow young people to enter employment without having their wages reduced.  As was suggested, we should examine the idea of a PRSI and income tax holiday for people under the age of 26 years.  If such a measure was implemented, we could combine it with an examination of the role and level of the minimum wage for people of that age because what is happening to young people, in particular young men, is a disaster.  A far more activist approach should be taken to deal with the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought about what I would say on the issue of job creation and thought I would give a practical example because everybody has given an overview of the situation and mentioned the almost 450,000 people who are out of work, of whom more than 100,000 are under 25 years of age.  This time last year people came to my office who were very stressed as a result of losing their jobs, in particular fathers in their mid-40s with two children in college and a third in a grind school.  One man said he had an idea to set up a cycling tourism business which I said was great.  He asked where he would receive help.  When I mentioned the <Col N="292"/>enterprise board, he said he needed a job to repay his mortgage because he was worried he would lose his house.  I told him I did not provide jobs and asked him to discuss his idea for a cycling tourism business.  That experience stayed with me.  </P>
        <P>This time last year, before National Women&rsquo;s Day, which is next Monday, three other colleagues and I had a conversation, from which was born the Job Creation Oranmore Initiative.  We were careful to describe it as an initiative as our aim was to help people to get started in business and provide hope.  It is going from strength to strength.  We set up a panel of experts which is available free of charge and which includes a former banker with more than 40 years&rsquo; experience, a marketing person, an IT person, a solicitor and a number of business coaches.  We worked out the initiative and coached a number of people who had come to me to develop their skills.  They start with me; I work on their needs and refer them to the expert panel which can give them help.  We are like a friendly &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Den&rdquo;.  We meet every two or three weeks and, on average, have four or five clients every time we meet.  Last October we had a job creation open day and were fortunate to have George Lee attend.  There were approximately 300 people present.  The initiative has since gone from strength to strength.  Each week in my constituency office I hold a jobs clinic and the panel meets regularly.  Last night I presented the idea to Athlone Chamber of Commerce because it was gaining credence and popularity.  We developed the initiative because no solutions were being offered by the Government.  Therefore, we decided to help ourselves.  When somebody comes to us, we can offer him or her expertise which, if he or she was to get started in business, would cost him or her &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000.  It is all available free of charge.  We do not say we will be there for ever.  Obviously, people must help themselves as well.  However, I shall list some of the businesses we have helped to date.  They include a fashion business, a young company working in environmental planning, a person who wants to get started in water harvesting, a person in the interior decor business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The single biggest challenge facing Ireland in 2010 is to create jobs and reduce unemployment.  Urgent action is required to improve our competitiveness in order to support job creation and export growth.  Speaking on 14 January at the launch of a report, Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Challenge &mdash; Creating a Better Future, Dr. Don Thornhill, chairman of the National Competitiveness Council, said speedy implementation of the priority actions identified in the report is as fundamental to Ireland&rsquo;s future as the steps being taken to address the banking crisis and arrest the decline in public finances.</P>
        <P>Improving our export performance and raising productivity across all areas of the economy, including local and international trading sectors and the public services, are the only sustainable strategies for securing long-term prosperity for our people, reducing unemployment and sustaining the standard of living.  Although Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness improved during 2009, to a great extent this was due to the sharpness of the recession rather than to competitive advantages arising from structural change.  The priority recommendation in the report by the National Competitiveness Council puts strong emphasis on skilled development which is critical in supporting the competitiveness of existing firms by enhancing their capabilities and increasing productivity growth.</P>
        <P>We must reduce the cost of doing business.  It must fall relative to that of our trading partners.  The priority actions report noted that limited competition and locally traded sectors of the economy, especially in the professions, have serious implications for the cost of doing business in Ireland.  We need to drive competition in these sectors and in the legal and accountancy professions and consultancy groups especially with regard to the effective implementation of the competitiveness council&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>High utility costs that have been in place for years are damaging the competitiveness of exporting sectors such as food, information technology, hardware and engineering industries.  Recent energy price reductions were necessary but have not been sufficient.  Further actions are required, such as phasing out price supports for renewable energy as the technology matures and deployment increases.</P>
        <P>My next point has been raised an unbelievable number of times and still nothing has happened.  Careful consideration needs to be given to freezing and, where possible, reducing local authority commercial rates.  Every submission made to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has included this issue.  We must prioritise infrastructural investment to support enterprise.  Reducing capital expenditure to maintain current expenditure will not help our long-term competitiveness.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to the construction industry.  Total employment in the industry, both direct and indirect, will fall to approximately 100,000 by the end of 2010, a reduction from 400,000 in 2007.  This is a severe blow.  Output is set to fall below &euro;10 billion in 2010.  In 2007 the industry earned beyond what would be considered normal, namely, &euro;38,500,000.  This growth was not sustainable, of course, and was unrealistic.  However, there is a crisis in the construction industry now.  We are losing skills and professions.  Architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, technicians <Col N="294"/>and tradespeople are being lost.  We are losing sight of what will happen when our economy recovers in the next two years as the world economy improves.  There is no doubt that will happen but we are missing the boat by not maintaining investment in capital expenditure.  There is no doubt about the improvement that took place in our roads infrastructure during the past ten years.  It is a wonderful sight to behold and a pleasure to drive on.  With tendering costs of 25% and the very competitive pricing now available it is a shame not to avail of these.  For every worker who loses a job in construction it costs us as much in social welfare payments as the salary that was earned.</P>
        <P>I have spoken non-stop on the Order of Business about job creation and employment.  The number one priority is to get the banks to free up money to companies.  The chicanery and irresponsibility of the banks in this country and their attitude to small and medium-sized businesses are immoral.  In time a story will be told about their rough manner and the brutality of their actions towards such companies who employ people.</P>
        <P>The good news yesterday was that the T&aacute;naiste launched the Horizon 2020 programme.  She made the point that foreign direct investment will continue to be very important to us.</P>
        <P>I have raised one point on numerous occasions in this House.  I attended the Craig Barrett lecture in the Mansion House.  He pointed that the PISA yardstick that measures standards of mathematics shows ours to be only average.  It has fallen to average.  When Intel came to this country 20 years ago the knowledge of our graduates and young people was much higher than that of the same group today.  The more we move towards the technology industries of the future the more mathematics and cognitive thinking will be needed as the base and ground work of these industries.  Unfortunately, one can get great points to enter university by learning things off by heart.  It takes more effort to study mathematics and science and those points are harder to get.  We have a fundamental problem regarding the next generation of industries, nano-technology.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, is addressing this issue.  He has been lobbied by multinational companies which have put billions of euro of investment into this country.  It is far more efficient for them to reinvest in Ireland rather than having to go to a new country where the standard of education in mathematics is much higher.  The bottom line is that cognitive thinking, entrepreneurship and risk-taking are the skills of the future.  If Ireland wants to compete, we have to be as good as our competitors in China, India, Israel and Singapore.  Europe has lost the game whereas they are the empires of the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is impressive to see the amount of work that has been done and the effort made.  Some of what we have heard of today is already taking place in many ways.  The Minister of State has heard me speak on this issue before because I said something similar to him perhaps two years ago.  The point I want to make is that the creation of jobs by Government is not the way to go.  We must find a way so that, if jobs are to be created, it would be because there is a need for them.</P>
        <P>I am not normally a supporter of Sinn F&eacute;in but I point out that Sinn F&eacute;in means &ldquo;we ourselves&rdquo;.  I believe the answer is much more independent creation of jobs by individuals themselves.  There is an opportunity in this regard.  I told the story some years ago of being on a partnership committee with the objective to create jobs in the particular area I was located.  I went to the committee full of enthusiasm for the sort of work we needed to do.  We needed our windows cleaned but we could not get somebody in the area to clean them.  We needed somebody to supply us with vegetables and jam if we could get these supplied locally.  When I went to the meeting, I found that in all cases the committee members wanted to send somebody <Col N="295"/>to Dublin to get the Government, the IDA, F&Aacute;S or some other body to come down and do what they could for us.</P>
        <P>We have to encourage entrepreneurship and we have to believe that people can create jobs themselves.  There are opportunities to do this.  In that case, I know a young man who decided, when he heard me make the point about cleaning windows, to set up a window cleaning business, which he then sold on at the end of the year.  This shows the potential to create jobs.</P>
        <P>I fear there has not been recognition that jobs in distribution are real jobs.  It was only last week when we saw Hughes &amp; Hughes and a fashion company go out of business that we began to realise there is a recognition that distribution is the creation of real, permanent jobs and that it is possible to do that, although only if the businesses are successful.  In the past, the situation was such that jobs were only regarded as jobs if they were manufacturing some product.  In fact, those of us in distribution were regarded almost as parasites.</P>
        <P>For example, when I finished studying commerce in university, some years later I met my professor, the dean of the faculty of commerce, in one of my supermarkets.  I was in my 20s at the time and as he did not recognise me, I introduced myself to him and he asked what I was doing there.  When I said I was working there, he did not realise it was my own shop, and he said it was wonderful that one of his students was actually working in business.  For the vast majority in those days, the 1960s, when a person finished university, it was supposed he or she went on to become either a teacher, an accountant or do some other job but not to create a job himself or herself.</P>
        <P>I encourage people to realise there is a need and an opportunity for business.  To a certain extent, if we talk ourselves into assuming that somebody else will create a job, and ask why somebody does not create a job for us, then it will not happen.  The Government has to make it more attractive.  We have to remove the barriers to jobs.</P>
        <P>Let me take one example of this.  Dr. Don Thornhill of the National Competitiveness Council was referred to earlier by Senator Mary White.  We need to be more competitive.  What can the State do about this?  There are some steps it can take.  One of the arguments that has been made by the retail sector is that something can be done to avoid the upward rent reviews that are taking place.  I can understand somebody who has signed up to pay rent objecting to the fact that this rent is now too high, but if they signed up for the rent, they will have to negotiate with the landlord, who is not likely to change it.  However, if an upward rent review is stapled into legislation, that is wrong and does not stand up.  I know the Government is taking some action in this regard but it has a long way to go before all the barriers are removed.</P>
        <P>Let me deal with one other barrier.  I firmly believe the minimum wage is a barrier.  We have the second highest minimum wage in Europe, to the best of my knowledge, and, while we want to be competitive, some jobs do not exist at that minimum wage.  We can say this is outrageous and that we should be not be paying somebody as little as that, but paying a minimum wage which is a multiple of what it is in other parts of Europe makes us uncompetitive in many ways.  Jobs are more important than income.  If somebody does not want to work at that rate, they do not have to do so, but if we have a minimum wage that states we must pay this particular rate, and the job does not exist at that rate, it is up to the State to do something about this.</P>
        <P>I mentioned some time back that the State of Colorado had reduced its minimum wage recently.  It did this because that wage was linked to inflation; therefore, when deflation occurred, as it has been occurring here, it automatically reduced.  That does not apply here and, while there are a number of jobs that could exist, they do not exist due to our minimum rate.</P>
        <P>I stress that I am not looking for the Government to create jobs.  I was chairman of a hospital board in the 1970s.  We used to get a letter every month with regard to how many jobs we had managed to create in the hospital and whether we had taken on more nurses, porters and so <Col N="296"/>on.  That is exactly what got us into difficulty.  We created costs which were far too high and which made the State uneconomical because we were creating jobs which were not necessarily needed.  It is not a question of encouraging the State to create jobs.</P>
        <P>What we have to do is recognise that if we are going to create jobs, most will come from the State removing barriers to enable entrepreneurs to start businesses and to create those jobs.  They will not necessarily be big factories or big employers.  There will be hundreds of jobs in small, independent operations run by entrepreneurs.  We must recognise that the opportunity for jobs does not come about solely from manufacturing products; it also comes about from distribution.  When a shopping centre opens, if it can be made to succeed, that will create jobs in distribution and all of the other areas involved.</P>
        <P>To add to that point, while we are blaming the banks for recent events, the banks point out that if a retailer or anybody else has a good idea which can be successful, they are anxious to lend.  What they are not anxious to do is to lend to somebody who does not have a concept that can make itself pay.  Therefore, we must be able to make that case.  If we make that case, we can succeed.  I urge the Government to work towards removing barriers to make entrepreneurship much more likely to create jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pleasure and a privilege to commence the debate on Second Stage of the Prohibition of Depleted Uranium Weapons Bill 2009.  The Seanad has a long and distinguished history of raising issues that would not ordinarily be high on the political priority list.  The structure and history of the Seanad allows us to introduce such issues.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Bill provides the opportunity to build on the work of this and previous Governments in leading international debate on specific means of international conflict resolution.  As far back as the late 1950s the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken, was prominent in the first anti-nuclear proliferation treaty and Ireland played a proud role in that situation.  The more recent example has been the work of this Government when the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, was the instigator and participant in an international coalition that brought about a treaty on the use of cluster bombs.</P>
        <P>The legislation before the House is an attempt to build on that reputation and to agree there is a class of weapon that needs to be treated in a similar way and that Ireland has a moral authority to lead this debate.  There are potential international partners with whom we should be willing to coalesce and progress the debate to another level.  The Bill is more or less a direct <Col N="297"/>transcription of a Bill that has been passed in the Republic of Costa Rica, one of two countries which have adopted this legislation, the other being Belgium.  Progress has been very prominent in New Zealand, a country with which Ireland compares itself regularly in terms of size and with a shared history.  We are also nations which are committed to the specific resolution of disputes.</P>
        <P>All weapons have a particular characteristic that is both nasty in attempts to cause maximum damage but there is an additional risk that this type of weapon has an environmental after-effect.  The theatres in which this particular class of weapon has been used have seen continuing damage to people in the areas involved.  There is a need for an international approach to this issue.  My colleagues may speak about the nature of the weapons themselves and the effects they have had internationally.  My new colleague, Senator Dearey, will speak about a personal experience with regard to international co-operation in the area of anti-nuclear policy and how this might be used to best effect in progressing legislation of this nature.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a positive contribution from the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche.  I know there has been some discussion within Government about similar types of legislation, particularly with regard to biological weapons.  If it is possible to incorporate the principles of this Bill into another Bill, this would be welcomed.  It is hoped this Bill can be progressed successfully, as was the cluster bomb legislation.  That legislation and international treaty was subsequently followed by legislation in this House and the other House. However, our chosen route has been adopted in at least two other countries.</P>
        <P>The Bill is short and contains a definition of the use of uranium as a weapon, which is an important definition.  I received a representation from a person in an Irish university enquiring whether the intent of this Bill was to cease research using uranium.  This is not the case.  We are against the military and violent application of uranium in this fashion.  I have to admit I have something of a family history in this regard.  My late father worked in a uranium mine in Canada.  I am not sure whether it was an altogether pleasant experience for him.  It is a link to what we are talking about.</P>
        <P>The wider issues associated with the use of uranium in the nuclear industry, including its energy and military applications, would probably be more appropriate subjects for another debate.  It is worth pointing out that the application and use of uranium in producing nuclear energy, in particular, is seen as an alternative to the energy difficulties associated with the use of fossil fuels.  We need to be aware that uranium, as a depleting resource, is not available in ever-bountiful quantities.  The use of depleted uranium for these applications raises another moral issue.</P>
        <P>The Bill defines &ldquo;uranium weapon&rdquo; and sets out the role, or otherwise, of the State in recognising or using the resource of depleted uranium in this way.  Although Ireland is not a militarily aggressive state and does not have a stockpile of weapons, it is important for our legislation in this regard to make a moral statement to the effect we do not believe these weapons are of particular value and that we will not stockpile or use them.  There may be a difference in this respect between the legislation I am proposing and the Government&rsquo;s planned legislation on the wider issue of biological weapons.  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say on that issue.</P>
        <P>The final element of this legislation, after the definitions and the prohibition on the use of these weapons in the State, discourages the &ldquo;transport, possession, transfer and use of uranium weapons ... in the territorial waters and exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  I hope this position can be strengthened by means of an international treaty.  While the Bill may seem like a gesture, if it is passed, Ireland will become the third or fourth country to introduce a prohibition of this nature.  It will depend on whether New Zealand progresses to <Col N="298"/>legislation before we do.  Perhaps a collection of countries will come together to initiate a UN treaty that would give this measure the widest possible application.  If we, as a House and individual Senators, decide to accept the Bill and if the Government is so minded, it will help Ireland&rsquo;s reputation which is built on its sound history in this area.  I ask the House to examine the legislation favourably and critically, as it needs a wider debate.  I hope its detail will be examined at a subsequent stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche.  The State has a proud history in introducing legislation of this nature.  A Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, Frank Aiken, was one of the instigators of the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  While the Bill might not be of the same import, it is of huge import, nevertheless.</P>
        <P>I am thankful to say Ireland has set its mind against nuclear power.  It is a clean and green country.  In my view and that of many experts, we do not need to go down the route of producing nuclear power.  I am glad that no political party has decided that it represents the way forward.  I previously quoted the Germany KiKK study which shows that within a 5 km radius of a nuclear power station there is a 60% increase in the incidence of tumours and an increase of over 100% in the level of childhood leukaemia.</P>
        <P>We are aware of phrases such as &ldquo;dirty bombs&rdquo;, which are often used in the context of discussions on depleted uranium.  We are aware that depleted uranium was used in &ldquo;bunker buster&rdquo; bombs during the Iraq War.  Heavy material is included in such bombs to allow them to burst through concrete before they explode.  It is a handy way for countries such as the United States to get rid of a load of uranium used in the production of nuclear power.  Unfortunately, such uranium has a radioactive content.  It lasts for a hell of a long time and we need to consider how it should be disposed of.  Countries generally bury waste uranium in the ground.  An alternative means of dealing with it is to send it to other countries.  I would not approve of such a method of waste disposal.</P>
        <P>I would like to read a snippet from an on-line BBC article on this issue:</P>
        <P LI="1">One UK Gulf veteran is Ray Bristow, a former marathon runner.  In 1999 he told the BBC: &ldquo;I gradually noticed that every time I went out for a run my distance got shorter and shorter, my recovery time longer and longer.  Now, on my good days, I get around quite adequately with a walking stick, so long as it&rsquo;s short distances.  Any further, and I need to be pushed in a wheelchair.&rdquo;  Ray Bristow was tested in Canada for DU.  He is open-minded about its role in his condition.  But he says: &ldquo;I remained in Saudi Arabia throughout the war. I never once went into Iraq or Kuwait, where these munitions were used.  But the tests showed, in layman&rsquo;s terms, that I have been exposed to over 100 times an individual&rsquo;s safe annual exposure to depleted uranium.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Many such stories can be read on the Internet and in the various news media around the world.  The BBC&rsquo;s reports on the issue are an excellent source of material.</P>
        <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland does sterling work.  This country&rsquo;s many nuclear-free local authorities have a proud tradition of opposing the development of nuclear weapons and the use of nuclear power.  My colleague, Senator Dearey, will speak about the work of such authorities.  When I was a member of Galway City Council, I was proud to have a motion on the issue agreed.</P>
        <P>We have an opportunity to show global leadership on an issue of international importance.  If we take the action proposed in the Bill, it can be taken up by many other countries.  Unfortunately, this will not be the first country to do so, as Costa Rica and Belgium have already adopted this approach.  Senator Boyle mentioned that some work was being done in New <Col N="299"/>Zealand also.  Ireland has a proud tradition of introducing legislation of this nature.  It is always good to assume an international leadership role in areas such as this.  It is always said Ireland punches above its weight, in terms of its influence, at the United Nations and other international assemblies.  We show leadership on international issues of importance.</P>
        <P>I hope the Bill will be passed in its entirety.  I ask the Minister of State to examine it and help us to guide it through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche.  I am pleased to speak on Second Stage of the Prohibition of Depleted Uranium Weapons Bill 2009.  This legislation touches on one of Fine Gael&rsquo;s general principles &mdash; its opposition to the use of weapons that cause long-term health and environmental side effects for non-combatants, possibly generations after a conflict has ended.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency colleague, Deputy Billy Timmins, introduced the cluster munitions Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2008 to ban the use of cluster munitions.  He opposed them because he had seen their effects first hand when serving as an Army officer on United Nations peace support missions.  It was a principle for him and for the Fine Gael Party.  This Bill aims to achieve the same effect with depleted uranium weapons, which we welcome.</P>
        <P>Some question the value of Ireland taking a stand on depleted uranium, just as we took a stand on cluster munitions.  They fail to understand the point we in the Oireachtas, on behalf of the people, are making.  This is not an issue of practice but of principle, of right and wrong.  The Oireachtas is unambiguously stating the use of depleted uranium is wrong, immoral and unacceptable.  We are committing ourselves never to use them, never to facilitate their use and never to support their use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Critics of a ban, of which there are many in the military in the United States and the United Kingdom, claim there is no proof that using depleted uranium weaponry causes long-term damage, citing World Health Organisation reports.  The problem with their argument, and those reports, is that they are demanding something that is almost impossible to prove.  While Japan voted in favour of the Indonesian UN motion against depleted uranium weapons, it noted no definite conclusions on the issue have been drawn from scientific studies.</P>
        <P>In war, scientific controls to measure cause and effect are not possible.  One cannot do laboratory conditions on a battlefield.  Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, however.  There is clear evidence of the lingering effects of weapons used on the health both of combatants and of those who lived in the area of combat.</P>
        <P>In Iraq, where depleted uranium weapons were used in both Gulf Wars, there were 11 cases of cancer per 100,000 people in Basra in 1989.  In 2001, there were 116 per 100,000.  In 1988, 34 people died of cancer, in 1998, 450, and in 2001, 603.  Forty-nine babies with severe congenital malformations were born in Basra between 1995 and 1998; and 224 between 1999 and 2001.  Nearly a quarter of babies born at Basra&rsquo;s teaching hospital in 2002 had some form of malformation.  The increase in leukaemia in the area around Basra was the first health development noticed by the medical profession following the first Gulf War.  Similar statistics could be quoted for other war zones where depleted uranium was used. The effects on soldiers were also striking.  The research advisory committee on Gulf War veterans&rsquo; illnesses in 2004 advised the US Department of Defense:</P>
        <P LI="1">More than 13 years after the end of Operation Desert Storm, a substantial proportion of veterans of the 1990-1991 Gulf War continue to experience chronic and often debilitating conditions characterised by persistent headaches, cognitive problems, somatic pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal difficulties, respiratory conditions, and skin abnormalities.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P FLI="0">It concluded:</P>
        <P LI="1">A substantial proportion of Gulf War veterans are ill with multi-symptom conditions not explained by wartime stress or psychiatric illness  A growing body of research indicates that an important component of Gulf War veterans&rsquo; illnesses is neurological in character.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Soldiers were given a cocktail of drugs and tablets supposedly to protect themselves yet ordinary Iraqis did not get any, yet both groups still suffered ill effects.  Both have one factor in common &mdash; contact with depleted uranium.</P>
        <P>The irony was that both Gulf Wars and other wars in which depleted uranium was used were officially described as wars of liberation, freedom and ending tyranny.  Is there any greater tyranny than to leave those liberated to suffer the chronic health effects of the weapons used in their liberation for decades after the war ends?  Is there any greater irony than, in the name of freedom, to destroy the lives of future generations of young people who will not be able to experience that freedom because of these weapons?</P>
        <P>In 2003, Professor Brian Spratt, chairman of Britain&rsquo;s prestigious Royal Society&rsquo;s working group on depleted uranium, said, &ldquo;It is highly unsatisfactory to deploy a large amount of a material that is weakly radioactive and chemically toxic without knowing how much soldiers and civilians have been exposed to it&rdquo;.  I would go further.  It is not just highly unsatisfactory but wrong, immoral and unacceptable.  It must be stopped.</P>
        <P>We have heard about weapons of mass destruction.  Cluster munitions and depleted uranium weapons are weapons of indiscriminate effect, killing and maiming for years after a war has ended.  They create a war without end.</P>
        <P>I commend the Green Party for presenting the Bill.  I hope this is the start of the Government&rsquo;s support in banning depleted uranium weapons which are causing so much destruction across the world.  I also hope the banning of such weapons will be progressed in the United Nations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am proud to be associated with the introduction of the Prohibition of Depleted Uranium Weapons Bill 2009.  The nuclear industry has never given a convincing explanation as to how it deals with the waste generated in the production of electricity in nuclear power stations.  Before the 22 February deadline for submissions on the proposed new build of nuclear plants in the United Kingdom, I made a submission to the relevant authorities highlighting this issue.  However, the waste question was dodged again as there was no convincing proposal as to how the new plants would deal with resultant nuclear waste.  There were more aspirational suggestions around long-term repositories deep underground which would be accepted voluntarily by councils.  Only three in the Cumbria region have expressed a cautious interest.</P>
        <P>It is abhorrent that one use of the waste from the enrichment process to make nuclear fuel rods is for weapons.  It defies belief and is an insult to anyone with a sense of moral rectitude that such weapons could have been conceived, designed and used on European soil during the Balkans conflict.  These weapons create civilian causality lists that will stretch far into the future as depleted uranium munitions, exploded or unexploded, linger for many thousands of years after use.  If exploded, up to 96% of the resultant aerosol is capable of being ingested through the human lungs.  It forms a ceramic owing to the heat it creates and is extremely likely to be airborne and ingested not just by this generation or the next but by many generations to come when soil in the area where bombs have been used is disturbed.  It is a depravity that this is considered a legitimate use of the waste product of the nuclear industry.  The entirety of the <Col N="301"/>waste is not used in this way but it demonstrates an arrogance and hubris on the part of the industry to think it is in order to pass on the problem to another generation to sort out.  I find that reprehensible.</P>
        <P>The issue of proliferation is one that civil nuclear countries fail to face up to.  There is a connection between civil nuclear power and the proliferation that follows from the exchange of nuclear materials, nuclear technology and nuclear investments.  It is disingenuous of those who support civil nuclear power to claim there is no link.  It may not be there explicitly, as in the case of Iran, but it is implicit in the industry that downstream technology can avail of the civil use of nuclear part.  That must be clearly stated.  Proliferation is a consequence of the introduction of civil nuclear power.  It must be taken into account when a case is being made for civil nuclear power.  I am not a Luddite.  I am not saying technology to generate electricity with nuclear power cannot be made safe, although I have not seen it.  There are design problems with the new European pressurised reactors and the AP 1000 proposed by Westinghouse for the new nuclear build in Britain.  Design problems can be dealt with but the waste issue has never been dealt with.  That is the core problem and this Bill tackles the issue head-on.  I commend it to the House and the Minister of State.  It builds on the experience in Belgium by defining more clearly a depleted uranium weapon.  I hope other countries will build on the experience we have had in making this real legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Boyle and his colleagues on this legislation.  It is very important and I welcome the fact that there is a general welcome from the House for this.  It always surprises me that, when we confront catastrophes such as the situation in Chile and Haiti, people do not realise there are enough catastrophes without mankind deliberately inflicting other disasters on itself.  I mention this because I was involved in the campaign for a ban on cluster bombs.  I raised it in this House where we had a good special debate, and I also introduced some material though the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The situation is urgent because I have reports that traces of depleted uranium have been found in some of the children affected by the conflict in Gaza.  The Minister of State is sensitive to this issue and is aware of the problems.  That is deeply worrying.  I was in Iraq before the latest American adventure and even then I met people who claimed they had been affected by depleted uranium.  Their claims appear to have had some justification.</P>
        <P>Uranium is a naturally occurring element but, as Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in said, this is a by-product of the nuclear industry.  It was first manufactured in the 1940s when the United States and the former Soviet Union began a nuclear weapons programme.  They discovered it was useful for protecting tanks.  They began coating tanks with this material.  The Americans discovered it was impossible to penetrate and they developed new weapons technology.  We are now confronted with a product of the Second World War and the arms race.  People are taking this increasingly seriously.  Costa Rica has just introduced legislation along these lines.  Seventeen countries have this kind of weapon: Britain, the United States, France, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Greece, Turkey, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt, Kuwait, Pakistan, Thailand, China, India and Taiwan.  The British company, BAE, was producing depleted uranium shells for the British forces until 2003.  I am glad to say it has ceased production but some stockpiles are left.  There is much highly technical material in this area and I am not a qualified scientist.  In addition, I have had a very busy day and my mind is reeling from reading this material.  That said, I think I have understood sufficient of it for me to be concerned about the existence of these weapons and very glad Senator Boyle and his colleagues have introduced the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill would make it illegal to &ldquo;test, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile, sell, deploy, retain or transfer, directly or indirectly, uranium ammunition, uranium armour-plate or other uranium weapons to anyone&rdquo;.  It would also make it illegal &ldquo;acquire or dispose of pre-<Col N="302"/>products for development and production of uranium weapons&rdquo;.  Legislation was debated in one of our European neighbours, Belgium, and concerns were expressed lest the text affect some American military installations.  I would be very happy if it did so negatively affect the American installations.  I compliment Senator Boyle on the definitions which appear to resolve what may have been problematic in other countries.  The Bill states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Uranium weapon&rdquo; means a mechanism which serves to destroy or damage objects and uses uranium in its mode of action.  Excluded from this definition are weapons that incorporate uranium and whose primary tactical purpose in this incorporation is the production, flux, or enhancement, of nuclear fission or fusion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a form of nuclear waste and this links it to the civilian nuclear energy, as my newly elected colleague said.  Nowadays, considering the crisis facing the planet, we cannot completely close our minds to the possibility of nuclear power.  It is rather hypocritical of us to be prepared to use the interconnector to introduce electricity that is generated by nuclear capacity, yet turn our faces against nuclear power.  That has some echoes of the abortion situation, where we do not allow it in this country but simply export it.  In this case we are importing energy.</P>
        <P>Depleted uranium is a chemically toxic and radioactive compound used in armour piercing munitions because of its very high density.  It is 1.7 times denser than lead, giving these weapons increased range and penetrative power.  I bracket these weapons with white phosphorus and cluster bombs.  I would like to see white phosphorus banned; it is an appalling weapon.  Flechettes are another form of fiendish device.  We must keep reviewing these weapons.  Depleted uranium is used extensively and in landmines.  It was used in the Gulf War, in Bosnia, Serbia and Kosovo and in the war in Iraq in 2003 by the United States and the United Kingdom.  It was also used in Afghanistan in 2001.</P>
        <P>The real problem is the dangerous and continuing quality of depleted uranium.  When burned it produces an oxide dust that has no natural or historical analogue.  This toxic and radioactive dust is composed of two oxides, one insoluble, the other sparingly soluble.  The distribution of particle sizes includes sub-micron particles that are readily inhaled into and retained by the lungs.  From the lungs uranium compounds are deposited in the lymph nodes, bones, brain and testes.  Hard targets hit by DU penetrators are surrounded by this dust and surveys suggest that it can travel many kilometres when re-suspended, as is likely in arid climates such as the desert.  The dust can then be inhaled or ingested by civilians and the military alike.  In other words, it does not discriminate.  The lymph nodes, bones, brain and testes are prime candidates for carcinogenic material and, therefore, cancer is a serious danger.  It is believed these weapons are the cause of sharp increases in some forms of cancer such as breast cancer and lymphoma and this is substantially documented.  It is also worrying in the Balkans because there are suggestions that despite the fact DU is only sometimes soluble, the corroding penetrators have been held to be likely to affect ground-water.  That is a continuing and serious problem.</P>
        <P>The chief radiological hazard from Uranium 238 is alpha radiation.  When inhaled or ingested, alpha radiation is the most damaging form of ionising radiation.  I note the implications of some investments of large capitalist groups.  For example, the Royal Bank of Scotland is heavily involved in financing the use of this material and its Ulster Bank subsidiary bears looking at.  Bodies such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection put themselves forward.  They are not pure, as they are too closely related to some of these big businesses.  In addition, they use average male body format when they calculate the impact of DU, ignoring completely the fact that ionising radiation has a much more substantial and negative impact on pregnant women and children.  I would be careful about these groups with grand sounding names.</P><Col N="303"/>
        <P>As U238 decays into its daughter products thorium and protactinium, both beta and gamma radiation are released, increasing the radiation burden further.  Therefore, DU particles must be considered as a dynamic mixture of radioactive isotopes.  Inside the body alpha radiation is incredibly disruptive.  The heavy, highly charged particles leave a trail of ionised free radicals in their wake, disrupting finely tuned cellular processes.  Like many other heavy metals, such as lead, chromium, nickel and mercury, uranium exposure can be damaging to health, particularly the kidney and other soft tissue areas.  Recent studies in hamsters found that these products make it more likely that the DNA will be repaired incorrectly, which leads to replicated errors, and this is a classic formula for carcinogensis.</P>
        <P>As a result it is not entirely surprising that the UN General Assembly passed a resolution highlighting serious health concerns over DU and, in May 2008, 94% of MEPs in the European Parliament strengthened four previous calls for a moratorium by calling for a DU ban treaty in a wide-ranging resolution.  I compliment my colleagues for treating this serious and sometimes technical subject with the concern it deserves and for presenting this important Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important legislation and compliment Senator Boyle on bringing it forward.  As Senator Norris said, it is technical.  I will concentrate on health issues.  Ireland has joined international efforts to try to establish the level of risk from the use of DU.  While as yet there may not be absolute scientific proof, I am assured that the Government shares the concerns raised at the United Nations about the potential danger to human health.  I accept there are many peaceful uses for DU across a range of sectors, including as a radiation shield on medical equipment.  However, its military use causes great concern.  The break up of the uranium when weapons such as tank busting rockets and missiles hit their targets, creates DU dust.  People in the immediate area can inhale this dust and I fear the health impacts.  In addition many of the missiles can miss their targets and lie in the soil for long periods.  Dug up later by construction workers, farmers or even children playing in derelict sites, they can be a risk years after the weapon was fired.</P>
        <P>Ireland, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department, took a global lead in outlawing another weapon which can maim or even kill people decades later.  The ban on cluster munitions was a diplomatic triumph for this country.  I recall taking a keen interest in this subject when it was debated in the House and I am delighted once again to be associated with a campaign to ban weapons that could impact on our health.  At all times, I make it my business to stand up to make sure such weapons are banned.  I encourage the Government to examine carefully the threat posed by weapons that use DU and that can generate DU dust.</P>
        <P>While we have never used such weapons, it is important that we should continue to play an active role in efforts to establish the level of threat.  Ireland should also take the necessary steps to protect both military personnel and civilians who can be caught up or trapped in a war zone.  While science may say there is no great risk currently, we must be sure of our facts.  A threat can remain well into the future and affect people for decades to come.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Both the United Nations and the European Parliament have in the past year called for further studies of the threat.  Following our successful brokering of the cluster bombs treaty, I hope Ireland can use the expertise it gained to play a role in analysing the research and in helping to decide the necessary response.  The World Health Organisation and the International Atomic Agency are also undertaking work in this area.  In addition, many NGOs and civil society groups have taken a lead on this issue.  I encourage the Minister to ensure we are fully informed of the outcome of any studies.  We must establish the risk primarily to human health but also to the environment.  If a risk is established then we must act swiftly and move towards a ban.  There should be a general welcome for the legislation to address this serious issue, given <Col N="304"/>the impact it could have on our health.  I am delighted Senator Boyle has introduced the Bill and I wish him well.  I hope it will be passed without opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I commend Senators Boyle and O&rsquo;Malley and former Senator de B&uacute;rca for initiating the Bill.  As countries and legislatures across Europe and the world attempt to clean up the financial and economic mess we have witnessed over the past three years, it is important, at the same time, that we do not lose sight of the fact that pressing global issues predated the current economic crisis.  Successive Governments have played a positive role on the world stage in advancing the prohibition of weapons of this nature and it is reassuring that this approach remains a feature of Government policy.  I commend the Senators&rsquo; approach in bringing the Bill before the House.  It is short and concise and its enactment would send an important message about Ireland&rsquo;s moral values, what we consider acceptable in times of war and the measures we deem necessary to establish a global and lasting peace.</P>
        <P>According to the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons, approximately 20 countries are thought to have uranium weapons in their arsenals.  These include the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Russia, Belarus, Greece, Turkey, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Taiwan.  It is unacceptable that three member states of the European Union have these weapons in their arsenals in 2010.  I find it particularly surprising that Greece maintains a stockpile of these weapons.  According to the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons:</P>
        <P LI="1">These were to be destroyed with the rest of Greece&rsquo;s landmine stocks by March 2008, as of March 2007 no stocks had been destroyed.  Greece informed landmine monitors that they were having technical problems as the ADAM mines had to be frozen before they can be destroyed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If Greece is having technical problems, I suggest it look for help to its neighbours in the European Union.  Perhaps we can offer technical advice.  I know the Army is involved in giving advice to foreign armies in the area of weapons decommissioning.  I am not sure whether this is an area in which we could offer technical expertise, but I expect that if not us, some other European Union country could provide Greece with the technical advice it requires.</P>
        <P>It is disturbing that, despite repeated calls from the European Parliament for a total ban on the stockpiling and use of depleted uranium ammunitions, France and the United Kingdom have continued to refuse to accede to such a ban.  I urge the Senators concerned and the Government as a whole to use the enactment of the Bill to exert pressure at European Union level to have a ban introduced and a binding international treaty put in place.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the United States has, as in so many disarmament and human rights issues, utterly failed to take a lead or even lend its considerable moral, financial and political weight to the advancement of this cause.  It needs to re-examine its attitude to international treaties such as this.  Included in the list of treaties signed but not ratified by it are the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and, of course, the Kyoto Protocol.  There is hope that at least some of these issues may be addressed during the Administration of President Obama.  However, it is immoral and unacceptable that countries such as Ireland should simply do nothing in the light of our &mdash; admittedly small &mdash; role on the world stage.</P>
        <P>Many commentators contend we are witnessing the decline of the primacy of the United States in global affairs.  While this presents modern societies with many challenges, it also <Col N="305"/>presents opportunities to redefine what might be considered morally and politically acceptable during times of peace and war.  The European Union has been invested with considerable collective, economic and soft power to push for these changes.  With its member states, it must decide what kind of player it wishes to be on the world stage.  Ireland can and should take a leading role in defining and articulating a more progressive and cohesive foreign policy script for the Union.  Such a script should hold no place, tacit or otherwise, for the retention of such destructive and devastating weapons.</P>
        <P>The International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons reported positively on the concise and considered nature of the Bill brought forward by Senators Boyle and O&rsquo;Malley and former Senator de B&uacute;rca.  The Bill states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Uranium weapon&rdquo; means a mechanism which serves to destroy or damage objects and uses uranium in its mode of action.  Excluded from this definition are weapons that incorporate uranium and whose primary tactical purpose in this incorporation is the production, flux, or enhancement, of nuclear fission or fusion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The ICBUW believes the text will &ldquo;help to &lsquo;future-proof&rsquo; any eventual legislation against the development of new conventional uranium weapons.&rdquo;  I must admit to a limited understanding of the definitional and prescriptive considerations the Senators faced but the endorsements from groups such as the ICBUW and individuals such as Denis Halliday are most welcome.</P>
        <P>It is also encouraging that the following provision is set out explicitly in the text of the Bill: &ldquo;The transport, possession, transfer and use of uranium weapons and uranium armour-plate in the territorial waters and exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Ireland is prohibited&rdquo;.  I support the Bill wholeheartedly and commend the Senators concerned on bringing it before the House.</P>

	<P>I was enjoying the debate so much that I would have willingly waited to speak.  The top of a ministerial script often includes the advice, &ldquo;check against delivery&rdquo;.  This is one of those occasions on which the advice applies.  I am immensely impressed by the debate and do not say that in a patronising way.  I sincerely believe it is better to light a penny candle than to curse the dark.  As has been said by all those who have spoken, Ireland has a long record of being willing to punch above its weight and enter into an area where caution might occasionally be advised from our Administration that might suggest it is either too early or too sensitive an issue for Ireland to intervene.  I get the sense that the House will not divide on the Bill and that there is unanimous support on all sides, which I welcome.  It appears it will move without division to Committee Stage and I look forward to listening to what will be said on that Stage.</P>
        <P>The Government has carefully followed the debate in recent years on the possible health and environmental hazards of using depleted uranium.  We share the concerns raised in various international fora.  As several Members said, it is an extraordinary reflection on the human condition that so much ingenuity and brain power can be used for such destructive purposes.  As Senator Norris said, as if the world is not visited by enough natural disasters, manpower needs to spend so much time, ingenuity and money inflicting further disasters.  As my personal concerns about the use of depleted uranium in armaments are a matter of record, I am very pleased to be present for this debate.</P>
        <P>Ireland voted in favour of Resolutions 62/30 and 63/26 at the United Nations in 2007 and 2008.  These resolutions requested the Secretary General to seek the views of member states and relevant international organisations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium.  I was struck by the point made by Senator Dearey.  We have enough problems with uranium, given that it has a half-life longer than the time that has <Col N="306"/>passed from the time of Christ to this day.  The nuclear industry has not even begun to address this issue.  We should stop to think about what has happened to human kind in that period.  If there had been nuclear dumps in the past 2,000 years, how much devastation would have been wrought on the human race?  The precautionary principle applies in this case &mdash; I was surprised it was not mentioned.  As Senator Ormonde said, many of the weapons fired find their way into watercourses and the land where they lie for a long time.</P>
        <P>Ireland shares the concerns raised at the General Assembly about the potential risks related to the use of depleted uranium.  Somewhat counter-intuitively the reports produced noted that, while a number of studies had been conducted by the relevant international organisations, no definitive conclusion had been drawn on the potential adverse effects.  As a layperson with a reasonable amount of scientific knowledge &mdash; I credit myself with a certain amount of common sense &mdash; I am of the view that pumping depleted radiation into the earth can hardly be good.  The reports noted that Ireland would continue to closely monitor developments in the analysis of the risks associated with the use of armaments and ammunition containing depleted uranium.  As several Senators noted, uranium is a naturally occurring and ubiquitous heavy metal.  Senator Boyle made the important point, which is never factored into the debate, that it is a material that is in limited supply.  Interestingly, the depletion of the world&rsquo;s supply of uranium is probably even more challenging than that of hydrocarbons.  Uranium is present in its natural form in drinking water and in food.  In the nuclear industry uranium, after the enrichment process, is referred to as depleted uranium.  I agree with Senator Dearey.  The reality is that this is a cynical way of recycling waste.  It is not what any of us who would propose recycling want.</P>
      
        <P>As Senator Ormonde noted, depleted uranium has its peaceful uses including as counterweights or ballast in aircraft, radiation shields in medical equipment used for radiation therapy and containers for the transport of radioactive materials.  The physical and chemical properties of uranium also make it suitable for military uses, and that is the nub of the issue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A number of Senators noted the effects of depleted uranium when it is used in armaments and they are worth repeating.  On impact with targets, depleted uranium penetrators ignite, break up into fragments and form an aerosol, DU dust, whose size depends on the angle of the impact, the velocity of the penetrator and the temperature.  The main potential hazard associated with depleted uranium ammunition is the inhalation of aerosol created when the ammunition hits an armoured target.  The size, distribution and chemical composition of the aerosol varies but, as Senator Dearey noted, up to 96% of it can enter the lungs of people who are in the vicinity, and that cannot but have a deleterious effect.  There is a good deal of research, some of which I would regard as somewhat suspect, that suggests the jury is still out, but the material we do have, and it has been put on record of this House, for example, the extraordinary increases in cancers, would suggest this is an area that the world should take more seriously.</P>
        <P>Regarding exposure to depleted uranium, there have been studies of the health of military personnel who saw action in the Gulf War and during the Balkan conflicts.  While DU itself is not highly radioactive, it is none the less a toxic metal and legitimate health concerns arise.  A number of Gulf War veterans have inoperable fragments of DU embedded in their systems and because it does not seem to have had an immediate effect other than chronic pain, some of the reports seem to support the thesis that this is not something about which we should be concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe the use of this particular material is cynical and would ask questions about some of the research that has been done.  There is persuasive material about long-term health risks to the wider population.  As I have indicated, the Government is strongly supportive of the view, proposed by the United Nations Secretary General, that there must be serious studies in <Col N="307"/>this area.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is following closely the valuable work of civil society on the issue of depleted uranium.  Officials from the Department met a delegation from the international campaign to ban uranium weapons in June of last year and had a useful discussion.  We communicated our views that to achieve an international ban, as they aspire to do, it will be necessary to establish conclusively the negative impact of depleted uranium.  That is very much the direction in which many who oppose the use of this material are pushing the debate.  The studies and the work by reputable international organisations, including the World Health Organisation and the IAEA, will be critical, therefore, in quantifying the risks and conveying them internationally.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators for their work.  As I have said here and on previous occasions, I cannot understand the reason it is necessary to introduce this particular material and to inflict yet another horror on human kind.  This is a good Bill and I am pleased that it seems there will not be a division on it and that it will go to committee.  I will be very interested in the output of that committee&rsquo;s deliberations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to those who congratulated the Green Party and Senator Boyle and Senator Dearey on introducing the Bill.  I am delighted to hear that the Minister of State believes it is a good Bill.  On that basis I assume it will be accepted and I hope it will get through the House because the use of depleted uranium in munitions is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects.  Normal functioning of the kidneys, brain, liver, heart and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because, in addition to being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal.</P>
        <P>This initiative is very worthwhile.  Ireland acts as a beacon state on the world stage when it comes to development aid, giving large <i>per capita</i> amounts.  We have maintained that standard very well up to now and I hope we are able to continue to do so.  Such an approach encourages, or perhaps embarrasses, bigger countries to give more to the world&rsquo;s poor.  This Bill to prohibit depleted nuclear weapons could have a similar effect in encouraging countries to give up these controversial weapons.  I realise what we do might be said to be whistling in the dark and not having a major effect but there is no doubt it sets a standard.</P>
        <P>There is still so much we do not know about depleted uranium.  I was reading one story of an American Gulf War veteran who currently takes ten prescriptions.  He has memory loss, chronic fatigue, stomach and sinus problems, muscle aches, vision loss, headaches and infections.  He is one of approximately 200,000 American Gulf War veterans who claim to suffer from mysterious Gulf War syndrome.  Depleted uranium is just one of the suspected causes, including toxic fumes from detonated weapons depots and pills which soldiers took to protect themselves from nerve gases and pesticides.</P>
        <P>We must remember that there is not total consensus on the danger of depleted uranium and we heard the case being made.  The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, which was established by the United Nations, stated: &ldquo;Based on credible scientific evidence, there is no proven link between DU exposure and increases in human cancers or other significant health or environmental impacts&rdquo;.  It further stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is a common misconception that radioactivity is the main health hazard of DU rather than chemical toxicity.  Like other heavy metals, DU is potentially poisonous.  In sufficient amounts, if DU is ingested or inhaled it can be harmful because of its chemical toxicity.  High concentration could cause kidney damage.</P>
        <P FLI="0">United Nations Environmental Protection, UNEP, studies in Kosovo in 2001, in Serbia and Montenegro in 2002 and in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2003, to which IAEA experts contributed, found it was highly unlikely that a reported increase in the risk of cancer in the Balkan regions <Col N="308"/>could be associated with the residue of depleted uranium munitions used during the war in the mid-1990s.  It found the probability of significant exposure to the local population was very low.  There are views on it, therefore.</P>
        <P>Local doctors have their own reports.  In the whole of Kosovo the cancer rate before 1999 was ten among 300,000 people and today stands at 20 among 60,000 people.  That is a huge increase.  An alarming rise in cancer cases has been recorded also in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, where depleted uranium was used by NATO against Bosnian Serb forces earlier in 1995.  According to official figures, more than 300 people from two districts of Sarajevo died of cancer from 1996 until 2000.  It is not proven but there is enough evidence to suggest there is a link.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other side of the story is perhaps most evident in former war zones.  The real hazard for the Iraqi population these days is not so much terrorism, occupation or oil but cancer.  Cancer is spreading like wildfire in Iraq.  There is strong evidence that the United States army used depleted uranium in Iraq.  Thousands of infants are now being born with deformities.  Doctors say they are struggling to cope with the rise of cancer and birth defects, especially in cities subjected to heavy American and British bombardment.  Falluja was heavily bombarded by the United States in 2004 and as many as 25% of newborn infants there have serious abnormalities, including congenital anomalies, brain tumours and defects in the spinal cord.  There is no definite proof of the cause but the link seems very credible.  The cancer rate in the province of Babil, south of Baghdad, has risen from 500 diagnosed cases in 2004 to 9,082 in 2009.  Iraqi doctors and some Western academics say the massive quantities of depleted uranium used in US and British bombs are not unconnected to the sharp increase in cancer rates.  Dr. Ahmad Hardan, who served as a special scientific adviser to the World Health Organisation, the United Nations and the Iraqi Ministry of Health, believes there is scientific evidence linking depleted uranium to cancer and birth defects.</P>
        <P>Depleted uranium is obviously a much more tangible problem in countries that have been affected by war.  I understand the Iraqi Ministry for Human Rights is filing a lawsuit against the United States and Great Britain for allegedly using more than 2,000 tonnes of depleted uranium in Iraq.  Obviously we must remain vigilant on issues of public safety from radiation exposure and take on board all reports which are involved in assessing any possible radiological effects from depleted uranium but given the massive rise in cancers in areas where depleted uranium has been used, it is difficult not to make the logical link.  We must do our best to encourage countries to abandon the use of depleted uranium.  I hope this Bill will send out a very forceful message.</P>
        <P>Israel is one of the biggest offenders in this respect.  The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has stated that the consequences of the three week conflict continue to affect the lives of the people of Gaza eight months later.  Dr. Mowaiyaj Hassanen, director of al-Shifa hospital in the Gaza Strip, said the use of internationally banned weapons, including white phosphorus and depleted uranium, has resulted in a series of abnormalities in newborn babies in Gaza, ranging from heart defects to brain abnormalities.  It is shocking that babies and children are often the ones who are suffering from the effects of depleted uranium.  If only to draw awareness to this fact, this Bill is very worthwhile.</P>
        <P>Although not in the strictest sense related to this motion, it is worthwhile to mention Bill Gates and his new project to make use of depleted uranium.  The founder of Microsoft, Gates is probably better known these days for his role in the fight against malaria.  He has emphasised that even more important than developing vaccines are new energy technologies such as nuclear power and next generation batteries.  To meet his 2050 deadline for cutting all carbon emissions, he is promoting a nuclear approach called terrapower, which will develop nuclear reactors that <Col N="309"/>run primarily on natural or depleted uranium rather than enriched uranium.  With un-enriched fuel, the reactors could be loaded up with fuel and sealed for 30 to 60 years.</P>
        <P>Switching from enriched fuel would reduce the risks associated with nuclear proliferation and transportation as well as the amount of nuclear waste primarily because the stockpile of uranium would go farther.  Depleted uranium is a waste product in the enrichment process.  Terrapower&rsquo;s reactors need some enriched uranium at the beginning but only to initiate a reaction.  The switch would also mean that the available supplies of uranium could be exploited to provide power for centuries or even thousands of years, which is far longer than what can be done with enriched uranium.</P>
        <P>Regardless of whether we like it, nuclear power is making something of a comeback worldwide.  I would like to debate the pros and cons of nuclear energy and while I am aware the Green Party is not very enthusiastic about it, other Greens around the world are considering its use.  The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission expects to receive approximately 30 applications for new reactors over the next few years.  Prominent members of the green movement in the United Kingdom have come out in favour of nuclear power after having a change of heart from an anti-nuclear stance to believing that atomic power is a necessary part of the energy mix in the struggle to cut carbon emissions and halt global warming.  Chris Goodall wrote in the <i>London Independent</i> last week:</P>
        <P LI="1">The green movement must learn to love nuclear power... Including nuclear power in this mix will make a low-carbon and energy-secure future easier to achieve.  Nuclear power has substantial drawbacks, but the consequences of not embracing it are likely to be significantly worse.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Bill Gates&rsquo;s new initiative does not use rare, enriched uranium, as today&rsquo;s nuclear reactors do, but regular old uranium, including the kind that is currently treated as waste.  That means reactors could use depleted uranium sources as fuel and produce far less waste in the process.  This is a very interesting development which we should follow with interest over the next few years.  I welcome the Bill and hope it does not stop here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for the support they have shown to this Bill and commend them on their considered contributions.  The research they put into preparing their speeches reveals a common belief that we can and should address this issue.  I am grateful for the intellectual investment Senators have made in the Bill.  Senators Cummins, Norris, Ormonde, Hannigan, Quinn, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in and Dearey have demonstrated the role this House can play.  I thank the Minister of State, in particular, for the support he has offered.  As a Member of this House, he was one of the first parliamentarians in the world to move a motion in support of Aung San Suu Kyi.  This country can play a valuable role in fostering debates, identifying clear injustices and taking a collegial approach to the resolution of international conflicts.</P>
        <P>This evening&rsquo;s contributions have comprised various descriptions of the moral and medical effects of these weapons.  While it was pointed out that research in this area is inconclusive, there seems to be a wide variation between the studies conducted on behalf of agencies with a vested interest in the continued use of these weapons and the information acquired by doctors on the ground in areas where the weapons have been deployed.  Senator Quinn outlined particularly stark statistics on the increase in the incidence of cancers in the Balkans and Iraq.  His evidence appears to indicate a close causal relationship which should give rise to concern.  Of course, the findings of these surveys are irrelevant to those who suffer from the cancers, whether caused by high levels of radiation or heavy metals.  This type of weaponry is at the heart <Col N="310"/>of the difficulties they are experiencing and we need to ensure they are put out of commission in the immediate future.</P>
        <P>Several speakers highlighted the difficulties involved in stopping these weapons.  Senator Norris noted man&rsquo;s ingenuity to inflict pain on himself even when dealing with natural catastrophes.  He has pointed out that 17 countries have access to depleted uranium weapons.  We need to build coalitions with other countries to make sure they understand these weapons are not accepted internationally.  That will be a hard sell.  Senator Hannigan pointed out that three of the aforementioned 17 countries are EU member states.  Ironically given the economic circumstances we all face, Greece is one of these countries.</P>
        <P>Through his campaigning for the Lisbon treaty, the Minister of State has built an expertise on the type of coalition building that will allow Ireland&rsquo;s voice to be heard on these issues.  I am confident that tonight&rsquo;s debate will build on that experience.  It will allow other legislators to examine what we are doing today and pass similar legislation, just as we have gained from and, as Senator Norris said, improved on legislation passed in Belgium dealing with the definition of the weapons in question, how they might be categorised and, as far as this jurisdiction is concerned, not used, transported or portrayed in a particular way.</P>
        <P>On these grounds, the Seanad has done itself proud and shown why it exists.  It engages in debate slightly outside the temperament of the nation but gives consideration to issues that otherwise would not be considered.  In the 90 or so minutes of debate we have provided a justification for the existence of this House and helped to progress legislation that otherwise would not have been given attention.  I am grateful to the Members who contributed to the debate and for the support forthcoming.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Iarraim uirthi freagra a thabhairt d&uacute;inn maidir leis na pleananna fadt&eacute;armacha le haghaidh Ionad Sl&aacute;inte Bh&eacute;al &Aacute;tha Seanaidh agus Ospid&eacute;al Leifir, at&aacute; &aacute; fheidhmi&uacute; ag Feidhmeannacht na Serbh&iacute;se Sl&aacute;inte an iarthair.  I am seeking information on the long-term future of Lifford Community Hospital and the Rock Hospital in Ballyshannon.  Through my colleagues in the D&aacute;il, I tried to get an answer from the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, on the future of these facilities but have not yet received it.  As a result of the pay cuts introduced by the Government, it is unlikely we will receive a reply from the parliamentary affairs division owing to the ongoing industrial dispute.  This is an opportunity, therefore, for the Minister of State to clarify the positon on the long-term future of these facilities.</P><Col N="311"/>
        <P>The Rock Hospital in Ballyshannon and Lifford Community Hospital provide vital services in their communities.  There was a debate earlier on the high levels of unemployment and lack of investment in County Donegal.  Public sector jobs are very important in the county, even though many of them are at the lower end of the wage scale.  They are a crucial lifeline for the county, which is not to take away from the services they provide, particularly for the elderly.  Earlier I looked at a report on Lifford Community Hospital which outlines the capacity and usage of the hospital.  There is 91.1% usage of the facility, while the total number of bed days in 2003 was 13,296.</P>
        <P>In recent days a number of people have approached me with the suggestion that the future of these facilities is in question.  I make no judgment on the validity of that suggestion but this debate offers the Government an opportunity to allay their fears.  Some of the staff are also concerned about their positions and this issue will undoubtedly become a source of concern and speculation among the wider community as time passes.  This is an opportunity, therefore, to put the matter to rest.  I am hoping to receive good news from the Minister of State in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on the matter.  The Government is committed to supporting people to live in dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  We continue to develop and improve health services in all regions of the country to ensure quality and patient safety.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including those at facilities such as Lifford Community Hospital and the Rock Hospital in Ballyshannon.  All developments must be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures.  The executive has been asked to make a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be reconfigured or reallocated to ensure maximum service provision is achieved.  This requires a stringent ongoing review of the application of the resources currently available.</P>
        <P>The integrated services directorate is the executive&rsquo;s directorate responsible for the delivery of health care services.  I understand that, in line with what is happening throughout the country, the HSE in County Donegal is reviewing its use of resources and facilities for residential care in the county.  The factors relevant to this process in County Donegal include compliance with the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 and the national quality standards for residential care settings for older people in Ireland; staffing and resource issues; residential care needs; the options available in public and private nursing homes and the HSE&rsquo;s capital programme to replace and-or upgrade existing facilities.  On completion of the review, the executive will be in a position to outline any proposed changes arising for HSE facilities in the county.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act was signed into law on the 1 July 2009 and that the scheme commenced last October.  The scheme equalises State support for individuals in public, voluntary and private long-term nursing home care.  This meets one of the objectives of Towards 2016,<i> </i>namely, that State support be indifferent as to whether a person is in public or private care.  Individuals contribute towards their care based on their income and the value of their assets, with the safeguard that no one will pay more than the cost of his or her care.  The introduction of the scheme eliminates the financial need for people to seek public nursing home care.  This allows older people to choose to receive residential care in a wider range of centres, including those which would be closer to their homes and families.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I deliberately worded my Adjourment Matter in such a way as to ask the Government to outline the long-term position of the two hospitals to which I referred and clarify if they would be closed in the future.  The Minister of State did not say whether the hospitals would be closed.  Her answer leads me to believe the information I have received, namely, that the HSE is planning to close the two facilities, could be accurate.  I am aware of the average weekly cost in both facilities.  At just over &euro;900, the average cost at the Rock Hospital is one of the lowest in County Donegal.  The figure for Lifford Community Hospital is just over &euro;1,300.  I am fully aware that a private facility, as the Minister of State mentioned, can provide a service at a cheaper rate.  In the case of Lifford Community Hospital, ancillary services are provided; it is not just a nursing home.  Can the Minister of State reassure the people of County Donegal, in particular the communities of Lifford and Ballyshannon, that the information I have received that the Rock Hospital and Lifford Community Hospital are about to close under new HSE plans is not correct?  She has confirmed that a rigorous assessment is being undertaken.  I have been told the two hospitals are on the chopping block.  I, therefore, ask the Minister of State to allay my fears and those of the community. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Senator on the issue of costs.  Public facilities were often more expensive because they dealt with patients with a higher level of dependance, which meant costs were higher.  The cost to the client is now irrelevant because 80% of his or her income and 5% of his or her assets are taken into consideration.  The issue of cost should not affect the ability of nursing homes or militate against a public facility; it only affects the State.  There are waiting lists at public facilities in County Kildare.  On the review taking place, the Senator can assure persons who wish to enter the facilities that we are trying to equalise support.  It is the levels of their income and assets which matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is appropriate that someone with strong links to Galway is responding to this Adjournment Matter.  I am sure the Minister of State is more than familiar with Loughrea, one of the most densely populated towns in east Galway; a busy spot which also serves a number of communities on the periphery.  In the context of the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is still a vibrant, thriving and burgeoning town.  This will place an extra demand on all of the public services available in the coming years, including water and sewerage schemes.</P>
        <P>A major extension of the water scheme serving Loughrea town and its hinterland has been planned since 2002.  From 2003 onwards, phase 2 of the Loughrea regional water supply scheme was included in the Government&rsquo;s water services investment programme.  It was also included in the investment programme commencing in 2007, with an indication that work would start in 2009.  However, work has not started, despite assurances given from 2003 onwards, including in this Chamber on 29 September 2004, that the matter would be given prompt attention and the project would begin in the near future.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to believe that in 2010 we still have a significant number of communities around the country who do not have access to a public water supply scheme.  One community on the periphery of Loughrea, Kilreekil, comprises more than 100 houses.  It was advised by Galway County Council in 2004 to begin developing a group water scheme, with the intention of connecting it to the Loughrea regional water supply scheme when it came on stream.  The community has been very proactive in that the scheme is ready to proceed.  All it awaits is a source of funding.  Unfortunately, the natural spring water available in the area is not safe to drink <Col N="313"/>and has been designated as such for many years by Galway County Council.  During the summer a number of businesses in the village, including the local pub and shop, have to bring in tankers of water to keep their premises open.  The school has also been affected.  As I said, the community has been very proactive in trying to proceed with a water supply scheme for the village and houses adjacent to it in the hope that if it did its work, Galway County Council and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would do theirs and allow the development of the regional water supply scheme to proceed.</P>
        <P>I am informed by Galway County Council that it has now answered every query raised by the Department and awaits an indication from it that it can begin advertising for tenders to commence phase 2 of the regional water supply scheme.  People have been very patient for almost seven years in waiting for the development to proceed.  Each time the Government publishes a water services investment programme, it contains a commitment to advance the scheme.  I hope the commitment which has been given over and over again will finally be honoured in 2010.  I await the response of the Minister of State with interest.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, I thank the Senator for providing me with an opportunity to set out the position on the Loughrea regional water supply scheme which was included in the water services investment programme 2005 -07 as a scheme to advance to construction in 2009.  The current position is that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government received Galway County Council&rsquo;s revised preliminary report on the scheme early last month.  The council proposes to expand treatment capacity at the existing water treatment plant, provide two new reservoirs and extend the distribution network to serve Kilreekil village and its environs.  The proposed scheme is intended to improve the water supply to existing consumers and also provide spare capacity to meet future needs.  The Department is examining the revised preliminary report and will convey a decision on it to the council as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Further progress on the Loughrea regional water supply scheme must also await finalisation of the new water services investment programme.  Last year local authorities, including Galway County Council, were asked to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services in their areas to the Department by 23 October 2009.  The Department is finalising its consideration of these assessments which will form a key input to the development of the 2010-12 water services investment programme.  In conducting their assessments local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression in the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  The new programme will set out the water services contracts which are likely to proceed to construction in the next three years and also the schemes for which planning will continue during this period.</P>
        <P>With the changed economic climate and the completion of the first cycle of river basin management plans by local authorities in the near future, there is a greater need than ever to focus on strategic environmental and economic objectives.  The 2010-12 water services investment programme, as a three year rolling programme for the provision of major water supply and sewerage infrastructure, will do this by prioritising projects that target public health and environmental compliance issues, support economic and employment growth and offer best value for money.  The Minister expects to publish the 2010-12 investment programme shortly.  His Department will work closely with Galway County Council to advance the priority schemes for the county identified in the new programme.</P>

	<P>To use a phrase used by a Minister who spoke recently in the Chamber, I am somewhat bemused by the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  Why should further progress on the Loughrea regional water supply scheme await finalisation of the new water services investment programme when the scheme has been included in every such programme since 2004?  The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, who was a Minister of State <Col N="314"/>at the Department, said in this Chamber in 2004, &ldquo;It is intended to commence construction in 2006 at an estimated cost of over &euro;35 million.&rdquo;  The programme for the period 2007 onwards indicated construction would start in 2009.  However, we are now told we must await publication of the programme for the period 2010-12.  One wonders why people become frustrated.  The response is less than ample.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue and the Minister of State for being present.</P>
        <P>The future role of F&aacute;ilte Ireland training centres in the provision of training courses for persons who are unemployed in Cork, Dublin and Waterford is a source of major concern.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland, with which the Minister of State will be familiar, runs skills training courses in the training centres mentioned, as well as the centre in Limerick.  It is stated on its website: &ldquo;These courses are the first step on the road to working in an exciting and flexible industry&rdquo;.  The key words are &ldquo;working&rdquo; and &ldquo;training courses provision for people who are unemployed&rdquo;.   As stated in the F&aacute;ilte Ireland pamphlet, it is about allowing people to return to work and helping young people who have no jobs.  There are almost 432,000 people on the live register, which represents an increase of 24% in 12 months.  These are people whom the Government has failed and continues to fail.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the future role of the training centres set up in the late 1980s under the stewardship of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  They were intended at the time to alleviate chronic unemployment and provide an outlet for people in the major cities to attend for retraining and upskilling in hotel catering, the culinary arts and bar tending.  They allowed them to be ready to avail of job opportunities that would present themselves in the tourism sector in restaurants, hotels, bars and guest houses.  If we are to use tourism as a catalyst to get out of recession, I am concerned that, although at the height of the Celtic tiger these courses were in full flow, now during the recession we are cutting back on them.  Why is this the case?  At a time when there is an unemployment ratre of 13%, surely we should put more emphasis on upskilling and training people who are unemployed.  In 2007-08 in Cork there were 14 courses &mdash; four to teach bar skills, four to provide restaurant training and six to teach culinary skills.  These figures have been reduced to two, one and three, respectively.  Why has there been a reduction?  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, speaking on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; on 25 February, stated, &ldquo;I put &euro;1 million into activation measures and training and &euro;1 billion into enterprise.  I transferred funding for training from those employed to those who are unemployed.&rdquo;  What is the money being used for?</P>
        <P>I have talked to people who cannot get onto courses in Cork or who have had to endure a waiting list.  Not only in Cork but also across the country people have been told the number of places on these training courses has been cut significantly.  Funding has been allocated to the training centres but course place numbers have been cut?  Why?  I made specific reference in my request to the Cathaoirleach to the years 2007 to 2009.  Surely it makes sense at a time of high unemployment for the Government to choose not to cut the number of courses available but to provide an opportunity for people to get onto such courses and thereby gain employment either now or in the future.</P>
        <P>In the same interview on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; the T&aacute;naiste spoke about the centres which would help us to return to economic stability.  She identified the tourism and catering industries, the very ones F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s training course programme was intended to assist.  I refer to the organisation&rsquo;s brochure which includes the phrase &ldquo;a career in tourism, a package for you&rdquo;.  The brochure is glossy and aimed predominently at young people but also at those who want <Col N="315"/>to return to work.  Given the reduction in the number of courses available to those who are unemployed, what alternatives are the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, providing for the tourism industry or people who wish to participate in culinary, bar and restaurant skills courses?</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing a reply in which the Minister of State will outline how such centres will be utilised to get people off the dole queues and waiting lists for courses in Cork, Dublin and Waterford.  We must be ready and willing.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland offers a great package and provides a great service.  Those involved in the centres are committed, highly motivated and professional.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate that the cuts to the numbers of courses will be brought to an end and that the numbers will increase in order that we can the tourism industry to be a catalyst to aid our recovery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, sends his apologies to the House for his absence.  On his behalf, I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the role of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and its training centres.  </P>
        <P>As the Senator knows, F&aacute;ilte Ireland was established in 2003 under the National Tourism Development Authority, NTDA, Act which sets out the functions of the agency.  Its clear focus in the provision of training, as set out in section 8 of the Act, is that it shall &ldquo;encourage, promote and support the recruitment, training, and education and development, of persons for the purposes of employment in connection with the tourism industry in the State&rdquo;.  This is a day-to-day function of the authority and neither the Minister nor the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism has a role in the day-to-day delivery of these services.  The Department&rsquo;s role, as stated in its business plan, is to ensure the appropriate policies, resources and structures are in place to support that development of knowledge, skills and competencies, as the basis for quality service delivery in the tourism industry.  The Minister is satisfied that this year&rsquo;s provisions, following the Estimates process, are adequate in that regard.  He is also satisfied that the structures in place for the delivery of the services are appropriate.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland provides and funds tourism training and education through four directly operated training centres in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick and in collaboration with ten institutes of technology.  This activity focuses on craft education and is designed to produce graduates with an accredited tourism qualification which is validated on the national qualifications framework through the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland engages in these programmes in order to build and maintain a relevant &ldquo;skills pipeline&rdquo; to meet the ongoing needs of the industry.  The Minister points out that, unlike the former State agency, CERT, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has no explicit remit to train unemployed persons.  F&Aacute;S remains the primary State agency tasked with that function.</P>
        <P>Equally important to the tourism industry and growing in prominence is a further element in the F&aacute;ilte Ireland service portfolio which involves a range of in-company training, advisory and coaching activities.  This work is carried out on-site in the tourism business and allows tourism owner-managers to access help and advice which is practical and tailored to the specific needs of each individual business.  Through this form of engagement with the industry, F&aacute;ilte Ireland makes a strong contribution to raising the skills, competencies and productivity of those already working in the industry.  In this way, the authority also contributes to the greater sustainability and survival of individual tourism enterprises.  I think Senators will agree that this is a particularly important and correct emphasis in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P>In the past two years F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been reviewing its range of training and business supports continually, primarily in response to the needs of the industry and in consultation with it.  In so doing it has sought to rebalance its activities to respond to calls from the industry for increased in-company training and support.  In some instances, this in-company work has <Col N="316"/>allowed F&aacute;ilte Ireland instructors to identify common problems across a number of firms.  Where this has occurred, staff from these firms have been invited to attend a course at one of the training centres specially designed to meet their needs.  In this way, greater on-site involvement has enabled new courses to be developed and resulted in the training centres being used in new and innovative ways.  This rebalancing of resources and activities has not resulted in an abrupt shift in direction by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Neither has it produced an either-or outcome.  Training continues to be carried on both within training centres and in-company fashion.  The exact balance to be struck in each of the four training centres is determined by reference to local tourism industry needs.</P>
        <P>The Minister believes it is important that training is available for those willing and eager to re-skill and get back into employment.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is playing a valuable role in this regard.  However, it is also important that, as a Government, we do our utmost to maintain existing jobs in the industry by making every effort to ensure businesses continue to survive and trade their way through the current difficult trading conditions.  In this regard, the initiatives taken by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to assist businesses through onsite training, as well as areas such as cost control, web presence and marketing, have been very well received by the industry and represent a good use of available resources.</P>
        <P>In regard to the statistics requested by the Senator, the Minister has asked the F&aacute;ilte Ireland authority to supply this information to the Senator directly and I am confident it will do so in the next few days.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I appreciate that this issue does not involve the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, is indisposed and I wish him well.  I have two points which I hope the Minister of State will convey to him and his Department.  The Minister of State said F&aacute;ilte Ireland had no explicit remit to train unemployed people.  However, its brochure refers to unemployed people being eligible for training programmes.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a role to play in regard to the whole area of unemployment, retraining and upskilling.  The Minister of State also referred to on-site training in the tourism business.  Hotels have no jobs and are cutting back on their workforces; therefore, there are no on-site training jobs.  It is important we examine the remit of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in this context.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s final comment on the provision of information.  I ask her to ensure F&aacute;ilte Ireland contacts me directly and to follow up with the Department in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
