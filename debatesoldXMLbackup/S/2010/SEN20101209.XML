	<P>I have received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the follow matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to comment on the need, if any, for an increased penalty system for those involved in the illegal importation of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re draft order for the reconstitution of the National Economic and Social Council, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2010 &mdash; all Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, on Second Stage of which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate on Second Stage which is to conclude by 1.30 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 3, Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 but not before 3 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure many of us will recall the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; documentary during the week on crime which focused predominantly on Limerick.  My son and I watched the programme together and we were horrified at the sense of despair and utter hopelessness of so many young people in that part of the country.  They had deserted society simply because it seemed to have deserted them.  In the light of the programme, I find it appalling, shocking and deeply saddening that the Government has chosen this week to reduce the budget for one programme which might have helped some of the people in question out of the difficulties in which they find themselves, namely, the youth justice programme which has been in operation since 2005.  The Government has slashed the budget for the programme by 25%.</P><Col N="388"/>
        <P>Child benefit and dole payments are being cut, yet it is intended to continue spending &euro;100,000 per year in keeping minor offenders within the prison system.  I would very much appreciate an opportunity to debate the matter at the earliest possible time, as we urgently need to examine prison policy.  A total of 60% of prison sentences are for one year or less.  I have said on many occasions since we entered into the economic crisis that it gives us licence and authority &mdash; in fact, it demands this from us &mdash; to do things substantially differently from now on.  We need to focus on the prison system and fundamentally reform the way it works.  On purely pragmatic grounds, spending &euro;100,000 per year to keep each prisoner in the prison system represents a ridiculous waste of money and makes no sense whatsoever on humanitarian grounds.  It is a self-defeating exercise.  A total of 40% of former inmates reoffend.  Therefore, the more people we send to prison, the higher the prison population will be.</P>
        <P>In the mid-1990s Canada faced a budgetary crisis that required the government to cut public spending by 20%, something that seems familiar to us now.  As part of the cuts, officials reduced the country&rsquo;s prison population by 11%.  The state released low-risk inmates and introduced more community-based sentences.  Crime did not surge and chaos did not reign.  During the following decade the number of assaults and robberies decreased by 23%, burglaries by 35% and murders by an astonishing 43%.  We need to get beyond the dichotomy of being perceived as being either tough on crime and, therefore, in favour of more prison sentences or soft on crime and, therefore, in favour of fewer prison sentences.  It is not the case.  Sending people to prison does not help to reduce crime.  In fact, prison systems such as ours lead to more crime.</P>

	<P>I was delighted last night when Senator Boyle stated his party should press to have its legislation passed and that he regretted the fact that there would be no legislation on Seanad reform.  It is an extraordinary jump from not being able to reform the Seanad to discussing its elimination.  This point needs to be responded to by the Government.  I am trying to be helpful, as the Green Party wishes to pass a series of important items of legislation, of which I would be supportive, for example, the Bills on political donations and climate change.  I will not rehearse the arguments in favour of passing them.  Since the Lower House will be focused on finance and budgetary issues for the next month or so, why can these Bills not be initiated in this House?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party has a clear opportunity to examine how the Seanad can prove helpful and be supportive of national initiatives and ensure the party&rsquo;s business is placed on the agenda and addressed.</P>
        <P>Although I have raised the next budgetary matter before, it is important that I have my comments recorded.  The cut in the national minimum wage was not demanded by IBEC, the Competition Authority or Mr. Chopra and it was not a condition in getting money from the European Union.  As there was no demand for the cut to be made, I ask the Government to reconsider.  Among all politicians, there is a significant sense of embarrassment at the idea that we are still here while certain cutbacks are being made.  Of all cuts, the one affecting blind people is the most difficult to take.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government probably did not give the matter enough thought.  I will, therefore, offer a suggestion.  Blind people and people with sight difficulties experience the added costs associated with maintaining a guide dog.  Guide dogs are expensive to look after and feed.  There are also veterinary costs.  In addition to the support afforded to blind <Col N="389"/>people and people with sight difficulties, will the Government consider providing an additional allowance for the support and maintenance guide dogs which would put people back on an even keel without undermining Government policy?  It would not cost much to do this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On the budget, there are many injustices.  I want draw attention to one, in particular, the impact of the cut in child benefit on the poorest families.  Child benefit was also cut last year, but some compensatory measures were taken to protect the children of poorer families.  Why have no compensatory measures been taken this year?  Presumably, the Social Welfare Bill 2010 will be before the House next week.  If the Government found it possible last year to take ameliorative measures to protect poorer families following the cut in child benefit, why is it not doing so this year?  Perhaps the Deputy Leader might like to comment, although his answer to all of these questions will be the mantra that it does not matter who is in government because they would all do the same.  That is what he keeps telling us.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a second question, on the important issue of the future of this and the Lower House.  We deserve clarity, not just rumour.  The airwaves have been full of rumours following the announcement of the leader of the Green Party on 22 November that it was time to have a general election and that it should be held in the middle of January.  On the same day the Taoiseach stated: &ldquo;It is my intention at the conclusion of this budgetary process with the enactment of the necessary legislation in the new year to then seek a dissolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and to enable the people to determine who should undertake the responsibilities of government in the challenging period ahead thereafter.&rdquo;  Is it still the position that, once the budgetary measures and the legislation required to enact the provisions of the budget have been completed, the Taoiseach intends to dissolve the D&aacute;il and hold a general election?  Alternatively, are we now in the hilarious situation where the Taoiseach is presenting the impression that he still intends to dissolve the D&aacute;il but that the Green Party will not let him?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>

	<P>I have mentioned it to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and believe he wishes to raise the matter at the next Cabinet meeting.

	<P>A matter on today&rsquo;s crowded Order Paper is not for debate, but a debate at the earliest opportunity on the change in the construction of the National Economic and Social Council, an important body for social partnership, particularly in the context of long-term strategy, would benefit the House.  Both Houses need every assistance in formulating a long-term strategy because the people are crying out for such a vision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised interesting points about legislation, to which Senator Boyle responded, but I would also like to hear the Leader&rsquo;s response.  Is there a timetable for the processing of this and other legislation?  The points made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole which Senator Boyle welcomed should be taken on board.  The Seanad could play a constructive role before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Another serious matter has been confirmed.  As suspected for some time, the banks deliberately falsified information and misled the National Asset Management Agency.  There are other problems with NAMA, for example, how the investment market should be kickstarted, given that NAMA&rsquo;s portfolio amounts to a figure of &euro;81 billion, two thirds or more of which is invested in Ireland.  The market is so stagnant that there will be no movement, unless NAMA takes the initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the matter?  If so, he should ask the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that the Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, has written to the Committee of Public Accounts confirming the position, I hope that he, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Director of Corporate Enforcement will follow through.  Perhaps the Leader might enlighten the House this morning in regard to the matter. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the country comes to terms with a very difficult budget, I want to raise an issue that I have spoken on many times, namely, the maximum chargeable interest rate for loans.  Licensed money lenders in this State can legally charge extortionate rates of <Col N="392"/>187%, and as people try honestly and in a resilient fashion to make the adjustments the budget demands of them, they may well seek to resort to the likes of Provident Financial plc, which openly charges 187%, and other moneylenders with extortionate rates.  This takes advantage of people, and other countries such as Germany have faced up to this issue where there is a maximum chargeable rate.  I believe 187% is legalised criminality by way of extortion. When people run into difficulty trying to meet these extortionate rates, they may resort to illegal moneylenders and we know the criminality associated with that.  In whatever time is left I ask for an urgent debate on this.  I urge the Leader to write immediately to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to ask that a maximum chargeable rate be applied forthwith.</P>
        
        <P>As regards the completion of the budgetary process and the expected dissolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas to facilitate an election, it is worth noting that the Finance Bill last year was not concluded until well into April.  Therefore an early summer election may well happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Further clarification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I spoke twice yesterday on the economy and put on the record a heart-rending letter from a woman who is experiencing the impossibility of meeting her very basic commitments to her family.  I am not going to read the letter into the Order of Business again, but we have to realise that one simply cannot get blood out of a stone.  We have all got to take whatever cuts we can, I would tell the Government, but they can only be the cuts we can take.  I believe in the old socialist maxim, &ldquo;From each, according to his ability, to each according to his need&rdquo;.  However, one can only take it from the people who have it to give, and for that reason I believe every measure should have a means test of some type applied to it to determine whether it is possible for people to pay up without damaging their families or their health, welfare and education. That is vitally necessary and in this context I know the bank executives who won a court case and got &euro;40 million in bonuses were legally justified in their action, but I wonder about the morality of it.  I wonder whether they realise quite how provocative it was in the light of the degree of suffering going on in the country, and given the general view that it is the executives of the banks who were very largely culpable for the crisis.</P>
        
        <P>I want to raise another matter that relates to our near kin, horses.  Ireland is supposed to be a horse loving country.  An extraordinary situation has developed, however, in terms of the very large numbers of abandoned and stray horses around the countryside.  These poor wonderful animals have no capacity to fend for themselves, because their nature, apparently, is just to stand in a field.  They will not jump over a hedge and look for food.  Often they are spancelled, tied and tortured.  We need to investigate the operation of the Smithfield market which, although it has a long tradition in this city, is being radically changed.  It is now becoming a funnel for horses to be sold very cheaply to unsuitable purchasers.</P>
        <P>I would like a discussion on this important matter of animal welfare, whether the legislation is appropriate and if there is enough of it and what we can do in negotiation with the farming community and others, along with the horse breeding industry, to tackle this very regrettable situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise again the issue of the Donegal Youth Council.  It has lost its co-ordinator post and the council has been suspended.  We talk here about getting youth involved in democracy and cite the Oireachtas as being more user-friendly towards young <Col N="393"/>people, in giving example etc.  However, the fact the youth council has lost its co-ordinator, which has effectively suspended that body, is just not in order.  To set the record straight, a Chathaoirligh, this issue was ruled out of order earlier this week on the basis of the Minister having no responsibility in this area.  However, I can clarify that having spent some time with the Minister&rsquo;s officials last night, it was realised that the Minister very much has a role in relation to this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That leads me to question the incidence of other matters being ruled out of order recently, for example the issue concerning television pictures and the change over from analogue to digital that I know will cause chaos later next year.  Given that the Minister was able to address this subject when it was an all-island issue, but could not do so when it was of concern only to the Republic of Ireland, can that question be raised again with the Department and the Minister ordered or asked to discuss with the Seanad the general issue of the changeover from analogue to digital and its implications?  We are moving to SAORVIEW and it will be anything but for those who are experiencing difficulties with their television pictures at the moment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again raise the issue of organised crime in sport.  If I am asked by the Council of Europe to produce a report on having an international agency involved in overseeing organised crime in sport, surely this House has the right to ask our Minister for her views in relation to this matter.  Therefore I believe it is most important that Ministers address the Seanad on issues that are of importance, and not have them ruled out of order given that subsequently they may be found to be in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Matters on the Adjournment are a matter for the Chair, and if senior officials in a Department indicate they have no responsibility in a matter, I have no choice except to rule it out of order.  I leave it at that and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>At all times I go to the very highest level in a Department, and when I get a decision I either allow the matter on the Adjournment or not.  I only rule matters out when officials are not in a position to reply. </P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was very saddened to hear the terrible news from Waterford city, where two five year olds were found by a social worker to be scavenging the public bins in the streets.  This follows on from Senator McFadden&rsquo;s experience last week, where she told of families on the bread line who cannot feed their children.  We need to be concerned at that this is happening around the country. Even families that are working are on the bread line and find it increasingly difficult to feed their young children.  We need to be very much aware of this as parliamentarians and as an Oireachtas.  I am not sure whether the recent budget was poverty-proofed because more poverty traps are being created in the measures being implemented by Government.  This is the real impact of cuts on those who are most vulnerable.</P>
        
        <P>I believe in enterprise and in people working their way, but when we reach these levels of destitution, we must take into account what we see before us.  The initiative as regards cuts in child benefit might have been done better.  Funds allocated for child benefit should have been targeted at the most vulnerable.  There are people in receipt of child benefit in Ireland who are millionaires, and this is patently unfair.  Then we see an example such as this in Waterford city, and it will happen in other towns and villages.  It just happened to be discovered yesterday, and I am aware the HSE is investigating.  However, it is time we took notice of reality on the ground <Col N="394"/>and measures in the budget need to be examined very closely and poverty-proofed before being implemented.</P>

As regards child benefit, we should have a debate, in particular, on the computer systems in use, because quite frankly, although we have some of the world&rsquo;s best computer professionals in Ireland, many computer systems are well out of date.  I raise this in relation to child benefit in particular because, apparently, the reality is that it is impossible to tax child benefit because the various computer systems do not talk to each other. Whether we agree with taxing child benefit is beside the point.  Our computer systems should be modernised and many things are not being done in terms of tax simply because we have not got adequate systems.  That needs to be debated here because, ultimately, who will instigate reform in this area?  Our job as politicians is to ensure we have computer systems that are at least up to the level of business in this country, whereas in reality we do not.</P>
        
        <P>I endorse the points made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  His point on the Seanad dealing with the non-financial business of this House is a very positive suggestion and I ask the Leader to consider this House sitting longer than the D&aacute;il, or indeed coming back earlier than the Lower House to do just that.</P>
      
        <P>I am a former patron of the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, which is probably one of the leaders in the world in terms of what it does.  We should all be proud of what it does.  This is an issue we should consider in the context of the comments made by Senator in that regard.</P>
        <P>I endorse Senator Norris&rsquo;s point about horses.  There is in Dublin at least a register of horses but in place such as Galway there is no register, even for stray horses.  We need seriously to examine this issue.  Horses are, owing to poverty, being left to starve.</P>

	<P>This year&rsquo;s budget in many ways hits the poor and ordinary people who did not create our troubles.  One measure which stands out and that should be reconsidered and discussed in this House is the reduction in the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  People who are carers make an input into the economy.  They create wealth in the sense of reducing the need for institutional care.</P>

	<P Just="Left">They create wealth in the sense of providing a service at home.  They are cost neutral.  There have been many consultative studies and so on in this country and a great deal of money has been spent on experts to advise experts, many from outside the Civil Service, but a proper study has never been undertaken of the import and potential of carers to keep more people at home and out of institutional care.  The cut in the carer&rsquo;s allowance is wrong and should be revisited.  We need to have a debate on the effect of carers in homes, the happiness they create and the quality of life they provide.  In these times when economics have taken supremacy over all other social sciences, the value of carers in economic terms is underestimated.  We need to re-examine this cutback.  I appeal to the Leader to provide time for that debate.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call on the need to bring the climate change legislation into this House immediately on the basis that we need to create jobs in the green energy area.  It is critical to debate that legislation given our potential to export energy.  I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on those two issues.  The madness of discouraging our carers at a time when this country needs to create jobs is appalling.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator MacSharry for a debate on official legal moneylenders.  This matter needs to be investigated because of the attraction of moneylenders to people currently encountering difficulties.  I also support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for this matter to be addressed in the finance Bill and urge the Leader to put that to the Minister.</P>
        <P>On the travel tax, I compliment all Members of the House and, in particular, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Culture, Deputy Hanafin, who proposed this change.  Senator Cannon made the point some time ago that it would be beneficial to consider free flights into Ireland for a particular period, in particular from Britain.  This would make a major difference in terms of filling hotel rooms.  The Senator also pointed out that if we can bring people into the country, even if we subsidise their flights, it would be a good investment.</P>
        <P>On the budget, the Minister for Finance has proposed a four year national solidarity bond, which I welcome.  Previously this bond was for ten years but it has now been reduced to four years.  While I welcome that the bond is sold through An Post, I raised yesterday with the Minister during a Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party meeting that the banks we own wholly or in part, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, should be allowed to sell these bonds because post offices are often busy dealing with pension payments and so on.  I believe this would make <Col N="396"/>the bonds more accessible to the public.  The national solidarity bond has raised approximately &euro;300 million and is a welcome provision that was raised initially in this House.</P>

In regard to the &euro;250,000 cap imposed in the budget on the semi-State chiefs in a great flurry of trumpets this apparently is only basic pay.

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I have a huge difficulty with bonuses being paid.  The budget has imposed cuts in three main areas because the bulk of public spending is in these areas.  These areas include, health, social protection and education, all of which are essential for people.  The reason for this is not the finances of the State because they are in a robust state, but the banks.  Not alone are the banks costing the State so much that we have to cut back on essential services in health, social protection and education, to add insult to injury they are insisting on payment of bonuses, which is terribly wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Finance to come to this House to tell Members who demanded that the minimum wage be cut and explain why it was cut.  Minimum wage recipients, those who need money most, will lose approximately &euro;46 per month, almost &euro;1,000 per annum, as a result of this reduction.  Why was the minimum wage reduced?  Perhaps the Members opposite can explain that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader explain to the House what the Green Party is going to do?  I call on the Green Party to state whether it proposes to stay and participate in or leave government.  Is it hitching a lift to the middle of nowhere?  If it wants an election, it should tell us when it wants one.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite the Taoiseach to come to the House?  There is a spring in the step of Government Members having witnessed the Taoiseach being reincarnated this week, while the Fourth Estate is ecstatic.  However, the leader of the Government needs to explain why he presided over and participated in a Government which got us into the economic mess we are in today.  Senator Harris speaks about a national consensus and a new movement.  I want a new Ireland.  The poet, Theo Dorgan, gave a fine address in UCC yesterday.  We must be a hopeful, forward looking nation, but we cannot be under the Government which leads us.  Is this about the Taoiseach holding on to his position as leader of Fianna F&aacute;il or the base Fianna F&aacute;il vote?  Is this about him upping his performance to appease parliamentary party members or is it about the people?  If the budget announced this week taught us something, it is that people matter.

Citibank is leading the way in the field of service innovation and the jobs announced will complement the 2,200 jobs the company has provided since it set up in Ireland in 1965.  Ireland competed with other European destinations for these jobs and Citibank states the reason Ireland won is its long-standing and well respected operation here, the talented and well education labour force available and the pro-business environment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Although we sometimes deservedly criticise Green Party members for being a little flaky in many ways, will the Leader pass on to Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in my compliments and great admiration for the way he stuck to his guns on the issue of animal welfare?  Concern for animals does us credit as a society and it in no way suggests we have our priorities wrong when, in addition to being concerned for our fellow humans, we also want to create a society in which animals are cared for and respected properly.  That is a tribute to human dignity.</P>
        <P>One of the more regrettable features of the budget is the way in which it further penalises one-income married couples.  It has hit such couples harder than single people and extended the philosophy of tax individualisation.  The tax burden on a one-income married couple on &euro;45,000 per annum will increase by almost &euro;200 more per annum than for a single person on the same income.  Such a couple will almost certainly have dependent children.  Why is the Government increasing the tax burden on such couples beyond that on a single person who is likely to have no dependants?  This is perfectly in line with the four-year plan which, regrettably, proposed a direct attack on stay at home mothers and appears to be a sop to the IMF and the European Commission.  From where is this hostility coming?  Who is behind the agenda to force women, in particular, into the workplace and children into day care as a priority?  Families should be allowed to make their own decisions.  Those behind this decision see no value or role to be served by one parent staying at home to care for their children or an elderly relative.  That is regrettable.</P>
        <P>Given the tentative proposal to reduce public service salaries by introducing a cap of &euro;250,000 per annum, will the Leader find out from where that figure came?  Could the Government not be more adventurous and propose a lower cap of, say, &euro;150,000 per annum?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am stunned that &euro;40 million will be paid in bonuses by AIB.  It may be an entitlement legally, but morally it is indefensible.  Was the Government aware that this was in process when nationalising the bank?  What type of negotiators did the Government employ since they could not strike a deal on behalf of the taxpayer contingent on bonuses not being paid?  Then AIB would have had to put it up to its workers to roll back on the bonuses to be paid.  We need such negotiations.</P>
        <P>I refer to the new universal social charge which will replace the income and health levies.  Is it true that it will affect everyone, including those who hold medical cards?  I have received a disturbing e-mail, as I am sure other Members have, about a family with a medical card who will lose &euro;67 a week if this is true.  That is exactly the amount they need to pay their mortgage.  The parents have everything worked out for how much they need for food, light, heat and so on.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not get a chance to read the OECD report yesterday, but having acquainted myself with it a bit more, I would like to call on the Leader for a debate on education.  The problem with debating education in this House traditionally has been that there are so many teachers in both Houses of the Oireachtas that the debates always descend to a level of letting the Government spend more money, whatever Government that might be, and that everything will be fine.  It is clear from the OECD report that there is a problem with teaching skills as well as everything else.  It is no good throwing money at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if we have bad cops.  It is no good throwing money at the ESB if technicians are just working four and five hours per day.</P>
        <P>The problem with teaching is that it seems there is a problem with teaching skills.  If there is, then there is a managerial problem to be fixed.  I would like a proper debate that would allow us to raise some of the unpopular things.  There is a duty among Members of these Houses to say things that vested interests cannot say, whether those interests are teachers or anyone else.  One of the things that strikes me is the fact that much teaching is very difficult.  It involves rote skills and hard brutal learning of facts and figures.  Mathematics especially involves hard work.  It seems to me, as an outsider, that in recent years since 1980, there is much child-centred nonsense going on that makes the relationship between teachers and parents more emollient, but the fact remains that teaching is hard work.  Much of it would be unpopular with parents if it were done properly.</P>
        <P>In the past 40 years, picking up the habits of Britain, we have gone for all this trendy stuff and green flags, and we have forgotten that de Valera was educated in national school.  There is no great curriculum around him.  Michael Collins was educated in national school.  How is it that they could come out and take on an empire?  They were mathematically numerate and highly literate.  How come, despite the fact that our teachers are some of the highest paid in Europe, and despite the fact that university lecturers are some of the highest paid in Europe, we still have problems with core teaching values?  Much of that comes from the fact that we need to return to some traditional habits of teaching.  We need to accept that, just like playing the violin, it is not easy all the way.</P>

	<P>We had little or no legislation in this House for the first seven or eight weeks of this term.  It now appears that the Green Party wants three or four Bills passed before we have a general election.  It makes one wonder whether it was January 2012 they had in mind for a general election rather than January 2011.  The Leader might be in a position to inform the House of the intended sitting days for next week, whether we intend to sit the following week, and the position on an early return in January.  Such information would be helpful to Members.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senators Cannon, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle and Coughlan all called for a debate on prisons.  We have had a debate on prisons, but like education, it is a subject we must debate again at the earliest opportunity.  I will have no difficulty in allocating time to it in order that we can hear the new proposals on how to tackle the challenges facing those who offend.  I am pretty familiar with the Canadian experience and I fully agree with what Senator Cannon said.</P><Col N="401"/>

	<P>It is all legislation between now and then, and legislation must take priority.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coffey, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, O&rsquo;Reilly, Buttimer and Mullen spoke about various areas of serious concern in the budget.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the issue of cutbacks affecting the blind.  They are a cause I certainly have supported all my life.  One of the greatest gifts the good Lord can give any person is sight.  As someone who has had difficulty with sight since I was 12 years old, I appreciate having my sight.  The proposal by Senator O&rsquo;Toole for an additional allowance for guide dogs is a very good one.  Anything that can be done in this regard will be fully supported and we will see what we on the Government side can do to have this included.</P>
        <P>Various areas like child benefit and carer&rsquo;s allowance were mentioned.  The child benefit rate will be &euro;140 per month for the first and second child, &euro;167 per month for the third child, and &euro;177 for the fourth and subsequent children.  The additional benefit and grant for multiple births will continue to be paid, and there will be no change in the weekly qualified child increase paid to those getting weekly special social welfare payments.  Schemes that have been fully maintained in the budget include the family income supplement, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, the domiciliary care allowance and the widowed parent grants.</P>
        <P>We have all praised carers as the unsung heroes of our society.  The half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance will continue to be paid to people who are full-time carers and who are getting another welfare payment.  Extra payment for caring for more than one person is retained.  Carers will continue to get an annual respite care grant of &euro;1,700 for each care recipient.  The carer&rsquo;s allowance rate for carers aged 66 and over will not change.  The rate for carers under 66 will be reduced by 3.8%, or &euro;8.  I think that clarifies the serious concerns expressed by colleagues on budgetary matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Boyle called for an urgent debate on the reform of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  I will have no difficulty in allowing it to take place after Christmas.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry and Senator Leyden raised a serious issue in the House, namely, those who are hard pressed with their debts.  Being able to charge an interest rate of 187% is of such serious concern that I will certainly discuss it with the Minister before we go home this weekend.  This is appalling and must not be allowed to continue.  I thank Senator MacSharry for bringing it to the attention of the House, and supported in doing so by Senator Leyden.  It certainly is shameful.  It is an absolute disgrace that this is being allowed to continue legally.  The Minister has an urgent duty to address this in the finance Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Norris, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Ross and Healy Eames called for the Minister to participate in a debate on the bank bonuses, which go back to 2008.  These were also an issue in the courts.  The thrust of the argument is that everyone must play their part.  A signal is being sent to the rest of the workforce of the country that must be examined by the Minister and addressed by the Government.  I agree with many of the sentiments that have been expressed in this respect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris, supported by Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, spoke about the animal welfare Bill and stray animals, especially horses.  I will pass on their strong views to the Minister.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Keaveney spoke about the failure to replace the Donegal Youth Council co-ordinator post.  This is a serious concern for the Senator and I will pass this on to the Minister.  She <Col N="402"/>also spoke about her concern about the changeover from analogue to digital television.  It certainly is a massive challenge.</P>
        <P>The Appropriation Bill 2010 is the last Bill we will discuss next week.  Senators who raise different issues and concerns on the Order of Business might participate in this debate.  I will discuss with the party leaders at our meeting next Tuesday the possibility of extending the discussion on the Bill over a few days at the end of this term and the start of the next term in order that colleagues can debate issues of concern to them, such as organised crime in sport which is a concern for Senator Keaveney.  Senator Leyden mentioned the four year national solidarity bond and I certainly support that great call.  Already &euro;300 million has been taken in, a large sum, and we should do anything we can to support it.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer commented on the Government&rsquo;s mandate.  The mandate is given by the people in a general election then the D&aacute;il reaffirms this mandate on a weekly basis for the Taoiseach and the Government to continue.  We all saw the budget being passed by 82 votes to 78 votes, a majority of four, followed by majorities on many other votes yesterday which confirm the Government&rsquo;s mandate.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely welcomed the 250 new jobs coming to Ireland from Citi.  It has been here since 1965 and the reason for these 250 jobs in the service innovation area was because of the pro-business workforce Ireland has been recognised for and I certainly welcome those new jobs, that is great news coming up to Christmas.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins asked about the legislative programme for next week.  I propose the House will sit four days next week, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and on Friday we will review progress on when the House will sit again.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In Budget 2009, as part of the programme of rationalisation of State agencies, it was proposed that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board and the Office of Tobacco Control would be merged to form the Public Health and Medicines Safety Authority.  The case for this <Col N="403"/>merger was based primarily on the broadly similar functional responsibilities of the three bodies in terms of their standards setting and inspectorate functions, and their risk assessment and evaluation roles.  However, following the pivotal role played by the FSAI during the 2008 dioxin incident, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in May 2009, recommended a reversal of this proposed merger.  In December 2009, the inter-agency dioxin review group also recommended that the independence of Ireland&rsquo;s food safety infrastructure be maintained. The Government, thereafter, decided in June this year to retain both the FSAI and the IMB as independent, stand-alone agencies.  The Government also decided to revert to its earlier decision to merge the OTC within the HSE as it was considered that there was no case for merging the OTC with either the FSAI or the IMB.</P>
        
        <P>In introducing this Bill, it is appropriate to reflect on the comprehensive range of tobacco control legislation that has been introduced in Ireland since 2002 and the significant contribution made by the OTC in its implementation.  These important public health measures include the smoke-free initiative in 2004, the ban on the sale of packs of cigarettes of less than 20 in 2007 and the ban on in-store display and advertising and the introduction of the retail register in 2009.  This comprehensive range of tobacco control legislation places Ireland in the top rank of countries internationally.  However, despite the legislative measures taken to date and the widespread knowledge of the harm caused by tobacco consumption, smoking prevalence in Ireland remains high.</P>
        <P>In view of this it is now necessary to refocus our efforts to reduce smoking rates generally, with a particular emphasis on young people.  With the core legislation already in place, we now need to focus to a greater extent on the broader health promotion and smoking cessation measures necessary to reduce smoking prevalence.  This integrated approach, allied with ongoing enforcement of the legislation, is essential if we are to continue to make progress towards a tobacco free society.  In this regard, the HSE has recently published its tobacco control framework to provide a coherent approach to promote public health by reducing tobacco use in Ireland.  This framework recognises the need for effective and evidence based tobacco control measures, including offering help to people who want to quit and warning of the dangers of tobacco.</P>
        <P>It is timely in this context that the Bill before the Seanad provides for the functions and staff of the Office of Tobacco Control to transfer into the HSE from 1 January 2011.  This additional resource and expertise will significantly assist the HSE in achieving its tobacco related population health objectives in the years ahead; objectives that are fundamental to a reduction in the health and social burden of tobacco consumption in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Bill comprises 15 sections.  Section 1 defines certain words and terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 dissolves the office.  Section 3 transfers functions of the office into the Health Service Executive.  Section 4 provides for references to the office in any enactment to be construed as references to the Health Service Executive and for the completion by the HSE of any function commenced by the office prior to dissolution.  Sections 5 and 6 transfer land, other property and any money, stocks, shares, securities, rights and liabilities of the office to the Health Service Executive.  Section 7 provides that every contract or agreement made by the office which is in force immediately before the commencement of the Act, shall continue in force and have effect as if the Health Service Executive were substituted for office.</P>
        <P>Section 8 substitutes the name of the Health Service Executive for the name of the office in any pending legal proceedings to which the office is a party immediately before the commencement of the Act.  The proceedings shall not abate by reason of such substitution.</P><Col N="404"/>
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Section 9 provides that every person who is currently a member of staff of the office shall be transferred to and become an employee of the Health Service Executive.  It ensures that their conditions of service, remuneration and superannuation benefits shall be no less favourable than those applicable immediately before commencement of the Act.  The previous service of a person transferred shall be reckonable and they shall be deemed to be employed in accordance with the Health Acts 1947 to 2009.</P>
        <P>Section 10 transfers each record held by the office immediately before commencement of the Act to the Health Service Executive.  Sections 11 and 12 require the Health Service Executive to cause final accounts and final report of the office to be prepared and to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 13 repeals Part 2 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, which established the Office of Tobacco Control and sets out the general functions and procedures under which the office operated.  Section 14 provides for the payment of expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 15 provides for the Short Title, commencement and collective citation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw attention to the welcome given by the OTC&rsquo;s chairman to the transfer of the office into the HSE.  The OTC considers that this move will ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing work to create a tobacco-free society, in which Ireland is a world leader, will stay at the heart of public health.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Fine Gael will support his legislation, in line with our support for the rationalisation of State organisations.  It is important, however, that the message goes out from this House today that our battle to address tobacco addiction is far from finished and remains a huge challenge to our health, education and wider social system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will speak later of what the WHO states at this point on the worldwide challenge of dealing with this issue and the tobacco industry.  It is also focusing increasingly on the effects of second hand smoke.  That is very important.  The WHO quotes a frightening figure and awareness of this in this country is not high.  More than 600,000 deaths per year are caused by second hand smoke worldwide, more than 1% of all deaths and of those, 165,000 deaths are of children.  Smokers are not only putting themselves at risk, they are placing at risk 1.8 billion non-smokers.  The statistics are frightening.  Women and children are disproportionately affected and there is major regional variation.  Policy makers are being urged to take action to protect the population from exposure to second-hand smoke.  We need effective policies in this regard and that is a challenge we must meet.  We must treat the effects of tobacco and smoking more seriously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important we recognise the positive steps that have been taken in this country, which the Minister of State listed.  Some of the targets in the strategy, Towards a Tobacco Free Society, have been met, as acknowledged by the Irish Cancer Society.  The Office of Tobacco Control, which first received statutory status in 2002, has played an important role in meeting these targets.  In discussing a rationalisation such as this, it is important to acknowledge the work that has been done.  The people in that office were proactive and the issue had a high priority at one time in our health policies, although it does not to the same extent now.  It can be quite disappointing for people who have worked in an area and given priority to it to find themselves subsumed into a larger body such as the HSE.  I pay tribute to the staff of the Office of Tobacco Control and I hope the valuable work they have been doing will continue and will be given priority.</P><Col N="405"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Office of Tobacco Control has compiled significant data on the level of compliance with tobacco legislation and on the attitudes of the public, particularly young people, towards smoking.  The subsuming of the office into the HSE should not be perceived as a lack of commitment to tackling the issues surrounding tobacco.  Despite all the efforts and welcome initiatives, the rate of smoking in Ireland remains high, and we have serious work to do in health promotion and the provision of education and information on the effects of smoking, particularly for young people and women.</P>
        <P>As we have seen over the years, the money put into advertising by the tobacco industry to target different sections of society, particularly women, has been effective.  The Government must be aware that we are dealing with a large industry, and its message must be strong.  We need to redouble our efforts to tackle this serious public health issue.  Obviously, there are many priorities in public health and health promotion, but this is a key one.  I have already quoted statistics on the appalling effects of second-hand smoking.  Our health service spends a fortune on treating tobacco-related illnesses &mdash; I have heard a figure of &euro;2 billion.  The health budget is approximately &euro;15 billion per year.  Does the Minister of State agree with that assessment?  In these hard economic times, the economic benefit of reducing the level of smoking is clear.</P>
        <P>We need to hear answers to the following questions from the Minister of State.  The current HSE service plan has no specific target of reducing smoking prevalence.  Will this change in the new service plan, and what targets does she envisage?  Will the Minister instruct the HSE to produce a new national strategy to reduce smoking prevalence and build on the work of the report, Towards a Tobacco Free Society?</P>
        <P>There is another serious issue, which also applies to other areas about which we are concerned.  In the current economic climate, community-based smoking cessation programs have been severely cut.  The impact of these cuts on achieving reductions in smoking will be serious.  We all know how difficult it is for people to give up smoking, and what is clear from the research is that a multifaceted approach is required, with advice and support from friends and good quality information.  Being part of a group such as a smoking cessation program can help.  If some of those elements are not available to people, it will be much more difficult for them to stop smoking.</P>
        <P>The number of calls to the National Smokers&rsquo; Quitline has gone down.  This is not because people have stopped smoking or do not need help; it is because there is less advertising and, like anything, if people do not know the service is available, they will not make the call.  This telephone service is a point of information and contact which is available to people who need it.</P>
        <P>I have already talked about the cost of smoking-related illnesses, which is substantial.  Around 6,000 people die every year from smoking-related illnesses and statistics indicate that 1 million people in Ireland smoke.  Smoking is the biggest cause of preventable deaths in Ireland, causing 30% of all cancers, including 95% of lung cancers.  What we know about lung cancer is that it is very slow to be detected and late diagnoses are common.  In many people, lung cancer has developed to quite a degree before a diagnosis is given.  It is frightening to see that more and more women are dying from lung cancer.  In fact, we are about to pass the point at which more women will die from lung cancer than from breast cancer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a serious public health issue for women and men and continues to demand our attention, priority and public money because its consequences are so serious.  Sometimes it is dismissed as though it does not have public health implications.  People say it is a question of personal choice and it is not that serious, but we should be far beyond that point based on the quality of the research we have available to us about the impact of smoking.</P><Col N="406"/>
        <P Just="Left">This is not the time to take our eye off the ball in tackling the use of tobacco products.  I stand shoulder to shoulder with the Government in its commitment to the objective of reducing the use of tobacco products.  The Bill must pass today only with assurances that the fight against tobacco and smoking will not be diminished as a result of the measures contained in it and that a new strategy and specific targets will be established.</P>
        <P>The selling of smuggled cigarettes is increasingly common.  I have seen this in my own area of Clondalkin, where people drop leaflets advertising the sale of illegal cigarettes and alcohol door-to-door without any regulation.  We saw a serious report on this on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; the other night in which the links between cigarette smuggling and drug trafficking were clearly laid out.  We are not talking about young children who want to make some extra money.  This is part of a big, illegal industry which is linked to trafficking of women and the importation of drugs.  It is not something that should be ignored; it demands our resources and attention.  We also saw in the programme that such cigarettes contain very dangerous substances.  I believe people in this country are not aware that when they buy smuggled cigarettes the material contained in them is dangerous to their health.  This is something that must be tackled seriously.  ASH has put out information recently about a dedicated free telephone line for members of the public to report details or concerns about the smuggling of cigarettes.  ASH states that the availability of smuggled cigarettes not only affects the economy but represents a significant health risk and supports organised crime.  The sale and importation of smuggled cigarettes must be seen as an activity of major international criminal gangs.  That is what is going on and it must be tackled.  Members of the public need to know about this confidential free telephone line.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provisions of the legislation, which makes sense as part of the rationalisation of State agencies, but we must continue to prioritise the valuable work that was done by this organisation when it was not under the control of the HSE but was an independent body.  Its work remains vital and I hope this is acknowledged within the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brady.  I welcome the Bill.  I always smile when I see a short tranche of legislation.  The shorter it is, the stronger.  There is no doubt that when one hears a speech read out and everything one wishes to say has already been said by Senator Fitzgerald, then we are all singing from the one hymn sheet.  Such Bills are always short, powerful tranches of legislation.  I am pleased to speak to the Bill and I gather all Stages will be taken today.  As the Minister of State has outlined, the Bill is primarily for the dissolution of the Office of Tobacco Control as part of the rationalisation of State agencies.  The former Office of Tobacco Control will fall under the remit of the HSE.</P>
        <P>This gives everyone here a chance to discuss the important work we must carry out to eliminate tobacco smoking in the country and to achieve a tobacco-free society.  This is not easy to do when one considers we are a nation of 4.5 million people of which 1 million are smokers.  It is a shame to see young people smoking.  God knows when I was going to school it was a great thing if one had a few pence in one&rsquo;s pencil box and one bought a couple of loose cigarettes.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach would not remember that time, he is far too young.  One would even smoke a cigarette that was three or four days old and die for a day from the sickness as a result.  Today it is so sophisticated with nice wrappers and attractive packaging but the hazards are so much worse than in my time.  This is remarkably sad because we know the terrible, negative and killing effects on us of tobacco smoking.  However, some in our young, well-educated society are still prepared to take risks with their lungs, heart and every other organ in their body that smoking affects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recently I was passing through the airport on my way to a funeral in Manchester.  I was browsing through the duty free shops because everyone was snowed under in Manchester and <Col N="407"/>the airlines were waiting to defrost engines and so on.  As I walked around I was blown away at the size of the duty free advertising for cigarettes, which was massive.  The perfumes, make-up, sweets, cheese and expensive nice foods that one may pick up in little hampers did not get a look in because of the big billboards &mdash; they were certainly billboards &mdash; advertising cigarettes.  Needless to say, everyone there was looking at the prices.  The smallest package available was a carton of 200 or 400 cigarettes.  It struck me that we have introduced great legislation which hides all of this under the roller shutters in our local shops.  However,  this is not the case in airports where people are more inclined to buy in bulk in the belief one is getting a bargain.  The advertising is there in one&rsquo;s face making it a good deal more attractive.  It would be preferable were it kept behind a shutter although I realise there is a legitimate reason why this is the case.  It has to be this way but I wish we could begin to chip away at it and perhaps change it.</P>
        <P>We were the people who brought in the smoking ban.  I recall when it was introduced in 2003 or 2004 and cameras from throughout the world came to Dublin to find out what it was like.  In particular, the Chinese and Japanese came here and they could not get over how we were going to try to stop people smoking in public places.  If we began at one airport, perhaps Cork or Shannon, and then followed through to our main airport in Dublin, perhaps we could be world leaders in this regard as well.</P>
        <P>From a budget of approximately &euro;18 billion, some &euro;2 billion is spent each year from the health budget in this area.  I am certain this must bring pain to the heart of the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, because there are so many other stronger needs for the small resources at the disposal of the Minister for State.  I realise if the Department of Health and Children, the Minister and the Ministers of State had their way, there would be a doubling of the &euro;18 billion to look after everyone.  It must kill the Minister of State to see &euro;2 billion going on tobacco-related illnesses.</P>
        <P>We cannot take this issue off our agenda and this legislation affords us a chance to get the message across.  The last day I spoke on this matter I asked about the pictures on the back of cigarette cartons.  I note this will be introduced and I will be pleased when it takes place because perhaps it will shake up some of the young people when they see the evidence in dark, graphic photographs.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald regarding the damage second-hand smoke can do.  I note reports in the newspapers last week of a case highlighting the terrible damage done to a young child, a six year old, who had been exposed to second hand smoke from the time he was born.  He had lived in a small, confined apartment.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I refer to the issue of cigarette smuggling.  I realise the cancer control people were somewhat annoyed that the budget did not include an increase in the price of cigarettes.  Sometimes the adage, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re damned if you do and you&rsquo;re damned if you don&rsquo;t&rdquo; applies.  When we put up the price of cigarettes we encourage the black market and smugglers.  I know of people who go to Spain on a cheap flight and bring back any amount of cigarettes for their own consumption, although not to sell.  However, the black market will always invite smugglers.  As we have heard, these are not young people.  They are people openly making a living by dropping leaflets in doorways to advertise the sale of cigarettes and cheap alcohol.  I call on the Minister of State to keep an eye on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should do whatever we can and I believe people will work together to try to bring about a tobacco-free society.  We will be a better off race of people when we do so.  I look forward to the remainder of the Bill passing through the Houses.  It seems there are always young people in the Visitors Gallery when anything such as this is going through.  It cannot be empha<Col N="408"/>sised loudly enough that if one is not a smoker one should not start.  Those who smoke maintain it is the hardest thing to give up.</P>

      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is really a technical Bill but it has given us an opportunity which I am glad my colleagues have exploited perfectly correctly by putting on the record very serious issues concerning health and the machinations of the tobacco industry.  With some of them I agree and with some I disagree strongly.  I wish to set the scene by pointing out that 16 people per day in Ireland are killed as a result of the tobacco industry and smoking.  I use the term &ldquo;killed&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;die&rdquo; because this is quite deliberate and specific.  The tobacco industry has known for decades, since before it was publically announced, that there was a direct link between smoking and cancer.  It did everything it could to frustrate that research, to deny it and to use its financial wealth to prevent the public being alerted.  They amount to a criminal conspiracy, especially in the United States of America, against the health and welfare of the nation.</P>
        <P>I speak as a recovering smoker.  It was terribly silly to get rid of the packets of ten because that only forces people to buy packs of 20 and if one is a smoker one will smoke all 20 cigarettes.  Packs of ten make it easier for people to cut down.  It was an absurd thing and I was pleased to see a former candidate for this House and a very decent man, Dr. Maurice Gueret, write about this point in his column in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> recently.  I cheered inwardly when I read what he said.</P>
    
        <P>Up to 16 people a day, 50% of those who smoke, die from smoking related diseases such as heart disease and lung cancer.  The latter is a particularly unpleasant illness as I know from having seen several friends die from it.  More than 90% of lung cancers are preventable as they are caused by smoking.</P>
        <P>Those are matters which should cause us all to pause and think about the impact of this trade.  It is difficult to put the genie back in the bottle; there is no point trying to make smoking illegal.  There is a substantial point, however, in raising taxes on tobacco products and I am extremely disappointed no provision for an increase in taxes has been made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recommend the Minister of State and her officials examine the data about cigarette smuggling I included in the Official Report the last time this legislation was debated in the House.  The tobacco companies have been lobbying against tax increases and even have access to politicians in Leinster House.  They are squealing, claiming their profits are affected by smuggling.  I do not think so.  Their profits are being increased by smuggling. Not only that, I highlight a series of cases in the United States of America in which the companies were convicted of colluding with tobacco smugglers.  It is extraordinary to me how, on the one hand, they can be lobbying against it while criminally colluding, on the other, to the extent they are convicted in court and subsequently fined.  Can someone explain that to me?</P>
        
        <P>There will always be a profit for the tobacco companies whether they sell them through the black market or legitimate channels.  Smuggling ensures a supply of cheap cigarettes to keep the addiction going and wavering smokers on the hook.  Smuggled cigarettes seized by customs authorities have to be replaced to meet demand for the product, meaning the tobacco companies earn profits twice.  More importantly, it allows them to argue for reduced taxation because it is claimed taxes cannot be raised because of smuggling.  In Australia, however, the authorities raised the taxes successfully.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I urge the Minister of State to resist the argument made &ndash; I accept made in good faith &ndash; about smuggling.  Smuggling is a dark area and the tobacco companies are not immune from it.  I agree with my colleagues that the sale of illegally imported cigarettes is widespread.  I see it every day of the week in the centre of Dublin with trays and boxes of illegally imported cigarettes being sold on Henry Street, Mary Street, O&rsquo;Connell Street and O&rsquo;Connell Bridge.  I <Col N="409"/>do not approve of it but I also believe it does not affect tobacco companies&rsquo; sales.  I would be concerned if this was a matter that was taken into account in this context.</P>
        <P>This is a technical Bill that dissolves the Office of Tobacco Control and transfers its functions to the Health Service Executive.  I hope this is intended to provide efficiency.  In this case, it may well do so as the new agency will be in with other medical areas such as poisons and so forth.  I hope, however, this legislation will strengthen the impact of the organisation rather than weaken it.  Like my two preceding colleagues, we all want the practice of smoking discouraged.  I acknowledge Senator Feeney&rsquo;s point that it was a close relative of this Government that introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the smoking ban.  The previous Government, which was of a similar complexion to this one, introduced several good measures which I have never denied.  The smoking ban was remarkable and put Ireland to the forefront of world policy.  Ireland was the first state in the world to implement such a ban, a fact of which we should be very proud.  Not only that, we got away it.  At the time, it was believed the Irish people would not tolerate such a ban.  It was claimed their subversive streak would come out and the ban would be so substantially undermined that a mockery would be made of it.  That never happened.  The next thing, other countries were following Ireland&rsquo;s example.</P>
        <P>I hope through this debate we can encourage those involved in the Office of Tobacco Control to continue the same policies and be as successful as they have been in the past.  I assume there will be a specific dedicated unit in the general framework which will target tobacco consumption.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad I had the opportunity to highlight my suspicions of the tobacco industry and that tobacco smuggling is used by the industry to get into the political system.  It allows them to lobby while wringing their hands claiming it is dreadful they are being undermined by smuggling.  Such claims are rubbish.  It allows them to undermine the arguments for an increase in prices which is what will seriously inhibit smoking.</P>
        <P>It is exactly the same with the drinks industry.  The drinks industry is very powerful and needs to be watched as it too does not have the health interests of this country at heart.  An academic study should be carried out of the subliminal impact of its hypocritical blather in its advertisements about remembering to drink sensibly.  Its message when decoded says one will be a sexually potent, wonderful, beautiful and intelligent person, have the party of one&rsquo;s life and the more one drinks, the better it will be, but, PS, drink carefully.  If it is going to have that effect, why the hell would one drink carefully?  One would slosh it all down as hard as one could and have a real orgy of a good time.  That is the drinks industry&rsquo;s message.  They should not be allowed to get away with that hypocrisy like the tobacco industry has effected in penetrating the Houses of the Oireachtas with its deliberately false message.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris used very colourful language, on which I commend him.</P>
        <P>I welcome the correct approach taken in the Bill not to merge the Food Safety Authority of Ireland or the Irish Medicines Board with the Office of Tobacco Control, as those organisations <Col N="410"/>have specific remits.  Bringing the office into the Health Service Executive allows us added value and will improve the health aspects of tobacco.</P>
        <P>Unlike certain other Senators, I would be one of those described as a goody-goody as I have never smoked in my life.  When I was a student in London I worked in a pub at one stage where I found passive smoking to be appalling.  After a night&rsquo;s work, I went home and coughed my lungs up.  It was disgusting and was nothing to do with me smoking but with others.</P>
        <P>As many Senators said, the success of the smoking ban is not only to the credit of the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, but also to the Government of the day.  More than anything, however, it is to the credit of the people.  The initiative has had a great impact and is now being copied all over the world.  Therefore, we do get some things right in this country.  Unfortunately, however, our financial difficulties are also being copied all over the world.</P>
        <P>I wish to expand on a specific point made by Senator Norris.  He said he was disappointed that there had not been an increase in the tax rate on cigarettes in this or the last budget.  I completely concur with him &mdash; there should have been an increase in the tax rate on tobacco in the last two budgets.</P>
        <P>There seems to be an anomaly in how the rate of inflation is calculated.  An increase in the price of tobacco products seems to skew the rate of inflation over and above the expenditure involved.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this point because we should be able to raise the price of cigarettes without it having such an effect on the rate of inflation.  This objective should be achievable.</P>
        <P>Any impediment in raising the tax rate on tobacco should be removed because such a tax has a beneficial effect.  Poverty is frequently raised as an issue in arguments about the price of tobacco.  Cigarette smoking is addictive and traditionally many in poorer areas smoke.  A measure similar to the carbon tax is needed, whereby any revenue raised by an increase in the tax rate on tobacco could be used to promote programmes and products to help people to quit smoking.  As people commonly want to quit smoking, they should be provided with products such as nicotine patches to help them to do so.  An increased tax rate on cigarettes could raise funding to finance such initiatives.</P>
        <P>Cigarette smuggling is becoming a big issue, but why are people being allowed to sell illegal cigarettes on O&rsquo;Connell Bridge?  Such activity should not be tolerated.  People may say it is not an issue for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but I ask the Minister of State to explore the possibility of using unemployed persons to police the problem as community wardens.  Local authority employees could also act to stop the illegal sale of cigarettes.  It should not be necessary to arrest people, but we must control cigarette smuggling which cannot be tolerated.</P>
        <P>Huge numbers of cigarettes are being imported illegally in container ships.  This problem needs to be dealt with at the point of importation, but we have a land border with Northern Ireland and it is very easy to import and export illegal cigarettes via that route.  It is also difficult to prevent illegal cigarettes being imported through small ports and harbours smuggled aboard ships or small boats in some cases.  We must do what we can in policing the problem.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald was right to indicate the linkage between cigarette smuggling and the importation of other illicit drugs.  It is crucial that this problem is policed.</P>
        <P>Not all of these points relate to the Bill, but we do not receive too many opportunities to discuss the issue of tobacco control.  This country would be a much better place in which to live if we could reduce further the level of tobacco consumption.  While I do not want to be too prescriptive about the culture that has developed outside pubs with the provision of heated outdoor facilities, it is necessary to ensure the smoking ban is adhered to.  We should not consider that the indoor smoking ban in public places is complete.  We should keep tightening <Col N="411"/>the regulations on where people can and cannot smoke.  Smoking is an anti-social exercise that belonged to the 19th century, not the modern age.  The country would be a healthier place in which to live if we could cut back as much as possible on the level of tobacco consumption.  I would like to see the day when smoking will go out of fashion and people will look on it as something that was done in the Dark Ages.  I hope that will happen because the benefits associated with smoking are nil, whereas the problems associated with it are widespread.  I reiterate Senator Feeney&rsquo;s plea to younger people not to start smoking because it is not cool to smoke.  Most older people who got hooked on it in their youth find it very difficult to quit, even if they want to do so.</P>
        <P>Senators have made responsible contributions to this debate.  It is important that there is unanimous support for the legislation and that we ensure it is passed.  I again thank the Minister of State for bringing it before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions on and their support for this measure, which I greatly appreciate.  I also endorse and acknowledge the wonderful work done by the Office of Tobacco Control which is located in my constituency in Millennium Park in Naas.  </P>
        <P>I agree with Senators that we need to reduce the numbers who smoke, particularly among young people.  Whenever I visit schools, I use the outreach programme to discuss the issue with students.  I encourage young people not to smoke because we all know how difficult it is to stop.  All of the legislation introduced to date will reduce the prevalence of smoking among young people.  It should be acknowledged that while almost 50% of the adult population smoked in the 1970s, this figure has been considerably reduced to almost 30%.</P>
        <P>According to the Revenue Commissioners, it is difficult to determine the level of cigarette consumption in Ireland, as is the case in any other country.  We must take account of the fact that no excise duty is paid on many cigarettes owing to the level of consumption of untaxed products, whether legitimately or illegally acquired.  Low-cost air travel, an increased number of trips abroad and cross-Border purchases provide people with an opportunity to obtain cheaper cigarettes outside the State.</P>
        <P>Many Senators referred to the issue of smuggling, extent of which is illustrated by the growth in the number of seizures made by the Revenue Commissioners.  They include the seizure of almost 30 million cigarettes found on one ship in Dublin Port.  I have been assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they will continue to implement a wide-ranging programme of measures to combat this threat.  The programmes includes continuing seizures of illegal products, prosecuting offenders, monitoring Internet sites, instigating test purchases to identify importation routes, monitoring sales patterns to identify and investigate irregularities and targeting enforcement activity.  In addition, we contribute to actions taken at EU level to improve controls on excisable products in the Community, as well as monitoring sea cargoes on the basis of a risk analysis and seizures.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney referred to tobacco product advertising at Manchester airport.  Such advertising at Irish airports has been severely curtailed since 1 July 2009.  Since that date, only one image of each product sold can be displayed at the point of sale.  This has been beneficial to those trying to give up cigarettes.  When people are out for a drink, that they cannot see the product is a help.  The price of cigarettes in Ireland is the highest in the world.</P>
        <P>The recently published HSE tobacco control framework will build on the comprehensive tobacco control legislation now in place.  It will ensure the positive work undertaken by the Office of Tobacco Control in implementing the legislation will be combined with the health promotion function and cessation programmes, with the ultimate objective of having a tobacco-<Col N="412"/>free society.  That remains my objective and that of the Government and all Members of the Houses.</P>

	<P el="10">Will the Minister of State give some indication of how the transfer will take place and how the work of the Office of Tobacco Control will be integrated in the HSE?  Will it be a separate section with the same personnel and director?</P>
        <P>Regarding the approach taken in the budget, which is relevant, research by the Office of Tobacco Control has always suggested price is the key determinant of whether people stop smoking.  I appreciate, as the Minister of State says, that the price of cigarettes in Ireland is the highest in the world.  However, if price is the main deterrent, why was there no increase in the budget?  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in that the rate of inflation is a factor.  Was there lobbying by the tobacco industry and how much did it use the argument about smuggling to deter the Government from announcing an increase?  It would be helpful if the Minister of State informed us of the Government&rsquo;s attitude and thinking because it is relevant.  We are talking about prevention, the work of the Office of Tobacco Control and how it will be continued in its new incarnation in the HSE.  At the time this is happening, the key action &mdash; increasing the price of cigarettes &mdash; was not taken in the budget.  This is a relevant point to raise in the discussion of this section.</P>

	<P>Section 3 refers to the transfer of functions and provides for the preparation and implementation of the plan for the national co-ordination of the activities of the Office of Tobacco Control and the HSE in respect of the Bill.  It provides that the office shall establish a body, to be known as the Tobacco Free Council, which was never established by it.  Its role was to be available to the office for consultation.  Having regard to the fact that the Office of Tobacco Control is to be merged with the HSE and in the broader context of greater streamlining of structures, the proposed role of the Tobacco Free Council can be incorporated in an advisory panel and may be established now.</P>
        <P>Section 15 of the Health Act 2004 provides for the HSE board to establish committees to assist in the performance of its functions.  Section 44 of the Act provides that the Minister may direct the executive to establish an advisory panel for a specific purpose.  Between the Department of Health and Children, the Office of Tobacco Control and the HSE, there has been a high level steering group established to oversee the merger.  Three staff of the Office of Tobacco Control and a sum of &euro;1.5 million will be transferred to the HSE.  All of the core functions will be transferred.</P>
        <P>The question of a price increase mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald is a matter for the Department of Finance.  As Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion, I was lobbied by ASH Ireland and the Irish Cancer Society and passed on their representations.  At a recent press conference the Minister for Health and Children referred to research on price which was passed on to the Minister for Finance.</P>

The exceptions include the functions of preparation and implementation of a plan for the co-ordination nationally of the activities of the office and HSE in respect of the Act.

	<P>When the Office of Tobacco Control had a separate office, the key priority was its specific remit.  It is critical that the remit of the office is retained despite the fact that the office will be integrated.  What assurances can the Minister of State provide to the House that its remit will be retained?  What priority is the issue receiving at the moment?  We can see the work that has been done.  This country has been a world leader in tobacco control.  Where does the Minister of State envisage the strategy going in terms of outcome and research on the number of people who are smoking, especially given the prevalence of smoking among young women who are taking up smoking and who continue to smoke?  What does the research indicate should be our focus?  I have outlined a few areas that should be a priority.  It would be helpful to the House if the Minister of State were to outline where the issue stands on her list of priorities and what action she intends taking or has taken.  Where does tobacco control stand among the health promotion priorities in the country?</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s concern.  The office is being subsumed into the Health Service Executive and she is afraid it will be lost.  I have met staff of the Office of Tobacco Control on many occasions.  They are very committed.  The chairperson has now welcomed the move.  Initially, there was concern along the lines expressed by Senator Fitzgerald, which I shared, that the office could be lost.  The staff are happy and they have been assured of my full support in the continuance of their good work.  The issue is a high priority for me.  We will see success based on the initiatives that have been introduced.  I feel strongly about the issue and I have used all possible opportunities to engage with younger people, rather than lecture them, on what they consider works well in terms of helping them not to start smoking in the first place and to give it up if they have started.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 16, to delete lines 22 to 28 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) The procedures referred to in <i>subsection (1) </i>shall include the opportunity for interested persons, including representatives of postal service providers and postal service users and organisations representative of employees of postal service providers, to make representations on the matter, the subject of the consultation process concerned, to the Commission in such form and within such reasonable period as the Commission may specify generally or by reference to the consultation process concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">This amendment arises from last week&rsquo;s discussions on the need to include a reference to trade unions in section 15, which requires ComReg to set out its public consultation procedures.  While it was never the intention, nor was it the effect of the section as drafted, that anyone, including staff representative bodies, would be excluded from any public consultation, we explored this issue with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  An amendment has been drafted to give effect to the Senators&rsquo; proposal.  Section 15(2) requires that ComReg&rsquo;s procedures will afford interested parties the opportunity to make representations on the matter that is the subject of the consultation.  The proposed amendment includes organisations representative of employees of postal service providers among those listed as examples of interested persons for this purpose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, draftspersons and advisers for responding so positively.  As the Minister of State mentioned, I tabled an amendment to include the term &ldquo;trade unions&rdquo;.  Draftspersons are horrified by that term.  They find it distasteful and have great difficulty using it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>And the term &ldquo;public representatives&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have needed to concede this point a number of times.  They do not find the term &ldquo;trade unions&rdquo; amenable.</P>
        <P>On a more serious point, the staff unions were concerned about their apparent exclusion while everyone else seemed to have been remembered.  Will the Minister of State convey this point?  I am grateful for the positive response, which deals with my issue completely, but it is also important that people consider how partnership operates.  I am not necessarily referring to social partnership.  For years, we have spent money developing partnerships.  We are trying to create an innovative knowledge-based society, one in which workers are being told to bring their brains to work.  If they are doing that, we want to be able to use and focus their knowledge.  This is the case in every sector, not just the postal sector.  I have made the same remark in respect of the Civil Service, in that civil servants are often ignored in large transformational processes.  Bosses seem to believe they know all.  Wisdom is not concentrated in any one place.  It tends to emerge from all sorts of experiences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This should not come down to having a proposal box in a corner.  Instead, people should be engaged with and have their opinions, concerns etc. heard.  The Minister of State must know this.  Just this morning, I received a telephone call from someone in a hospital department wherein there will be a major transformational change.  That person read about the change in the newspapers.  He was not opposed to whatever the change might bring, but he will now spend a sleepless weekend because he does not know what the change will be.  Often, that people are not being asked leads to problems.  Let us anticipate the problems in advance and <Col N="417"/>deal with them. This is a long-winded way for me to say the amendment is important.  I fully support it.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Government amendment, which improves the legislation somewhat.  It effectively includes trade unions without referring to them as such.  I have a concern, although I am unsure whether Senator O&rsquo;Toole shares it.  The amendment reads &ldquo;organisations representative of employees&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;organisations representing employees&rdquo;.  I am not sure what the other interpretations of this provision might be, but I will take my lead from Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who is shaking his head.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join in the welcome for the Government amendment as a co-sponsor of the initial amendment alongside Senator O&rsquo;Toole and having spoken on the issue on Second and Committee Stages in the belief that the unions should be part of any consultative process, public or otherwise, as important stakeholders.  I would have preferred the explicit use of the word &ldquo;union&rdquo; and I see no reason it should not be the case, but I welcome the amendment as achieving the same objective.  I am not sufficiently expert in linguistic nuances to know the implications of Senator Ryan&rsquo;s concerns, but I am prepared to support him in his comments.  His proposal is worth consideration, as it would specifically give workers&rsquo; representatives a voice.  I shall leave it at that, but I welcome it in that it is achieving one of our objectives.  As I have said repeatedly, our sole objective is to shape this legislation in a fashion that maintains the integrity, quality and strength of the existing service and personnel.  This is a step in the right direction, but many more will be needed as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the language used in the amendment was based on advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, which had been advised of the Senators&rsquo; concerns, and we believe it fully represents the views expressed.  I hope that is clear.  We are talking about semantics here, but I believe it fully addresses Senators&rsquo; concerns.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 2 in the names of Senators McCarthy, Alex White, Ryan, Prendergast, Bacik and Hannigan arises out of Committee Stage proceedings. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 21, to delete lines 18 to 23 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) the terms and conditions, excluding those specifying the amount of the charges, in accordance with which a postal service user may avail of the postal services concerned,<?oasys _jy ?>and&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Our proposal is to delete sections 19(2)(<i>a</i>) and 19(2)(<i>b</i>) and include the amendment as proposed. This stems from comments made by the Minister in the Seanad on 24 November to the effect that a price control mechanism was intended.  It seems that it cannot be the intention to have charges approved by ComReg in advance and to have a price control mechanism.  Therefore, I am interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in that regard.</P>

	<P>I second amendment No. 2. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not proposed to accept this amendment.  Its effect would be to remove the need for An Post or any designated universal postal service provider to notify ComReg of its tariffs or changes thereto.  Tariffs are an integral part of universal postal service providers&rsquo; terms and conditions.</P><Col N="418"/>
        <P>In the context of safeguarding the interests of users, the general terms and conditions, including the terms and procedures for dealing with consumers, under which An Post as a designated universal postal service provider, or any other designated provider, provides universal services, must be approved by ComReg.  Charges for postal services not within the scope of universal service are not subject to ComReg&rsquo;s oversight.</P>
        <P>In addition, Recital (34) of the first postal services directive states that Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts applies to postal services.  Oversight by ComReg gives the operator a practicable defence to any claims that even where its terms and conditions are not negotiated with its consumers, they are unfair and therefore unenforceable.  Such protection is especially needed where users have no bargaining power.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 3 in the names of Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and Cummins arises out of Committee Stage proceedings. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 29, to delete lines 24 to 28 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;28.&mdash;(1) A postal service provider has the right to enter into negotiations with a universal service provider with a view to concluding an agreement with that provider to access the postal network of the universal service provider up to the inward mail centre and may serve notice.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The legislation places no specific limit on where network access should begin.  The current postal network is built around four mail centres, with Government support over the years.  As I have said previously on Second and Committee Stages, &euro;100 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been spent on automation in those four centres.  An Post is now ranked as the seventh most efficient postal operator out of 27 EU countries.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that access should not be permitted below the mail centre level.  This protects the collection and delivery model that aims to serve all addresses at all locations, maximises the efficiencies provided by hi-tech equipment and ensures adequate volumes in the system.  In other words its objective is to ensure that an independent or private service provide cannot enter the marketplace at a lower level than the four automated centres so as to ensure a level playing pitch for An Post and guard against cherrypicking.</P>
        <P>A competitor might negotiate a price lower than An Post, put it into a town and have it delivered at that level.  We are trying to prevent it going in at the lower level.  Everything we are doing in this legislation with these amendments is aimed at protecting the universal postal service and its quality along with the 2,000 jobs that are at stake, which must now be at a premium.  This is a reasonable amendment, which allows for the directive to be implemented, along with free trade and competition, while not allowing the structure of An Post as it has been built up over the years to become an unfair victim of competition.</P>
        <P>I shall not be argumentative as regards the wording.  If the Minister of State proposes to change it, that will not be an issue.  The objective is to achieve the principle of fair play and to maintain the integrity and quality of An Post.  We have a great national service and workforce.  At ground level our post men and women throughout Ireland are exemplary, providing a great social service and facilitating crucial human contact at local level.  These are great people of whom we are proud, and I include the sorters and personnel within the offices.  I want to preserve those people <i>in situ</i> while at the same time achieving the objectives of the directive.</P><Col N="419"/>
        <P>Our attitude towards every EU directive should not be too cap in hand, and we should not take them too literally.  We have this tendency in that we almost have to go beyond the terms of a directive in effecting its implementation.  We can be nearly more penal than what is intended in the directive, and therefore I ask the Minister of State to see reason on this.  I am totally open to the manner in which she does it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. </P>
        <P>We are just trying to avoid a race to the bottom.  We want to ensure that what has happened in other places does not happen to the Irish postal service in the effort to undercut everybody.  We want to ensure we get efficiency and quality as well as good value.  We are talking about value for money here, but we do not want to see advertisements for half the rates the people doing the job at the moment are getting, with people queuing up for these jobs.  In the event quality is lost as regards a postal job, it ceases to be a career and the incumbent is no longer a focal point and pillar of the community, while all that is achieved, perhaps, is a greater saving in costs.  There is an assumption that those costs will benefit the consumer.  That was the assumption behind the privatisation of Eircom and what we finished up with was a couple of dozen extra millionaires.  That is always a difficulty.</P>
        <P>I know ComReg will be insisting on quality and I do not say this lightly, but there is only so much that can be done.  We have seen many areas of work in this country that have simply become places through which people just pass, without seeing any career opportunities.  The question is whether we want to ensure this area is seen to provide a real career opportunity, where people want to develop the service and see it improving, or just a place to work while they are looking around for a better job.  That is what happens if one just creates a yellow pack career structure where people are simply taken on at a minimum wage and kept for as long as possible until they get a job somewhere else.  In the event, the employer is losing out on the quality of the people he or she is employing.</P>
        <P>I have heard this argument before, where people question how much quality is needed.  The reality is that intelligent, bright and well-qualified people are needed in every job.  I want to ensure we are not just going down the wrong road in a race to the bottom.  We have seen this happen in other places and it does not improve the quality of life for anybody.  All it does is increase the profits for whoever is running the operation.  Eircom is the best example I can think of.  Just reflect on how many times it has been sold in the last ten years, and how much money it made for everybody along the way.  The first time it was sold for &euro;250 million and we did not even get capital gains tax from this.  That is the law of the land and I am only using this as a reference point.  When we were doing that I recall standing here and making the same speech.  I remember asking about who was going to bring broadband to Belmullet.  This was before the advent of Corrib gas.  It was not going to be worth anyone&rsquo;s while, and I remember saying at the time that Sir Anthony O&rsquo;Reilly would not do it.</P>
        <P>We are transposing a European directive, the general thrust of which I support despite that in many ways the legislation goes against the grain for me.  However, I recognise where we are at.  I welcome competition in the public sector, which should be in place to make it work properly.  However, what I want is not competition at any price but competition based on fairness, quality, career, good value and community reference points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not proposed to accept this amendment.  Section 28 places an emphasis on access being granted following commercial negotiations between a universal postal service provider and another postal service provider.  Where an agreement cannot be reached, ComReg may resolve the issue and may impose certain terms and conditions in relation to access.  Section 28 sets out ComReg&rsquo;s role in this context and the issues to which it must have regard, including the need to ensure and maintain the efficient provision of the universal service, the reasonableness of the access request and network costs incurred in grant<Col N="420"/>ing access.  It is not appropriate to legislate for where access should be granted and the precise terms under which it is granted.  To do so, could potentially be restrictive and it is not possible to predict future work arrangements of postal service providers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  We do not believe there is sufficient protection in the legislation to provide for a level playing pitch.  The legislation is too ambiguous and open to different interpretations.  There is also too much of an assumption underlying this legislation that An Post, while it will expand and take on new roles and services and so on, will discover a crock of gold or new business model at the end of the rainbow.  As eloquently put by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, we are anxious to preserve jobs and a level playing pitch.  We accept the directive and have been particularly constructive in our approach to it because we accept the legal requirement to implement it.  It is a shocking state of affairs, however, if in this process we throw out the baby with the bath water, which is effectively what we are doing.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to reconsider and accept the amendment.  If not, we will have to press it.  The legislation in this regard is unacceptable, in particular to the workers.  There is too much at stake.  We have put too much into An Post as a national enterprise, in terms of taxpayers&rsquo; money and human effort, to throw it to the winds.  It is bad practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for his heartfelt input on the amendment.   The Senator will be aware that the postal service is undergoing significant change and must evolve to ensure it meets the needs of its users.  An Post may make commercial decisions in the future as to how it should configure its network to meet its obligations and best serve the needs of its users.  The challenge for An Post is to recognise the need to re-evaluate its relationship with customers and competitors alike.  It must explore its potential through competitive partnerships with rival postal service providers and ensure it remains the postal delivery company of choice for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s suggested amendment to this section, the Minister has agreed to make this amendment for clarification purposes.  Subsection(9) provides that ComReg, in making a decision on the price of access to the postal network of a universal postal service provider, should take into account any network costs involved in granting such access.  The amendment makes it clear that the network costs referred to are those of the postal network of a universal postal service provider.</P>

	<P>I co-sponsored the amendment with Senator O&rsquo;Toole who asked me before he left the House to express his appreciation to the Minister for accepting the amendment.  The objective is to prevent a private service provider coming in to cherry-pick areas, enter the market at an unreasonable cost level and prejudice An Post and its operation.

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 31, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;30.&mdash;A postal service provider that operates a post office shall not close the post office (other than for a temporary purpose) without the consent, by reserved function, of the local authority in which the post office is situate.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The amendments attempt to limit the closure of post offices and post boxes, to recognise that post offices have been closed solely on a commercial basis with no account being taken of their social value and to provide for a consultation process when closures are proposed.  We had a long debate on this issue on Committee Stage and there was support throughout the House for the amendments.  However, they were rejected by the Minister.  I asked him to reconsider them to see if he could come up with something for Report Stage. I have retabled both of them.  I am not suggesting the wording represents the only way to deal with this.  I would be happy if the Minister of State said the Government wanted to take the spirit of the amendments into account when the Bill goes before the D&aacute;il, and might introduce some mechanism to deal with this and recognise that the people do not want our post offices to be closed purely on a commercial basis.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally second the amendment which I strongly support.  If we were to apply solely commercial criteria to the maintenance or otherwise of rural post offices, we would have two to three post offices in an average county.  This cannot be the case.  I support the effort to put a legislative imperative into the Bill to prevent this being the case in the future.  We have all attended the public meetings and witnessed the closure of a local post office.  We all know it is, effectively, the death-knell of a community and how traumatic it can be for a local community.  We have seen the rationalisation of schools, the reduction of Garda stations and the closure of post offices.  Even outlet post boxes dotted around the place mean <Col N="422"/>so much to people in isolated communities.  Older people who are not in a position to drive and want access to their post need these facilities.</P>
        <P>There must be positive discrimination involved.  We cannot let everything out to the free markets.  We have to preserve certain things.  Throughout the debate on the Bill, we have been trying to preserve the universal service obligation, as well as the State&rsquo;s investment.  I support Senator Ryan in preserving the rural post office network and post boxes around the country.  They are such a part of our infrastructure, and not only in the countryside, but also in villages, towns and on the fringes of our big cities.  We cannot have people coming from Balbriggan and Skerries into the GPO on a daily basis.  Some common sense and compassion must be applied.</P>
        <P>We must decide what our priorities are as a society and what we value.  If we are to turn the entire country into an economy, with no social dimension, it will be a sad and bleak place.  I urge the Minister of State even just to come back with an alternative wording to achieve this objective.  It is a worthy objective and it is hardly one that anyone could reasonably disagree with.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In respect of amendment No. 5, the opening, closing or maintenance of postal infrastructure, such as post offices, are commercial matters for the management of the postal service provider concerned.  The provision of post offices is not affected by the directive and the requirement to open postal services to competition.  An Post&rsquo;s responsibility, pursuant to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, to provide counter services for the company&rsquo;s own and Government business is not being amended by the Bill.  The vast majority of post offices are operated by postmasters under commercial contracts with An Post.  The closure of individual post offices is a contractual matter between An Post and the individual postmaster in question.  Post offices are only closed when An Post has been unsuccessful in recruiting a postmaster to fill a particular vacancy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not proposed to accept amendment No. 6, which relates to the closure of a post box or similar access point.  In respect of a designated universal service provider, section 16(10) of the Bill provides that ComReg may, following a public consultation process, direct such a provider for the purpose of ensuring that the density of access points and the provision of points of contact for users with the universal postal service provider, take account of the reasonable needs of postal service users.  ComReg already has this direction making power under the current regulations and section 16(10) restates this in primary legislation. For commercial postal service providers other than the designated universal postal service provider, establishing or removing access points to their networks are purely commercial decisions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I asked the Minister of State to concede that she would go back to the Minister to see if something else could be done.  I do not necessarily accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that the post office only closes when An Post cannot get an alternative operator.  The evidence I have received is to the contrary, but I will not argue that now because I have not got specific examples.  However, I do not think that is true. I am asking the Minister of State to take this back and see if the Minister could consider some way of dealing with the spirit of what we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter.  In view of the cost of not dealing with the smuggling and counterfeiting of tobacco products, it is important that we take it seriously.  When I was a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, we published an important report on the tobacco industry.  It was clear from the research we had done that tobacco was causing many thousands of deaths in Ireland due to both smoking and passive smoking.  If there was this number of deaths as a result of road crashes or something else visible, we would be dealing with the matter much more seriously.  Because people are dying of cancer and other factors may be assumed, the effect of tobacco may not be clearly seen, but medical evidence suggests smoking is a key problem in terms of the numbers who are dying, directly and indirectly, due to it.  That is why one of the recommendations made by the committee was that the Government continue to increase the cost of cigarettes.  The only thing that has been proved to work is setting the cost of cigarettes so high that people cannot afford to smoke.  Many people who smoke are in socially disadvantaged categories and the more the cost of cigarettes is increased, the fewer people will smoke.  It is tough love, if one wants to put it that way.</P>
        <P>The argument has been made that we should not increase the cost of tobacco products &mdash; as happened this week in the budget &mdash; because so many cheaper brands of cigarettes are coming onto the market and the illegal trade is thriving.  I do not accept that argument.  In view of the cost to the health service and the threat to people&rsquo;s lives, it is not good enough to avoid increasing the price for fear of increased smuggling.  We must deal with smuggling.  I am asking the Minister to review the provisions on cigarette smuggling and consider how we can sting those involved in this trade.</P>
        <P>There are two types of illegal cigarette: contraband and counterfeit.  One is the genuine article &mdash; cigarettes bought in other countries at a cheaper price and sold here at a higher price &mdash; while the other is something that is not necessarily a cigarette as we would know it.  We all know that arsenic and other poisons are found in cigarettes, but, according to last week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, counterfeit cigarettes can contain three times the amount of lead and twice the amount of arsenic in legal cigarettes.  This is appalling.  What is going on is certainly manslaughter and perhaps even murder.  People are selling things that they know are placing people&rsquo;s lives at risk, yet, according to the programme, a person caught with 13,000 illegal cigarettes was fined 13 cent by the courts.  This is not a deterrent by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
        <P>This is an issue that is relevant to the Departments of Justice and Law Reform, Finance, and Health and Children, but if each Department is dealing with the problem separately, we are not doing the people a service.  It is vital that we take on this challenge.  Those involved in this industry must know it is not acceptable and that they will be dealt with severely.</P>
        <P>What scared me most was that I was aware of all the things I mentioned but not of the involvement of organised crime.  This trade is now one of the easiest ways for paramilitaries and others to make sure they gain a substantial reward from their activities.  Dealing with this must be a priority for the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  I am not saying it will be easy because there is free movement throughout Europe and cigarettes are sold at much lower prices in many countries.  If we cannot deal with this issue nationally &mdash; although I would like it to be dealt with nationally &mdash; we should be fighting this trade internationally.  We must encourage other countries to raise their prices to deal with the problem.  We must take a broader approach to the issue.</P><Col N="425"/>
        <P Just="Left">I could outline many more aspects of this matter as I, unfortunately, know the subject upside down and inside out.  It is vital that the Government does not avoid putting up the price of cigarettes because of the illegal cigarette trade.  We cannot throw our hands in the air and do nothing about it.  We have instruments of State at our disposal, which we must use both nationally and internationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who welcomes the opportunity to clarify the penalty system for those involved in the illegal importation of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes.</P>
        <P>Cigarette smuggling has serious adverse implications for Government revenues and the measures adopted in recent years to protect public health by reducing smoking.  The Government is committed to tackling this illicit trade and ensuring those involved in it are detected and punished.  Combating cigarette smuggling is a priority for the Revenue Commissioners which employs a multi-faceted strategy to deal with the problem.  This includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem; the sharing of intelligence on a national, EU and international basis; ongoing review of operational policies; development of analytics; deployment of detection technologies such as scanners, and optimum deployment of resources, both at points of importation and within the country, to intercept the smuggled product and detect and prosecute those involved.</P>
        <P>An illustration of what this means in practice is the nationwide tobacco operation launched by the Revenue Commissioners in July which concentrated additional resources at ports, airports and various retail points to identify illicit tobacco products.  This led to 561 seizures, totalling almost 14 million cigarettes, in a two-week period.  A further intensive operation of this kind has recently taken place and more are planned.  These intensive operations complement the normal ongoing level of detection and enforcement activities.  A high level internal group in the Revenue Commissioners, chaired at commissioner level, works to ensure performance in tackling this illegal trade is optimised.</P>
        <P>It is essential that this important work is underpinned by a scheme of penalties that ensures those prosecuted and convicted of tobacco-related offences can be punished in a way that reflects the seriousness of their actions.  The Department of Finance, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, keeps the penalties that apply to these offences under review on an ongoing basis.  Substantially increased penalties were introduced in the Finance Act 2010.  The principal provision under which tobacco-related prosecutions are taken is section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, as amended, dealing with the evasion or attempted evasion of excise duty.  Following the stronger penalties introduced in the Finance Act 2010, where a person is convicted following prosecution on indictment, the Circuit Court can impose a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970.  However, if the value of the goods involved in the offence is greater than &euro;250,000, the court can impose a fine not exceeding three times their value.  If, for example, the goods concerned were valued at &euro;300,000, it would be open to the judge to impose a fine of up to &euro;900,000.  The section also provides for imprisonment for a term of up to five years which can be imposed either instead of or in addition to a fine.  It also allows for summary prosecution in the District Court.  In that event, a fine of &euro;5,000 can be imposed on conviction.  There is provision also for a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Certain tobacco-related offences, specifically those relating to breaches of tobacco stamp requirements, fall to be prosecuted under section 78 of the Finance Act 2005.  In these cases a person convicted on prosecution on indictment can be fined up to &euro;126,970.  There is provision also for a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years.  The penalties on summary conviction are the same as those under section 119 of the 2001 Act.  There is also a procedure under which prosecutions taken on indictment can be dealt with summarily, in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act 1967, where the accused person pleads guilty and the Director of Public Pros<Col N="426"/>ecutions consents.  Following the changes introduced by the Finance Act 2010, the court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000 in such cases and may also imprison the convicted person for a term not exceeding 12 months. The Minister is satisfied, therefore, that the revised fines introduced in the 2010 Finance Act allow for the imposition of penalties commensurate with the seriousness of the offences connected with smuggling and trading of illicit cigarettes and other tobacco products.  While he does not consider that any further increase in the level of the fines is required, the situation will be reviewed regularly.</P>

        <P>Senators will appreciate that the punishment to be imposed in a particular case is a matter for the courts, having regard to all the relevant circumstances.  There have been 128 convictions to the end of November this year, of which a total of 90 were for smuggling and the total amount of fines imposed was &euro;45,780.  The other 38 convictions were in respect of the selling of unstamped tobacco products and, in total, fines of &euro;103,250 were imposed.  In addition, 20 terms of imprisonment were imposed, 12 of which were suspended.</P>
        <P>In addition to the various penalties the courts may impose, the Revenue Commissioners may seize any illicit cigarettes detected.  To the end of last month, more than 167 million cigarettes, with an estimated retail value of in excess of &euro;70 million, have been seized this year.  Revenue is also empowered to seize vehicles used to convey illicit cigarettes and 122 vehicles had been seized up to the end of November.  As I have outlined, the level of penalties in the legislation is strong; however, the average level of penalties being imposed is considerably lower than that provided for in law.</P>
        <P>The Minister trusts that the information provided will help to clarify the position on the level of penalties provided for for the smuggling of cigarettes and the illegal sale of tobacco products.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The kernel of the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply is the second last paragraph which reads, &ldquo;the level of penalties in the legislation is strong; however, the average level of penalties being imposed is considerably lower than that provided for in law.&rdquo;  I am unsure how we can get the message across because we are not supposed to link the legal and political systems, but if anyone is listening, I would like to think this could be done.  </P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State ask the Department to come back to me on another matter?  Today we transferred the Office of Tobacco Control to the HSE.  I like to believe the Departments of Justice and Law Reform, Finance and Health and Children work together in detecting not only the big operators but also those who come in with multiple suitcases full of goods which are certainly not for their own consumption.  Perhaps the issue of what constitutes personal consumption should be dealt with at European level because people are obviously trading and travelling to and from continental Europe daily.</P>
