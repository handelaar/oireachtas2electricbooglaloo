	<P Just="Left">In the run-up to the budget we have heard a lot about how we protect the elderly and the services the country provides for them.  That is critical and it acquires a particular significance given the shortage of resources.  It is not just about making decisions at election time; it also concerns how the State reacts in providing services for the elderly on an ongoing basis.  The lead letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> today is from Professor Desmond O&rsquo;Neill who works with the elderly and chaired the Government&rsquo;s working group on the report, Protecting Our Future.  He makes a point relevant to the financial crisis.  During the period in which he chaired the group he repeatedly asked financial institutions and the Department of Finance to provide a member of staff to be part of the group, but the Government continually refused.  He says the country has failed to stay on top of the financial abuse of older people by financial institutions.  He is extraordinarily disappointed and the group disbanded not having received a proper response from the financial institutions to a topic of major national and international significance.  The financial abuse of elderly people by financial institutions is a major issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is extremely disappointing that the report of the Ombudsman makes the same point about how the elderly have been treated by the State.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister come to the House to discuss the report, because it raises very important issues about the role of the Ombudsman who says no Ombudsman has ever been treated the way she has been treated by the Department of Health and Children and the Minister.  Those who saw the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night will have seen what she had to say about the matter.  If one goes through the summary of the report, it is an indictment of Government policy and the way her role has been dealt with.  It raises the most serious issues.</P>
        <P>That is not to say we are not in a crisis in terms of funding services for the elderly; we are.  It is an indictment of Government if it cannot tolerate an independent person examining the situation, reporting it and raising questions.  We have reached quite an extraordinary situation in terms of independent reports and the attitude of the Government to them.  I want the Minister to come to the House today in order that we can have a discussion on the report and the wider issues it raises about nursing home care for the elderly.  More than 1,000 complaints were received, albeit over a 25-year period.  The report raises the most serious issues about how we approach residential care for the elderly in this country, the kind of decisions that have been taken and the inequities that were built into those decisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very important week in European history.  In most of the countries of western Europe there is a remarkable memory spreagtha on 11 November each year.  I made this point some years ago in the Seanad and I raise it again.  We in this House showed a lot of support for the Shot at Dawn campaign.  We have shown a lot of support over the years for what has happened in our history.  Many Irish people went to fight in the Great War, the First World War.  Some of them went to fight because they believed in what was being protected and what needed to be protected.  Others went to put bread on the table for their families.  Still others went because they were inspired by the political leadership at the time which asked them to do so.  Some great people such as Tom Kettle and others laid down their lives on that occasion.  We have been afraid to remember or deal with that.  In effect, we have eradicated and erased them from our history and folk memory.  We have been remiss at all times and in total denial.</P>
        <P>I do not suggest that we buy in to the Poppy Day in Britain but if we do not do that, I suggest we should have a poppy of our own or that we should remember in some other appropriate fashion Irish people who died in the Great War.  We should not be afraid to face up to our history and to honour people who died in a good cause.  Perhaps a Minister of State with responsibility for protocol in the Department of the Taoiseach could come to the House to <Col N="571"/>explain why we cannot do this and why we do not consider it important to remember those people.  It is still a significant issue three or four generations later to the families of those who died at that time, as we found out during the Shot at Dawn campaign.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I raised the Croke Park agreement.  I do not completely support the points raised by my colleague, Senator Marc MacSharry, but he should be listened to on the issue.  We were given a commitment a couple of weeks ago that the objectives and targets of each Department, Minister and Secretary General would be available and published.  I have not seen them yet.  Last week I stated that unless we have clear targets of saving &euro;1 billion a year at least and reducing the number of jobs in the public sector by 20,000, then we are going nowhere.  That target must be broken down into each Department.  If I do not see that in front of me then I do not believe there is political traction or buy-in from senior civil servants.  We should demand it.  I ask the Leader to seek copies of those targets for Members of the House.  I want to see it happening.  I will have a lot more to say on the issue.</P>
        <P>Overtime in the public sector costs more than &euro;1 billion.  Halving that would result straight away in savings of &euro;500 million.  A total of 20,000 jobs at an average of &euro;45,000 a year is almost &euro;1 billion.  It is a big ask to reduce the public service pay bill by &euro;1 billion but it is doable.  It can only be doable if we start now.  The Health Service Executive was a good start.  I welcomed that initiative two or three weeks ago.  I indicated to Members that it would run and play as it has.  More needs to be done.  We should be seeing action now but it is not happening because everyone is standing back and waiting.</P>

	<P>I echo Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate today on the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report published yesterday.  The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, has raised serious issues about the potential exposure of the taxpayer given that compensation is sought in approximately 300 legal actions on the costs of private nursing home care.  Those cases are being settled routinely.  It is worrying that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has simply rejected the findings of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report.  We need to hear from the Minister on the matter.  I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment.  I saw the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night.  It was an excellent investigation of the issues raised in the report.  We need to debate the report in this House as a matter of urgency, especially given the economic circumstances, the great hardship for many families of elderly people in nursing homes and the great worry this report will have caused them.</P>
        <P>I call on the Leader to provide not a debate on Seanad reform but a response and clarification on what will be the consequence of the loss by the Government of the votes last week on the Independent Senators&rsquo; motion on Seanad reform.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the matter yesterday.  He is correct to say there must be a consequence for the loss of those votes.  In the High Court judgment last week on Senator Doherty&rsquo;s action, legal shape was put on the abstract notion of democracy.  The High Court said that it is not enough for the Government to pay lip service to the concept of democracy and to keep promising a by-election and that adequate representation would be provided for the people in Donegal, Waterford and Dublin South.  The Government must go ahead and call the by-election.  One can draw an analogy or comparison with the vote on Seanad reform.  Where the Government loses a vote on a motion on Seanad reform, especially when it has been promising action in that regard since it was elected, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, made it a key promise of his when he became Minister, we need clarification from the Government on what it is going to do in response to the loss of the vote and the passing of the motion on Seanad reform.  Those of us in this House who have supported Seanad reform are anxious to see real action being taken by the Government on the matter.</P><Col N="572"/>
        <P Just="Left">I join others who called for a debate yesterday on the Magdalene laundries, survivors of those laundries and the need for redress.  In the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s Irish Human Rights Commission report, there is a real imperative that we would debate the issue today or very soon given that the survivors have been pressing for many months for redress and recognition by the State of the real injustice that was caused to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support any calls for a debate on the Ombudsman.  We have five Ombudsman positions in this country.  The Seanad is the place to have a much closer link to those independent voices.  I would support any debate in that respect.</P>

	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;is eco-tourism.  We have raised this matter many times.  There is great potential in this country for eco-tourism that is not being realised at present.  I have been lobbied on the matter on a number of occasions.  I call for a proper and fulsome debate on eco-tourism because we do not have a fully coherent plan for it.  I accept F&aacute;ilte Ireland has produced certain documents on it but I would like to see the green mapping which was put in place in Galway rolled out throughout the country.  There has been much talk about smarter travel and we have been promoting cycling routes throughout the country.  From a tourism point of view we need joined-up thinking in terms of eco-tourism.  The way to do that is to ensure green maps are put in place for the country outlining rights of way, walking routes, cycling routes and anywhere that recreational facilities could be put in place.  I hope the Leader will accede to that request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  It is most concerning that in a democracy it seems that the Government is literally trying to block the independent reports being brought forward by the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office.  This is the second time in a matter of a few weeks.  We had the lost at sea report.  Now we have the Who Cares? document in which the Ombudsman clearly states that the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive have both refused to co-operate with her in the conduct of the investigation leading to the report.  That is a sad indictment of Government.  It is anti-democratic.  It comes on top of efforts by the Government, even in the courts, to block citizens from exercising their democratic right to give a verdict on the Government via by-elections.  This is shocking.</P>
        <P>I concur with those who called for a debate on public sector reform.  It is an essential factor in the road to recovery.  Fine Gael has not been afraid to step out and outline its policy on this important matter.  It is not a new concept in Ireland.  The ESB, which is heavily unionised, is a national body that reduced its workforce from almost 14,500 to 7,000 by negotiation and agree<Col N="573"/>ment during the unprecedented growth of the Celtic tiger years.  There is no reason other civil and public service organisations cannot do the same, but we are not seeing the necessary willpower on the part of the Government.  Will the Leader arrange a debate?  Let us map out the road to recovery and start by having a good debate on public sector reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader investigate when the Colm McCarthy report on the sale of national assets is expected to be before the Government?  I hope we will have a debate on the question of our national assets, including Dublin Airport, ports and so on.  We must examine everything in terms of what we can sell to raise funds internationally.</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on the sale of local authority houses.  In a sale of the century, we could get rid of the State&rsquo;s rented houses and let individuals develop those houses via insulation grants and so on.  Raising funds in this way would be worthwhile and attractive at this point.</P>
        <P>I found Mr. Kevin Myers&rsquo;s article in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> quite offensive to members of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>When we are focused on reducing public costs, small gestures can bring a significant amount of comfort and joy to people.  My mother-in-law, Grace Prendergast, is 101 years old today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>A happy birthday to her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>We are proud of the fact.  Yesterday, she received a letter from President McAleese congratulating her on her 101st birthday.  Last year was a big birthday and she received more than a letter, but she also received a medal this year.  I gather that the President has initiated a scheme whereby someone not only receives a large gift at his or her 100th birthday, but also something for subsequent birthdays.</P>
        <P>I mention this because it is a reminder of how much joy, delight and comfort we can bring to people via small gestures and I congratulate the President on what she has done.  My mother-in-law is proud of her medal, which she will have around her neck for the rest of her life, and she has framed the letter.  We can remind ourselves that small things can bring great joy at a time when we are focused on reducing heavy costs.  Let us not forget that we can bring light into people&rsquo;s lives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the nursing home debate, one newspaper put it particularly well, in that there is hardly a single person who has not felt the distress and guilt of needing to put a loved one into a nursing home.  All of us who have visited a nursing home can agree with this sentiment.</P>
        <P>Last night, I watched a television programme on the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report.  I was somewhat disappointed by the method through which the programme handled the situation.  The Ombudsman was in the studio for questions and answers with the presenter.  The Minister for Health and Children also engaged in a questions and answers session.  I was waiting for an interaction between the Ombudsman and the Minister, but it never occurred.  This suggested a prior agreement, either with the Ombudsman or the Minister, probably the former, that there would be no interaction.  The Minister made a strong statement to the effect that the Government had legal advice from the Attorney General that the Ombudsman was exceeding her role and privilege.  This was a serious statement and I cannot understand why the presenter did not put it to the Ombudsman, who was sitting there with the camera on her at the time.</P>
        <P>My greatest fear in this regard is that those who will suffer are those who must go to a nursing home.  The issue will become a political football again.  There is no one in the Chamber who does not feel compassion on issues of this kind.  The new method of ensuring that everyone can avail of a nursing home through a deferred payments system is a good scheme introduced by the Minister.  Perhaps she could attend the House and expand on what we heard on last night&rsquo;s programme, as there is extra confusion among the public as a result of the way the programme was handled.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Naturally, we are all concerned about the ability of the State and our banks to borrow on the international markets and the cost of raising that finance.  Is there not a conflict, in that the State is, on the one hand, extolling the banks to lend money &mdash; we have all added our voices to that &mdash; to businesses in order that they can have the requisite working capital to keep functioning while, on the other, the Central Bank is requiring banks to conserve capital to meet the tier 1 and other capital ratios now required?  How will we square this<?oasys _jy ?>circle?</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s suggestion on the poppy, am I given to understand that a shamrock poppy is being promoted by the former Deputy, Mr. Paddy Harte, and his peace group?  It would be an ideal way to meet the points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, which I fully support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in asking for a debate on the implementation plan for the Croke Park agreement.  One of its main architects, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, questioned the pedestrian pace of its development this morning.  That pace is unacceptable.  While Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I agree on much, we disagree on some matters.  I am heartened to hear about the &euro;1 billion we can save on overtime payments and the &euro;1 billion that can be saved through number reductions in the public service.  As we saw yesterday in a report on salaries in the education sector, the highest paid person earns &euro;22,000 per month.  My only issue on public sector pay is whether that person could live on &euro;15,000 or &euro;16,000 per month.  The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Everyone earning more than a certain amount of money must realise that, regrettably, we are in a national emergency and, as such, determine what he or she realisti<Col N="575"/>cally needs to continue.  It is not a question of achieving efficiencies that trade unions are more than willing to provide through the innovations outlined in the Croke Park agreement.  Rather and as with the private sector, they must be immediate in nature and not pedestrian, as Mr. Mulvey outlined today.  An early debate on the implementation plans is essential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join others and I am delighted that Senators &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; want clarity on yesterday&rsquo;s report by the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, appears to have received advice from the Attorney General.  To what did it relate? Was it about the right of older persons to nursing home care or the Ombudsman's approach to her investigation?  The matter requires clarity.  The Minister should come to the House to clarify it in the national interest.  I am delighted there is support for this call on the other side of the House.</P>
     
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments made by Senator Coffey about the ESB and the job it did in rationalisation.  It must be recognised that salaries in the ESB are excessively high, with an average annual salary of almost &euro;70,000.  Nonetheless, the company rationalised to a significant extent during the good times.  There is a need for other semi-State companies to follow suit.  The same applies to the regulatory authorities in which many staff are significantly overpaid for carrying out what are not much more than administrative functions.  The chief executives of a number of companies are on salaries to which only people in very challenging positions should aspire.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Competitiveness is one of the biggest challenges facing the economy.  As Senator MacSharry said, rightly, there is a national emergency and we are probably not far from having recourse to the International Monetary Fund.  In that scenario the delay in having concrete suggestions made by the implementation body on the Croke Park agreement is regrettable and we should be highly critical of its failure.  The House should have another debate on the subject very soon.  It is time the implementation body was replaced by others who would drive the agreement to achieve essential savings.  Otherwise, we are doing a disservice to the public service because when it will be necessary to have recourse to the IMF, the first thing that body will look at is the excessive salaries paid throughout the service which are at least 30% higher than those paid in other competing countries.  We owe it to good people in the public service to ensure there is maximum intent and energy behind the drive to implement the Croke Park agreement.  I certainly do not see this happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is incorrect.  The activities of the implementation body on the Croke Park agreement are dependent upon receiving schedules from Departments.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>

	<P>Only one schedule was received.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks are pertinent.  It is the Minister and senior civil servants who set policy.  That is why we need to have a debate to receive clarification and a setting out by each Department of its objectives and targets regarding implementation.  That must happen.  Reform of the public sector, linked with the Fine Gael document, Reinventing Government, would empower and strengthen workers and Irish society.  On this side of the House we recognise that real reform would mean giving people autonomy, a role and authority and a slimmer version of government that all of us should embrace.  I, therefore, appeal to the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue.</P><Col N="576"/>
        <P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in asking for a debate on our First World War veterans &mdash; both men and women but predominantly men died &mdash; which, as a nation, we should remember.  We should acknowledge the sacrifices they made and the impact on their families and Irish society.  We are a bold and vibrant nation, despite our economic troubles.  It would be a great move by the House, the Government and Irish society if we acknowledged and remembered our dead.  As Senator Coghlan noted, former Deputy Paddy Harte has produced a poppy with a shamrock on it.  That might be a step in recognising the individuals in question.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s remarks on the Ombudsman who in her role is independent of the Government.  She is an independent officeholder who has produced a report.  There must be something about Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il because they have a problem with the role played by the Ombudsman.  Every Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government has had a difficulty with the Ombudsman.  Perhaps we should have a debate on the future role of the Ombudsman.</P>

	<P>I accept that Members in this Chamber do not have control over how RTE produces a programme.  It is an independent broadcaster, which I accept.  On many occasions I have congratulated and complimented it on wonderful programmes we have viewed and commented upon.  However, I concur with my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  In the public interest and the interests of fairness it would have been much better had there been a two-way debate last night rather than a stilted one, with questions being put to the Ombudsman and then the Minister.</P>

	<P>The Minister was contained in that she had to accept &mdash; as a Minister does &mdash; the advice of the Attorney General who advises the Government.  Listening to the programme, it was a little disingenuous of the presenter not to have had a more rigorous debate.</P>
        <P>In support of my colleague, Senator MacSharry, and as I stated last week, the higher paid in society, particularly in the public service, should pay more than the lower paid.  There is an enormous difference between taking 10% from a person earning &euro;30,000 and taking the same percentage from someone earning &euro;300,000.  I mention, in particular, a group of workers who have the protection of the Constitution in regard to their salaries, not all of whom have made a voluntary contribution.  At this very difficult time for the economy when everything is on the table everyone has a role to play&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The frustration felt by Members about the Croke Park agreement is alarming.  I agree with everything Senators Walsh, MacSharry, O&rsquo;Toole and others said.  Although what Mr. Kieran Mulvey said this morning on RTE was a departure for a senior member of the LRC, it was a little too gentle.  He said that if nothing was done within six months, the situation would be serious, but that showed a striking lack of urgency.  The Croke Park agreement, or, at least, some of it, should have been implemented by now.  It is amazing that someone can state that if it does not happen within six months, we will be in a serious situation.  We are in a very serious situation as it is and adopting such a sanguine attitude is <Col N="577"/>not reassuring but worrying.  I would be very worried if some of the arithmetic for the budget was dependent on the agreement or some of the assumptions embedded in it, but that will be the case.  If it is, no one will believe what is contained in the budget or the four-year plan because what we are finding out &mdash; I do not necessarily agree with the analysis of where the delay is &mdash; is that there are people in powerful positions who are able to delay and frustrate the agreement.  That is what is happening and no one is doing very much about it.  If that is the case, the people in question will be able to frustrate the budget or the assumptions underlying it.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Finance if he would consider bringing forward the budget from 7 December by two or three weeks.  There have been stories about this happening.  The matter is now so urgent that if the markets see the budget and the four-year plan as lacking credibility because of the agreement, as they will,  we will have to call in outside forces before Christmas.</P>

	<P>I join others in asking that the Irish people who died in the First World War be remembered by the State.  They have been forgotten during the years.  Many of them were from my home city, Waterford.  Many were looking for adventure, like young John Condon, aged 15 years, who was killed on the battlefield, one of the youngest to be killed in the First World War.  As stated, many went away to put bread on the table because of the economic circumstances of the time.  Others wanted to further the cause of the Home Rule campaign, the national aspiration of the time, which was supported by the vast majority in the country.  I ask that the people who were killed in the First World War be remembered in some way by the State, and perhaps the Leader might come back to the House on that matter.</P>
        <P>I note that more than 250 prisoners jailed for not paying fines were released at the gates of the prisons where they were to serve their sentences, mainly because of overcrowding in our prisons.  I do not believe that people who have to pay fines should go to prison in the first place, but they should have to pay the fines, whether through their salaries, social welfare or whatever.  This matter will have to be addressed.  We can take it up tomorrow with the Minister when speaking about prisons, but I do not believe that anyone who fails to pay a fine should get off scot free.  He or she should be made to pay the fine in some way, whether through a community order or an attachment of earnings order on salary or social welfare payments.</P>

	<P>I join Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan, Cummins and Buttimer in suggesting that now is the time for us to commemorate the Irish people who died in the First World War.  It is a pity that so far no one from the other side has said anything on this issue.  Perhaps before the Order of Business is concluded we will have some support.</P>
        <P>Emblems such as the poppy are sometimes contentious.  For that reason, wisely, all emblems are excluded from this House.  The former Deputy Paddy Harte has provided me with copies of the poppies he has had produced with a shamrock in the middle to emphasise the fact that they are commemorating Irish people.  There is, indeed, one for everyone in the audience because I have a supply of them in the office if anyone wants to wear them outside the Chamber.  I remember, on the day of the Enniskillen bombing when Senator John Robb came from the back row and presented the then Cathaoirleach, Charlie McDonald, with a poppy, which, in a gesture of extraordinary reconciliation, he put in his lapel and wore for the day.  I believe this matter should be looked at.</P>
        <P>Can the Leader tell the House when my colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill will be taken?  It is important we address this matter, especially in light of the High Court judgment placing two companies, Pierse Construction and Pierse Building Services, in liquidation.  They had 2,000 to 3,000 subcontractors employed, and some of these are also facing difficulties and, possibly, liquidation.</P><Col N="578"/>
        <P Just="Left">We learned last week about hundreds of millions of unspent money washing around in the Department of Education and Skills.  Wexford County Council has decided to use public moneys to complete certain projects that are of importance to the community.  In this situation, where there are small subcontractors who, through no fault of their own, face the prospect of receivership or liquidation and putting their workers on the dole, we should ask the Government to release that &euro;300 million immediately and frontload the payments, if necessary, for accounting purposes in order that construction workers can continue to be employed, small firms do not go out of business and school projects are completed.  I commend Senator Quinn on addressing this subject in the important way that he did.</P>

	<P>We all know Ireland is a small open economy that is deeply dependent on the role of financial investment in its economy to keep it going and very dependent on its international reputation.  A number of speakers have referred to the role the IMF could play in the economy in the future.  We need to be very clear about one thing.  While an outside body could play a role in helping the country tackle interests that are holding us back, the effect this would have on our international reputation would be disastrous.  We are deeply dependent on our ability to attract people, capital and talent, and that reputation would suffer a decisive blow if it appeared to the outside world we were not capable of managing our own affairs and leading our country back to security.</P>
        <P>All speakers on that point need to be very conscious of this.  We are still many steps away from such a scenario evolving.  The Government still has cards to play to ensure this does not happen.  One of those cards is the implementation of the Croke Park deal.  If the political will was there to negotiate the deal, where is the political will to implement it?</P>

	<P>Some weeks ago a prominent academic in Northern Ireland revealed that there was soft support for the dissident IRA from no less than 18.4% of the Nationalist community.  In that ominous context, it is beyond belief that RTE News would put out two minutes last night, at 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., of what amounted to an inflammatory montage of what looked like police brutality.  Everyone in the trade knows that a montage is cutting shots out of context for maximum dramatic impact.  Consider the impact on the public, especially on the young men whom the prominent Northern academic revealed as particularly susceptible to supporting the dissidents because they have no memory of the horrors of the armed struggle.  To put that out without context represents a serious dereliction of duty on the part of the head of news and his staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Opposition parties may be in government soon.  Are they going to be facing a situation where, on one front, we are facing economic meltdown and, in Northern Ireland, dissident <Col N="579"/>support among young people is rising while RTE News continues to shove out negative propaganda and allow a minority of its staff to put out inflammatory montage?  The footage of Rodney King being beaten up was a continuous shot that went on for five to seven minutes.  These were shots cut out of context.  We have no means of knowing, where a policeman lifted his baton, what might have happened to him before that.  It is recognised all over the world that this is not done in a broadcasting service.  It is despicable.  Yesterday, the Leader welcomed the new director general of RTE, Noel Curran.  His first duty should be to ask the chairman of the authority to ask the head of news to account for what happened last night on the news at six o&rsquo;clock. Lenin had a phrase for that type of useless bombing assassination propaganda among infantile left-wingers. He called it excitative terror, that sort of stupid inflammatory stuff. He had another phrase for those people who engage in it.  He called them useful idiots.  </P>

	<P>I draw to the attention of the Cathaoirleach a unique study which was presented yesterday at the American Public Health Association&rsquo;s annual meeting in Denver by researchers from the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland.  According to the lead researcher, Dr. Frank Scott, it showed there is a downside to new media such as texting and networking of which parents and teachers need to be aware.  The study was carried out among more than 4,000 students in secondary schools in the United States and found that adolescents who are hyper-texting and hyper-networking are more likely to be sexually promiscuous, have multiple partners, suicide ideation and are susceptible to drugs, alcohol and cigarette smoking.  This is startling and is a unique study.  I do not know of any previous review that has studied the negative effects of texting and intensive social networking.  The parameters of hyper-texting amount to writing 120 texts a day and social networking on-line for three hours per day.  This is a very serious warning about teenagers who are hyper-texting and hyper-social networking.  It is contrary to what one thinks when one sees them on their phones.  One thinks it is fantastic.  The perception is that they are engaging with other young people and appear to have loads of friends.  The 22% of young people who do not engage in hyper-texting and intensive social networking have much better health outcomes.  I am pleased to draw this warning to the attention of the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Commissioner Olli Rehn came to Ireland to advise and, more important, to remind us of what is important.  In terms of what is important, Commissioner Rehn mentioned the same three areas mentioned last week by the OECD, namely, education, reform and trade in terms of growth.  Commissioner Rehn also complimented us on our educated workforce.  While we might tire of hearing that, we must be careful not to lose that educated workforce.  What will the Government and Minister for Education and Skills do to maintain this educated workforce and the budget commitment in respect of education?  Important advice given last week by the OECD is that education funding should not be cut, rather cuts should be made in the defence budget and the issue of why we gave money to the banks should be debated.</P>
        <P>Commissioner Rehn also spoke about labour reform.  In this context, every speaker in the House today has expressed concern in regard to the lack of implementation of the Croke Park agreement.  Why has the Government not driven through the reform?  The perception among the public in regard to the Croke Park agreement is that it is merely cover for no further cuts for public servants.  No one believes that the Government is serious about reform.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Apropos the remarks in regard to the ending of the First World War at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918, the anniversary of which occurs tomorrow, it is appropriate that this matter has been raised by Senator Cummins as he comes from the city always known as the Redmondite city.  In that context I recall, as referred to by Senator Norris, being in the House when former Senator John Robb presented the poppy to the then Cathaoirleach.  It was a particularly dramatic moment.  However, I remind the House &mdash; I believe that in this regard I speak for all of my colleagues on this side of the House &mdash; that during the past 15 years and this new period of openness and respect for diverse traditions within this country it was the current Government and successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments that initiated reaching out to the Unionists under the Good Friday Agreement.  For the first time ever, the President, along with the Queen of England and King of the Belgians, represented Ireland at Messines Ridge, the round tower of which was also financed by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  Any suggestion that Fianna F&aacute;il did not embrace the reality of the traditions emanating from the First World War is false.  I am sure Senator Norris will appreciate and acknowledge my point in that regard.</P>

Irrespective of the historical revisionism in regard to their contribution, the reality is that those involved at that time believed what they were doing was in the best interests of Ireland.  That should not be forgotten.</P>
        <P>In the context of all the discussion in regard to the Good Friday Agreement, if there are elites within various aspects of Irish society I have no doubt there are elites within the Croke Park agreement who are defending their own particular position.  I agree that the Government should take note of this.  I remind the House that the most vulnerable in our society should always be protected.

	<P>The national study of elder abuse published yesterday is disturbing.  I ask that the Leader provide time for a full day debate on this issue.  It is a matter of great concern that 10,000 people in this country over the age of 65 are deemed to have suffered abuse, much of it in their own homes.  This is intolerable and unacceptable.  Despite our economic woes, the is a matter we can and should tackle.  The contrast between these people and those young people who were abused down the years, which abuse was horrendous, is that the <Col N="581"/>latter lived to tell the tale while much of this elder abuse and memory of it goes to the grave.  This House should debate this issue.</P>
        <P>The remarks of the Ombudsman, Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, in this context are extraordinarily serious.  That the Ombudsman was allegedly frustrated by the HSE and Department of Health and Children in the discharge of her work is a serious matter.  It is also extraordinarily serious that the Department of Health and Children has stated the Ombudsman acted in bad faith.  A statement on that matter is required in this House from the Minister for Health and Children.  We must debate this matter as part of the debate on elder abuse.</P>
        <P>It is not inappropriate that I, coming from a Border county, would join with those who say we should honour those who died in the First World War.  History is written by the victors.  The people who emerge as Government write history.  These people were written out of history for years, which is wrong.  I admire Senator Mooney&rsquo;s contribution which called on us to acknowledge them now.  We should go out of our way to rewrite this wrong on behalf of the families who have lived with the perception that their ancestors did wrong.</P>

I witnessed the horrific abuse of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on Merrion Street by these young thugs, which is all they can be described as.  Incidentally, not alone were alleged dissidents of the Real IRA involved but flags and emblems of another political party were waved at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while this abuse was taking place.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Leader invite to the House the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Minister for Justice and Law Reform &mdash; I am not sure which has responsibility in this area &mdash; to discuss the opening of gold shops in all of our main towns.  This House needs to discuss what measures the owners of these shops are taking to ensure the people from whom they are purchasing the gold own it.  I understand from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there has been a huge increase in the number of home break-ins in the towns in which these shops are located.  I ask that the Leader invite the relevant Minister to this House so we can discuss what legislation would be required to compel the owners of these shops to satisfy themselves that the people selling the gold to them actually own it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  Interest on Government bonds is now in excess of 8%.  If Ireland is to survive, it must be able to borrow money at the rate of 5% or less.  For the past six months, Irish banks have failed to borrow any money from international investors.  All our borrowings are now coming from the European Central Bank.  Ireland will have to borrow &euro;40 billion over the next three years.  This House needs to debate from where this money will come.  It is feared now that international investors are not unwilling to lend money to Ireland but are concerned about the amount we have already borrowed.  If that is the case, we will have to rely more often on the European Central Bank for funding in the next three years.  That &euro;40 billion is to pay social welfare payments, old age pensions, public sector pensions and public sector pay.  We must have an urgent debate on where Ireland will borrow money from in the next three years if, as appears obvious, we are being abandoned by international investors as far as borrowings are concerned.</P>

	<P>Again, unfortunately, we have the impression from the Opposition that circumstances are much worse than they are.  To say that Ireland failed to borrow from international lenders is wrong.  We did not attempt to seek international funding.  We went to the Europeans first.  That is a misrepresentation.</P>
        <P>A further misrepresentation, which I hope ends in the media, is the benchmarking of Irish bonds against Germany.  One might as well benchmark us against Switzerland or the Japanese yen.  The people we should be benchmarked against are the Portuguese, the Spanish, the Greeks and the Italians, which are also peripheral countries.</P>
        <P>I support those who would remember the ending of the First World War.  It is an important date.  While the Irish fought in Europe against German imperialism, they also fought at home against British imperialism and, thankfully, freedom won out in the end.  It is a great credit to President Woodrow Wilson who fought for the rights of small nations.  He was one of the main reasons we eventually received our own independence and, of course, achieved the successful conclusion of that war.</P>

It has now compiled all its information and its members are coming back to give Members an update on the current position.

It is an important group and when one considers that this country&rsquo;s gas and oil imports amount to &euro;6 billion every year, it would be a good start for us to ensure we would be self-sufficient in energy.

	<P>Last week the Minister for Justice and Law Reform told us that a very small percentage of inmates in prisons were there for non-payment of fines, but it appears now that prisoners being jailed by the courts for non-payment of fines have had their fines waived on arrival at the prison gates and have been released immediately as part of new procedures.  It is said that at least 200 inmates had been released immediately under that system but the true figure could be much higher.  That sheds light on the reason so few are in prison but it also sheds a light on a serious problem in the way our prison system is functioning.  It also sheds light on the conduct of debates in this House, and I hope the Minister will address that issue when he is back in this Chamber for the continuation of that debate.</P>
        <P>I also wonder whether going forward, if Members will pardon the expression, we would do better if speeches to be made by Ministers were circulated in advance to allow Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; consider what they will hear in the House, do the necessary research and be able to respond <Col N="583"/>in a more informed way.

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik, Boyle, Coffey, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Prendergast, Buttimer and Feeney expressed their views on the new report from the Ombudsman on services for the elderly.  It is an independent report, as has been said, and the colleagues outlined to the House the difficulty the Minister may have had regarding the legal opinion from the Attorney General.  I have no difficulty in the House debating this, and I will endeavour to have such a debate in the next few weeks because reports of this kind form an area in which we can have a significant input.  We owe it to the generation that created the Ireland of today.  Looking after our elderly is something all Members on all sides of the House owe to that generation.  We will certainly have that debate in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan, Buttimer, Cummins, Norris, Mooney, O&rsquo;Reilly, Hanafin and Mullen paid tribute to the men and women of the First World War and the way it is celebrated on Remembrance Day.  They spoke also about all the families who had to make the sacrifices at that time.  I have no difficulty in supporting the calls made by Members on all sides of the House to honour those who died between 1914 and 1918 and also to remember those who played such a major role for our own country at that time, especially the men and women of 1916.  I have no difficulty in getting together to see what we can do to make our contribution to acknowledge the heroic efforts made at that time by those who fought in the war.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coffey, MacSharry, Walsh, Buttimer, Feeney, Ross, Donohoe, Healy Eames, Twomey and Hanafin expressed their concerns about the Croke Park agreement.  The agreement has been a marvellous achievement by everyone who made it possible, but Kieran Mulvey let the nation know today that a huge amount of work must take place in the coming months.  Anyone who knows him will be aware that he is a conciliatory person who has made a significant contribution to Ireland in terms of various agreements.  I have full confidence in Kieran Mulvey.</P>

	<P>I said on the Order of Business yesterday that as soon as the information regarding the four budgets is available to us, we will discuss and deal with that as well.  I discussed it with one of the leaders, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, yesterday morning who asked me about it before the Order of Business and I gave a commitment that I will put an update on the Croke Park agreement on the agenda of the business of this House by the last week in November.  That still stands.  If we need to deliberate on what we as Members of the Oireachtas can do to assist this important agreement, I will have no difficulty allocating time on a weekly basis if necessary.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik mentioned Seanad reform.  I stated yesterday morning that all groups and political parties have made proposals and they are with the Minister.  The Minister said on a visit to the House that a White Paper would be published.  I am doing anything I can to speed up the process.  I am fully in support of Seanad reform in the form of proposals we have all made in good faith to the Minister.</P>

I have no difficulty with this.  Senator Leyden asked me to find out the up-to-date position on the report by Colm McCarthy on the sale of national assets.  I will give this information directly to the Senator when I find out the timeframe.  The Senator also expressed his views on an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn mentioned the joyous occasion of the 101st birthday of his dear mother-in-law.  I am amazed when I think of the changes in our country that lady must have seen &mdash; all for the better.  I join Senator Quinn and his family in celebrating her terrific achievement of reaching the great age of 101. The Senator quite correctly brought to the attention of the House the lovely gesture by President McAleese of providing a medal of achievement for his mother-in-law.  I share with him and his family, with everyone in the House, my joy on the lovely day they had yesterday and his mother-in-law&rsquo;s reaching the age of 101, which is an incredible achievement that few have reached.  I appreciate the words of joy the Senator expressed in the House this morning.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins and Mullen expressed concerns and gave their views on everything to do with prison sentencing and standards in our prisons.  This is for discussion in the House tomorrow, with the Minister present, from 2 p.m.  Senator Norris inquired about Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill, which is No. 34 on our cl&aacute;r.  I hope we will be able to deliberate further on this in the last week of November.  We are fully in support of the Bill, particularly in view of what has happened in the last two to three weeks.  The situation must be addressed as a serious matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Senators Harris and Wilson mentioned poor editing on the RTE news last night and called on the head of news at RTE to account for what happened.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s strong views to the Minister after the Order of Business.  Senator Mary White spoke of the downside of new media such as texting and social networking in terms of quality of life for young people and the amount of time being spent on mobile phones and other new technology.  I certainly share her views in this regard, and we must note the research she has outlined to the House.</P><Col N="585"/>

    <Title>Effects of Recession on Mental Health: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for the invitation to the House to discuss the effects the recession is having on the population in terms of mental health.  I propose to deal with this under three headings.  One is the capital programme, and I am anxious to confirm that funding is still available for the mental health sector and, more importantly, that the Government programme, A Vision for Change, is alive and well.  It is a ten-year programme and we are only four years into it.  There is every possibility it will be delivered within the timeframe of the remaining six years.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The overriding demand on the Department is to deal with the issue of the stigma surrounding mental health.  I will commence by discussing what has been achieved while also acknowledging what remains to be done.  I will be direct and to the point and if Members have doubts about the issues I mention, they are free to question me.  The first issue is what we are doing to help the population to understand the difficulty surrounding mental health and the problems that result from the stigma attached to it.  In that context, two years ago I decided that the most important thing the Department could do is travel throughout the country and try to deal with the issue of the stigma and, more importantly, encourage as many groups as possible to become involved in this national campaign.</P>
        <P>I have always been of the view that if we could encourage people to look after their mental health in the same way as they look after their physical health, it would be a determining factor in dealing with mental health issues before they became difficult and required institutional or community care.  The See Change initiative is taking place in that context.  So far, we have visited ten county towns and our intention is to travel to all the county towns before the end of March.  The objective of the See Change campaign is to reduce the level of discrimination and prejudice.  When we travel to the county towns, we bring with us professionals from the area and service users.  We open the debate to the floor after the presentations.</P>
        <P>We have visited Ennis, Donegal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Dublin and Tipperary.  Next week we are due to visit Mayo, Sligo and Wexford.  The important aspect of all the presentations has been the response from the floor.  Sadly, many people are reluctant to present and often they speak on behalf of their loved ones or friends.  They consistently point to the fear factor involved in presenting for mental health support.  That is the result of fear of discrimination in the workplace and &mdash; a phenomenon we should deal with as quickly as possible &mdash; the fear people suffer when they make an application for a mortgage, personal loan or a job.  Often there is a question on the application asking the person if they have ever suffered a mental health disability or issue.  People feel discriminated against because if they answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to such a question, it will have a negative effect on the application.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These issues are the challenge for us.  Even where people apply for local authority housing, there is a huge fear factor.  The See Change campaign seeks to deal with that issue which affects many people.  It is also trying to educate the authorities, local and central as well as in banking and the private sector, that a mental health issue should be considered in the same way as a physical health issue.  I believe we are getting that message across, albeit slowly.</P>
        <P>The other aspect of the See Change campaign is to convince people to look after their mental health.  It was never more important than in the context of the next budget.  The budget for the Department of Health and Children will be reduced by approximately &euro;1 billion, which will pose a serious challenge in ensuring we hold on to the funding we have for mental health and ensuring we use it better and wisely.  I am convinced, having met many groups over the past two years, that the priority must be early intervention.  Many people have advised me over recent months that 70% of mental health issues begin in childhood and adolescence.  It is <Col N="588"/>obvious, therefore, that this is where the funding should be prioritised and I intend to drive that programme forward.</P>
        <P>It is also important to discuss the issue of suicide and its prevention.  Many groups are making great efforts to impact locally through community organisations and individuals to bring assistance to people.  Again, I must examine the budget in the context of ensuring that whatever is provided to the National Office for Suicide Prevention will be targeted at groups that are most vulnerable.  That will be the new thinking as we approach this budget.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to waste time talking about capital programmes because this discussion is about the effect of the recession on mental health and what the Government should do.  It is important because there is so much negative comment to the effect that little happens in the mental health area.  That partisan comment does not concern or worry me in the least.  What does concern me is that the notion is abroad that because we are in a recession funding is reduced and nothing is happening to drive A Vision for Change forward, but nothing could be further from the truth.  I continue to affirm at all times that the level of funding for mental health services should be increased.  We have made this case in the past year and will I hope receive the appropriate response.  I am not trying to fly the flag for the Department or the Government, but I do recognise that this is consistent with what was promised in A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>Let me give a flavour of what is happening.  Under this year&rsquo;s capital programme, there have been significant achievements.  For the first time since 1815, there will be no new referrals to Grangegorman and the service at Blanchardstown hospital is now up and running.  I have often been asked about what is happening at Portrane.  The development of the acute psychiatric unit promised at Beaumont Hospital will commence in February 2011.  There have been questions as to whether funding has been committed; I confirm that it is guaranteed.  I acknowledge there has been a delay in commencing the project due to the fact that the original site had to be changed to allow for the co-located hospital programme.</P>
        <P>I am trying to follow up on the annual report of the Mental Health Commission inspectors on the condition of mental hospitals.  In the case of St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital, Mullingar, I am pleased to say that, as part of the A Vision for Change programme, we visited Mullingar to turn the sod for the new 100-bed unit that will replace the wards referred to so often in the inspectors&rsquo; report.  I expect the new facility to open early in the new year.  The inspectors&rsquo; report also referred to the acute psychiatric services in Letterkenny and called for the closure of the hospital there.  That has now happened and construction of the new psychiatric unit is well under way.  I visited the site unofficially during the past fortnight in order that I would have some idea of progress and was pleased to see the building was almost three quarters completed.</P>
        <P>We have made progress on a child and adolescent day hospital in Cherry Orchard in Dublin and on hostels in Wexford and Tipperary.  Deputy Neville, Senator Fitzgerald and many other members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children have often reminded me of the importance of insisting on separate child and adolescent facilities. Yesterday I met Deputy Neville and the Irish Association of Suicidology and once again they impressed on me the need to ensure that whatever we did, we needed to prioritise the provision of child and adolescent supports.  We must not just concentrate on the provision of beds but also on the provision of support through mental health teams.  A Vision for Change commits us to providing 100 beds by the end of the programme in approximately four years time.  We have reached a figure of 55 child and adolescent beds, an important achievement which illustrates that progress has not been parked owing to the recession.  A 20-bed child and adolescent unit in Cork which has been commissioned is expected to be up and running by early next year.  Day hospitals in <Col N="589"/>Ballyfermot and Inchicore are also in operation, while nursing units are in operation in Senator Prendargast&rsquo;s area, in Clonmel.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All of these works demonstrate how the capital programme for last year has been applied.  We must now work out the programme for next year.  Much of what will be achieved will be funded by selling assets to the tune of &euro;50 million and reinvesting the funds.  We did not realise a full &euro;50 million last year and the spend was in excess of that figure.  The extra funding came by way of a transfer from the capital budget of the HSE.</P>
        <P>I have dealt with the programme See Change and what it can achieve.  It is delivering by involving many groups and encouraging them to embrace and deal with the issue of mental well-being.  Some 55 groups are involved.  Our next strategy must be to work in primary and secondary schools to involve students and help them to realise the importance of the delivery of services in the community to help change attitudes and help recovery.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to be here to discuss the issues raised, in particular the fears about the current economic situation and the impact it is having on people&rsquo;s work and lives.  Undoubtedly, it tests the coping skills and emotional resilience of individuals, families and communities.  The impact of unemployment and personal financial difficulties on physical and mental health is well documented.  Following job loss, people report higher levels of anxiety, stress, depression, anger and loss of personal control and self-esteem.  It may also be difficult, at times, to maintain contact with friends and colleagues.  There is a strong relationship between unemployment, the economy and increased mental health problems and suicide risk.  Of course, there are also people who are in employment and financially secure who may also be in need of support and services.  Last year there was a worrying increase of 24% in the number of deaths by suicide on the figure for 2008.  This increase is a source of concern for me and the Government.  We must redouble our efforts to reduce the incidence of suicide and make every effort to reach out to people in despair.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I visited Pieta House in Lucan where I saw at first hand how this group, like many others, worked in a non-hospital setting to provide for early intervention.  I was impressed to hear Pieta House had dealt with 1,200 people in the short time it had been open.  I am convinced that when sitting down to decide how much of the budget should be devoted to suicide prevention measures, I must take account of the number of groups working in this area.  I do not wish to offend any group, but we must take into account whether it would be more sensible to support many small groups or to target the funds available.  In the next few weeks I hope to bring clarity to the issue.  I was very impressed by what I had seen in Pieta House and by the fact that people were being referred to it from Tallaght hospital, by people such as Dr. Ian Daly and from Beaumont Hospital.  This is the way forward.  Advice from various professionals, Members, the Joint Committee on Health and Children and service users has helped me to realise that we must bring all the groups involved in suicide prevention together in order that we can target investment to achieve a better outcome.</P>
        <P>I am not here only to say the Government has put money aside for this or that.  Everyone has a role to play in ensuring the appropriate funds are put aside for mental health services.  The Government has provided additional funding of almost &euro;1 million this year from the dormant accounts fund for a programme of suicide prevention measures to help communities to develop integrated local action plans aimed at suicide prevention.  I say this to stress that, even though we are in a recession, it is not true that we will park investment, A Vision for Change or the plan to place mental health issues at the top of the health agenda.</P>
        <P>The special needs service of the mental health service has also been recognised in the context of the 2010 employment control framework for the health service which provides for an exemption from the moratorium in respect of 100 psychiatric nursing posts.  I am aware that some <Col N="590"/>will be surprised at this, given that the moratorium has presented a difficulty in rolling out A Vision for Change.</P>
      
        <P>We were able to secure 40 nurses in the context of the employment control programme.  Although it was long overdue, last week the Knockamann development with ten-unit bungalows was opened to replace the Portrane facility and nursing staff have been secured for it by way of an exemption from the recruitment moratorium.</P>
        <P>Regarding new ways of thinking in mental health services, I am very much taken by the success of the innovation funding secured last year for disability and mental health services.  The fund was established to help support the transition from institutional to person-centred models of care.  From it, 50 disability and mental health projects were awarded grants totalling &euro;3.6 million, 15 of which were mental health projects which received funding of &euro;1.4 million.</P>
        <P>I recently met Ms Madeleine Clarke and her colleagues from the Genio Trust and believe its approach is the way forward.  I also believe it can be supported financially next year.  I met some of the service users who had benefited from the Genio Trust.  It must be continued, particularly as we try to bring forward new proposals this year as to how we will fund directly mental health service users and those with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention is supporting organisations which are concerned about the impact the economic downturn may be having on the mental health of the population and providing services for those in need of support.  The aim is to inform the general public and organisations on mental health issues related to unemployment and financial difficulties.  The office is also supporting the delivery of mental health promotion programmes targeted at unemployed persons.</P>
        <P>In the next few weeks the Government will consider the 2011 Estimates for the health service in the context of the strategy for economic recovery and the target to reduce the general government deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014.  Our current financial difficulties do not in any way dilute the Government&rsquo;s commitment to mental health services.  The challenge we face is whether we should park A Vision for Change until the recession passes or embrace change by involving the Genio Trust, the Health Service Executive, community mental health teams and others.  We should always maintain the commitment to A Vision for Change and outline each year what can be delivered under the programme.</P>
        <P>Strategies to reduce the impact of the financial crisis should be viewed as an opportunity to improve the way mental health services are financed and delivered.  I am confident this can be achieved and that staff at all levels will collaborate and work together to deliver services in a more flexible way.  Given the substantial resources already invested in mental health services, the reconfiguring and remodelling of resources will be the main focus for the immediate future.  Collaboration is a fundamental principle in A Vision for Change.  Solutions to meeting people&rsquo;s mental health needs require effective partnerships where managers, professionals, service users and carers work together in forging relationships, utilising resources and involving service users as legitimate collaborators in their own recovery.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive must work with limited financial resources.  As the health sector accounts for over 27% of public expenditure, the appropriate management of the public finances means the Health Service Executive must operate within the approved budget set out at the start of the year.  Under the Health Act 2004, the executive is required to prepare an annual national service plan which must indicate the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided by it.  The plan must be approved by the Minister for Health and Children.</P><Col N="591"/>
        <P>There will be no increase in funding for mental health services and the disability sector.  After meetings with the various organisations and Mr. Geoff Day of the National Office for Suicide Prevention, the challenge will be to see how we can better utilise the suicide prevention fund, to which I hope new thinking can be brought.  Yesterday I met Deputy Neville and the Irish Association of Suicidology and have invited them to explain their proposals to achieve better results in two weeks.</P>
        <P>Progress can be reported in implementation of the Reach Out programme.  In recent years the National Office for Suicide Prevention has launched two awareness campaigns with the aim of improving the awareness and understanding of mental health and well-being.  The Letsomeoneknow campaign is aimed at young people and was informed by consultations with young people arranged under the auspices of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  In addition, the National Office for Suicide Prevention has produced an information leaflet entitled, Looking After Your Mental Health During Tough Economic Times, which outlines information on the impact unemployment and financial difficulties can have on mental health and well-being and how we can look after our own mental health.  An information booklet entitled, Suicide Prevention in the Workplace, provides organisations and workplaces with practical guidance on how staff can respond to and support persons at risk of suicidal behaviour.</P>
        <P>To date, some 18,000 people have been trained in the internationally recognised ASIST, applied suicide intervention skills training, programme.  In addition, over 3,300 participants have completed the SafeTalk training programme which prepares participants to identify persons with thoughts of suicide and connect them with support services.  I am conscious that last year saw the most suicides reported to date and we must ask ourselves if what we are doing is sufficient.  Should we be supporting community health groups more or should we be more proactive in encouraging communities to look after themselves?</P>
        <P Just="Left">In these straitened times it is important that we watch out for each other and be mindful of the mental health of those around us.  As a society, we need to be able to reach out to others in need and be prepared to offer a shoulder because often that is all that is required to give someone a lift.  People are reluctant to acknowledge their mental health difficulties for fear of being stigmatised.  Stigma is, undoubtedly, the most damaging factor in the life of anyone with a mental health problem.  Recently Senator Fitzgerald and I attended the Suicide or Survive annual conference.  In listening to those who have attempted to commit suicide speak about their personal recovery a message is sent that if the required support was available, people would recover.  It is important for people to talk publicly and to point to the groups across the country which can give the required support.  In the past two years the groups and individuals I have met all say the Department&rsquo;s message should be that early intervention makes recovery not just possible but also a reality.</P>
        <P>Many groups also tell us that they need to have fully staffed community mental health teams.  I accept they are not often staffed to the level we would wish.  Getting these teams in place is important if we want to move from institutional to person-centred care.</P>
        <P>People are reluctant to acknowledge their mental health difficulties for fear of being stigmatised.  We are however dealing with such issues on a weekly basis throughout the country.  The combined efforts of everyone on the See Change campaign, including the HSE, the media and local organisations, work to great effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People often say that talking to and encouraging such groups can have a snowball effect.  I was recently invited to the launch of the annual report of the Irish Veterinary Association.  The IVA&rsquo;s officials have taken it upon themselves to do their bit to make more people aware of mental health issues.  Their efforts will impact on their members and customers in the farming <Col N="592"/>community.  If, in their opinion, somebody is unwell, the appropriate authorities can be notified in such cases.  I spoke about this matter on that occasion and it was reported in the IVA&rsquo;s magazine two weeks later.  Some weeks after that, I was contacted by a local vet in my constituency who pointed out a family that was in difficulties.  He suspected that a suicide attempt could recur in that family, and his telephone call helped to involve the local agencies.</P>
        <P>That is the message we are trying to get out &mdash; that regardless of what walk of life one comes from or what profession, people&rsquo;s lives can be impacted by these matters.  It is important for us to try to deal with that situation.  In an effort to highlight this issue I launched See Change, the national mental health stigma reduction partnership, earlier this year, to reduce stigma and challenge the discrimination associated with mental health problems.  Our vision is to achieve a change in Irish social attitudes and behaviour and to reduce the level of discrimination and prejudice.  To help make that vision a reality and to change attitudes positively, a range of national and local activities are being developed, aimed at giving focused messages to the general public and target groups.</P>
        <P>I recognise the need to develop mental health services, which are well integrated in society.  They put the individual at the centre and operate in a way which avoids prejudice and exclusion.  I am pleased to say that the task is now in hand and I wish to thank my departmental officials for their work in that regard.  Many others were also involved who came out to be a part of the presentation on the night.  There are too many to mention individually, but I acknowledge their efforts.  When we visit a location to promote the See Change partnership, it is pleasing to see the number of professionals and service users who offer their services voluntarily at such public meetings.  I am sure Senators share my view in that respect.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate and I know Senators have the same concerns as everyone to ensure the best level of service is provided.  The media are always quick to comment when I do not do something, but when we do something it does not seem to be an issue.  I am not interested in that aspect, except to say that when something is achieved in this area the media should try to show the positive aspects, rather than the negative ones.  That should be done not just for the sake of political gloss, because that will be seen through quite clearly, but for the sake of those with family members who may be affected by mental illness.  We should not create the impression that we are in lock-down and that nothing is happening.</P>
        <P>I have spoken about this year&rsquo;s capital programme and I will announce next year&rsquo;s capital programme in January.  Early in 2011, I also hope to provide a progress report on the numbers of affiliated groups which are now attached to the See Change campaign.  I will return to the House early in the new year to discuss how we intend to involve schools and organisations in the campaign.  At that stage, we can also discuss how the suicide prevention budget will be allocated.  I am pinning my hopes on the fact that reconfigured funding will focus attention on the urgency of providing early intervention.</P>
        <P>I am impressed by the work of Head Strong and Jigsaw, and I am aware that other groups do such work throughout the country.  I have seen what is happening in Galway and Ballymun in this regard.  I have been invited to Navan where I will shortly launch the programme.  We have had talks with philanthropic organisations which are taken by the notion that, if we can provide funding for early intervention through the See Change programme, it can be developed further.  I hope to be able to say something more specific about that when I next return to the House.</P>
     </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome his commitment to this area, as well as the work programme he has outlined.  This is a time of change concerning the mental health sector, both for politicians and the public at large.  That can be seen from <Col N="593"/>the fact that See Change meetings around the country have, for the most part, attracted very good numbers.  There is clearly a widespread interest in the campaign.  I welcome the changes the Minister of State has outlined in moving some institutional care to care in the community.</P>
        <P>Despite this being a time of change for mental health matters, it is also a time of crisis for such services.  I agree with the Minister of State that we do not want to deter anyone from availing of existing services; we want to encourage people to use them.  They should seek early intervention from their GPs and specialist centres.  This is particularly the case with children, but it also applies to adults.  Prevention of mental illness is extremely important, so the earlier people seek help the less serious the consequences of their mental health difficulties will be.  Every family is affected by mental health issues, which affect one in four people.  As the Minister of State said, it is time to draw back the curtain fully and to ensure that people do not feel stigmatised.  This is a time of change in that regard, which we must all welcome.</P>
        <P>All these positive aspects, however, could easily be put aside by funding cutbacks.  The Minister of State and his officials know this better than most.  The front page of yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Medical News</i> stated that &ldquo;providing services with no funding is reckless and unsustainable&rdquo;.  That quote comes from the head of mental health services with the HSE, who expressed serious concern about the ability of service providers to continue to provide safe levels of care in a climate of diminished resources.</P>
        <P>I do not underestimate the Minister of State&rsquo;s personal efforts and the changes he has outlined, which I accept.  However, this is a time of crisis for mental health services, and I want to outline why I think that is so.  It is obviously linked to our overall economic situation and the demands for cutbacks in the health budget.  We should put the facts on the record as regards what is happening with health funding.</P>
        <P>I will quote some more of what Mr. Martin Rogan has to say, as reported by the <i>Irish Medical News</i>.  He says he is still seeking commitments from the Department of Health and Children about securing additional funding next year for implementing A Vision for Change.  It is clear that we have the vision and we know where we want to go with mental health services.  The question, however, concerns the roadmap, in addition to money, implementation and the progress that has been made.  We must analyse that to see where it currently stands.  Mr. Rogan says that no extra funding was provided this year for the implementation of the mental health strategy.  He stated: &ldquo;I will deliver the service when it is paid for, otherwise it is reckless and unsustainable&rdquo;, adding, &ldquo;Ethically, you can&rsquo;t start a service with no funding for it to fall over three weeks later when you have invited people to avail of the service&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If it is not sustainable we definitely cannot go there, but what sort of message is that for services around the country?  Mr. Rogan also spoke about the equitable distribution of funding within the health budget.  A key challenge for the Minister of State is to get equitable distribution of funding within the overall health budget.  We know that mental health services have been the Cinderella of the health sector, so the challenge for the Minister of State is to ensure that changes.  At the very least there should be equity within the health budget.  If he achieves that, he will be achieving a great deal.</P>
        <P>What is the current situation?  The Minister of State has painted one picture, but I want to put on record some of the existing challenges.  I accept that they have not arisen overnight, but have come about over a long period.  It is disgraceful that mental health services have been at the margins for far too long.  As the Minister of State knows, there is a new campaign on this issue involving all interested groups.  There is more publicity about mental health budgets, which is a good thing.  More than 7,000 e-mails have been sent to Deputies, Senators and people interested in this.  This shows the stigma has been reduced and people are willing to write to their representatives about mental health and funding.</P><Col N="594"/>
        <P>Let us consider the challenges.  The campaign says that since 2006, mental health spending has been reduced by 9.2% and currently 5.3% of the overall health spending goes on mental health.  Over half of all HSE staff cuts last year applied to mental health.  Many psychiatric nurses have taken voluntary redundancy.  This is a real challenge but they only make up 9% of the health workforce.  The Inspector of Mental Health Services continues to say some facilities are entirely unacceptable and inhumane.  The Minister of State referred to being at Pieta House yesterday, a service I know very well.  Many cutbacks are coming at community services level, the more progressive side of the service to which A Vision for Change outlines we need to move.  At a time of cutbacks in staffing, this is what is happening.  We still have 1,000 people living in institutions that are Victorian despite the major efforts by front-line staff.</P>
        <P>Major challenges remain.  In 2009, more than 200 children were admitted to adult psychiatric units.  Some 14 children have been admitted this year and an investigation is taking place on why nine were admitted in Limerick.  I welcome that investigation because we should not admit young children to adult psychiatric or mental health institutions.  It is clearly inappropriate.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to early intervention, which is a major challenge.  What is the price to the individual, the family, the community and the budget of this country if a young child with mental health difficulties must wait up to four years for a diagnosis?  It is enormous.  Early intervention and early assessment in local areas is the key.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is focusing on this.</P>
        <P>I have indicated the scale of the challenges facing the Minister of State in receiving a budget.  We are having this debate because it behoves us all to support the Minister of State in trying to ensure the budget he receives for next year is higher than for this year and is equitable in respect of what is happening in the Department.  This week, research published by Red C highlighted the stresses and strains people feel as a result of the economic recession.  It is important that the Taoiseach and other Ministers realise that at a time of recession, the need for mental health funding is even greater.  International research over many years has shown that in an economic recession, mental health difficulties increase.  It is common sense but the research shows this is what happens.  We see it with suicide, depression rates and stress on families.  The demand for the services increases at a time of recession, which is important to note in terms of the budget.</P>
        <P>Services must be resourced.  I am sure the Minister of State saw the comments of the Irish Medical Organisation in its pre-budget submission.  It pointed out the interesting fact that 25% of people in receipt of illness benefit in 2009 cited mental health issues as the reason they were unfit for work.  One sees the cost of not providing services to people.  People fall out of the workplace and we know those with mental health difficulties face major stigma in speaking about their difficulties in the workplace.  I also welcome the article written by Dr. Muiris Houston in the health supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He outlines the stark economic burden of mental ill-health on the State, which is estimated at &euro;3 billion per year.  This is the cost of not having in place the services we need.  All of this must be recognised.  This is a major challenge, which we must recognise.  Everyone will fight their corner.  How does one say that mental health is more important than other areas of health?  One can only make the best case one can and see if we can get extra money.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change needs money, as the director of services in the HSE commented.  Perhaps the Minister of State can provide Members with the implementation plan for the policy and how he sees it developing.  What is the Government&rsquo;s funding commitment to the implementation of the plan?</P><Col N="595"/>
        <P>How much money is spent on mental health services?  The Department is saying one figure, the HSE is saying something else.  It seems extraordinary that the HSE service plan refers to a figure of &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million and the Department of Health and Children suggests it is &euro;977 million.  Why do we not have clarity on funding?  The Considine working group referred to monitoring and having a framework of accountability between the Government and the HSE.  One sees this is missing when one asks a question about HSE funding.  There is a game going on and it is to the detriment of mental health services.  We need answers and we need to ask the Minister of State if he will put in place a more accountable framework for funding.  By doing this, the Minister of State will gain additional resources for mental health.</P>
        <P>Amnesty International has made the complex argument that resources should be underpinned by legislation and a statutory right to access services.  That raises major legal issues but I welcome the views of the Minister of State on these demands.  What is the amount of money that has been received from the sale of residential assets?  Have any been sold, has the money come back and has it been ring-fenced?  We need to know the baseline figures for funding to assess what can be implemented and what is feasible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand why Senator Fitzgerald went over time because this is a very important debate and there is much to be said.  One could spend the day speaking and we would not cover every aspect of it.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I took great heart from some of what he said.  I will endeavour not to repeat what he said or the points made by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the end of her contribution, Senator Fitzgerald pointed out that we are in difficult times.  The Minister of State must fight very hard to maintain the level of funding for the mental health services.  Across the board, there will be challenges ahead.  Senator Fitzgerald questioned how the Minister of State can say that mental health should be prioritised.  The survival and recovery of this country in difficult times is dependent on the well-being of people.  Our only hope of getting through the challenging times ahead is in the resilience and capacity of people to take on these challenging times and come out at the other end.  This is not about mental health services as we have become familiar with them over recent years.  The debate we are having concerns the impact of the recession on mental health and well-being of our people.  It is in the interest of our people and the recovery of the country that the well-being and mental health of people are supported and nurtured to grow their capacity for resilience.  The Minister of State has a very strong case to make for the protection, in so far as possible, of the budget for mental health services, not just as we thought of it until now but for the support and growth of the capacity of the well-being of our people.  In these difficult times we are aware of the impact the recession is having on many people and its adverse consequences.  It is an increasingly vulnerable time for those with existing mental health problems.  It is also an increasingly vulnerable time for people who have never experienced mental health challenges.</P>
        <P>This is not just an Irish financial crisis, it is also a global one.  At the outset the World Health Organization warned that the economic downturn would spark a rise in the incidence of mental illness and health problems as people turned to alcohol, tobacco and drugs to get them through.  With the country being hit particularly hard, it is inevitable that the health and well-being of Irish people will also be adversely affected.  There is a proven link between times of economic hardship and an increased demand on mental health services.  In The Economics of Mental Health Care in Ireland, the 2008 report of the Mental Health Commission, the overall cost of poor mental health in this country is estimated at &euro;3 billion.  One should bear this figure in mind.  In the forthcoming budget it is said we need to make savings of &euro;6 billion.  The report sets out a compelling economic case for increased investment in mental health services and the point is made that we cannot afford to not invest in them.  That is how we should see it, namely, <Col N="596"/>as an investment in people.  It is also an investment in our recovery in getting through these difficult times.</P>
        <P>While we do not have figures for this country, research has been undertaken recently in the United Kingdom which shows the impact of the economic downturn on individuals.  An across the board increase is apparent in all manifestations of mental health difficulties.  The impact of the downturn will expose more people to risk factors, including unemployment and other major life changes such as poverty, an unanticipated disruption of income, an uncertain and increasingly stressful work environment and the impact of debt and financial strain.  We must bear in mind that the suddenness of the change has had an impact on people and their capacity to adjust.  We should also bear in mind the uncertainty of the times we live in and the fear generated.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has outlined the many improvements made in intervention and the goals set out in A Vision for Change and his policy on where we want to go and the direction in which we want to take the intervention services.  The See Change campaign is necessary because we must consider what we can do in terms of education, increasing awareness, prevention and boosting people&rsquo;s psychological well-being and mental health.  There have been positive developments in that respect in recent years.  We must focus on these issues, in particular.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State inquired whether we should look at groups or consider the issue on a national level.  This is not just about a responsibility to tackle existing levels of mental illness, it is also about preventing an increase and supporting people who might not previously have been vulnerable to the onset of mental health challenges.  We are in a time of change and there is an increasing risk posed to far more people than we could have imagined a couple of years ago.  Whatever strategy is put in place must take this into account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any figure that emerges this year or next year should be treated with caution.  The Minister of State has indicated he will look at the figures to consider whether we are effective in what we are doing and if they support the approach taken.  However, when the goals and targets were set, times were different.  Circumstances have changed.  Therefore, when figures are presented, we must interpret them with caution, as they may not necessarily be an indicator of the effectiveness of what we are doing, rather they may be an indicator of what is happening in the difficult times we are experiencing.</P>
        <P>We must be clear about a number of issues in terms of prevention and increasing capacity.  We are in a time of fear.  Uncertainty brings a sense of helplessness which increases one&rsquo;s vulnerability.  For that reason, it is important that we show leadership at political level and are clear about having a plan and saying we will get through these difficult times.  To that end, we must have an effective national recovery plan.</P>
        <P>We must promote a healthy lifestyle.  The use of alcohol and other substances is detrimental to one&rsquo;s health.  It is possible to promote a healthier lifestyle and resilience by taking exercise, good nutrition, getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep, improving coping skills and tolerance levels and encouraging people to do things they enjoy.  We also know how important it is to engage in purposeful activity and to have a reason to get up in the morning.  Social contact is essential, as social isolation can result in an increased level of mental illness.  This poses a challenge with so many joining the live register.  We must say what we can offer people who suddenly find themselves without employment.  There are needs in the community that we are not in a position to meet, but many who have a lot to offer are now signing on the live register.  They need a reason to get out of bed in the morning and to get out and about.  They need a purposeful meaning to their existence and to feel they are contributing.  They also need to come into <Col N="597"/>contact with others.  We must, therefore, encourage social contact.  There is an argument to be made in that regard.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We must consider growing our systems of support and how we can generate positivity.  We need to examine the relentless negative messages being received across the board.  We all have a role to play in that regard.  I do not suggest we should not be honest with people or that we should stick our heads in the sand.  We cannot do this, but we all have a responsibility to support people to get through these difficult times.  Relentless negative messages increase the sense of fear and helplessness and reduce people&rsquo;s mood and thereby their resilience.  While we have limited control over what we say to certain elements of the media, particularly since the media have become such a powerful communicator, we have some control when it comes to the public service element.  I feel strongly about the negative messages continuously sent by the public service broadcaster.  There is a balance to be struck.  I am not blaming anyone or apportioning responsibility.  We have as much of a responsibility to show leadership and that we have a plan, but the public service broadcaster must try to meet us halfway when it comes to promoting the well-being of our people.  That is not being done.</P>

        <P>I also compliment Senator Corrigan on what she has just said because it is something on which I also intend to dwell.  What she has said about negative messages in the public service media and public debate is important and something I wish to address.  We have a serious problem in that regard.  Politicians are sometimes afraid to raise the issue because they fear they will be accused of trying to cover up their own failures or wrongdoings or closing down debate on accountability in society.</P>
      
        <P>It is all the more to Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s credit that she raised the issue, since we must insist on a higher quality of public debate.  We must find an appropriate balance that allows for the necessary interrogation of public policy, Government decision making and the mistakes of the past, that is, the necessary search for accountability, while not destroying the potential for the uplifting of people&rsquo;s spirits.  The media has many questions to answer in this regard.</P>
        <P>I have had the good fortune never to have suffered from depression.  That said, I went through a difficult period during my first year and a half of college.  One might call it growing pains.  I experienced something that came close to depression and it took me ages to settle down.  My mother told me I should get out, do something for someone else and get involved in a voluntary organisation because, if I did, I would realise how much I had to be thankful for.  I recount this with trepidation as I know that there is a great danger in the snap-out-of-it mentality.  That is not what I mean to suggest.  Mental health difficulties must be taken seriously, so one person advocating positivity when another is experiencing dark times and suffering can do great damage.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, our society must discuss whether we are living sufficiently for others or whether the individualism that has crept into our community life and our country in recent years has contributed partly to this problem.  When conversing with another Senator, he mentioned how mental health does not seem to suffer in war time because people are more cohesive and have a common enemy and a shared sense of struggle.  In times of economic recession, people might suffer too much in silence and believe their problems are unique to them.  This situation might be made all the worse if our society has lost the habit of its members depending on and living for one another.</P><Col N="598"/>
        <P>The great Viktor Frankl, with whom many people would be familiar and who wrote the book <i>Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning</i>, quoted the philosopher Nietzsche when reflecting on how some people in Auschwitz coped well with their suffering while others became rather bestial in their behaviour towards one another.  That quote is: &ldquo;He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.&rdquo;  The person who has a reason to live, be it religious faith, a deep religious or spiritual sense of the ultimate meaning of our existence, the love of a family member or a great professional or vocational project, is much better able to cope with the sufferings and challenges of life, especially those found in exceptional times such as those in which we live.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For this reason, I welcomed many of the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks.  For example, I welcomed his mention of breaking down stigma and the work of See Change.  I had the good fortune of speaking at the recent awards ceremony of the Lundbeck Art Against Stigma project.  People experiencing mental health problems created works of art, including paintings and sculptures.  It was uplifting to be among such people and their professional supporters, loved ones and families.  Breaking down stigma is important, as is the emphasis on the problems of discrimination and social attitudes.  However, it is not enough.  Some of the most important words in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech were his statement of how it was particularly important that we watch out for one another.</P>
        <P>We must get to a new point in society at which we not just reflect on our problems as individuals but also revert to thinking as a community about the challenges we face and our responsibilities to one another.  I am encouraged by the work of the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training, ASIST, workshops, which have trained 18,000 people to help.  We have often heard stories about people saying they did not know, had no hint of it or did not recognise the problems.  That resources are being used to prepare people to spot problems and look out for others by helping them towards supports and strategies is excellent.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise the good work being done by various private sector bodies, for example, Headstrong.  I had the positive experience of attending some events organised by Ms Violet Gavin and Positive Mental Health in Galway.  Her good work, arising out of her long experience of life, is about going into schools to get peers to mentor their fellow students and to involve them in group discussions on matters they would not normally discuss with one another.  What a wonderful civic contribution this work represents.  It is an attempt to try to ensure people&rsquo;s happiness and positive mental health by getting students of psychology or related areas in college to give of their free time by visiting schools and leading debates.</P>
        <P>We cannot ignore the statistics.  Where suicide is concerned, the statistics of the past two years seem to suggest that the situation is much the same.  Some 104 deaths by suicide were registered in the first quarter of 2010 whereas 106 were registered in the same period in 2009.  We are trending along the middle range compared with other European states, but this is not the complete picture.  The link between suicide, recession and financial hardship is irrefutable and the link between unemployment and suicide is indisputable.  The live register figures are constantly rising.  The Minister of State cited a 24% increase in suicide figures since 2008.  I have spoken to a psychiatrist friend and no one will be surprised to hear the anecdotal evidence, not just of suicide, but of people who have attempted suicide or self-harm presenting.  A serious problem, it can be directly linked with the economic recession and the challenges we are facing.</P>
        <P>It is somewhat like the nature versus nurture debate.  Some people will face mental health challenges because of their genes or personal circumstances, but a significant part of the problem undoubtedly relates to society&rsquo;s anti-nurturing nature.  The challenges our society faces make matters worse for people.  Therefore, we must be wary of how expenditure cuts might have a profoundly negative effect on people&rsquo;s health.  This issue must be tackled.</P><Col N="599"/>
         <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Economic concerns seem insignificant when we consider the bigger picture.  Our collective and individual health must be the utmost priority of Government policy.  I am not quite clear on the Government&rsquo;s plans in respect of psychiatric nurses, so I am anxious that there be an exemption from cuts and certainly no disproportionate cuts in the area of mental health staff.  As a Galway man, I welcome the improvements in Ballinasloe with 50 community nursing units and 25 day places.</P>
        <P>We must consider the greater causes of mental health difficulties.  We must examine honestly how family breakdowns and changed family experiences affect people&rsquo;s lives.  We must also examine how our culture contributes.  Our media is either too serious or too flippant.  We need a media that can interrogate the challenges and problems of the day while helping people to find positivity.  There will need to be a proper accounting by church and State bodies for past mistakes, but the media must be careful not to destroy the sources of hope in people&rsquo;s lives.  I refer not just to sources of spiritual hope but also a sense of the meaning of life that is vital to people&rsquo;s well-being.  According to experts in psychiatry and psychology, with a decline in religious belief and practice goes a greater likelihood of mental health suffering and difficulty.  I do not want to make a separate case, but the spiritual dimension of life must be addressed.  It is important for the media to take account of this and to help people to find sources of hope in the same way it asks hard questions of the Government and public agencies.</P>
        <P>We must not have our media driving people into an individualistic, selfish, m&eacute; f&eacute;in mentality where they focus only on how they are likely to be affected by problems but must develop a communitarian response to the challenges we face.  We will have to ask the hard questions of our media but we will only be able to ask those questions credibly if we invite the media into a dialogue rather than throw brick-bats at them for what they will perceive as a privilege and a self-interested place in public life.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney.  I listened to his presentation in my office.  He never fails to touch me.  I am probably embarrassing him because he does not like bouquets being thrown to him for the way he handles his brief and conducts his Ministry.  I heard him say he took time out two years ago, equipped himself with what he calls his bible, A Vision for Change, read his brief and proceeded to go around the country.  I have heard at first hand from units the Minister of State has visited throughout the country about the hands-on approach he takes.  Not alone is he a hard worker but he has great empathy &mdash; I would use the word &ldquo;sympathy&rdquo; meaning sympathy in a positive way &mdash; for people who find themselves experiencing mental health issues.  In my eight years in the Seanad I have been associated with the health brief over two terms.  I take my hat off to the Minister of State because I have never worked with a Minister who has immersed himself or herself in a brief as much as Deputy Moloney has.  I congratulate him and his staff.  The Minister of State always tells me it is the good staff he has who make his job that little bit easier.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>I draw attention to an article by Sara Burke in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday.  We have discussed the national broadcaster and the media.  The headline on this opinion and analysis article was &ldquo;The &euro;2 billion health cure that won&rsquo;t make us sick&rdquo;, and it was about the &euro;1 billion in the health budget of 2010 that could give us more for less.  It is not often we hear or talk about <Col N="600"/>such ideas.  Of that &euro;1 billion two thirds of the projected saving was to be achieved by pay cuts and the remaining &euro;400 million could be saved by deals done with pharmacists on prescriptions and contracts made with general practitioners and dentists.  That article was well thought out and full of foresight.  I congratulate all concerned because it proved such a saving could be achieved.</P>
        <P>For the few minutes I have I shall concentrate on adolescent and child psychiatry, if the Minister of State will bear with me.  Again, I turn to the media.  I was very taken, as I always am, by Jamie Smyth, writing in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He might not always write the article I agree with or would defend in the House but, in fairness to him, he is a very balanced writer, particularly in matters relating to child psychiatry and the hospitalisation of children in adult psychiatric units.  Last Monday, Jamie Smyth wrote about nine children who were hospitalised in the adult unit in Limerick Regional Hospital.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of this.  An investigation is taking place led by Mr. Hugh Kane, chief executive officer of the Mental Health Commission.  If a child presents as a danger to himself or herself, or to the community, we must keep that child in a safe place.  There will be times when we have no option other than to hospitalise a young person in an adult unit.  When this case is investigated I hope that will be the reason for so doing, even though it was inappropriate, and that the decision was not taken for other reasons.</P>
        <P>Of those nine children a number were aged under 15 years; three being 14 and one 13 years of age.  I was delighted to read &mdash; that is the balance found in writers such as Jamie Smyth &mdash; that Mr. Martin Rogan, the assistant national director of the HSE, spoke out to say it was not appropriate for children to be hospitalised in that way.  The HSE is doing its level best and I am delighted that next month a new unit will open in Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in&rsquo;s constituency which will provide further beds for children and adolescents.  One hopes that will take care of the problem, which may be unique to Limerick.  Perhaps social deprivation has a role to play in the reasons children are admitted to psychiatric units when there is nowhere else for them.  One hopes Limerick will not experience that situation again because its neighbour in Galway will have a unit that will also include my area in the north west.  By the end of the year there will be 52 dedicated beds for young people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was delighted to hear the Minister of State state that Grangegorman Hospital is now closed for referrals.  Even as I say that name I feel the hair rising on the back of my head.  I visited the hospital, as did the Minister of State, in our capacity as members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Blanchardstown hospital will have a new unit up and running by February 2011 and Letterkenny General Hospital, just north of Sligo, is to have a new unit.  There is progress and I know the Minister of State is doing his level best to ensure this moves on.</P>
        <P>I have a matter to bring to the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention about which I will talk to him in private.  I have a file that I will copy and give to him concerning a very sad case.  Children as young as six and seven years of age are suffering from anorexia nervosa.  I have raised this issue on a number of occasions; the Acting Chairman will know I am always calling for debates.  I shall take the few seconds that remain to me to ask the Minister of State a question.  There is a centre, the Marino Therapy Centre, but it is not in a psychiatric hospital setting.  Conventional medicine and conventional psychiatrists might not have much faith in it but my file shows that several young people have been treated in this centre which has proved to be enormously successful.  However, it has also proved enormously expensive, costing &euro;2,000 per month for families who have a young person suffering from this condition.  At any time that would be a vast amount of money but at this time it is unreasonable to ask anybody to pay even &euro;200 per month, never mind &euro;2,000.  It appears that different regions of the country are prepared to fund <Col N="601"/>this cost for families.  Naturally, families in receipt of funding from the HSE are slow to divulge what they are receiving to people who are not getting the same kind of funding.  One can understand that.  I shall copy the file I have which concerns a very sad case and the Minister of State might see his way to talking to me about it.</P>
        <P>When children find themselves in adult units self-imposed isolation comes into play.  They are less motivated to interact with adults and do not enjoy the pastimes senior psychiatric patients do, playing bingo and suchlike.  There is a need to consider a different way of treating young psychiatric patients &mdash; that is what the Marino Therapy Centre does.  We should create a situation where children can have more access to outdoor facilities, whether with a care worker or a social worker, and can be monitored.  Also, they could have access to computers and those types of things.  I wish we had more time, but as I always tell the Minister of State, he is no stranger to this House and perhaps if we could do this once a month, things might move on.  Instead of being critical of the media, as we have a right to be, we might create a base in this House for highlighting the problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Seanad once again.  As Senator Feeney has said, he is no stranger.  Mental health services continue to report an increase in the number of people suffering from stress.  This has been linked directly to the recession, as has been identified by other speakers.  The report by the Samaritans last year showed one in ten of the calls it received related to the financial crisis and issues relating to debt.  There is an unquestionable link between times of economic hardship and increased demands on mental health services which are in need of reform.  A failure to act will have long-term consequences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The impact of the global economic difficulties on mental health has been recognised by the secretary general of the World Health Organization who said, &ldquo;It is essential to learn from past mistakes and counter this period of economic downturn by increasing investment in health and the social sector.&rdquo;  The inadequate funding of mental health services in times of economic prosperity has impacted on the present situation.  We cannot neglect these services because they are needed much more than ever before given the scale of the impact of the recession.  Mental health services are reporting people visiting them daily who are suicidal, depressed or both because they have lost their jobs or their incomes have collapsed.  I know many people who have had the sad reality of suicide visited upon their families.  This is always a very difficult subject, and especially difficult is the lack of closure in such cases where it might have been thought possible to have helped someone before he or she took the final, awful step.</P>
        <P>Having been a member of the sub-committee on suicide as well as of the Joint Committee on Health and Children when the Minister of State was in the Chair, I am very well aware of his interest in this subject.  He recognises that people have a whole change in their sense of self worth and cannot see any way out.  Losing a job or having a chronically reduced income can have a major impact on someone suffering from mental illness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I suggest that to reduce services drastically is not the way forward.  People who have never suffered from anxiety or depression are expressing that view to me now at my clinics.  A report by the Mental Health Commission, entitled The Economics of Mental Health Care in Ireland, estimates that the annual overall cost of poor mental health in this country is &euro;3 billion or 2% of GNP.  That would suggest that cuts which serve to deepen this problem would simply create a false economy and fail to address the forthcoming budget in any meaningful way.</P>
        <P>In the middle of economic recession, the enormous cost of mental health problems for the economy cannot be swept under the carpet.  We need to enhance investment in mental health care.  As the Irish Medical Organisation has pointed out, 25% of people in receipt of illness <Col N="602"/>benefit in 2009 cited mental health issues as the reason they were unfit for work.  If we are serious about getting people back to work, we cannot ignore these figures.</P>
        <P>Amnesty International, working with people who have directly experienced mental health problems, have offered three proposals for dealing with the current situation.  First, it suggests that the Mental Health Act 2001 be reviewed and updated in line with the new UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It says the relevant Department, not just the Department of Health and Children, should take action on mental health and that new legislation should be introduced to deliver appropriate community-based mental health services.  These are all aspirations in A Vision for Change, and I add my support to the proposals.</P>
        <P>An issue very close to my heart and on which I have not received any clarity is the decision to close St. Michael&rsquo;s in the constituency of Tipperary South which was announced on 9 January last.  This stunned the entire community because there was no consultation with local health users, the staff or management of the unit.  It was obvious that a proper assessment of the needs of mental health patients had not been carried out.  This was confirmed when I discovered that the option appraisal was, in effect, a collection of random thoughts, riddled with errors and incomplete sentences which did not serve to allay any misgivings I had about that decision.  The decision has further impacted because the 49 beds in that acute unit in St. Michael&rsquo;s are part of the general hospital complement and therefore impact on the size of the hospital.  It is obvious that to take 49 beds out of the hospital will have a serious impact.  Can the Minister of State clarify the matter?</P>
        <P>I want to ask as well about the three recently vacated wards in St. Luke&rsquo;s that are undergoing extensive refurbishment.  It seems considerable money is being spent on them.  Will the Minister for State give the reason and purpose of this?  It is a pity this money was not spent when there were patients in those wards because it would have made much more sense.  The Minister of State visited the unit and his horror was evident as he discussed the medieval conditions within which these people and the nursing staff had to operate.  I would like if he could clarify this issue.</P>
        <P>I reaffirm my belief that A Vision for Change, which is supposed to be the blueprint for the future of mental health services, is being used as a propaganda tool.  I do not understand how the needs of service users in Kilkenny require greater relevance than those in Tipperary South.  Again, I have an issue with clarity and ask the Minister of State how much money has been realised from the sale of HSE lands in Tipperary South.  When the Minister of State was Chair of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, he said that any money realised from the sale of mental health facilities or HSE lands would be red circled and reinvested in the mental health services.  We were delighted at the time to hear that the money was going to be reinvested in the mental health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards closing mental health units without the community services being in place, I still have serious concerns about the announcement that the unit in Tipperary South is to close and the services are to be transferred to Kilkenny.  Not a block has been laid yet, even though the Minister of State officiated in turning a sod there.  South Tipperary has some of the worst employment blackspots in the country.  We have seen the reconfiguration of health services there being driven by a group of people whose personal interests seem to be hell-bent on centralising services in Kilkenny.  That goal, I believe, is being put before patient welfare.</P>
        <P>There is no clarity on how decisions are arrived at.  I submitted a freedom of information request last February in this regard which indicated that local stakeholders, including patients, their families, consultants and nursing staff, were told the news by Mr. Pat Healy at a Tuesday executive hospital meeting, which news became a formal announcement the following Friday <Col N="603"/>and without any consultation whatever.  It flies in the face of every sort of communication mandate possible, and the people of Tipperary South are still reeling from that decision and asking what is left for the community and patients, where the community facilities are and whether there are home-based treatment teams, crisis houses, their location in the event, how much money has been invested in them, etc.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Minister of State a number of questions about the services in Tipperary South and how the geography was divided up.  He said it was a matter of some concern to him as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health that &ldquo;People with a mental illness are a hidden minority who suffer from pervasive discrimination.&rdquo;  I do not accept that people with mental health illness, of whom there are as many in south Tipperary as anywhere else in the country, should suffer geographical discrimination.  I would like to know how a hospital in Kilkenny, which is operating to full capacity &mdash; I have checked this with the staff who tell me the unit is as busy as the unit in south Tipperary &mdash; is to deal with patients from south Tipperary.  The Mental Health Commission has stated there is in place a legal agreement in regard to services at South Tipperary General Hospital, of which the acute unit is part.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An announcement was made by a director of nursing in the psychiatric service that the night superintendent, a CNM III grade, is to be downgraded to a CNM II grade from January next.  Perhaps the Minister of State will set out the reason for this downgrading and the diminution of the management structure within the service.  I thank the Minister of State for his attention and ask that if he cannot answer all my questions today, some of which I appreciate are fairly parochial, he do so at a later date.  The people of south Tipperary are interested in having the best possible services irrespective of their geography.  There should be equity and fairness in respect of mental health services, in particular given there are so many lands and properties within HSE ownership which the Minister of State agreed would be red circled for the future mental health needs of the people of south Tipperary.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will explain the reason for the disconnect in respect of past decisions and announcements of which neither he nor the Minister were aware and how people within a regional structure can announce decisions to close services, announcements which came as an absolute surprise to everyone from the top of the structure down to the service user.</P>

	<P>I am delighted the Acting Chairman is being generous with time to enable Senators express their angst, thus ensuring their mental health is catered for in the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who receives much praise, rightly so, in this Chamber.  The issue of mental health is important to the Seanad.  It is an issue which thankfully all parties are agreed on.  A Vision for Change is an important roadmap for the current and future Governments.  We all need to get behind it and ensure it is delivered.  A Vision for Change is equivalent to the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs, EPSEN, Act.  There are in existence a number of important documents that will stand the test of time, one of which is A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are facing into a very tough budget and there is much lobbying taking place in regard to mental health services.  The Green Party&rsquo;s policy is a rights-based approach to mental health care.  However, an issue arises in terms of available resources.  The Minister of State cannot implement A Vision for Change to the extent that he would like if he does not have the funding to do so.  Currently, less than 7% of the overall health budget is allocated to mental health.  Green Party policy is that this needs to be increased to 12%.  I support the Minister of State in his ongoing discussions in relation to the budget in terms of ensuring the amount of money being cut or retained in the mental health area is not affected to the same extent as many other areas.  We need to increase in this and every subsequent budget the proportion of money being <Col N="604"/>spent on mental health to the extent that we eventually increase it to 12% of overall spending on health.</P>
        <P>From a parochial point of view, I commend the Minister of State on the good news he announced today in relation to the opening of a new 20-bed unit in Merlin Park Hospital, which will replace the current psychiatric unit for child and adolescent services.  It is important that even in times of recession we continue to open new facilities.  The Minister of State also announced the opening of a similar service in Cork, which is good news.  A Vision for Change deals with issues such as community and primary care.  A pilot project called Jigsaw in Galway, which has been extremely successful, must be continued.  We often put in place pilot projects which are enormously successful but when the funding runs out they are discontinued, with the loss of experience gained.  I would not like this to happen to Jigsaw.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A Vision for Change has been championed by the Minister of State.  However, there will<?oasys _jy ?>be enormous changes in our health structure in the coming years.  In this regard, we<?oasys _jy ?>need to ensure in relation to any changes in the HSE that we focus on the key issue of primary care and of supporting communities, in particular in times of recession.  We must support communities in providing good services to their people.  There are many ways that this can be done that do not involve Government intervention.  Most mental health care is provided by families, communities, including neighbours and so on.  There is much we can do.  Remaining positive is not easy in recessionary times.  When speaking earlier to my wife she mentioned a number of positive measures in this regard, including listening to Lyric FM rather than some of the other channels, eating and sleeping well, which is often difficult to do when one is worried about all the appalling figures being thrown about by the Opposition, the media and often the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we were.  Let us hope it can continue.  Meditation is important.  An over-reliance on tobacco, drugs or alcohol is not good.  I am sure the Licensed Vintners Association will not be happy to hear me say that.  It is important to focus on what is good.  We should be counting our blessings.  Many people in this country are stressed and fearful of the recession.  While many people are badly affected by this recession, many others are not but are getting caught up in the stress associated with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like other Senators, I too would like to refer to the media.  During the boom, when we borrowed a great deal of money which we now have to pay back, we had a wonderful dynamic in that we were constantly hearing on the radio estate agents telling us the boom would go on forever, it was a great time to buy and that while the boom would peak there would be no dip in house prices and that the worst that could happen would be that prices would level off.  Why were the media constantly engaging with estate agents?  The positive cheerleading of that time has been replaced by absolute negativity, with economists now being invited onto the radio, each trying to outdo the other in terms of stating how bad things are going to get.  A newspaper recently quoted that we owe &euro;250 billion, or a quarter of a trillion, to the European Central Bank.  Where will all of this stop?  All sorts of figures are being thrown about which are frightening people.  I am not suggesting these matters should not be reported on, rather that they should be responsibly reported with both sides of the balance sheet being recorded.  Balance is important.</P><Col N="605"/>
        <P>Another phenomenon is that of group think on websites such as <i>www.politics.ie</i> where many people who are wound up to 90 are writing all types of vitriolic things.  Those involved are purporting to be people representing society.  However bad our public broadcaster is, sites such as <i>www.boards.ie </i> or <i>www.politics.ie</i> are creating hysteria in terms of their content in regard to how bad things are and how badly people are being hammered.  That is not good for mental health.</P>
        <P>In terms of our public service broadcaster, I am not suggesting that RTE start broadcasting nature programmes, play soothing music or show pictures of rabbits and so on.  That is not RTE&rsquo;s job in terms of current affairs.  Its job is to report the truth but the key is that it gets the balance right and I believe it is very much swayed currently in terms of hysteria and talking ourselves into a state of panic.  That is not good for the mental health of our people, especially our children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key aspect of which we as adults should always be aware is that the mental health of children is affected by the various negative comments being made.  I appreciate the Acting Chairman has been very generous, as he was to the other speakers.  We must take special care of our children in this very difficult time.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Bradford.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The debate is on the effects of the recession on mental health.  The effects, to quote a friend of mine, are extraordinary.  The need to look after our mental health is far more important today than it has ever been in the history of our State.  That is the reason it is important we provide adequate funding and the services people need.</P>
        <P>Young Fine Gael has a motion before its convention next weekend regarding the spending on mental health but we must put things in context.  We must examine the number of cases of suicide in this country in a two to three-year period.  They have increased.  They were people who were faoi bhr&uacute;.  That pressure, as the Minister of State is well aware from his work, comes from a variety of different sources but predominantly from the recession, alcohol abuse, unemployment, sexuality and a myriad of other issues.  We must allow people the opportunity to go to a safe harbour or refuge and in that respect, the job of Government is very important in providing services for people who are vulnerable.</P>
        <P>We are talking about people, not statistics.  The suicide rate is increasing by 25% but that means nothing unless we put it in context.  It is the number of people that is relevant.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in October, Dr. Conor Farren of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital spoke about the link between alcohol consumption and suicide.  A total of 527 people took their lives last year.  That is an increase of 100 on the 2008 figure, which was 427.  It is far more important to stress the number of people who commit suicide than the percentage increase because we are talking about people.</P>
        <P>The figures are frightening.  The quality of life of married couples and partners who are not married is at risk from this recession and in that respect the issue of mental health arises.  Senator Fitzgerald spoke about having a roadmap.  We have the roadmap, A Vision for Change, but what we need is a willingness to embark upon that journey with resourcing.  The embargo on recruitment in certain areas of the Health Service Executive is having a profound impact on the delivery of services.</P>
        <P>While we will come out of the recession, thousands of people who are struggling with depression and other mental health illnesses will be mired in the difficulties they are encountering today unless we put in place a structure.  Early intervention for young people is vital.  The waiting times for assessment are unacceptably high but what stress does to people is <Col N="606"/>extraordinary.  We see that every day.  Every day all of us in this Chamber meet people who are under pressure and are struggling financially, emotionally and psychologically.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an obligation on us as legislators and the Government not to cut mental health funding.  We have a cross-party group in this Oireachtas which has done good work.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to give him credit, has been very sincere in his actions as Minister of State but I am genuinely concerned that if we embark upon a negative course of action regarding mental health, we will leave a legacy that will take a generation to change in terms of the policy.  I hope we will not do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I do not have any professional qualifications in this field but the subject of mental health has been high on the political and health agendas in recent years.  That is a welcome development, and the action and involvement of people such as the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, has helped in that regard.</P>
        <P>Mental health is no longer a taboo subject.  We all have some words of wisdom on the matter but we are talking about the effect of the recession on mental health.  I agree with what my colleague, Senator Buttimer, said about ensuring funding and investment levels continue.  We all appreciate that the Government faces a difficult financial position but some areas must be sacrosanct in so far as that is possible, and I hope that mental health funding will be in that area of safety.</P>
        <P>I had not intended to speak on this matter but having been in the Chair and listened to my colleagues&rsquo; contributions, it struck me that we, as politicians, have a duty in these difficult economic times to perform our politics in a way and using language which does not depress the country.  Political practice and party political gamesmanship in Ireland and in most European countries over the decades have been practised in a way that is confrontational.  In recent times the observer of Irish politics would have noticed that, generally speaking, we are now talking the language of Armageddon.  We are going from recession to depression to almost the end of Ireland as we know it.  It is frightening for people when they listen to the radio, watch television or read the newspapers.  They see nothing but bleak headlines, and an air of almost total despondency, despair and hopelessness is created.  That is having a profoundly negative impact on citizens.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in mentioned that many people now do not wish to listen to programmes on the radio.  They certainly do not wish to listen to news programmes or read the newspapers because it is all bad news.  There is a responsibility on every citizen to be at least reasonably aware of the state of difficulties in the country but we have a political responsibility, in highlighting the awful economic plight of the country, to illustrate as well that there is hope, that a way can be found to turn this country around and that the country and its citizens have a future.  We all must be more responsible in that regard in terms of the language we use.</P>
        <P>It is part of the political and economic challenge we face as politicians to highlight the difficulties but also to highlight the fact that solutions can be found and that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  The need for responsible politics does not just mean turning around the state of the economy.  It is also important to ensure people have a sense of hope and see there is a future for our country.</P>
        <P>When we talk about leadership, we should admit that we must present a type of politics which is not devoid of hope and that shows that there is a future.  The number of people who genuinely feel a sense of despair and hopelessness is disturbing, and it is affecting all strata of society and all age groups.  Parents see their children emigrating to find work.  Children see their parents unemployed.  College students see no future.  We have a responsibility in conducting our <Col N="607"/>normal political business to ensure we do not present a picture of Ireland devoid of hope because that will not be the case providing the correct decisions are made.  I commend the Minister of State on his ongoing efforts.  He has the support of every politician and party in the House as he continues to try to ensure services are provided for those in need of mental health facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>When I was notified about this debate, I thought it would be an ideal opportunity for Opposition Senators to criticise Government policy and I am so pleased to be able to say not one Senator has used this debate as a political outing.  It is right for me to acknowledge that underlying the comments of all Senators has been their proper concern about where we go from here in terms of funding.  Wearing my Minister of State hat, it is important for me to be loyal to the commitments made in A Vision for Change, but I will not use this occasion to dress things up as though I were not a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party.  I say this in the context of the difficulties we face as we move towards the budget.</P>
        <P>In the past two years, during which time I have often been in the House or before the Joint Committee on Health and Children, people have been asking whether we will stick to the commitments made in A Vision for Change.  Given the fact that four years of this ten-year programme have elapsed, issues have cropped up which must to be responded to.  I do not have enough time to address all of them, although I will try my best, and ask to be invited back to the House to deal with any issues I do not have time to speak about today.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald asked whether we would be able to fund the commitments made and properly referred to a person for whom I have a lot of time, Mr. Martin Rogan, assistant national director of mental health at the HSE.  At a recent meeting I attended he posed a similar question: can we talk about providing services that we do not have the financial wherewithal to fund?  That is the key question.  In view of the reduction in the budget of the Department of Health and Children by &euro;1 billion and the proposals we have made to the Government in the past two years which have culminated in this important budget, we will need to &mdash; to use a swanky word &mdash; reconfigure the spending of the Department on mental health services.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast asked many questions which I will not be able to answer now, but I will respond directly to her on each one within the next two weeks.  I recognise her ongoing concerns and will try to show her that A Vision for Change is based on a concept of delivering mental health support that is not confined to counties but makes use of catchment areas.  I have failed to get this message across.  A commitment was made that the proceeds of the sale of institutional properties would be ring-fenced for mental health services.  The expenditure of the &euro;50 million promised in the last budget was dependent on the sale of properties.  Let us be open about these matters.  We did not have &euro;50 million because we did not sell &euro;50 million worth of properties.  We have spent &euro;15 million so far and received money from the capital budget of the HSE to fund the items I mentioned.  I mention this not because I am trying to fly a flag, saying &ldquo;We are great because we have done this.&rdquo;  We have done only what we were asked to do in A Vision for Change and part of this has been the closure of the old hospitals.</P>
        <P>Many Senators spoke about the media.  I will not go down that road except to say this.  I do not believe for one minute that the media should pretend things are happening if they are not, nor should we expect them to.  However, there are people who are dependent on the media for their education on what is happening in the area of mental health.  As no one asked this question and it will not be taken up by anybody, I am really talking to myself on it.  When I embarked on the See Change campaign, I was depending on the media becoming interested, but this has not happened.  Members of the media did not attend the opening in the Mansion House or any of the subsequent events.  I do not mind this.  I attended an event in Donegal two <Col N="608"/>weeks ago as part of the campaign.  It was well attended and people spoke from the floor, as did Senators this afternoon, about the need to ensure funding was made available.  If we do not do this, people will say it has all been a pretence.  On my way home the next morning I bought <i>The Irish Times</i> and was disappointed, although not on a personal level, to see that the editorial referred to the See Change campaign as an overly cynical attempt to pretend we were doing something.  That is a sad reaction.  I would have preferred if <i>The Irish Times</i>, with others in the media who might have had doubts about what we were doing and our sincerity &mdash; not our personal sincerity but that of the Department &mdash; had tried to find out before they wrote such columns whether it was a pretence.  The evidence was available.  I received thank you cards from the organisers and those who had attended which mentioned the benefit to be gained.  The See Change campaign involves visits to every county.</P>
        <P>Some days later I did an interview with the <i>Irish Independent</i> &mdash; I am loath to mention the journalist, as journalists do not like to be mentioned specifically.  Rather than drawing down the wrath of the media once again, I gave an interview.  The journalist concerned had the idea that when I spoke about capital programmes I was talking through my hat.  I explained the six capital programmes that were under way, including the closing of the hospitals referred to in the inspector&rsquo;s report.  However, the sad reality, after I had waited the next day for a hopeful breakthrough in the media which would succeed in conveying to the public that we were going about our business, was that the commentary took the form of a message to patients at these mental hospitals that their stay would be for much longer than they had supposed.  I was so disappointed to see that response because I had tried to give hope to them.</P>
        <P>The issue of child and adolescent mental health issues was raised by many Senators.  Yesterday when I met Deputy Neville and his colleagues from the Irish Association of Suicidology, I asked them what they would do and what they would like to see.  I said we could not tackle the issue by way of a quick knee-jerk response to get headlines and asked them the way forward in terms of a proper strategy on mental health.  They told me the most important issue was that of mental health support for children and adolescents.  I concur.  I accept the point made by Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in about Jigsaw.  I have been to Galway and seen it.  I proposed to the Government that we should fund at least five such projects a year until we had one in each county because that is the way forward.  Jigsaw and Headstrong also receive financial support from international sources; however, more important, all outputs are independently assessed.</P>
        <P>We do not make a song and dance about the fact that we now have 52 beds in the child and adolescent mental health services, with a commitment to provide 100 beds.  The real challenge is not turning sods or achieving media exposure but ensuring we have appropriate community mental health teams available.  Early intervention is important.  Senator Corrigan advised me that people were presenting with depressive illnesses at much younger ages, including five, six and seven years.  It is clear the focus must be placed on this aspect.  When a person such as Dr. Tony Bates advises me that 70% of mental health supports should be provided during the child and adolescent years, it is clear that this must be the focus of the reconfiguration of funding.</P>
        <P>All Senators mentioned suicide prevention.  Of course, Opposition Senators and colleagues in my own party wonder out loud whether we can deliver on the commitments made in A Vision for Change.  I have always said the cosy way out of this is to park A Vision for Change, wait until the recession passes and deal with it then, but we are not doing this.  We are giving clear and specific commitments to close the old hospitals and drive the development of community supports.</P>
        <P>I have been reminded by my officials, whom I thank as they are, as usual, on the ball, that the expected income from the sale of properties is &euro;13 million.  At the end of this year we will need to tackle the capital programme for next year.</P><Col N="609"/>
        <P>I ask the Cathaoirleach to invite me back to talk about specific issues raised by Senators.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">Clearly we need to clarify publicly the funding in mental health services and how much it will cost to fund A Vision for Change.  Our objective is combining the budget for mental health services using the strategic funding for suicide prevention and more importantly changing public attitudes towards mental health.  As Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in said, this is not a party political proposal.  A Vision for Change is supported across the board by politicians and more importantly by the service users and clinical experts.  Regardless of who is in power, we need to drive on this change.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Many people are disappointed that 5.5% of the total budget goes to mental health.  I will not ride two horses because one will always fall off two horses; there is no point in me coming to the Seanad and saying what Members want to hear.  Of course we all want to see an increase in mental health funding.  As we debate the challenge for funding in the cancer programme and other programmes, our argument must be that given the enormous demands placed on us by our commitments in A Vision for Change, of course we must fund it.  Although we are talking about funding from, unfortunately, a decreasing pot, nevertheless we have the ability to provide funding through the sale of properties.  There are some substantial resources invested in mental health and these can be moved from the old institutions to the community.</P>
        <P>In referring to the new thinking in the Department, I thank the officials.  Ministers get great credit when something goes right, but it is the officials who advised me about the setting up of specific ring-fenced funding to bring about immediate change.  I am talking about the change in bringing people from institutionalised care into the community, which is working well.  It is up to us to try to tap into resources in order to continue that funding and I thank the co-funders of that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to bring a message of hope by saying that at the end of the year we will make our proposal on how the funding on mental health will be spent.  Of course, I use the term &ldquo;I hope&rdquo; in talking about increased funding.  I do not seek to try to separate me from my senior Minister &mdash; the pressure must go on her and the Government to provide that funding.  It is up to me to make my case within this area on how this budget in health should be spent.  Over the past two years I have listened to many people who advised me about the changes that should be made to do that.  Next week the Minister, Deputy Harney, who has a significant interest in suicide prevention, has invited Geoff Day and me to talk about what we can do to effect change in that area.  I take the points made by Senators Buttimer and Bradford; the fact that in excess of 500 deaths by suicide were recorded last year indicates that we need to prioritise mental health within the funding available.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen raised the issue about the media, which I have addressed.  I accept I have given little response to the issues Senator Prendergast raised.  I have clarified that the funding is ring-fenced as has been proved by what has been spent this year.  That commitment was made in the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, last year.  I cannot give the Senator a response on the three wards in St. Luke&rsquo;s or give details on the funding there.  However, we asked Dr. Hillery to engage with the staff in the hospital.  The day I went there to meet the Senator and other public representatives from the area, I acknowledged that the service providers not being aware of proposals in advance is not the way to do business.  I am trying to rectify that which is why I asked Dr. Hillery to engage there in order to ensure this was not an attempt to disregard the demands in south Tipperary.  Those were very specific questions the Senator asked and I will arrange to meet her in the next fortnight to give her a clear briefing on those issues.</P><Col N="610"/>
        <P>I fully support the concept of Jigsaw.  Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in and others referred to eating disorders.  The Marino clinic is also taking referrals from the HSE.  I have never come across so many issues pertaining to eating disorders as I have in the past year.  It was something foreign to me and I was not aware of it.  I recently meet Deputy McEntee and the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, to discuss the enormous demand on services to address this new phenomenon, if I might call it that.  I travelled to the UK to ascertain what its service providers were doing to encourage young people with eating disorders to engage with services.  I was impressed by what I saw there whereby people are provided with support in a clinical setting while at the same time they have the educational facilities on campus also.  In this area we are totally exposed by the lack of public beds to deal with eating disorders.  The enormous costs of accessing services in that area are beyond most families&rsquo; reach.  In prioritising we need to recognise that we have to make changes in that area.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan has often referred to the need to prioritise the needs of children and adolescents.  I wish I could say that all her requests would be addressed, but they will not be.  My strategy will be to retain the budget I had for last year and there will be changes in how the money is spent.  It is important for people to point out to me the areas that have come under the most pressure in order that we can respond to that.  Regarding the suicide prevention budget, I have met representatives of many groups in recent months who tell me that it is time to bring people together, spend money more strategically and set targets, similar to the model in Scotland.</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to go over my time.  I acknowledge I have left many questions unanswered and I would like the opportunity to come back in the new session to outline specifically the cost of A Vision for Change, what has been spent so far, what remains to be spent and more importantly whether we can deliver on A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I forgot to answer one very important question on the effect of the moratorium on mental health services.  We have been somewhat successful this year in getting from the employment control programme 100 nurses to deliver the service in Blanchardstown.  It is not blocked or closed down on the mental health side.  I have acknowledged the six capital projects that are in process.  They are directly linked to the inspector&rsquo;s report on the conditions of mental hospitals.  The message needs to go out that we have funded the closure of Grangegorman &mdash; for the first time since 1815 there have been no referrals.  We now have a modern facility in Blanchardstown.  Deputy Reilly has often quite properly asked me in the D&aacute;il about the plans for the new acute psychiatric unit in Beaumont to allow the closure of the facility in Portrane.  The funding is available and the project will begin in February 2011.  Senator Prendergast has acknowledged what we are doing regarding nursing in Clonmel.  Six months ago we turned the sod for a new 600-bed unit in Mullingar, which will allow us to close those awful wards in St. Loman&rsquo;s.  I am happy to say that the acute psychiatric unit in Letterkenny is near completion and will open this year.  There are new beds in Cherry Orchard, Galway and Cork for children and adolescents.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to go over my time.</P>

    <Title>EU Directive on Temporary Agency Work: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members of the House for the invitation to address them on the EU directive on temporary agency work.  This coincides with the recent initiation by my Department of a public consultation on the transposition of the EU directive into Irish law.  Ireland, along with all other member states of the European Union, is required to transpose the directive into domestic law and bring it into effect by 5 December 2011.  The directive will require the enactment of primary legislation.</P>
        <P>It is important, in the first place, to recognise the legitimate and valuable role that agency working plays in the economy.  On the one hand, it can assist employers to respond to shifts in demand, to cover for short-term absences and to meet short-term skill needs.  It can also be the option of choice of some people who can benefit from the flexibility, personal freedom and income it provides.  It can assist persons entering employment for the first time, help unemployed persons to return to employment or help retain persons in employment at times in their careers when they might be otherwise unemployed.  It can also act as a stepping stone to finding permanent employment.  It must also be acknowledged that agency work does not suit everyone&rsquo;s circumstances and that the very flexibility it offers can, in fact, be used in a less positive way by unscrupulous businesses.</P>
        <P>When launching the proposal for a directive in 2002, the European Commission presented the stated objective of the directive as being twofold: first, to improve the quality of temporary agency work by applying the principle of non-discrimination and, second, to establish a suitable framework for the use of temporary agency work to contribute to the smooth functioning of the labour market.  The Commission proposal stemmed from concerns that the temporary agency work sector in the EU included workers who are vulnerable in that agency workers typically have fewer benefits in basic working and employment conditions in terms of pay and working time compared with persons with open-ended employment with enterprises that directly hire them.  Moreover, they may be treated differently in other ways, such as not having access to collective facilities that are available to directly recruited employees in user undertakings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Temporary agency work is a unique, triangular form of employment, involving a temporary employment relationship subsisting between a temporary work agency &mdash; the employer &mdash; and a worker, who is assigned to work for, and under the control of, an undertaking.  It is the undertaking that avails of the employment of the agency worker that is often referred to as the user or hirer undertaking.  The consultation which my Department has embarked on is therefore in respect of a directive that establishes legal entitlements and obligations impacting on three parties: the agency worker, the employment agency and the user-hirer undertaking.  This contrasts with the standard binary relationship between employer and employee and which is a more characteristic feature of our existing suite of employment rights legislation, which affords protection to employees ranging from those in what might be termed standard employment relationships, including those with open-ended contracts, to persons involved in atypical employment relationships such as fixed-term work.  Uniquely, temporary agency working involves a contract of employment between the temporary work agency and the agency worker, on top of which sits a commercial contract regarding the supply of labour between the agency and the user-hirer undertaking.  There is no intention, as has been clearly articulated in the public consultation, in forthcoming legislation to transpose the directive to formally change the nature of this so-called triangular relationship.  Neither will it interfere with the employment status of agency workers or their entitlements to existing employment rights.</P><Col N="612"/>
        <P>Before delving into some of the core elements of the temporary agency work directive, I wish to avail of this opportunity to stress that, contrary to perception, agency workers are afforded protection under our existing suite of employment rights legislation.  Thus, agency workers, regardless of nationality, as well as agency workers posted by their employer from overseas to work temporarily in Ireland with a contract of employment to work in the State, are afforded the same rights as Irish employees.  This employment protection framework provides for transparent and easily accessible routes for remedial action and redress in cases where there has been a breakdown in the employment relationship.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Article 5.1 of the directive sets out the core principle of equal treatment that should apply to agency workers during their period of temporary assignment to work at a user undertaking.  It provides that the basic working and employment conditions of agency workers for the duration of their assignment at a user undertaking should be at least those that would apply if they had been recruited to that undertaking to occupy the same job.  Article 3 defines the essence of what constitutes basic working and employment conditions to include hours of work, overtime, breaks, rest periods, night work, holidays and public holidays and pay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the consultation, I am seeking the views of interested parties, in particular, on issues concerned with defining, for purposes of inclusion in implementing legislation, the constituent elements of pay that will be consistent with meeting the equal treatment requirement of Article 5.  Thus, for example, stakeholder comments and input to the consultation will help inform the legislative context in identifying the constituent elements of pay beyond basic pay to include, for example, overtime, shift work allowances and so forth that may be deemed appropriate for inclusion in the contractual entitlements of temporary agency workers to reflect their contribution for work done.</P>
        <P>Key elements of the debate in this regard concern the extent to which there are elements of remuneration such as incentives and rewards which reflect the specific and different quality of the relationship between the employer and permanent employee.  Views are being sought on the extent to which there may be exclusions from the scope of pay in respect of, for example, occupational pensions and financial participation schemes which reflect the long-standing nature of the relationship of directly recruited employees with their employer that would not normally apply to temporary agency workers temporarily assigned to work for a user undertaking.  Such elements of remuneration and rewards may be seen as not coming within the scope of pay and may be excluded from the equal treatment principle enshrined in Article 5.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The role that collective agreements or other workplace agreements or pay norms can play in the implementation of equal treatment rights for temporary agency workers is also a core issue.  This may be the case if pay norms in place in user undertakings go beyond those that arise under legislation, regulations or administrative agreements.  Currently, pay norms embraced under these institutional arrangements include the national minimum wage and conditions agreed under universally binding collective agreements, such as in registered employment agreements.  According to the terms of the directive, the principle of equal treatment for temporary agency workers in respect of basic working and employment conditions applies to the extent as would apply to directly recruited workers established under agreements that are deemed to be binding and general provisions in force in a user undertaking.  The views of stakeholders are being sought, therefore, on whether pay norms, which are incremental to those provided by legislative and other regulatory means, might also embrace, for example, pay scales or other contractual arrangements in place in the user undertaking.  Comment is also being invited on the pay norms that should come within the scope envisaged within the meaning of Article 3 of the directive and which are, accordingly, deemed to be binding and generally in force in user undertakings.</P><Col N="613"/>
        <P>Aside from establishing a general principle of non-discrimination between temporary agency workers and comparable employees directly recruited to an end-user undertaking in respect of basic pay and working conditions, the directive also embraces a number of additional aspects to ensure existing restrictions and prohibitions on temporary agency work will be reviewed periodically in order to verify whether the specific conditions underlying them still obtain &mdash; there are no such restrictions in Ireland; temporary agency workers will be informed of any vacant posts in the user undertaking and will not be prevented from forming a contract with the user undertaking after their temporary assignment; temporary agency workers will be given access, as are directly recruited workers, to what are termed collective facilities such as staff canteen, child care and transport services; dialogue between the social partners will be promoted to improve temporary agency workers&rsquo; access to training in temporary agencies and user undertakings; temporary agency workers will count for the purposes of calculating the threshold above which bodies representing workers are formed at either the temporary work agency or the user undertaking; and the user undertaking will provide suitable information on the use of temporary agency workers for the workers&rsquo; representatives.</P>
        <P>The directive also provides that individuals may seek remedial action for an infringement of their employment rights through an appropriate dispute settlement body.  The consultation invites views on how an agency worker might pursue a claim in such situations, as well as on the most appropriate means of pursuing such claims and the appropriate body for progressing such claims.  This should have regard to the substantial dispute resolution processes already in place under employment rights legislation.  Furthermore, member states are required to lay down rules on penalties applicable in the event of infringements which are to be vigorously enforced.  Such penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</P>
        <P>The directive provides for a number of derogations from the principle of equal treatment under certain conditions.  Article 5.4, for example, affords the social partners at national level the opportunity to negotiate and conclude an appropriate framework agreement which can derogate from the principle of equal treatment, provided there is an adequate level of protection for temporary agency workers.  This could relate, for instance, to the operation of a qualifying period before agency workers would enjoy equal treatment.  This option presents an opportunity to achieve a balanced outcome to meet the needs of employers for flexible labour supply, as well as achieving the objective of protecting agency workers.  I am in the process of facilitating discussions with the social partners to this end.</P>
        <P>The ability to conclude a framework agreement has implications for Ireland&rsquo;s labour market competitiveness.  In the United Kingdom, for instance, Ireland&rsquo;s closest market, agreement has been reached between the unions and employers for a 12-week qualifying period before the application of equal treatment, in terms of basic working conditions, to agency workers.  It is my sincere hope an agreement can be reached by the social partners reflecting the particular circumstances of the Irish labour market and the <i>de facto</i> position in other EU member states.  As the negotiation and conclusion of a framework agreement under the terms of the directive are within the gift of the social partners, the issue of a derogation from the directive&rsquo;s principle of equal treatment to include, for example, a qualifying period, does not form part of the public consultation.</P>
        <P>As is the norm in the enactment of primary legislation, my Department will, following the completion of the consultation process, undertake an impact analysis of the provisions to be included in implementing legislation transposing the directive.  This will have to take account of the fact that for many of the measures in the directive, it may not be possible to quantify costs and benefits as the statistical information available on the sector may be relatively limited.  Official data for the temporary agency sector are extremely limited.  In general, it is estimated that when we speak of the size of the temporary agency worker sector in Ireland, we are <Col N="614"/>speaking about agency workers representing approximately 2% of total employment.  On that assumption, the legislation to transpose the terms of the directive will potentially impact on approximately 40,000 agency workers.  In terms of absolute numbers, however, there is likely to have been a decline in the number of agency workers, given the severe reversal in the economic situation.  On the basis of the limited information available, it may be possible to carry out a qualitative and partially quantitative analysis of the potential impact of the directive.  It is intended that this work will be completed prior to the enactment of the implementing legislation.</P>
        <P>The House will be familiar with the possibility for member states, within the principles set out in the directive, to adapt the rules and definitions as laid out in it to their own specific circumstances, provided they afford a higher level of protection to agency workers.  The views provided by interested parties in response to this consultation will help fully inform this process.  With regard to the consultation, I am inviting views from a wide spectrum, in particular, from agency workers or their representatives, temporary work agencies or their trade organisations and user or hirer undertakings and employers generally and their representatives.  These views will assist in the preparation of the necessary implementing legislation which I look forward to bringing to the House for enactment in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am a substitute for my colleague, Senator John Paul Phelan, Fine Gael spokesperson in this area.  While I am not sure my views will fully reflect his thoughts on the directive, I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on it.  Its transposition will be the subject of legislation and this is probably the preamble to the debate we will have when it is introduced.  That is welcome because it is not the norm to have an opportunity to receive an overview in advance of the introduction of legislation.  This is helpful and perhaps we could learn from it in the case of other legislation.  It would be helpful to have an opportunity to receive an overview of legislation some months in advance in order that the Minister in question could take on board the views and concerns of the Opposition.  There is unanimity on what the Minister of State stated and I presume that when the legislation is brought before us for approval, it will be supported by all sides of the House, although we do not know on which side of the House each will be at that stage.</P>
        <P>The forthcoming legislation stems from an EU directive.  During the Lisbon treaty debate last year some claimed workers&rsquo; rights were being threatened by the European Union, but we focused on the fact that they had, in fact, been much enhanced since Ireland joined what was then the EEC in 1973.  In this directive we have an example of a framework from Brussels which, when put in place, will be to the benefit of agency workers.  However, we are now in a place where jobs must be the focus of everything.  Bill Clinton coined the phrase, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the economy, stupid,&rdquo; but now it must be, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s job, jobs, jobs, stupid.&rdquo;  Everything we do must be aimed at restoring the country to economic well-being and while we may use a variety of measures, the focus must be on the retention and creation of jobs.</P>
        <P>The concept of agency work is not ideal.  In an ideal world the majority who hold agency jobs would have longer term and more secure work.  I was interested to hear that there were approximately 40,000 agency workers in Ireland, who come from here, there and everywhere.  They do valuable work, contribute to the economy, generate economic activity and comprise a significant group.</P>
        <P>The directive came into being in 2008, but there have been significant economic gales throughout the continent of Europe since bringing with them, unfortunately, negative consequences for its economies and Ireland, in particular.  Therefore, when we discuss new rules, regulations and obligations to be imposed on employers, we must ensure none of them will <Col N="615"/>create difficulties in job creation, even if a job is to last for only one day, one week or one month.  I mentioned that it would be ideal if agency workers could be provided with full-time jobs, although agency work hours suit a number of people.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State and his colleagues are preparing the legislation, they must be conscious that the country, the Continent and the world are very different from what they were in 2008.  We must ensure whatever measures and restrictions are put in place through legislation do not impinge on short, medium or long-term employment prospects in this country.  I support the Minister of State&rsquo;s view that agency workers need the maximum protection and their entitlement to benefits should be applicable.  That said, we must be a little cautious that further bureaucratic barriers are not raised to employment creation.  Flexibility will always be required in the labour force, especially during an economic downturn.  I am sure the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues are examining the minimum wage, for example.  All measures need to be examined in the context of our current economic plight and the need to put in place those measures which could generate economic activity while removing those which might be a barrier to job creation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I noted the Minister of State referred to the possibility of a framework or regulation for agency workers&rsquo; pension rights and entitlements.  Everyone is entitled to a pension.  It is not just in the area of pensions for agency workers that we need a strong and vigorous national debate.  The whole pensions industry, which is somewhat a misnomer, whether contributory, general social welfare or industry-based, and the payment of pensions are very much up for debate.  The agency workers&rsquo; element will be a small piece of the larger jigsaw.  We will need new and radical thinking for pension entitlements, provision and funding.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said the &ldquo;framework agreement under the terms of the directive are within the gift of the social partners&rdquo; which is a throwback to the Celtic tiger.  The House often debated how the social partners were taking over many of the roles which should have been pursued by politicians.  This now may be one of the remaining powers the social partners will have.  Perhaps too much was in the gift of the social partners and not enough in the control of the elected Members of both Houses.  We have been left where we are as a result of some decisions too far removed from the political process.</P>
        <P>The Minister compared the Irish figures with those in the UK.  While we do not have to follow the UK&rsquo;s lead, it does seem to have taken a reasonable and balanced approach to this directive.</P>
        <P>The legislation on temporary agency work will be before the House soon and I presume my party&rsquo;s spokesperson will be back in full action then to assist in its passage.  It must be recognised that agency workers play an important role in the economy.  I am glad the Minister of State pointed out they have strong rights under Irish law.  Several high profile cases highlighted nationally have presented a false impression that agency workers are discriminated against or treated unfairly.  The majority of agency workers are treated well by their employers.  We must have space in the economy for this type of flexible work.  It is only a question of ensuring the regulations are in place to ensure fairness and common sense apply.  I wish the Minister of State well in his work in this regard.  I look forward to publication of the legislation which I am sure will receive all-party support.</P>
        <P>The directive is based on the broader spirit of European social thinking of bringing a balance and fairness to employer-employee relations.  One can contrast European thinking on this matter with that of China, the US and India.  There is a concern that their economies are booming because of a less regulated and regimented approach to this area.  We are where we are, however.  Ireland is very much part of Europe.  Since the formation of the European Economic Community, Europe has ensured fair and balanced relationships between employer and <Col N="616"/>employee in which rights and responsibilities are at one.  When we are putting the finer detail to the legislation, we must ensure employment creation, even for short-term jobs, is protected.  Job creation and economic activity will turn the country around, an idea that must be central to our political thinking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>In welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, I would like it noted there are three Members present in the Chamber from County Mayo and Senator Bradford, considering his recent marriage announcement, will soon be an honorary member of the county.  I do not know if Senators Ryan or Dearey have a Mayo connection but Senator Quinn has been spending much time in the county recently.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the EU directive on temporary agency work.  Under the terms of the directive, member states are required to transpose it into national legislation by 5 December 2011.  I am sure the Minister of State will ensure its passage through both Houses which will be an opportunity for the House to ensure the legislation will be beneficial both to employees and the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The directive respects and complies with the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, specifically Article 31 which provides that every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity to a limitation of maximum working hours, rest periods, night work, paid holidays and public holidays.</P>
      
        <P>It also covers work undertaken by pregnant women and nursing mothers, children and young people, and includes action taken to combat discrimination on the grounds of sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disabilities, age or sexual orientation.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The directive is therefore wide-ranging.  The legislation will be comprehensive when it comes before the House.  The directive makes changes to national law and any further employment rights, since Article 2 now designates employment agencies as the employer.  Most countries guarantee substantial rights to all people at work.  The main purpose of the temporary agency work directive, as far as I can see, is to harmonise the law across the European Union.  This is to prevent unfair competition between different member states.  For example, if an EU country has loose employment protection while Ireland has strong employment protection, companies will shift their operations, not because the other country is more efficient for doing business but because wage rates are lower.  We must be cognisant of this at the present time with the economy as it is.  We must ensure fair play across the EU.  We cannot afford to see other member states introducing legislation so that business can be done there at an unfair advantage, thereby putting us at a disadvantage.  This is especially so as we are on the periphery of Europe and employment is of the utmost importance now, as it will be in future.  There is a social function to most European directives.  The social function in this one is to ensure a higher standard of living and quality of life.</P>
        <P>While the directive provides for equal treatment for agency workers from the first day of employment, there is provision for a derogation within limits by way of collective agreement or by agreement between the national social partners.  In effect, the derogation would set out an agreed time limit or qualifying period after which the agency worker would qualify for equal treatment.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State has told the House, agency working plays a useful role in the economy.  It helps employers to respond to changing demand and can help employees in terms of greater flexibility, whether in employment or entering the labour force.  At the same time, agency work might not suit everybody and we must be wary of unscrupulous behaviour.</P><Col N="617"/>
        <P>I understand the objective of the directive is ultimately to improve the quality of temporary agency work and ensure a smoother functioning of the labour market.  I noted the Minister of State&rsquo;s reference to flexibility, which is sought by employers.  We must ensure that they have it, but not at the expense of workers.</P>
        <P>Agency work is atypical in Ireland, but is more common in the EU.  The directive aims to ensure that vulnerable agency workers are typically protected.  The temporary agency working sector in Ireland accounts for about 2% of employment.  As the Minister of State said, the directive will not change the employment status of agency workers or their entitlements to existing employment rights.  Quite rightly, agency workers are protected under employment rights legislation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the Minister of State has opened the directive to consultation.  In his speech, he did say that such consultation will be broadly based in order to seek the views of all the social pillars.  We have until 2011 to ensure that this is done.  Following that consultation process, the ensuing legislation will hopefully be strong and to the benefit of all concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The views attained will help to inform this process fully.  The consultation will help to identify the constituent elements of pay, beyond basic pay.  It should include, for example, overtime and shift work allowances that may be deemed appropriate for inclusion in the contractual entitlements of temporary agency workers to reflect their contribution for work done.  These views will assist in the preparation of the necessary implementing legislation.  I look forward to welcoming the Minister of State back to the House to discuss it.  I thank him for attending the House for this debate.  I wish him well in preparing the forthcoming legislation based on the temporary agency work directive.  I am sure the legislation to be presented to this House will ultimately make for good law when enacted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State and I am very interested in what he has had to say.  I was impressed, as Senator Carty noted, that temporary agency workers account for only 2% of the work force.  I employed quite a few people in my career and I would like to tell the House about one such employee, called John, who worked in our Ballinteer store.  About 18 years ago, he came to me in mid-December and said: &ldquo;I have worked here for nine years and I will be 65 on 31 December.  I plan to retire&rdquo;.  Our company had a policy of encouraging retired people to come back and work part-time, particularly those with skills.  John had worked at various jobs during his lifetime.  He told me:</P>
        <P LI="1">I have worked here for nine years and haven&rsquo;t missed a day.  I wake up in the morning looking forward to coming to work.  I look at my watch on a regular basis, thinking that it must be 4 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, only to discover that it is 6 o&rsquo;clock.  The day had gone faster than I thought.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I was very impressed with this and we talked about it.  Unfortunately, John died on Christmas Day that year, some five days before he was due to retire.  His wife had also wanted him to come back to work on a temporary basis.  She died three days later, so we had two funerals in the local church that day.  We talked about John and the fact he said he woke in the morning looking forward to coming to work and looked back on his day thinking it was 4 o&rsquo;clock to discover it was 6 o&rsquo;clock.  We set that as a target for those who worked with us.  At the time we thought that was for full-time employees, but should it apply to agency workers of whom there were very few?  We decided that it should also apply to them.  John&rsquo;s words had a huge impact on us and left a mark.  It reminded us of the responsibility that employers have.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EU&rsquo;s fundamental function is to provide its citizens with a better quality of life and this directive is consistent with that aim.  It may well be that a lot of employers intend to implement it, but do not get around to doing so.  I hope this new measure will help to prevent unfair <Col N="618"/>competition between member states.  If, for example, Portugal has loose employment protection and Ireland has strong employment protection, companies are most likely to shift their operations to Portugal.  It is not that Portugal is more efficient, but that companies can pay less there.  We must therefore try to prevent this race to the bottom, which is so detrimental to the workforce.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must remember, however, that as Europe competes with the rest of the world, we do not want to find ourselves putting in such constraints that would prevent us from competing internationally.  We should be aware of that fact.  In spite of the economic downturn, the agency work industry is continuing to create jobs that otherwise would not be created.  Agency work is helpful in people&rsquo;s transition between unemployment and work, while also providing a flexible form of labour that allows more people to enter the labour market.  In particular, agency work further enhances the employability of workers through training and investment.</P>
        <P>Proposals for a directive to regulate temporary agency work were first raised in 1982, but were blocked for years largely due to opposition from the UK.  There was a fear there that the country&rsquo;s highly deregulated labour market might suffer from granting rights to its 1.4 million agency workers.</P>
        <P>The directive will harmonise EU-wide legislation on temporary workers, which varies considerably between member states.  In Ireland, the existing protection is quite strong.  However, in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, the situation is quite different.  For instance, there is a ban on the use of agency workers in the public sector in Spain or in the construction sector in Germany.  As this situation is being reformed, some experts believe it could prepare the ground for a better economic recovery.  Look at the fact that many companies have recruitment freezes but that does not mean they are not busy.  They can get a temporary person into the workplace to continue to compete in the market.</P>
        <P>We must ensure we do not make Europe uncompetitive by introducing regulations that do not apply to the rest of the world.  There has been some criticism of the directive, for instance by the Small Firms Association, which says it will give short-term, fixed-term and agency workers the same terms and conditions as full employees.  From day one it will make things very difficult for companies employing temporary workers.  I understand people are worried about jobs but we must examine the broader, long-term picture of improving people&rsquo;s rights in the workplace.  Let us look also at the fact that we are still importing workers into Ireland in spite of the recession.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For the past three years I have been president of Eurocommerce, which is based in Brussels and represents 6 million shops in Europe.  It represents 31 million retail workers but I do not know the proportion of agency or temporary workers.  It represents the retail, wholesale and international trade sectors in Europe.  The organisation has met trade unions and welcomes the directive, describing it as &ldquo;well adapted to the needs of the commerce sector&rdquo; and &ldquo;a fine example of &lsquo;flexicurity&rsquo; in action&rdquo;.  The general consensus is that European labour markets are too rigid.  Labour market rules must be made more flexible with a combination of easier hiring and firing rules with good levels of social protection, including high benefits for the unemployed and a proactive labour market policy.  This is one of the main challenges of the EU&rsquo;s long-term vision for economic, social and environmental reform through the EU 2020 goal.</P>
        <P>I am interested in the view of the Minister of State on the fudge whereby the UK Government, in agreement with the social partners such as the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry, opted out of offering agency workers the same pay and basic conditions as full-time staff from day one, as the directive assumes, and instead implements the measures after a 12-<Col N="619"/>week period.  Is it beneficial to implement the directive before the December deadline?  Why not do so?</P>
        <P>Implementing what the directive requires is not totally straightforward.  For example, there is an argument about which terms and conditions agency workers should be entitled to enjoy on an equal basis with directly employed workers.  What about alternative dispute resolutions to avoid tribunals?  Can smaller employers insist on different treatment if they have formal pay bands?  Could we see workplace agreements established to get around the agreement?  Perhaps the Minister of State can elaborate on these matters.</P>
        <P>These concerns have been expressed but this is a step forward for social Europe.  The number of temporary agency workers, which in many member states is still a relatively insignificant proportion of the labour force, will undoubtedly increase over the coming years, as barriers to the use of such work are removed.  I welcome the legislation, which is a step in the correct direction.</P>
        <P>I have some concerns, particularly about the need for Europe to be competitive in the years ahead and the difficulty if we introduce regulations or constraints that limit the ability of Europe to compete with others.  In the immediate years ahead we will not be able to compete with India and China on pay but we should not burden ourselves by introducing regulations that make it difficult for us to hire people.  Part of how we will solve the employment problem is by making it more attractive to take on people.  The more constraints introduced, the more difficult it is.  The objective is correct &mdash; let us see if we can get both correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic ahead of the consultation process.  Speaking as an employer, I highlight the precious nature of a job and the importance of the relationship between the employer and employee.  In my case, my relationship with staff is binary, as was the case with Senator Quinn.  I thank Senator Quinn for his story, which he told movingly.  The relationship with agency workers is triangular, involving contracts between the agency and the worker and between the agency and the employer.  This set of relationships is more complex and the likelihood of things going wrong and the room for exploitation is greater.  This can exist in binary relationships, which is why we have partnership and unions, and can also exist with these triangular relationships.  That is why this legislation is overdue.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State is aware of an article by Father Brendan McPartlin, SJ, in <i>Working Notes</i>.  He talks about the history of the directive, which Britain has long opposed for competition reasons.  Ireland could not afford to lose competitiveness with regard to Britain and joined for the purposes of tracking the UK.  This opposition continued until 2008.  I understand Ireland felt compelled to take this position but I am glad both countries have moved on.  It is important that when capital seeks flexibility and competitiveness, which it does in this instance, not in regard to materials or utilities but in respect of human beings, those who are the subject of the search for flexibility and competitiveness are protected and not subject to exploitation.  This can easily happen through business pressure, increased competition in the sector and huge numbers of immigrants coming into a country.  There are also reasons and mechanisms through which agency workers can become the subject of exploitation.  I am not sure it is good for business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recently, I spoke in the House about the minimum wage and how we could create a bridge between jobseekers and the workplace, without allowing the minimum wage to become a barrier to employment.  I got my head taken off on Facebook for making the suggestion that the State should help young people on &euro;100 a week to bridge the gap between jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits and employment.  I suggested a contribution of &euro;7 from the employer and &euro;165 from the State.  This would reduce the State&rsquo;s involvement in sustaining a person by &euro;50 a week on <Col N="620"/>the basis of a 35-hour week.  This would move the person into employment where he or she would be subject to levies.  This could help employers to stop the current practice of sub-optimal service, where one makes the customer wait because the business is selling cheaper goods or fewer goods but it takes as long to sell them as to sell expensive goods.  We are in this fluid situation and we are in a recession, although technically we came out of it some time ago.  There is no question that employers are under enormous pressure to see flexibility and competitiveness, yet I still resist it because I do not believe agency work is good for an employing organisation.  I am pleased to see the figure is 2%.  At the margins, there is a role for agencies to fill spikes in demand and to take care of peripheral activity within a company.  In the case of the HSE, where agency workers have become common, my understanding from the nursing unions is that it is a far more expensive way of doing business than the traditional binary relationship of employer and employee.  The core strength of my small business is the staff, the relationship I have with them and the relationship they in turn have with customers.  I wonder how sustainable it would be if I were to embark on the practice of using an agency to supply staff.</P>
        <P>Ironically, I understand that in a number of European countries agency work was used initially as a tool to bring not easily employed people into the labour market.  It was conceived in some countries to have a social benefit attached to it.  However, it morphed into something else.  There was a cynical use of it in the Gamma case.  Gamma Industry acted as the agency while Gamma Construction delivered the work.  Two arms of the same corporation did not enter into the kind of healthy relationship I spoke about but an exploitative one where temporary staff in Ennis in particular were being paid &euro;3 a week.  Their rights were not explained in Turkish, which was the only language they understood.  They had to have their meals separate from the rest of the staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our employment rights legislation does not allow a comparison between agency workers and permanent workers but only between agency workers and other agency workers to establish whether they are being treated equally played against those Gamma workers at the time.  It is a problem in that in the 1998 Act comparisons are not allowed between agency staff and full-time staff doing the same job but must be between agency workers.  That is my understanding of the legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, is looking at me in a way that suggests I could be wrong.  I accept I may be wrong but that is my understanding of the provision in the Act.</P>
        <P>I welcome the public consultation and the eventual adaptation in December next year of the directive.  I also welcome the fact that local conditions are being taken into account and that it allows social partnership to deal with the finer detail of how implementation will happen in this country.  That makes sense because we are in a diverse Union with a wide range of economies.  I also note that the directive begins by quoting the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and that this directive finds its wellspring in the charter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot help but finish with a barb against those who claimed that the Lisbon treaty would wreck workers rights when in fact the formal enshrining of that charter happened as a result of the Lisbon treaty and that it is the wellspring for the directive.  The European social democratic approach to labour and to this directive is progressive while the more aggressive, dare I say Anglo-Saxon model that characterises some relationships between employers and employees, which does create a race to the bottom, is not progressive.  By allowing for a consultation period and ultimately transposing the directive itself into Irish law we are embracing the more progressive model.  It is important that it is done carefully and that local knowledge plays a part.  Ultimately, these triangular relationships need strong legislation because of the range of <Col N="621"/>problems as to who employs whom, who is responsible for whom and that can only be dealt with by clear and effective legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call Senator Ryan I welcome a former Member of the House, Councillor Mary Jackman, to the Visitors Gallery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  We are dealing with the temporary agency workers directive 2004/104/EC which must be transposed into Irish law.  It was published on 5 December 2008 and must be transposed by 5 December 2011.  I question why it has taken us until now to get seriously involved in it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the directive which is a good one.  Its transposition into Irish law would be welcome.  I hope it will result in legislation of which we can all be proud.  The equal treatment principle which is contained within Article 5.1 of the directive is progressive.  I will refer to it later.  I wonder whether we would have come up with such measures left to our own devices.  It is an example of where European Union legislation and the work of the Union can benefit Irish people in a progressive way.  I concur with a previous speaker who referred to it as one of the benefits of membership of the European Union.  We must transpose the directive into Irish law.  Some flexibility is allowed within the directive, including possible derogations but, by and large, the resulting legislation must reflect what is contained in the directive and its major principles.</P>
        <P>I am against the concept of a qualifying period for equal treatment.  Such a concept is alien to me in terms of people&rsquo;s rights.  There should be equal treatment from day one.  Nobody should be in a position to deny workers who come along at a later stage the right to equal treatment in any employment in which they engage.  Such an approach is wide open to abuse.  I am surprised by the news that Britain has opted for a 12-week qualifying period.  Situations could arise whereby an agency would send a worker to an employer for eight or ten weeks and then put someone else in the position.  I am totally opposed to the concept.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The directive deals with the triangular relationship; the employment contract on the one hand and commercial contracts on the other hand.  Employment agencies are outside the scope of the directive.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has considered the directive.  I have seen the consultation documents.  One of the issues that arises relates to the reference to economic activity in Article 1.2 and the question of Departments and State agencies engaging the services of outsiders.  That might not be defined as economic activity but I do not think there is a problem with it.  There is economic activity and a commercial element to one half of the relationship so I do not envisage any difficulty in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A possible derogation is envisaged on Article 1.3 which refers to member states after consultation with the social partners providing that the directive does not apply to employment contracts or relationships conducted under specific publicly supported vocational training.  I accept the principle which appears reasonable but it is difficult to visualise how such an agency would be engaged in that type of employment.  It may be possible but it is difficult to see how agencies would engage in a public utility.  I could be convinced in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Article 3 deals with adopting definitions.  In his commentary the Minister of State referred to adopting the definitions contained in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  That is positive.  We should continue to hold on to what we have.  I welcome the fact that we are not departing from those principles.  The question of equal treatment arises in Article 5.1 which states, &ldquo;The basic working and employment conditions of temporary agency workers shall be, for the duration of their assignment at a user undertaking, at least those that would apply if they had been recruited directly to occupy the same job.&rdquo;  I welcome that positive statement.  Article 3.1(f) defines basic working and employment conditions.  Agency workers should not <Col N="622"/>be used to frustrate the rights or opportunities of other workers.  An employer should only engage in hiring agency workers with the agreement of the existing workforce.  For example, the HSE is exploiting the use of agency workers.  I know of someone who has taken a sabbatical and is entitled to return after one year but who is being made to wait a further year before being rehired because the HSE is using agency workers to frustrate her efforts to return.</P>
        <P>There are questions surrounding whether more generous conditions should apply to agency workers in respect of their working times.  To do otherwise would be to go against the principle established in the directive which has been worked on for some time.  The consultation document refers to difficulties encountered in practice, but there will not be any.  In many organisations holidays are earned.  For example, holidays are earned having worked for one month.  Therefore, this will be easy to administer.</P>
        <P>I differentiate between profit sharing, pensions, etc.  There is a case to be made for considering existing long-term arrangements outside the context of the directive, but I am open to being convinced.  There might be a reason for us to opt out.</P>
        <P>Possible discrimination against pregnant women and nursing mothers is an issue.  In a regular employment arrangement risk assessments must be made for all types of work in an organisation, but additional assessments must be made where a worker is pregnant.  Having done this, the decision in normal conditions might be to remove a worker from a particular type of work for the duration of the pregnancy.  However, it might not be reasonable to expect the redeployment of an agency worker to perform a task he or she was not hired to do in the first instance.</P>
        <P>The question of who monitors the relationship is important.  To test for equal treatment, a worker will make a local comparison.  Difficulties in this regard might arise in respect of newly created positions and the determination of how the work function is deemed to be fulfilled.  In the main, however, making comparisons will be reasonably easy and we can expect that workers will not be found wanting in making them.  Has the directive been transposed elsewhere and how has this matter been addressed?</P>
        <P>Where dispute resolution is required, the obvious action would be to approach the agency first.  If this does not resolve it, a claim could be pursued with the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, the existing disputes resolution mechanism.  However, I will make a different suggestion concerning a new advocacy role.  Instead of approaching the LRC and waiting for a hearing to be held, someone should be given a new role, as part of which, for example, he or she would make a telephone call to deal early with and advise on a dispute.  In this way, an offending person could be dealt with easily enough.</P>
        <P>Regarding penalties and remedies, it is stated penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  This is a good and useful set of criteria.</P>
        <P>A question arises as to whether the employer or the hirer is responsible for dealing with health and safety issues and risk assessments.  This grey area may pose practical difficulties and will need to be monitored.</P>
        <P>What if an agency acts in good faith on the basis of information provided by the hirer?  Perhaps a standard provision addressing matters such as this could be included in commercial contracts.</P>
        <P>I like the directive.  It is progressive, simple in its layout, easy to read and likely to achieve its objectives of protecting agency workers, improving the quality of agency work and ensuring equal treatment.  I look forward to discussing the legislation and hope there will be no major dilution because of the available derogations.  I wish the Minister of State well in its introduction.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, and wish him continued success in his important Ministry and meeting the other responsibilities thrown on top of him.  He has broad shoulders on which to carry them to achieve success on 25 November.</P>
        <P>The directive was debated in 2008 and agreed in 2009 and is being implemented as fast as possible in the House.  However, introducing legislation to implement European directives takes time.  Although times are difficult, the Government&rsquo;s introduction of the legislation is appropriate and welcome.  I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic.</P>
        <P>The directive aims to ensure the protection of temporary agency workers by ensuring the principle of equal treatment is applied across the board.  It will enshrine in EU and Irish law the principle that the basic employment conditions of temporary agency workers are the same as if they were directly recruited by the company.  For too long, certain recruitment and agency worker companies treated workers poorly.</P>
        <P>I draw to the attention of Members some of the provisions of Article 6 of the directive.  It states: &ldquo;Temporary agency workers shall be informed of any vacant posts in the user undertaking to give them the same opportunity as other workers in that undertaking to find permanent employment&rdquo;.  During the years I have heard of people being employed as temporary agency workers, staying in that role for three or four months and not being informed of a permanent position.  It does not make sense for a company to invest in a staff member and then not to make use of his or her knowledge and skill set in filling a permanent position.</P>
        <P>Another important provision of the directive provides for equal treatment for agency workers in actions taken to combat discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, ethnic origin, religion, beliefs, disability, age and sexual orientation.  I know of many young mothers who find returning to the workplace difficult.  Child care is a significant issue and I am delighted the directive addresses a major inequality in the provision of child care services by companies.  Companies must offer the same provisions to agency workers as to full-time staff.  This is a fantastic change that will be of major benefit to mothers throughout Europe.</P>
        <P>The directive has the capacity to slow the race to the bottom in terms of workers&rsquo; rights.  Harmonising workers&rsquo; rights laws across the European Union will help to prevent unfair competition between member states known as social dumping.  The directive will ensure a higher standard of living and better quality of life for employees and more efficient, productive and happier workers for employers.</P>
        <P>It is right that Ireland is introducing this legislation.  Irish workers have travelled the length and breadth of the world to obtain employment, including Britain and the United States of America.  While conditions have improved dramatically, Irish workers in England were not always treated well.  Most of the money earned was repatriated to Ireland.  Many Irish people who are entitled to claim social benefits in Britain have not applied to avail of them.  When they applied for their old age contributory or non-contributory pension, they were asked for their social security number in Britain.  Some ignored this request, believing it would not be of benefit, if applying for a contributory pension in particular.  However, it has come to my attention that numerous people already benefit, having applied directly to the British Government.  The forms are available from Deputies, Senators and councillors.  I brought the matter to the attention of councillors throughout the country and recently went on Mid West Radio to discuss it, as a result of which I have received queries from County Mayo.  This is merely to indicate there are people who may qualify for a pension in Britain and that it would be worth their while to apply.   We extended the pre-1953 stamp scheme to our emigrants in Britain and many qualified.  There is an enormous transfer of funds to Irish people in Britain, rightly so, because they transferred so much money to Ireland in the 1940s and 1950s and we owe them a great debt of gratitude.  It would be worthwhile to try to get across this message.  If people had a <Col N="624"/>social security number in Britain and worked there for four or five years in the 1960s or 1970s, they can qualify for a reasonably generous pension.  There is a very good pension system in Britain, with a reciprocal agreement between Ireland and Britain.  This debate gives me an opportunity to highlight the issue.  This social policy is one of the benefits of EU membership.</P>
        <P>My father was a member of the Cuffe Street union of bricklayers and stonemasons and at the forefront in dealing with labour issues when the question of &ldquo;wet-time&rdquo; was introduced.  Probably no one in this House has heard of this, but in the 1950s and 1960s it was a provision that applied to builders.  Fianna F&aacute;il is the most socialist side of the Government and has always dealt with social issues.  My father was a life-long member of Fianna F&aacute;il, but he was also a life-long member of a union, which is a great combination.  The Minister of State may feel very comfortable in his position with responsibility for labour affairs knowing that the party always represented the working people of this country to the best of its ability.  I can say with pride that it fought alongside the Cuffe Street union of bricklayers and stonemasons.  That is only one indication; I am sure my colleagues realise the full extent of our involvement in the labour movement.   When I was a Deputy for Roscommon, I secured the labour vote in the constituency for that reason.  I hope that in the by-election on 25 November we will secure transfers from the Labour Party candidate in Donegal South-West.</P>

	<P>That is certainly tenuous.  </P>
        <P>I thank Senator Leyden and all other Senators for their contributions.  This marks the start of a consultation process, into which the input of Senators will feed its way.  We have placed advertisements in the newspapers and on the Internet and the process will fully inform the preparation of the implementing legislation which I hope to be in a position to introduce to the House next year.   When Senator Bradford queried who would be around to do this, it struck me we were a little like temporary agency workers, except that we had much less protection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are a number of issues I wish to clarify.  There were a number of comments about the qualifying period which obviously will be in the consultation process.  However, there are questions to be asked.  Senator Ryan commented on the 12-week period.  We share an island, part of which is in the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.  Therefore, for reasons of competitiveness, we need to look at the issue.  The framework agreement will have to encompass the qualifying period and consider whether it is appropriate that from day one the concept of equal treatment should apply.  There are issues that affect our competitiveness, as Senator Bradford noted.  In particular, I invite those who will get involved in the consultation process to give some thought and consideration to the difficult issues that arise in that regard.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  There are many associated issues, of which that is one.</P>
        <P>The reference to occupational pensions is important.   As Senator Bradford stated, there is a wider debate to be held on pensions and pension provisions for temporary agency workers, especially those who spend their entire careers in the sector who, for whatever reason, do not enter a formal working relationship.  We must give consideration to the people concerned, even though they comprise a small group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bradford was concerned about the position of the social partners.  It is indicated in Article 5.4 of the directive that the deal can only be concluded by the social partners at national level.  It is not the case that the social partners will be given <i>carte blanche</i> from Dublin but from Brussels.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the recent publication of the National Housing Development Survey and is concerned that:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />many completed houses are unoccupied despite a huge demand for social and affordable housing and there is no mechanism to transfer properties in ghost estates controlled by NAMA to local authorities for social and affordable housing and other community uses;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />there is no clarity around who will pay to complete unfinished estates;</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is0p11- ?><?oasys _ix ?>and calls on the Government to step up their efforts to address these issues.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am delighted to propose this motion on behalf of the Labour Party.  It follows on from the publication of the National Housing Development Survey a few weeks back.  Members will recall that survey highlighted that there are more than 2,800 ghost estates and developments currently incomplete and left in a sub-standard and dangerous condition throughout the country.  We need to learn lessons about how we have got to this point, but in this debate I want to focus on how we can put things right.</P>
        <P>We need to examine every possible way in which to solve this problem, to best utilise the vacant houses and many apartments that are out there, and make the living conditions of the people in these estates better.  I note the amendment to be tabled on behalf of the Government.  In particular I note the reference to &ldquo;the establishment of a high-level expert group&rdquo; by the Government.  The purpose of this group, according to the proposed amendment, is &ldquo;to advise on practical and policy solutions to ensure satisfactory completion or resolution of unfinished housing developments&rdquo;.  I am very glad to see the Government do this, but I would like a commitment from the Minister of State to the effect that this group will finalise its work as a matter of urgency.  I invite him, in his speech, to outline clear timescales for when this expert group will deliver.</P>
        <P>With all due respect to the Minister of State, we have heard about these expert groups and task forces over a number of years.  I draw his attention to the task force that was set up by his Government to look into the issue of job creation, which met once in the last year, I believe.  I am glad to hear about this expert group, but seeing is believing and I want to see clear timescales outlined for when that expert group will deliver.</P>
        <P>My party colleagues will also speak on this motion.  They will look at issues such as how completed houses might be utilised within these estates to sort out our housing stock as well as the impact unfinished estates are having on the families living in them.  They will talk about how legislation needs to be introduced to allow some of these houses to be transferred either <Col N="626"/>into or out of NAMA and to allow local authorities to house some of the people on their waiting lists in these houses.  There are many finished but empty houses in these estates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In County Meath there are 85 unfinished estates that have not been handed over to the local authority.  It is imperative we know exactly where we stand when it comes to finishing off these estates.  We also need to work out exactly what it will cost.  One of the first tasks the expert group will need to do is to trace back through all the planning applications, permissions and conditions attached to them to see exactly what needs to be delivered in terms of each of those estates.  That will entail a great deal of work and means having to go through each estate to work out precisely what needs to be done to bring them up to an acceptable condition.  It will mean finishing off every single footpath and knowing exactly where the lights should be and where the open spaces are meant to be.  We must work out exactly what needs to be done to correct these eyesores and to put the estates to right.  It is only when that trawl through the planning permissions and conditions is completed that we will know exactly the scope of work needed to correct these estates.</P>
        <P>It is crucial that this does not drag on and that the process is finished off because currently some of these estates pose a health and safety hazard.  Apart from being unsightly, there is a danger of risk to the families living in them.  I have seen how this impacts on the lives of families.  In recent weeks I have visited many estates around County Meath and I shall give a few examples.</P>
        <P>I visited one estate in Stamullen where, because of footpaths not being finished, a child had fallen and injured himself.  In another estate 50% of the public lighting was not working, either because it was never connected or the work was not done satisfactorily.  Apart from that being a health and safety risk as we come into the winter months, it also impacts on people&rsquo;s perceptions of anti-social behaviour and crime in those areas.  I saw an estate in Slane last week that was lacking the final wearing course of tarmacadam on the road.  That means potholes and manholes located above the surface of the road, impacting on tyres and costing money in terms of damage to cars.  I have seen other estates with half-finished housing sites that are sometimes not sealed off very well.  As a result, they tend to become centres for anti-social behaviour, rats or target locations for people dumping rubbish.</P>
        <P>All these things need to be put right.  People have paid many hundreds of thousands of euro for their properties only to discover they are expected to rear their families on housing estates that are clearly not fit for purpose.  I have outlined a few examples and mentioned a few towns.  It is not one town that is suffering in County Meath, however, but every town and village.  There are unfinished estates throughout the county and country.  It has been going on for years and now it needs to be put right.</P>
        <P>I welcome the establishment of the expert group.  It needs to identify exactly what is expected prior to an estate being completed and handed over to the council and it needs to produce an estimate of how much it will cost to put these matters right.  I should expect the expert group to appoint a firm, or perhaps many firms, of engineers to go through each estate, work out exactly what remedial works are needed and cost them.  From this trawl of planning permissions we should for once get an exact breakdown of how much it will cost to put this problem right once and for all.</P>
        <P>Bonds are in place, as the Minister of State is very well aware.  There are estimates that these bonds amount to &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million, and the crux of the matter is the difficulty in accessing these.  Builders and developers took out insurance and bonds with financial institutions, generally banks and insurance companies.  Some developers are still in good standing, managing to complete their estates and will be expected in time to get their bonds.  We are not <Col N="627"/>overly concerned about them.  The issue is more about those developers who have gone bust or who are having problems meeting their commitments and who cannot finish estates as a result.  Perhaps such developers might have some money but the bonds they can expect to draw on are less than the costs of rectifying the estates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to look at those issues and perhaps there is need for legislation or a statutory instrument to be put in place in order that we can access these bonds.  It is definitely a painstaking task that has to be completed, but we need a comprehensive list of institutions with which the developers took out their bonds.  That would allow us to assess whether the bonds are still in place in State-owned institutions or other domestic or foreign-owned entities.  If the bonds are with State-owned banks and building societies, it is effectively we, the taxpayers, who will have to stand surety for these repairs.  The possibility arises that a number of the bonds will have been taken out with good banks and even overseas institutions.  None the less, an instrument must be put in place whereby the local authorities can access these bonds.  If a proper and thorough examination is done of with whom the bonds were taken out, it should be possible to see whether the financial institutions sub-loaned such facilities to foreign institutions.  The trail of the bonds needs to be examined in depth to find out which institutions hold them and how easily they may be accessed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It may be that a legal mechanism needs to be put in place to draw down these funds.  Even if only a portion of the &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million can be accessed, this would go a long way towards finishing off many of these estates.  We need to call in these bonds to finish off the maximum number of developments as quickly as possible.  If legislation is required, I would expect that the expert group will report to that effect and make recommendations accordingly.  We need to establish what is to be done in the event of a bond being recoverable from an institution and assess whether it is sufficient.  If not, how is the gap between the bond and the cost of the works to be filled?  Most people when purchasing a home engage an architect to compile a snag list.  Where problems are identified these are rectified by the builder before the final amount owed on the house is paid.  However, when it comes to purchasing a home, we do not ask the architect to examine common areas, sewers and drains running down the central spine road.  We assume that the clerk of works will do this work on behalf of the county council and for the common good.  It is fair to expect a home owner to cough up money if problems arise in the house which were not identified on the snag list.  However, it is not fair to expect home owners to put right somebody else&rsquo;s mistakes.  For many people, whether or not one&rsquo;s estate is finished is down to pot luck.  Some of us live in finished estates while others do not.  Rarely is this the fault of the individual, rather it is because councils failed to implement proper checking at the time of construction of the estate.  There is an argument to be made for the Government stepping in where a shortfall is identified between the bond and cost of the works.  This shortfall could be addressed by central government through the councils.</P>
        <P>I was recently told by people in Meath County Council that it will take between eight and 12 years to take in charge all of the unfinished estates in the region.  That is how slow the process is and how little money councils have to put towards finishing estates in respect of which a shortfall arises between the bond and cost of works involved.  Clearly, the process is far too slow.  The issue of unfinished estates has been ongoing for years.  People are fed up living in unfinished estates.  It is difficult enough at this time for those who have jobs to pay their mortgages without their having to put up with living in unfinished estates in respect of which health and safety or anti-social issues are arising because a developer has failed to live up to the promises made at the time of sale of the property.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  I welcome the establishment of an expert group but would like to hear from him clear timescales in regard to when that group will report.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="628"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will be well aware that ghost estates are a monument to bad planning decisions which perforate our landscape.  They affect every county from Schull in County Cork to Malin, County Donegal and Clifden, County Galway to Balgriffin in Dublin.  The main cause of our economic crisis is widely regarded as cheap credit leading to foolhardy lending.  Bad planning ranks every bit as high as a cause of our economic meltdown and the high cost of social provision, which is also a reason for the collapse in our competitiveness.  If we slip into a full-blown economic depression, bad planning will without doubt be found to have been the enduring cause.</P>
        <P>Many people say that in Ireland all politics is local.  While I can understand the reason this is said I have never subscribed to this view, rather I have always believed that national and local cannot be separated and that it is up to politicians to communicate this message effectively.  This motion supports my view.  With 2,800 ghost estates identified in the National Housing Development Survey, the decision of national Government to introduce appalling planning regulations has been brought home to every locality in the country.  County councillors were because of these regulations able to force through so many ridiculous planning applications against the advice of local authority officials.  My view on the electoral and sometimes financial advantages gained by this is already on the record of this House and as such I will not dwell on the point again.</P>
        <P>The misery visited upon the residents of our nearly 3,000 ghost estates is a direct cause of that bad planning.  The price paid for the houses, the failure to complete the developments and the poor servicing of them, are Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s legacy of 13 years in power, a fact that cannot be denied or brushed under the carpet.  Fianna F&aacute;il is the architect of the disaster which so many residents of ghost estates are experiencing and will continue to experience for some years to come.  However, there is hope.  Senator Hannigan has put forward some great ideas in regard to funding that could be accessed to complete these estates and serve an important social function.</P>
        <P>Another important factor that needs to be considered is that not all ghost estates are incomplete developments.  Some of them are finished but the houses are lying empty.  There are many such estates in south Tipperary.  I am sure that is mirrored all over the country.  Even if every house was completed and every estate finished, we would still need a functioning market in which to sell them.  Re-establishing a functioning property market is essential to economic recovery and is an indispensable part of the solution to the human tragedy of ghost estates.  While I accept the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, has put in place schemes to help people access housing, given the scale of the problem this response has been less than adequate.  However, that is not entirely his fault as he does not have anything like the budget required even to begin addressing this problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every now and then, an economist raises the spectre of mortgage defaults dragging our economy even further into the mire, leading to yet another revision of the figure for the structural deficit.  I subscribe to this view.  The Minister for Finance needs to recognise that a massive intervention in the housing market is needed and needs to look to the National Pensions Reserve Fund to finance it.  It has long been argued that the NTMA, which manages the pension reserve, should be investing in this country&rsquo;s infrastructure.  Given the state of the stock markets, it would be prudent for the NTMA to consider alternative investments.  There appears to be an opportunity in the housing market if the properties can be bought at the right price.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Official figures suggest house prices have fallen by 36% from their peak price.  However, those who work in property sales say one would have to do better than that in order to sell.  There have been a number of media reports of supposed fire sales where properties have been <Col N="629"/>snapped up at a price 50% below the 2006 peak level.  While the experts say we need property prices to reach a floor before the market recovers, we are already seeing signs of what that floor might be.  There are metrics for pricing property which over the years have proven to be robust, one of which is to regard the average house as being three times the average household income.  Another is to value individual properties at 14 times the rental yield of the property.  Compiling accurate figures is difficult in these chaotic economic times.  However, when I examined some reasonable estimations I found that these metrics suggest that fair value for housing stands at approximately 50% to 55% of the peak average house price of &euro;310,000, in other words, between &euro;145,000 and &euro;155,000.  If the NTMA were to invest in the property market at prices somewhat discounted from this, it would be making a sound long-term investment.  I accept other people might dispute this and that they may be right.  However, it is time to develop strategies to get the housing market moving again.  It should be a matter of constant public debate so that an informed policy can be implemented by whomever is in government.</P>
        <P>The survey referred to housing estates in my area and stated that they had been completed to a high standard.  While many have been completed to a high standard, some have been used as a dumping ground for discarded building materials and machinery, with many footpaths unfinished, which is a sad sight to have to look at when one has paid &euro;300,000 to &euro;350,000 for one&rsquo;s home.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to the interesting views put forward by the Labour Party.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to the Seanad in which he played a key role for many years.  I know he is committed to his brief as Minister of State with responsibility for housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all accept that in recent years permissions were given in circumstances where they ought not to have been given.  Nevertheless, I believe we have learned a vital lesson.  I have been <Col N="630"/>involved in public life for 31 years.  I recall that during my time as a member of Westmeath County Council I, with the late Deputy Gerry L&rsquo;Estrange, who was also a member of the council, proposed a motion in regard to developers who were not discharging their responsibilities.  Nothing has changed except the date.</P>
        <P>I welcome the National Housing Development Survey.  It brings our problems into clear focus but the Government has taken definitive steps to address the problem.  The key results emanating from the report are significant.  A total of 2,846 developments were inspected of which only 429, or 15%, are active.  While it is difficult to be precise about the exact numbers of housing units approved in total on all these developments, estimates so far indicate a figure of 179,273 dwellings.  There are 78,195 dwellings in the developments surveyed that are completed and occupied.  A total of 23,250 dwellings are complete and vacant &mdash; that is the bad news &mdash; together with the 9,976 dwellings that are near completion.  A total of 9,854 dwellings are at various stages of construction from site clearance, foundations up to wall pit level.  There is planning permission for a further estimated 58,025 dwellings.  They are not commenced and therefore do not pose immediate construction or site specific difficulties.</P>
        <P>Ghost estates are a symptom not only of bad planning but of poor planning enforcement.  Planning enforcement is very important but it is not a role of Government, rather of local authorities.  I have stated that previously, not only in this House but when I was a member of Westmeath County Council.  Many current members of the council are constantly articulating that view.  There must be appropriate planning enforcement.  Local authorities have that power.  It is vested in them by statute.</P>
        <P>We must be careful not to demonise all developers.  There are very many responsible developers who not alone complete their developments but contribute in a positive way to life after they have completed the estates.  We must dwell, unfortunately, on those who are not coming up to the plate, as it were, when they leave disasters behind them in estates in respect of a number of areas, including play areas.  Most new estates will have a young population, and children require play areas.</P>
        <P>The point about footpaths has been made.  I recall an estate being taken in charge prior to my becoming a member of the council and the first action we had to take in the estimates of 1980 was to provide money to complete the footpaths.  A patch job had been done by the developer which involved plastering the footpaths.  Needless to say, the first winter frost that came lifted it.  In terms of roads, I have seen estates that were left by developers in which one could bury bodies.  The rate payers and the taxpayers of County Westmeath, as with those in other local authorities, had to pick up the tab.  In terms of lighting, the ESB would get an order from the local authority but when it came to the money being paid over by the developer, that did not always happen.  Unfinished houses are not a new phenomenon.  One has only to travel around towns and villages to see what that means.  Regarding flooding, there are brand new estates but one would need waders after one shower of rain to get through them.  Tree planting is another issue that is not always taken on board by developers.</P>
        <P>Housing is an important part of life in this country.  In terms of the towns and villages in the various counties that have development, we must match the number of developments that are completed with the number of people on housing lists.  I accept it is not always possible from a practical point of view, and I am sure the Minister of State will develop that point further when he responds.  The local authorities have a role in acquiring a number of these properties, especially in the villages.</P>
        <P>A point I argued strongly when I was a member of Westmeath County Council was that everyone cannot live in the major towns.  The villages have to develop.  There are many small <Col N="631"/>communities that could and should have village status.  They have grown significantly arising from the housing boom and they should have village status.  There are private dwellings in those areas, some not complete, that could be taken in charge by the local authority.  I am aware the Minister of State is very interested in this area and I look forward to his response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  I echo what my colleagues have said, namely, that the Minister of State is an interested and dedicated Minister for housing.  I thank him for the interest he has shown in my area of Athlone.  I appreciate it.</P>
        <P>I commend this motion and I commend the Labour Party on tabling it because there are many uncompleted houses on unoccupied estates, especially in the midlands.  In the town of Athlone there are 600 people on the housing list.  In the catchment and environs of Westmeath there are huge numbers on the waiting lists.  I am aware that many of those are not urgently in need of housing.  Some of them are on the housing list because they have to be to get their rent allowance.  There are 100,000 people in receipt of rent allowance.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Labour Party motion.  Why can we not use these houses that have been taken over by NAMA for social and affordable housing?  The affordable housing schemes appear to be at an end.  There are no longer any affordable houses.  People cannot buy them.  There must be joined-up thinking as to how we can convert those houses and ghost estates into homes and communities where people can live their lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other area that concerns me is the amount of money involved.  My colleague in County Cork, the mayor for County Cork, Councillor Jim Daly, raised the issue of bonds.  Significant sums of money of between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million were gathered over the period of the boom for bonds for housing estates.  Those bonds could be drawn if there was a co-ordinated policy and the money could be spent on installing lighting, footpaths and roads in these ghost estates for the benefit of the people living there who are probably in negative equity because they have spent so much money on their mortgage and are now to the pin of their collars trying to pay it back.  If we spent the &euro;500 million that has been gathered in bonds, it would go a long way to putting in place roads and lighting for those people and would ease their plight.  Now that building costs are greatly reduced, we would get very good value for money.  It would also stimulate job creation and get people working.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other area about which I am concerned, and I am sure my other colleagues have the same experience, is housing for single men.  That is a serious issue because many relationships are falling apart.  I do not know the reason it is so prevalent but that is a debate for another day.  There are men who see their children and spend time with their families in places like McDonald's.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>A gentleman who came into my clinic the other day told me that he was sleeping on his mother&rsquo;s couch in a one-bedroom old person&rsquo;s dwelling.  He has five grown-up children whom he cannot see.  They are all teenagers and as he cannot bring them to his mother&rsquo;s little flat, he sees them in McDonald&rsquo;s.  He painted that sad picture for me.  He has left the family home and is unemployed and there is no housing available for him.  He is not in receipt of rent allowance and is destitute.  I know he is only one of many.  I have raised the issue of housing for single men several times before.  They are just as entitled to housing as lone parents who are women.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder why more landlords are not participating in the excellent rental accommodation scheme and ask the Minister of State to answer that question for me.  Is it the case that we are not highlighting it sufficiently?  It is an excellent scheme, under which <Col N="632"/>the landlord has little to do.  He or she does not have to pay the &euro;200 second home levy; the council looks after the property and the rent is assured every week.  I fail to understand why more landlords are not availing of the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Glynn&rsquo;s amendment states Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;welcomes the potential role of the social housing leasing initiative in matching up housing oversupply with social housing need to accelerate social housing delivery in the most cost effective manner achievable&rdquo;.  However, the long lease system does not seem to be working either.  There is little going on in County Westmeath.  Why is this not happening?  It seems to be a no-brainer for landlords who have empty properties.  Why are they not participating in either the long lease scheme or RAS?  I know many people who would be more than willing to accept accommodation under one or other scheme.</P>
        <P>Spending money on housing for the elderly or the disabled is a way of keeping people out of institutions and nursing homes and allowing them the dignity of living at home independently by adding extra bathrooms or modifying their homes to deal with mobility problems.  However, I worry that if the money is spent early on in the year, there will not be one penny left to provide such aid later.  This is not only the case in County Westmeath.  I have been speaking to my colleagues and it seems to be happening throughout the country.  I wonder whether there is buoyancy anywhere &mdash; probably not.</P>
        <P>I appreciate all the efforts being made by the Minister of State, but I wonder whether the problem is a lack of awareness of the schemes that I mentioned.  I commend the Labour Party on tabling the motion and ask the Minister of State to make the houses in ghost estates available to families who are destitute and desperate for housing.  I also ask the Minister to respond to my comments on bonds from developers.  There is money available in local authorities for works such as road, footpath and lighting improvements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the motion tabled by Senator Glynn.  I do not want to do down many of the relevant points made by Senator McFadden and all previous contributors, but we must recognise the fact that the Government has stepped up its efforts to deal with this issue.  The expert group has been meeting &mdash; I understand it met today &mdash; and its proposals will be presented to local authorities within weeks.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who has a particular interest in planning has also stepped up his efforts to address problems such as that mentioned by Senator Prendergast, namely, the relationship between planning and the economic collapse, which is an accurate analysis.  The flip side of over-lending was the supply of unsuitable land which far exceeded actual demand.</P>
        <P>Planning issues played a major role in the collapse of the economy and, in a way, this is the untold story of the collapse of the Celtic tiger.  Those charged with oversight and enforcement of planning regulations and those in whose hands planning and zoning decisions lay must be fully examined.  The roles of councillors and planners, as well as planning law, local area plans and county development plans, all contributed to what has been a catastrophic collapse.  There is no point in saying this as part of a blame game, but it does need to be recognised.  Reform of the planning system must be seen as the flip side to banking reform; there is no point in doing one and not the other.  They need to be done together and they have been.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party motion which calls on the Government to step up its efforts to address issues in the area of housing misses the point.  The Government has stepped up its efforts.  The new Planning and Development (Amendment) Act has been passed and local government reform is under way.  Alignment of the national spatial strategy and regional planning guidelines with county development plans and local area plans has taken place.  The rule is no longer that those drawing up such plans must have regard to the superior planning document but that the <Col N="633"/>plans must be in compliance with the superior planning document.  This is a small change &mdash; a few words &mdash; but they will have a significant effect.  The Government has also stepped up its efforts to address the issue of ghost estates by insisting that in the future planning and land use must be based on evidence of need and that this evidence must inform a core strategy which cannot be deviated from &mdash; if it is, the Minister of the day will have the power to intervene.  There are many ways by which the Government has increased its efforts to address the legacy of ghost estates.</P>
        <P>The code of practice soon to be published by the expert group will focus initially on estates in which people are living but which have large numbers of unoccupied units, which is reasonable.  These constitute roughly 1,000 of the 2,500 unfinished estates.  The rest &mdash; pre-developed sites, hard fill areas, areas in which drainage works were done and nothing further happened &mdash; all require a high level of expertise to deal with them.  After a developer goes bust, how does a local authority return the area that was being built on to visual acceptability?  The area may be 20 acres in size, with a road through it and a herringbone drainage system.  What can the council do with these lands?  Should it return them to agricultural use or wait for an upturn in housing demand?  These are complex questions which require professional or expert advice.  I do not think a rushed response would necessarily be the right one.  There is a need for a case-by-case analysis and set of recommendations, but the guidelines must be clear and consistently applied.</P>
        <P>I commend the amendment to the House and look forward to publication of the code of practice.  I applaud the changes that have taken place.  I take on board the need for instruments to be applied to release securities and bonds if that is what is required.  Like Senator Hannigan, I am aware of all sorts of difficulties in finishing estates because of the financial arrangements that have been left in place being very difficult to realise &mdash; bonds beyond the reach of local authorities and insufficient bonds to meet the instatement of roads etc.  All of those issues ring true with my experience of ghost estates and the local authorities&rsquo; problems.  I am pleased the expert group has that as a high priority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of landlords coming into the RAS or the social housing leasing initiative, there is a kind of twilight zone involving people living in rental accommodation.  Many landlords who have not declared themselves as such and continue to avoid coming into the full glare, are doing themselves a few favours while doing their tenants none.  There is a wider issue regarding inferring the same rights on the person living in the rented home as a home owner would have.  That is a longer term project that should be occupying our minds.  We should seek to find legislative instruments to encourage that parity between the home owner and the person who chooses not to own a home but to rent it.</P>
        <P>I commend the amendment.  I believe the Government has stepped up to the plate regarding the ghost estates and that the motion, while worthy in intent, misses the point of what the Government has been engaged in in recent months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Far be it from me to be contentious, but I completely disagree with my good friend and colleague, Senator Dearey.  The motion gets straight and clearly to the point and I am very disappointed the Government should propose to amend it in this completely fatuous way.  The Labour Party motion contains three elements.  The first is that &ldquo;many completed houses are unoccupied despite a huge demand for social and affordable housing&rdquo;, which is a clearly established fact.  On the other hand one needs to be sensitive in these areas because it is not possible simply to take into State ownership willy-nilly housing estates that are incomplete as this might simply concentrate disadvantage in one particular area.  It was tried in Dublin and was a big mistake.  It is a rather more sophisticated problem than simply <Col N="634"/>suggesting matching one with the other.  However, at the same time the facts are established and quite clear, and the first part of the motion is right.</P>
        <P>The next part of the motion states that &ldquo;many estates are still lacking completed roads, pathways and open spaces&rdquo;, which the Government accepts.  It is true and there is no argument about that either.  The final part states that &ldquo;there is no clarity around who will pay to compete unfinished estates&rdquo;, which is also true.  Nobody knows and no mechanism has been put in place for that to happen although everyone wants it to happen and it is recommended by Focus Ireland and the auctioneers&rsquo; association.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>These issues are being addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No interruptions, please</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>However, they have not yet been addressed and the Labour Party motion outlines the current factual position.  It would be much better for both sides to agree rather than this appalling business whereby we are still in the middle of this crisis playing at logic chopping and political partisan point scoring.  There is nothing in the Labour Party motion that could not have the words of the amendment in the name of Senator Cassidy attached to it in order to create a composite motion.  I see no problem with the Government&rsquo;s amendment because it is so pathetically weak.  It notes this and that, welcomes the potential to do something else, and commends the intention and the potential role of other things.  It is all pie in the sky and would not detract from the Labour Party motion.  If the Government wants the respect of the people it should stop playing this stupid game of party politics and agree a composite motion.  We can then get together to address this serious problem facing the country.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator McFadden on proposing that there should be social housing for single men, which has long been a problem.  We should be able to solve at least some of it using this housing stock especially given that, as any person with any contact with the market will say and as covered on a radio programme over the weekend, people will not buy one-bedroom apartments.  Some tricksters of property developers, who are now appropriately in trouble, specialise in building one-bedroom units.  They brought in a transient population because nobody wants to stay in them or have a family in them.  Nobody will develop a relationship with a community living in a one-bedroom apartment.  On the other hand, single people, particularly single men, might well be grateful to get them.</P>
        <P>I know there is a kind of antagonism to the phrase &ldquo;ghost estates&rdquo;.  I see the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, nodding and perhaps he will say something about this.  The problem is that we are lumbered with the phrase in the same way that we are lumbered with phrases such as &ldquo;boy racers&rdquo; and &ldquo;free fees&rdquo;, which is an oxymoron.  They may be inappropriate and ugly, but they are there and people use them so we need to work with it.  These estates are in different states of completion or non-completion, but there is no point in railing against the idea of calling them ghost estates.  It may not be an exactly accurate scientific description, but it is there.</P>
        <P>There is a question as to whether it might be better to demolish some of them and perhaps a partial demolition might be appropriate because of the decay.  First, it is very depressing for people to have bought a house and see a large section &mdash; one third or even half an estate &mdash; decaying around them.  It is also unsanitary with infestations of vermin such as rats, children exposed to danger because they will break into it, and the danger of fire; I need not go on.  We need to consider whether on balance it would be better to complete or pull down and at least remove some of the visible aspects of blight.</P><Col N="635"/>
        <P Just="Left">The scale of the problem is significant.  I am happy to commend the Government on establishing the national survey, which at least gives us fairly stark facts to deal with.  There are 43,000 empty or unfinished units in 34 local authority areas.  The Cork County Council area has by far the largest number of ghost estates &mdash; I apologise for using that term, but it is in the briefing I have &mdash; with 284 unfinished or substantially vacant developments.  It is followed by Wexford with 180, Fingal and Kerry with 152 each, 147 in Cavan and 104 in Louth.  Much of this follows the pattern of areas with defective planning permissions granted.  In the number of planning permissions overturned on appeal, Donegal was the worst and it was also among the worst in terms of the developments.  In Donegal, 60% of planning permissions were overturned and Cavan had nearly 40%.  Those are astonishing figures, which reflect a dangerous practice in that they considered only their own selfish parochial or party interest in their planning decisions.  I commend the Green Party on having a useful impact on Government in tidying up some of these planning aspects, but we were left with the historical detritus of it.  Some 2,846 developments were inspected and only 429, 15%, were active.  Some 78,195 dwellings were complete and occupied. A total of 23,250 dwellings were complete and vacant, 9,976 dwellings were near complete and 9,854 dwellings were at various early stages of construction activity.  These are very serious figures.</P>
      
        
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I wish to return to a matter I raised on the Order of Business about school construction.  A serious situation has been caused by the collapse of Pierse Contracting and Pierse Building Services which has left between 2,000 and 3,000 smaller subcontractors in the lurch.  There is money in the Department of Education and Skills which should be used to complete these contracts, as Wexford County Council has decided to do with a half-abandoned Pierse construction site in Wexford.  Why not reactivate the National Building Agency?  Using the evidence from this survey the Minister could decide whether it is appropriate to use the National Building Agency or something similar to employ many of the unemployed building workers to complete those housing estates which appear to have a prospect of being sold or which would have some socially beneficial use.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>At the beginning of this financial crisis I suggested, although no one took any notice, that we should consider the possibility of establishing a Department for home security, not homeland security, which would try to secure people in their homes in the context of defaulting on mortgages and so forth.  When we have this blight of ghost estates, difficulty in the construction industry and queues and backlogs in waiting lists for social housing, the idea of creating a Department with that specific focus should be examined again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I agree with Senator Norris that we should not play politics with this.  I have no hang-ups about the wording of amendments.  The people who are suffering are the purchasers who bought houses but are now living in drastic conditions.</P>
        <P>I watched a programme on RTE a couple of weeks ago about an estate in Longford.  I have to give the builder some credit because he stated that, like many others, he got involved in the building business knowing nothing about it.  He was making 20% on each house and thought it was great.  His son died tragically in the meantime but he was making an effort to try to rectify the houses for the people who are living there.  There is a problem with sewers, they have no electricity connection and so forth.  Children are using the unfinished houses as a playground and there have been a number of accidents.  It is not a time for either side to be playing politics on this.  We must help in some way or other the unfortunate people who are suffering.</P><Col N="636"/>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and especially the Green Party on bringing some common sense into planning.  I do not wish to discuss the past because that does not achieve much but there was a situation in which there was self-certification building and excessive zoning.  In some cases, more land was zoned for housing than was required by the population in the area, which was crazy.  Local authorities acted in a completely irresponsible manner.  No inspections were carried out.  More than 2,500 houses in this country have had to be vacated by people &mdash; I believe there are approximately 400 such houses in my constituency &mdash; because the walls have cracked owing to pyrite.  There is an ongoing court case about this which I understand will continue for the next three years.  In the meantime, the house owners have been left in the lurch.  There were no inspections and the local authorities did not act in a responsible manner.  They did not carry out the duties required of them.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State on making a start on this.  We must fix the problem as soon as possible.  In many areas people are living in unfinished estates.  The roads and footpaths are unfinished while manholes are high over the surface of the road and are quite dangerous.  People are crying out for help.  We need to give them some hope and offer them a timescale for when something will be done for them.  It is an horrific situation in which to find oneself.  One of the people interviewed for that programme was asked what he would do.  He said he might have to walk away from the house and rent one elsewhere.</P>
        <P>People have found themselves living in remote places with no nearby shops or transport as well as no lighting or proper sewerage system.  The Government and politicians in general have a responsibility to ensure no one is left in limbo.  We also have a responsibility to ensure these people&rsquo;s mental stability is not affected.  Many people are suffering from depression and so forth as a result of the housing in which they find themselves.  It is not good enough.  They are also quite angry because they see that some of the developers &mdash; I do not seek to paint all developers with the same brush &mdash; appear to be living in the lap of luxury in other countries.  They have just walked away from all this and have not been held to account by anyone.  In some cases, people do not even know who the developers are.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome this move by the Minister of State.  How far are we from fixing this?  Can we say there will be some progress on it in six months or a year?  We must make a start somewhere to give people some hope.  It is just not good enough to leave them in their current situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this important issue again.  We must always consider the context of a debate and examine the reasons for being where we are.  We have inherited a terrible legacy from the housing boom and the Celtic tiger economy.  People have engaged in the blame game but we are right to seek accountability and to report on why it happened and who the main players were in making it happen.</P>
        <P>There has been excessive zoning and we must acknowledge that.  That is not the only reason, however.  Just because land is zoned does not mean planning permission will be secured.  An excessive number of planning permissions were granted and there is now an overhang in the number of housing units lying vacant.  The reason for the excessive number of planning applications being granted is that there were Government sanctioned tax reliefs in many areas where housing developments probably should not have been built.  There was easy borrowing from the banks.  If that borrowing had not been available, the capital would not have been available to build the developments.  There was also poor regulation.  I do not wish to delve into this area but it is important to identify all the factors that contributed to the property bubble.</P><Col N="637"/>
        <P>With regard to local authorities, they had a very high dependence on planning contributions.  That must be acknowledged.  This is fundamentally an issue of how local authorities are funded because they were depending on the enormous contributions that arose from granting planning permission and the construction of developments.  There was an incentive for local authorities to grant planning permission.  That incentive must be removed.  If not, we will not have proper and sustainable planning.  If that incentive is removed, we must examine new ways of raising finance for local government.  These are the issues we must tackle if we are to learn from past mistakes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must also acknowledge that the Exchequer was heavily dependent on the income and tax receipts that were raised from the property bubble.  There was high expenditure on our public services and in other areas which were dependent on the huge income from the property bubble.  We now see the huge shortfall in the public finances, which is currently &euro;19 billion.  Tax income has taken a sheer drop, as if from the top of a cliff, but we still have high public expenditure.  That is the legacy we are discussing and there were many factors in creating it.  I agree that engaging in a blame game for purely political purposes will not generate solutions, and we must be careful about that.  There must be accountability, however, and we all must play our part in trying to secure that.</P>
        <P>I welcome the national survey as it serves as a baseline from which we can work.  However, figures produced by the Department conflict with those produced in the national survey and the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis.  We need to confirm the figures and ensure we have them as accurate as possible from the outset.</P>
        <P>Despite the number of vacant houses, it is most frustrating that thousands of people are still on housing lists.  Other public representatives and I, as well as those on housing lists, find it frustrating to hear daily about vacant units while we still have large numbers on waiting lists for housing.  Many of them are in private rented accommodation and in receipt of rent allowance; therefore, the State is already paying out for them.  Therefore, it is in its best interests to ensure they are provided with social housing as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Another matter that needs to be addressed before we start leasing private accommodation is the significant number of vacant local authority houses, many of which are boarded up and in need of either reconstruction or maintenance.  Local authority officials say this is because they do not have the resources or the manpower to regenerate or maintain these properties.  That is a crying shame, particularly in the current climate when we have thousands of unemployed construction workers.  Local authorities and the Department could put together a scheme to get apprentices and craftsmen off the dole.  They should let them do the maintenance works required in these vacant houses in order that they can be re-let to people on the housing lists.  We need to think outside the box to get people off the dole queues to do this work.</P>
        <P>There appears to have been a major shift in policy in the Department over the summer, I presume as a result of the number of vacant houses available in the private sector.  A circular was issued to local authorities more or less instructing them to cease engaging in construction.  I understand why the circular was issued, but I do not agree there should be such a major shift in policy without an analysis of needs in each local authority.  A one-size-fits-all policy will not work.  In the Dublin commuter belt there is a more serious overhang and a greater number of vacant private properties available than in other areas, but in rural areas with a large hinterland there is still a need for local authorities to construct new houses.  They must be allowed this flexibility where a need is identified.</P><Col N="638"/>
        <P Just="Left">We need clarity on the national expert group, its terms of reference and who is represented on it.  We need its report which must prioritise solutions to the problem of vacant properties and ghost estates.  There is a question about unfinished estates and the bonds collected by local authorities.  This week the media reported that local authorities still held many bonds but had not called them in.  I understand from discussions with local authority officials that many of the bonds are inadequate.  They were put in place to cover superficial aspects of estates such as the provision of lighting or the final skin on footpaths or roads but do not address the deficits in infrastructure such as the provision of sewerage and water systems.  During the big freeze last year we saw that, even in some finished estates, the infrastructure was substandard.  The infrastructure has been placed underground and cannot be seen.  Unfortunately, in some estates it was not installed at the correct depth or to the proper standard and as a result water pipes froze in cold weather and we have ended up with a catalogue of problems.  Pipes crack and water leaks and all such problems impact on local authority and State resources.  Many of the estates are private and the work was certified by professional engineers with insurance policies.  Why do local authorities or the State not call on these insurance policies?  As professional organisations, whether for engineers or architects, certified the work done in these estates, why do we not call on the insurance policies when estates are subsequently found to be substandard?  When the professionals are found to be at fault, we should call on their insurance policies.  This issue must be examined.</P>
        <P>We could debate this matter forever.  The national survey is a start and will give hope to citizens living in unfinished estates that we will try to address the problems they have inherited through no fault of their own.  They have paid good money for which they worked hard, but, unfortunately, the system and local authorities have let them down.  We need to learn from this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, and compliment him on his initiative some months ago to try to establish accurate figures.  While they are the subject of debate, they can no longer be challenged.  I am particularly pleased, therefore, that he took the initiative because it brings to an end speculation in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been a great deal of soul searching and wringing of hands about what the Government did or did not do during the housing boom.  As early as 2004 or 2005 it became apparent that it was unsustainable that 25% of national wealth was being generated in the construction sector when the European average was 10%.  I made this point in the House on a number of occasions.  It was also becoming evident to the Government which began to dismantle the tax incentives available.  If I have one criticism of the Fianna F&aacute;il Government at the time &mdash; I am a member of the party and was a Member of the House during that period &mdash; it is that despite my strenuous objections to the extension of what was known as the Shannon tax incentive scheme, it continued.  The scheme had worked exceptionally well.  It set out to achieve the objective of ensuring the repopulation of counties such as Leitrim which had been ravaged by emigration dating back to 1840.  It also provided a corporate tax break which resulted in significant investment in the county.  One need only look at Carrick-on-Shannon today and when it was a small sleepy town through which people passed without giving it a second thought.  Now it is a cool place to be.</P>
        <P>The downside of the scheme was that too many houses were built.  Up to 2004 most of the building activity in my county had taken place in Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton and Kinlough which is only two miles from Bundoran.  However, it was not until the extension of the tax scheme that significant numbers of housing estates started to appear in my home town of Drumshanbo and outlying towns within travelling distance of Carrick-on-Shannon.  It was at <Col N="639"/>that point that people motivated more by greed than housing demand started to pay inflated prices for land and, subsequently, to charge enormous prices for their houses.  I do not want to single out a particular builder, but two or three years ago one would have paid &euro;350,000 for a four-bedroomed house in Drumshanbo.  The prices asked for were outrageous.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and his colleague, Deputy Finneran, have acknowledged that the housing market overheated between 2004 and 2007.  However, they make the defence &mdash; I am inclined to agree with them &mdash; that during that period the Government tried to give hard working families what they needed, a crack at home ownership.  Also, no one said at the time that we should build fewer houses.</P>
        <P>I would like to make it clear that developers were not offered special rates.  Any tax measures designed to encourage the freeing of lands for development were not aimed at a particular group or an elite few.  In other words, farmers and other owners of small amounts of land were able to avail of the measure.  I can give examples in my county where some 90% of the land is marginal and on which nothing is grown apart from rushes.  For a period in the late 1990s and early 2000s land prices were inflated, but like many others I did not object.  Farming families with surplus land which was fallow and only used for grazing livestock were able to generate real money for the first time since the Famine.  No one resented them for doing this.</P>
        <P>The motion claims there is no clarity around who would pay to complete unfinished estates that are still lacking completed roads, pathways and open spaces.  An interesting phenomenon has occurred since NAMA was established.  NAMA has taken on a significant number of undeveloped or partially developed estates in Leitrim.  The agency has either begun or instructed receivers to sell these properties.  The buyers, in turn, are completing the estates.  The downside of this was seen recently in my home town where houses, sold at the peak for &euro;320,000, are now being sold for &euro;140,000.  While some may argue this is bringing house prices to sustainable levels, it is depressing the housing market.  It is difficult to tell where this particular trend will go.</P>
        <P>One key priority has been leasing unsold housing stock by local authorities and voluntary bodies for social housing purposes.  More than 2,500 units have been sourced and approved for use under this scheme.  It will be an increasingly important component in the State&rsquo;s response to housing needs in the future.</P>
        <P>Taking a base vacancy rate of the national housing stock at 6%, Fingal County Council has a 2.1% oversupply while South Dublin County Council has 9% and Meath County Council 7.9%.  Galway City Council is at -0.1% and has a slight potential of undersupply.  In these local authority areas it is estimated stock should be taken up relatively quickly when demand returns.  In my part of the world, oversupply figures amount to 35% in County Roscommon, 24% in County Sligo, 21% in County Leitrim and 19% in County Longford.  The extent of oversupply is not near as great as had been thought.  In some areas, the oversupply equates to a few quarters of normal demand.</P>
        <P>Another interesting aspect of this debate is that Ireland did much better during the housing boom than Britain.  In Ireland houses were built whereas in the UK the phantom housing boom added very little new housing stock.  Why were so many housing starts spatially decoupled from economic activity?  That is the problem facing us with the overhang in the north west and north midlands.</P>
        <P>As a result of the tax incentives, houses were built far removed from locations where jobs were available.  In my home town, people asked who would live in the new housing developments because no extra jobs were being generated in the locality.  Instead, people were choosing to live in the town while willing to commute longer distances.  Many residents in my <Col N="640"/>area commute to Sligo, Cavan, Enniskillen and Longford, a 45-minute journey in all.  This raises the problem, as outlined by the Minister of State, of a greater reliance on private transport and greater pressure on transport infrastructure.  This is a legacy of these years with which we will have to deal.</P>
        <P>I applaud the Minister of State for ensuring the planning process will be examined and it is to be hoped we will never have to face over-demand coupled with underresourced planning departments as was the case in Roscommon.  The Heritage Council published a report in 2006 which was highly critical not of those working in the planning departments in Roscommon and Leitrim but of a system that had allowed huge demand for planning applications without sufficient resources to address them.  Monitoring and enforcement were not up to the efficient standards they had been in the past with the result that the eye was taken off the ball when it came to housing standards and, in some instances, unauthorised buildings were erected.  This is not as simple as it may seem to the outsider.  Dealing with the legacy of oversupply in certain parts of the country, especially in those areas where industrial development and job creation were minimal, is a complex matter.  I welcome this timely and accurate amendment to the motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Housing Development Survey, published by the Ministers of State, Deputy Cuffe and Deputy Finneran, is an important, welcome and much-needed report.  It eliminates the unsubstantiated rumours of what had occurred in some housing developments.  Having said that, the survey&rsquo;s results are alarming.</P>
        <P>A housing development, by definition, comprises two or more dwellings set out in free-standing, semi-detached, terraced, duplex or apartment format.  A special advisory group was set up to tackle the issue of ghost estates and offer solutions to the problem.  With more than 2,800 ghost estates in the country, this was a welcome step.  The group comprises members of NAMA, central and local government, the banking and construction sectors, and architecture, planning and engineering institutes.  All have an important role to play in this.</P>
        <P>One glaring omission from the group was the residents of these ghost estates.  They should have been included to introduce the consumer aspect into the group&rsquo;s deliberations.  While many of these ghost estates are partially occupied, the local authorities will not take them over, making it difficult for those living in them.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney claimed there will be a quick uptake of these houses when demand returns.  How long do we have to wait for that?  Demand may not return for up to ten years and the outlook for the quality of life for residents in many of these unfinished estates is shocking.</P>
        <P>Dwellings considered complete by the survey are not necessarily so as the finer details of building regulations and planning permission may have been overlooked.  Dwellings without outstanding works such as individual electricity supplied to a property are not considered major works and are, therefore, considered complete.  Housing developments completed three or more years ago that have up to 10% of dwellings unoccupied have not been included in the report either.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In many ways, the survey is an understatement.  Fingal County Council has 125 ghost estates with Balbriggan especially badly affected with 2,809 unoccupied dwellings, including the Hastings estate with 120 and Hampton Gardens with 998.  There are 6,700 households on the housing list in Fingal, so that potential must be explored in whatever way it can.  The director of Fingal&rsquo;s housing services department, Mr. Dick Brady, is a creative thinker on these matters and I know he will bring forward solutions.  We must try to match this oversupply of houses in <Col N="641"/>ghost estates with the more than 7,000 people on the waiting list.  Unfinished houses must be completed in some way.</P>
        <P>Innovation is required in this regard and the social housing list can be greatly reduced if these occupied houses are utilised.  It is unacceptable, however, to say that everything will be fine when demand returns.  I look forward to some creativity from this high level expert group.  The Minister of State should try to ensure the consumer&rsquo;s voice is represented on that body.</P>

	<P>I welcome the constructive debate we have had on this issue.  I have taken notes of some of the contributions and I intend to feed them back into the ongoing process.  It is not the first time we have had a good debate about the causes of oversupply in the housing market.  We all have our pet blame for what went wrong and why.  Within my own party, we put much of the blame at the door of excessive zoning of land, but there are many other issues, including development levies.  In some counties there was far too much of a chase to get development levies and therefore to grant permission for development.  That was part of the problem.</P>
        <P>It is great to see almost a cross-party consensus that the tax incentives went too far in the final analysis.  I re-read Charlie McCreevy&rsquo;s introduction of the levies when he essentially said that a rising tide would lift all boats.  It did not.  It was naive to assume that blanket tax designations would, at the stroke of a pen, transform local economies that had far more deep-seated socioeconomic challenges than simple tax incentives could cure.</P>
        <P>The media were not mentioned, but the glowing tones with which the property supplements greeted every new development in the latter part of the boom contributed significantly to the problem.  We like to blame banks for throwing mortgages at people, but the media threw homes at people.  They made people feel a bit stupid if they did not have at least one property, if not several.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a challenge and that was part of it.  A more fundamental issue is that we have a post-colonial obsession with property, which underlines every one of the issues I mentioned earlier.  People see home ownership as providing stability.  I strongly believe, however, that we should be looking at a more European model with a greater menu of options for home ownership.  There should be greater security of tenure in the private rented sector in order that people would be happy to spend their entire lives in rental accommodation.  In the reforms we are making in the private rented sector, we have to give people greater stability, not just in terms of tenure but also in that fundamental belief that they will be protected in a rental environment.  That includes protection from noisy neighbours, eviction or whatever else untoward may happen in a neighbourhood.  We would have a healthier housing market as a result.</P>
        <P>This debate is not so much about looking at the causes of the problem, more about finding solutions to what now faces us.  The work being undertaken by my Department and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, is all about finding a way out of the challenges we have.  The National Housing Development Survey is a necessary and critical first step in tackling the problems associated with unfinished developments.  It establishes an authoritative baseline analysis at a national level of unfinished housing developments to assist in fully understanding the scale and extent of the issues.  We are putting actual figures in place <Col N="642"/>of estimations.  We are replacing vagueness with certainty and, most of all, we are underpinning a clear plan of action to remedy critical situations in the most problematic developments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was interested to hear Commissioner Olli Rehn saying yesterday that we need better medium-term planning.  He was talking about financial planning, but this country also needs better physical planning in the medium term.  Let us move away from tax incentives and look at the real needs of counties such as Longford, Roscommon and others.  We can plan better and provide an improved quality of living and working environments in those areas if we look beyond bricks-and-mortar solutions.</P>
        <P>I am grateful for the plaudits given to me for initiating this survey and, while I would like to take the credit, I cannot do so.  It was initiated by the officials in my Department.  I want to place on the record my appreciation of the far-sighted work they undertook to determine the extent of the problem before I took office.  It is a strong, evidence-based survey.  We have that survey and are now taking prompt action.  We have put in place a committee which met for the second time today.  Its members sat down with a draft manual and are making some revisions to it.  We want to move full steam ahead and put the manual out for public consultation in order that everyone can make their contribution, including residents.  I take the point that perhaps residents should be represented on the committee.  I have an open mind on that point and will certainly re-examine it.</P>
        <P>I wish to set out briefly the key figures emerging from the survey.  More than 2,800 housing developments were identified where construction had commenced but had not been completed.  That translated into more than 180,000 housing units for which planning permission has been granted.  Of those units, more than 120,000 dwellings have commenced construction while 77,000 are completed and occupied.  A further 33,000 homes are either completed and vacant or nearly complete.  Some 23,000 of these are complete and 10,000 require final fit-out and connection to services.</P>
        <P>The 33,000 complete and nearly complete dwellings identified in the survey represent the most realistic assessment available of the overhang of new dwellings on the housing market.  A remaining 10,000 dwellings are at various stages of construction, from preliminary site clearance to foundations to wall plate level.  While the results of this survey will not immediately change the reality for those living in unfinished housing developments and who are deeply concerned for the future of those developments, it presents a strong evidence basis for the delivery of action.</P>
        <P>I take Senator Brady&rsquo;s point that people were getting into building who had no background or understanding of it.  Some 15 years ago, when I was a councillor in Dublin, I recall someone ringing me up to say he was having fierce problems getting planning permission.  He got a nurse to draw up the drawings and could not understand why he was not being granted permission.  That level of incompetence in the construction sector added substantially to the problems we are now dealing with.  I do not remember whether the nurse managed to get planning permission for her client in the end, but it illustrates the challenges that existed, especially when we force fed tax incentives at the problem.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I do not know whether the individual who rang me up was of any particular political persuasion.  The nub of the problem, however, was an abundance of tax incentives.  That was a problem in Temple Bar, Drumshanbo and elsewhere.  Even the seaside <Col N="643"/>resorts scheme, for which Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s party and his colleagues in the Labour Party would take credit, added significantly to the challenges.  Tax incentives look like the quick-fix solution by getting money and buildings in there.  Members should visit the seaside resorts and the upper Shannon scheme.  There is a legacy of major challenges.  If we have learned something from this, it is that tax breaks in themselves do not address the challenges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was inaccurate reporting in the aftermath of the publication of the National Housing Development Survey.  It was wrong for media commentators to characterise every one of the 2,846 developments inspected by the Department as so-called ghost estates.  Such reporting is not just inaccurate, it verges on irresponsible.  There are not 2,846 ghost estates.  We examined 2,846 estates.  The detail of the survey shows many of the developments have been completed, are fully occupied and perhaps have only minor completion issues outstanding, such as the provision of final road surfaces.  Only 147 developments in the survey are fully completed but have less than 10% of the completed units occupied.  Some 50% of the developments surveyed are quite small, at 30 dwellings or fewer, and 25% had ten dwellings or fewer.  Some 1,050 developments are potentially of concern because they are substantially incomplete but have significant occupancy.  Considering the 1,000 or so substantially incomplete but significantly occupied developments, further analysis will reveal the smaller proportion of these developments, probably in the region of 200 to 300 developments, that are in particular distress.  I do not want to blind Members with statistics but it is worth drilling down into the very good survey analysis to gain a more complex understanding of the challenges.  These distressed developments are essentially where neither a developer nor a receiver acting on behalf of a financial institution is present and addressing outstanding completion issues.</P>
        <P>Every housing market, regardless of the point of the market cycle it is at and whether rising or falling, will have a certain level of vacancy in its stock.  The Irish housing market is no different.  These survey results provide an important snapshot of the housing market in Ireland.  Now that we have identified the extent and scale of the problem, we can assess how best to manage the problems that have arisen.</P>
        <P>The publication of this survey is just the beginning of the process of addressing unfinished housing developments, a process that will require the involvement of not just Government but developers, financial institutions, local authorities, professional experts in relevant disciplines and, above all, local communities and residents.  The expert group recently announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, and me draws representatives from all of these stakeholders and is actively developing practical and policy solutions to ensure satisfactory resolution of unfinished housing developments.  The group is being chaired by John O&rsquo;Connor, the chief executive of the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.</P>
        <P>The expert group is already making good progress in advancing a best practice guidance manual for managing and resolving unfinished housing developments.  The second meeting of the group took place today, which demonstrates the urgency the group is placing on this matter.  The expert group will publish the manual as a consultation draft in the next week or so.  The manual will set out the roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders in addressing unfinished housing developments, identify the type of developments and issues that need to be prioritised for action in the short term, and summarise the wide range of statutory powers currently at the disposal of local authorities to resolve urgent matters.  It will establish an organisational context for leadership on this issue at local authority and national levels, building on existing best practice approaches developed in Ireland and elsewhere in dealing with the issue.  Some local authorities have come to the fore in the actions they have taken.  These <Col N="644"/>actions and solutions will be brought together in the manual.  We will ask the public for its views and integrate them in the final version of the document in the new year.</P>
        <P>The manual will act as a code of practice for the range of stakeholders to address the issues.  The focus of the expert group is on that fraction of the overall number of developments surveyed where there is substantial occupancy but also completion issues.  Some of these apply to the Fingal examples cited earlier, especially where neither a developer or a receiver appointed by a financial institution is present.  The Government will consider any recommendations made by the expert group in regard to legislative changes.</P>
        <P>The survey output provides a key strategic input not just to the evolution of planning policy and practice and the operation of the housing market but also to the delivery of social housing over the coming years.  From the point of view of social housing, more important than the precise number of unoccupied units is what we propose to do with those vacant and available for use.  In this regard, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, has been pursuing a multi-stranded approach to obtain vacant unsold stock for use as social housing through a long-term leasing initiative that will support the delivery of sustainable communities.  This involves matching up oversupply with rising demand.  This will be a plank of social housing supply in the coming years.  It is not as easy as matching 10,000 empty units and 10,000 people on the housing list.  According to those involved in the provision of social, affordable or local authority housing, the issue is more complex.  We must ensure we do not have a particular group of people with housing needs concentrated in one area.  We want to achieve a housing mix.  Some housing bodies have done great work in recent years by ensuring one gets a mix of different tenancies in housing developments.  We must learn from the existing examples.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has done good work in stopping the large, monofunctional housing estates we had in previous years.  There is work to be done in ensuring we have a range of housing tenures.</P>

	<P>I will take two minutes more to get through the remainder of my thoughts.  We are engaging extensively with NAMA to ensure we free up housing where possible in order that there is no stagnation at that end of the market.  Some 2,500 units have been sourced and approved for use under long-term lease arrangements, which will arrange for two thirds of total social housing delivery this year.  We must learn from the past and be careful that we do not see this unoccupied new housing as a quick fix to sort out social housing lists.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to one-bedroom apartments.  We introduced regulations and guidance to ensure we do not have an oversupply of one-bedroom apartments.  Some 15 or 20 years ago, I was very critical of very small housing units and the lack of housing mix.  I referred to it as vasectomy planning, where the apartments were so small one would not think of raising a family in them.  We need a range of housing types which is good for the surrounding community and residents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other side of this is reform of the planning system.  The work of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and the passing of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act fundamentally change how we will plan in the future.</P><Col N="645"/>
        <P>Senator Mooney referred to replacing rushes with housing.  I am a little nervous about this proposal because rushes are an indication of bad drainage.  We have undertaken work on flooding issues and we must ensure we do not build on land that is prone to flooding.  The survey adds an additional chapter to a range of planning and housing information.  The manual is the next element and this is all happening quite quickly.  I look forward to further work on this issue.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The Minister of State is correct in saying that the survey will not immediately change reality for those living in unfinished housing developments.  It presents strong evidence for the delivery of action.  The remarks of the Minister of State are at odds with the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  He said he would not leave houses empty while thousands of people are on the housing list.  I fully agree that we cannot match up one aspect with the other.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, to the House and commend him on his bona fides in this regard.  The amendment before the House was unnecessary.  We had a good debate on the issue contained in the motion during statements in recent weeks.  There was no need for an amendment, which in itself is aspirational and lacks conviction.  The Minister of State correctly said that we have identified unfinished estates of various types in each local authority area.  I accept there was misreporting.  We should put that on the record.  People invested money in houses.  I do not refer to those who bought five or six properties but people who bought them as homes. </P><P Just="Left">I fully agree with the Minister of State.  I liked his description of small apartments.  He is correct.  Planning was wrong.  I opposed planners in my own area of the city because I believed certain developments were wrong for the locality.  I speak on behalf of families and single people who bought a primary residence to be their home and who are now living in unfinished estates and apartment complexes with no one else or only a few other people living there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is unfortunate that we now have thousands of people on housing waiting lists in every local authority.  If one engages with the local Simon Community one hears that increasing numbers of people are becoming homeless.  Unfinished estates are the most visible sign of the collapse of the Celtic tiger.  We have the banking bailout, unemployment and emigration but that is the visible infrastructural legacy, the lack of finished estates and other housing developments.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party motion underlines the need for clarity on who will pay to complete unfinished estates.  There is a need to deliver on that requirement.  On the previous occasion when the Minister of State was in the House I made the comment that developers, bankers and others should not be let off the hook.  Developers who come in by the back door with a change of name or register their companies in a different way should not be given planning permission.  I am not anti-developer.  I am pro-people who want to build and create sustainable communities.  It is a given that a sustainable community needs families, homes, people, proper roads, infrastructure, paths and lighting.  The press release issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government refers to next steps.  For those who live in unfinished estates, the next steps are critical.  They must see action.  We can have hyperbole and fancy press statements but we must have action.</P>
        <P>We have a picture of the situation as we have carried out a survey.  Independent commentators and academics from Maynooth, UCD and other places can squabble about the number but we must see tangible evidence of how we can tackle this blight on society.  There is much <Col N="646"/>in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech with which I could not disagree.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, impresses me, which is a rarity in the Government of which he is a member.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State must deliver.  I accept he cannot do it by himself but he must lead people.  We are talking about people.  This is about sustainable communities.  If people mean anything to us, we should build vibrant communities, urban and rural, in Leitrim, Cork or wherever.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As we speak, people are living in terrible, unfinished estates.  Many of them are in negative equity, struggling with mortgage repayments and trying to pay the bills.  I met a couple last weekend, one of whom had lost a job and the other was on reduced hours.  They had a new baby on the way.  They were told that the underpinning of the apartment complex is dangerous and that they have to move out.  They spent their life savings on their home.  The Minister of State is absolutely correct.  We built apartments in this country that were like box rooms.  They were terrible.  There was no backup infrastructure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I concur with the point made by Senator Ryan that residents should be on the committee.  Let us give ordinary citizens a chance to express their views.  They might rant and rave but they are legitimately entitled to do that.  They would bring to the table a different perspective as they have experience many people in academia or Government do not have.</P>
        <P>The mayor of County Cork, Councillor Jim Daly, referred to the bond issue.  I do not have time to go into it in detail but he is correct that every effort should be made to assist local authorities to call in the bonds put in place by developers to bring about incremental changes.  I accept there is no magic wand and that we must allow due process in terms of the report and surveys, but people expect and want action.  I do not fly a flag for the person who has bought three or four houses who was trying to make money.  I speak for the ordinary person who has invested his or her life savings.  We must look after such people.  I hope the Government side withdraws its amendment because the motion before us is about people and creating communities, something on which the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, and I agree.  I appeal to the Members on the Government side to withdraw the amendment and to support the motion which does not try to condemn the Government but tries to bring about action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I realise we are running out of time.  Senator Buttimer brought home with graphic accounts the human misery involved for people who have to conduct their lives in ghost estates.  It is something on which we must focus.  Safety is a major concern if one is in a difficult situation and one is forced out of one&rsquo;s home under those circumstances.  People might decide that it is unfortunate to live in an unfinished house but what can one do if one is <Col N="647"/>told that a building is likely to collapse and one has no insurance? My heart goes out to that family.  It brings home what we are faced with.</P>
        <P>I take slight issue with the contribution made by the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, because we are in danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Tax incentives were good.  The Minister of State should recall Dublin in the 1980s.  There was nothing in the docks area.  Tax incentives changed that in the area beside the Four Courts all up along the quays.  I accept it is not high quality building but what was there previously was dereliction.  The new docklands areas on both the south and north quays was where we learned.  Architecture of high quality is evident there.  It is a joy to walk around that area.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is stagnation of building projects now.  We are in danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater in that tax incentives were helpful in regenerating areas in my native city of Limerick for example.  It is wrong to say there was not some good in tax incentives just because it is now fashionable to kick developers.  For the sake of consistency, people are crying out for stimulus packages to generate income and transactions in the country.  That is exactly the purpose of tax incentives.  We must be careful about the language we use because it is what is being sought to get people to buy cars and do whatever else.  A flexible taxation system is one that allows people to invest in other people&rsquo;s opportunities, be they for motor manufacturers or others.  Tax incentives are not of themselves bad.  The problem was compounded when there was cheap money and there was no need for tax incentives in the property sector.  Inappropriate tax incentives do no one any good at all.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I agree with Senators Buttimer and Norris.  One could not disagree with the Labour Party&rsquo;s side of this motion, but neither could one disagree with the Government&rsquo;s side.  It should become a composite motion.  I applaud the Minister of State and his Department, as they have conducted a survey with facts.  This is useful because we can do something with that information.</P>
        <P>In terms of the establishment, I am glad that the second meeting of the expert advisory group has been held.  The Minister of State mentioned that we are where we are, but we must consider what we will do.  I do not disagree with the Government which wants to show what it plans to do.  In this light, one could not argue against the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  For this reason, we have an opportunity to table a composite motion.  As Senator Buttimer stated, it is about people.  Something must be done about the properties in question and people need homes.  Mixing the two is not an exact science, but solutions could be reached.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment clearly outlines what work will occur and how it will happen.  The appendix to the terms of reference states: &ldquo;To report to the Ministers on the above and on such other issues as are relevant to the subject matter no later than 31 January 2011&rdquo;.  The Minister of State should not let this deadline pass; it is far too important.  I have every faith in him in this regard as the problem is manageable, but in light of Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s illustration regarding people stuck in certain situations, we must keep the foot firmly on the pedal and ensure the problem is resolved.  We can do it if we work together and tabling a composite motion would deliver a resolution.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is also welcome that we have had a full debate on the important topic of so-called ghost estates.  Mr. David McWilliams gets credit as the man who first coined the phrase &ldquo;ghost estate&rdquo; in 2006, although the Minister of State has been quoted many times in commenting on the negative impact of such estates.</P>
        <P>Most Senators mentioned the national housing development survey which is referred to in the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion.  The figures have been well rehearsed.  As the <Col N="648"/>Minister of State mentioned, it is clear that a substantial number of the developments surveyed are complete and occupied.  While we all welcome this, some 33,000 dwellings are complete or nearly complete but still remain vacant.  This is a concern.  There is also a concern regarding the nearly 10,000 dwellings at various early stages of construction.  One wonders how likely it is that they will be occupied.  It is these dwellings which are addressed in the Labour Party motion which is meant to achieve a resolution in the interests of consumers, those awaiting housing and those who cannot afford to buy a house, even in the downturn.  It is in their interests that the motion is putting it up to the Government in a bid to seek answers as to what it proposes should be done about these unoccupied dwellings.</P>
        <P>On reading the findings of the survey, I was deeply concerned by the fact that planning permission had been granted for a further estimated 58,000 dwellings, on which work has not yet commenced.  While they are not the subject of the motion, they point to something on which the Minister of State has commented previously and a specialist group in Maynooth reported.  They show that there are two sides to the downturn.  Not only was there a lack of regulation of banking and a free-for-fall in giving out loans, the cheap credit to which Senator O&rsquo;Malley referred, there was also a lack of regulation of planning permissions.  Far too many were given.  One report suggests that, using a proper objective estimate, in County Leitrim 590 new houses might have been needed between 2006 and 2009 to accommodate population growth, yet nearly 3,000 were built.  This begs the question of whether there was any regulation or forward planning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senator O&rsquo;Malley stated, we are where we are.  The Labour Party accepts the Minister of State&rsquo;s goodwill in the matter and we framed the motion in an attempt to achieve a constructive solution, not to score political points.  We call on the Government to step up its efforts to address these issues and are heartened to note that the expert group has already commenced its meetings.  As the Minister of State mentioned, the second meeting was held today.  He hopes the manual will be published as a draft consultation document in the next week or so before the final draft is published in the new year.  In the interests of those about whose cases my colleagues have spoken so eloquently, we must ensure the expert group meets its deadlines.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called on the Government to withdraw its amendment.  It could do so, as the motion is not confrontational.  However, we will not put it to a vote.  In a sense, we are working in a composite way to try to achieve a solution to the serious problem of unoccupied dwellings.  The motion suggests the National Asset Management Agency should be involved in that resolution, although it is represented on the expert group.</P>
        <P>To be constructive, I wish to examine the three parts of the motion, the first of which refers to the need for a mechanism to transfer unoccupied dwellings to local authorities to provide social and affordable housing.  I am glad the Minister of State described the proposal in respect of a long-term leasing initiative in this context.  We accept there is not a quick fix, but there are many unoccupied units and many thousands of homeless families.  Many of these units are not located where people might wish to live and there might not be an immediate homelessness problem, but we should see progress on this front in the near future.  I am not only referring to the report of the expert group but also to the provision of housing units for needy families.</P>
        <P>We need to consider matching unoccupied hotels with social purposes.  While this is beyond the scope of the motion, many unoccupied hotels would make excellent nursing homes at a time when more nursing home places are required.  We should, therefore, consider matching unoccupied properties with social purposes.  That is at the heart of the motion.</P><Col N="649"/>
        <P>The final two parts of the motion should not be overlooked.  While dwellings in many estates are complete, the estates lack completed roads, paths and open spaces.  This issue was highlighted in the survey and is of concern to the many families and individuals living in these estates.  In Dublin, for example, of 155 open spaces identified in building plans, only 80 are complete and an alarming 67 have been substantially untouched.  One can only imagine what it is like to live in these complexes, but it is a serious matter for the individuals concerned.  There is no clarity as to who will pay to complete unfinished estates.  I hope there will be clarity in the process described by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>We all recognise the serious problems presented by ghost estates.  We all want to see a solution to match the need for social and affordable housing.  I hope the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, will make this a priority.  I am glad progress is being made and hope the motion will assist in exerting pressure on the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, for taking this matter.  To synopsise it in a nutshell, Garnish is a little fishing hamlet in the Beara Peninsula, about 15 miles west of Castletownbere, facing primarily onto Kenmare Bay.  Beara, Castletownbere and the general area are renowned for their fishing activity and in the small community of Garnish there are in the region of 20 or 25 small vessels.  These are not ocean-going trawlers but small half-deckers or fully decked vessels that range from 20 feet to 40 feet at maximum.  They traditionally fish for mackerel on a seasonal basis and provide significant income for the fishermen, some of whom are part-time farmers or small fishermen.  This activity has been under scrutiny and there is some doubt as to its future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of my motion is to ask the Minister of State to recognise that this is a traditional mackerel fishing area with fishermen who go back generations.  This is not a recent activity.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm that the quota for these fishermen will be maintained into the future and that they will not have the situation they had this year, and possibly other years, of starting the year not knowing their fate for the future.  They would like to know on a year <Col N="650"/>to year basis and well in advance that the traditional fishery will be maintained and protected by the State and they will have a certain amount of the mackerel quota, which is small even in Irish terms and certainly in European or global terms.  I hope the Minister of State will have positive news for me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for raising this issue.  I visited Castletownbere recently and had a very pleasant visit in the area.  I am very familiar with the area around Garnish which is a beautiful part of the country and am glad to have the opportunity to address the issue the Senator raised.</P>
        <P>The need for a review of the polyvalent mackerel quota has been evident for some time, due to an increasing number of vessels taking part in the fishery.  In 2009 my predecessor, the then Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Tony Killeen, initiated a prolonged consultation with the industry on the matter.  He wrote to industry representatives on 24 July 2009 advising that he intended to undertake a review of mackerel management and pelagic licensing policy for the polyvalent segment of the fishing fleet.</P>
        <P>Following that letter the Minister of State received submissions from the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation, Irish Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish South and West Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation, and the Irish Fish Producers and Exporters Association.  He also received letters from individual companies and operators setting out their individual positions.  No agreed position was put forward by the industry and the views expressed were divergent on many aspects of the reform.  Given that situation, the Minister of State invited the industry representatives to a meeting on 18 December 2009 to discuss the issue.  It was very clear at that meeting there were substantially divergent views within the industry on changes to the mackerel management arrangements.  The Minister of State finally decided to retain the existing quota management arrangements for spring 2010 as they were in spring 2009, pending the evaluation and consideration of long-term arrangements as part of the current mackerel review.</P>
        <P>In July 2010 I made a formal proposal to the industry followed by a public consultation process in August 2010.  It was during this consultation process that a submission was made by the Garnish traditional net fishermen&rsquo;s association, setting out their history and the nature of their endeavours.  The method of mackerel fishing employed by these fishermen is quite different to that of other fishermen pursuing the fishery in that the Garnish fishermen use gill nets rather than trawl nets or hook and line.  The hook and line fishery is an inshore fishery developed in recent years with BIM support and an annual allocation of 400 tonnes of mackerel is set aside for the fishery.</P>
        <P>The Garnish traditional net fishermen&rsquo;s group explained that the gill net fishery has been in existence for over 100 years and that in the 1960s 40 boats and 200 people were employed in the fishery, using gill nets.  Over the years many of the fishermen switched to hook and line fishing in deeper waters.  The submission advised that today there are 11 boats involved in this fishery, ranging from 34 foot to 16 foot in length, all still fishing by the traditional gill net method.  In that respect it is very much a localised inshore style of fishing and is focused on bringing a high quality catch to the local processors.  The Garnish traditional net fishermen&rsquo;s association has sought support for the gill net fishery on a national basis although I am not aware that gill net fishing for mackerel is practised to any great extent elsewhere in the country.  I firmly believe that this type of artisan fishery should be supported where possible and this is what I intend to achieve by accommodating these fishermen in the polyvalent mackerel policy and arrangements put in place this autumn.</P><Col N="651"/>
        <P>In coming to a determination on the revised polyvalent mackerel policy, I decided to take account of the request of the Garnish traditional net fishermen&rsquo;s association by accommodating the fishery within the general 2.5% of polyvalent quota available to under 18 metre vessels.  The mechanism used to do this was the inclusion of gill net fishing as an acceptable gear for mackerel fishing within Determination No. 15 of the Need for an Authorisation for Certain Fish Stocks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the submission made by the group, a number of approaches were suggested to ring-fence a percentage of the quota for that style of fishing.  I do not believe that such an approach is warranted.  Following on from Determination No. 15, I have issued fishery management notices, under section 12 of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, for October and November of this year.  I permitted such vessels to land up to five tonnes of mackerel for October and increased this allocation to seven tonnes for November.  The allocation will accommodate the existing landings of these small inshore vessels and I do not believe that ring fencing and demarcation of a specific quota allocation is required in this instance.  I will listen to the views of industry representatives in regard to setting the maximum catch levels within the allocation set aside for under 18 metre vessels on a periodic basis during next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, for her attendance.  To declare an interest, I am president of the Youth and Sports Committee of the Council of Europe and I ask why a country so interested in sport has not signed up to the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport, EPAS.  People regularly argue that we are losing too much control on issues of importance to the EU.  Membership of EPAS, because of its Council of Europe mantle, affords us the opportunity to enhance our influence and express our views as a country on sport.</P>
        <P>The existence of an intergovernmental body such as the EPAS ensures states retain the initiative on issues they do not want to entrust to a supranational body such as the European Commission while retaining the strength of numbers on sporting issues that need to be addressed.  The Lisbon treaty demands that agencies work together.  As a Council of Europe member, I see the input that we as nationally elected politicians have.  To leave all decisions to the European Commission does not always serve our national uniqueness.  I equate joining the EPAS with enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s power as a country, not the hand of Europe.</P>
        <P>The majority of Senators in the House have not heard of the EPAS, aside from the fact of my being on the Council of Europe, or the important work in which it engages on behalf of its 33 member countries.  That is why I wish to inform the House in this matter.  The EPAS covers the following essential policy aspects of sport: maintaining law and order, promoting public health, and the educational and social benefits of sport.  Each of these is especially relevant to the sporting environment in Ireland today.  The value of sport is sometimes underestimated.  Whether it is the GAA or chess, each of these activities provide people with outlets that improve society as a whole.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we take law and order, for instance, thankfully Irish sport in general does not have many problems when it comes to upholding law and order at sports events.  I have been asked by the Hungarian committee chairperson to give some indications as to how we manage to have our sporting endeavours so peaceful and family orientated.  The EPAS, in any event, will be able to aid sports bodies in this country on different approaches and campaigns that can be run to ensure this does not become an issue.  While Ireland has a good record, we have seen in recent weeks and months that a minority of so-called fans can cause trouble.  I am referring in part<Col N="652"/>icular to the incidents that took place at the end of both FAI league games and at Gaelic football matches in the course of last season.  Thankfully, such incidents are relatively rare but we must ensure we take sharp action to stamp out such occurrences before they take hold.  This is something which the EPAS has assisted other member countries to do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s voice at an international level will also be improved.  The EPAS is partnered with the likes of UEFA and other European sports bodies.  Having a voice at the table when policies and regulations are being discussed for sport on a European basis cannot hurt.</P>
        <P>Report after report shows that Irish people are becoming less healthy.  The boom period led many to forget about the importance of exercise.  Obesity, as the Minister of State knows, will be on the rise at a rate that is quite scary, not just among the young but right across the age spectrum.  If this trend is not halted and reversed, we shall see an enormous strain being put on our health service in the years to come.  Having examined the activities closely, it prides itself on its health promotion work.  The campaigns run by the EPAS highlight different ways of improving health through sport.  As these campaigns are on a European-wide basis, the information provided presents many different perspectives on approaches to sport and health.  Again, this illustrates the positive impact that membership of the EPAS can afford Ireland, not only in sport but as a country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Through my Council of Europe work, I have been fortunate to be party to some very early but interesting work that is being done in dealing with corruption in sport.  The scale and widespread nature of this, from the evidence I have seen to date, has shocked me greatly and probably has forever changed the way in which I will view sport.  This is clearly taking place across Europe, and I have no doubt that it is, unfortunately, present within Irish sporting circles as well, with very high levels of gambling on the outcomes of sports fixtures, using exchange betting and other activities. The spotlight is not being focused on this criminal activity but that is about to change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The media and sports bodies in Europe are beginning to pay attention to the problem which threatens the very enjoyment and existence of sport for us all.  To eliminate this growing cancer in sport, it is essential that Ireland is at the centre of future investigations and new regulations.  Signing up to the EPAS presents us with an ideal opportunity to uphold fair play and sportsmanship, which are key values in sport that must be protected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EPAS is regularly consulted and engaged in the awarding of major sports events.  Being part of a lobby that numbers 33 countries and which is constantly growing would strengthen our chances of securing some of these events in Ireland.  Every week in this House we discuss ways of generating employment and general economic growth.  We cannot afford to miss out on the revenue that would be created from these events through tourism and so on.  In this context membership of the EPAS has relevance for the social development of Ireland, quite apart from the sporting benefits.  As far as I know, the economic implications for this country would be minimal.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter and for the opportunity to address the issues involved on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the principles of sports policy defined in the Irish Sports Council Act 1999 are based on the Council of Europe&rsquo;s European Sports Charter.  Our national anti-doping programme, which is administered by the Irish Sports <Col N="653"/>Council, was established based on the elements of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Anti-Doping Convention.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, sport no longer forms part of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s centrally budgeted activities following the Council&rsquo;s proposal in 2006 to transfer a number of activities, including sport, to partial agreements as a means of finding budgetary savings.  This led to the Committee for the Development of Sport being discontinued and the establishment of the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport, EPAS, in 2007.  The growth of the EU and its increasing engagement with sports issues arising from the specific competence for sport under the Lisbon treaty has also overtaken to some extent the Council of Europe&rsquo;s role in this area.  That said, the Council of Europe continues to play an important role in the anti-doping area and currently acts as a forum for a co-ordinated European approach in relation to doping issues, particularly in relation to the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA.</P>
        <P>Ireland ratified the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention in 2003.  The convention has been effective in harmonising anti-doping policies and practices and in raising the standard of the anti-doping programmes of its 50 signatory governments.  The convention provided a framework for the global UNESCO anti-doping convention which Ireland ratified in 2008.</P>
        <P>Article 165 of the Lisbon treaty provides the European Union with a formal competence on sport which will formalise the co-operation and co-ordination between member states.  The European Commission has indicated its intention to adopt a new communication setting out its suggested plans and priorities for European Union action to promote European sporting issues.  The competence allows for better promotion of sport in other EU policy areas and programmes such as health and education.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the growing role of sport within the European Union, in September this year the European Council changed the name of the council in charge of education, youth and culture.  Officially it is now called the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council.  Sport was discussed for the first time at the council meeting in Brussels in May this year and the next sport council will take place next week in Brussels.  I understand that the EPAS is stepping up its co-operation with the European Union and the sports movement through joint projects.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the Council of Europe has played an important role in Irish and European sport policy.  As sport no longer forms part of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s centrally budgeted activities, Ireland is not a member of the Council&rsquo;s EPAS at present.  The Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport does follow EPAS events and programmes for continued consideration in the context of Irish sport policy.  In view of the exceptional economic constraints at present and the need to prioritise developments in relation to the roll-out of the EU sports provisions established by the Lisbon treaty, the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport has insufficient resources to expand involvement to direct participation in the EPAS at present.</P>

I am very disappointed with it, however, because as regards the Council of Europe working with WADA, I have been asked to look at the Council&rsquo;s potential to deal with the organised crime issue.  We are talking about putting together an international agency such as WADA under the EPAS to deal with organised crime.  Ireland is putting itself very much on the fringe of activity that is very central to matters that are very important to us.  I ask that the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport comes back to me with the actual amount involved.  We are not talking about a great deal of money.  In fact, it is tiny.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Chathaoirleach mar gur thug s&eacute; cead dom an r&uacute;n seo a chur roimh an Teach, agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta &Aacute;ine Brady.  The motion calls on the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, whom I know is unable to be here tonight, to make an immediate announcement regarding the contract for the Lower Lee flood risk management scheme.  The Minister of State and the Government have a duty to the people of Cork to outline whether funding is in place and, if so, when the flood protection measures will be commenced and completed.</P>
        <P>The recent revelations by the ESB that the flooding of Cork is no longer considered a once in 800 year occurrence is of extreme concern to the people of Cork.  Almost 12 months on from the eve of the flooding, procrastination by Government and the Departments has resulted in the ESB refusing to implement changes to operating procedures despite the recommendations of Lee Flood Risk Management Plan that the ESB and OPW co-ordinate their working schedule.  Of concern is that no timeframe has been given in regard to when these works will commence.  This is despite the fact that an internal ESB report on the flooding found that the inflow to the reservoirs during the flooding was two and a half times what is considered normal.  This should serve as a warning to Government that we need action and to have the necessary works carried out immediately.  Immediately does not mean in 12 months time.  This work must commence soon.  The ESB has stated that once OPW completes its downstream works on the River Lee it can allow increased discharges from Inniscarra, which in turn will improve its ability to lower reservoir levels in advance of bad weather and heavy rain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, makes a statement tonight in regard to the contract for the Lower Lee flood risk management scheme.  The response received will provide us with a timeframe in regard to the appointment of a contractor, an indication of when the OPW can expect to receive the completed feasibility study and when the flood protection measures are likely to be completed.  These are critical questions that need to be answered by Government on behalf of the people of Cork.  When in February the Taoiseach visited Cork he stated he was thankful the flooding that had occurred was a once in a century event.  According to the ESB, this is not the case.</P>
        <P>It is now winter and we are approaching the first anniversary of the flooding and the people of Cork need and deserve better than what occurred last year when almost 40% of its water supply was disrupted.  Some 12 months on, there is still no early warning system in place and the quay walls of Grenville Place have not been restored.  Is funding for this work in place for the OPW?  Is the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, confident such funding will be provided and that the works will be commenced in 2010 or will we have to wait until 2011 for work to commence?  I am hoping the Government will not sit back in the hope that the people of Cork have a Mediterranean-type winter.  Cork people are by nature of sunny disposition.  However, the long range weather forecast indicates a severe winter ahead.  The Government can no longer put this work on the longer finger.  The people of Cork deserve a timeframe within which there will be a call to action and greater co-ordination between the different strands involved.  I hope the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply to this important motion will be positive.</P>

	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At national level, the need for a proactive approach to the management of flood risk was recognised by the report of the flood policy review group.  As the lead agency for flood risk management, the OPW&rsquo;s strategy for the management of flood risks is founded on that report <Col N="655"/>which was approved by Government in September 2004.  The main work programme to deliver on that strategy is the catchment flood risk management and assessment, CFRAM, programme.  This programme has been piloted on the River Lee.  This work was well advanced before the coming into effect in 2007 of the EU floods directive requiring the State to develop by 2015 flood risk management plans aimed at best managing flood risk in areas where risk is potentially significant.  The objective of the plans is to define existing and foreseeable flood hazards and risks within a catchment and the methods, mechanisms, policies and proposals for managing the hazards and risks in a sustainable, integrated, proactive and holistic manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In February this year, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, launched the first of these plans, the River Lee flood risk management plan, which is the result of three years work by OPW and its partners, Cork city and county councils, and sets out a range of measures to manage effectively and efficiently the flood risk for the whole Lee catchment, which when implemented should significantly reduce the likelihood of the severe flooding witnessed in Cork city and elsewhere in the catchment in November of last year.  The OPW, in association with Cork city and county councils, is currently taking forward the Lower Lee flood risk management scheme, which was a key recommendation of the Lee catchment flood risk management plan.  This scheme seeks to manage the flood risk from the River Lee and has been developed to protect against river and tidal flooding in and around Cork city.  The scheme will involve works downstream of Inniscarra and through Cork city permitting greater discharges to be made from the ESB reservoirs without causing flooding of properties and will provide protection against flooding from the river and during periods of high tide or storm surge.  Based on extensive analysis, undertaken between 2006 and 2009, of river flows and tidal-surge levels, this scheme is considered the most cost effective means of managing these flood risks in Cork city.</P>
        <P>The concept of this scheme was originally devised in the course of the Lee CFRAM study but the events of November 2009 demonstrated the urgent need for this work to be progressed and the overall validity of what the scheme proposes to achieve.  While the concept has been developed within the scope of the Lee CFRAM study, a scheme now needs to be taken forward to public exhibition and, if approved by the relevant stakeholders and the general public, will then be progressed to detailed design.  This work will include developing localised defences upstream of, and through, Cork city.  It will also include the carrying out of further investigations of how revised management of the water levels in the Inniscarra and Carrigadrohid reservoirs could further contribute to reducing the flood risk in the lower Lee and Cork city.  Also, it will involve a full and detailed assessment of the likely environmental impact of the proposed works through an environmental impact assessment.</P>
        <P>The OPW commenced the procurement process for consultants to undertake this work in September of this year and expects to issue tender documents to short-listed tenderers before the end of the year.  The current programme is for the consultant to commence this work early in 2011 and for it to be completed before the end of next year.  This would be followed by formal public exhibition of the proposals.  Subject to public acceptance of these proposals, the procurement of a works contractor would then be undertaken.  Based on past experience of similar flood relief projects, it would likely be some time into 2012 before construction works could commence on the scheme.  However, should interim measures be identified to reduce the existing level of risk in the course of the consultant&rsquo;s work, these will be considered by OPW and its partners on the steering group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">OPW has sanctioned &euro;900,000 for Cork City Council to undertake the repair of quay walls breached last November and contract works for this are currently at tender stage by Cork City Council.  I can confirm that the cost of undertaking the development work and the eventual <Col N="656"/>construction works has been included in OPW&rsquo;s budget profiles for flood relief activities for the coming years.  The Minister of State is confident that the scheme to be developed will be warmly welcomed by the public and will lead to a significant reduction in the risk of flooding as experienced last November.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is extraordinary that the flooding concerned occurred in 2009 and that the Minister of State has stated in her reply to the motion that &ldquo;it would likely be some time in 2012 before construction works could commence&rdquo;.  That is a sad indictment of the processes and procedures we have in place.  It is of little consolation to the people of Cork who were affected by the flooding.  I ask that the Minister of State convey to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, my view that the reply given is not good enough.</P>
