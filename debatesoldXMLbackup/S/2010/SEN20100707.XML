	<P>I have received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to bring forward legislation to compel all companies awarded State contracts to comply with registered employment agreement rates and pension schemes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement on whether he will encourage and support RTE to carry the advertisement campaign to promote peace and reconciliation funded by the IFI and others, currently playing on UTV, given its value to the mutual understanding of the peoples on the island.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the establishment of an advisory board on the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in HSE South and to outline the reason there is no public representative or patient advocate on the board.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Today is an historic day as the civil partnership Bill will be introduced to this House, having been passed in the D&aacute;il.  It is, as we know, on the cusp of becoming law.  The full and positive impact of this long overdue legislation was summed up for me by a young man I met in the House after the Bill was passed in the D&aacute;il, a young man in his early 20s who, unprompted, said to me: &ldquo;This Bill will change my life.&rdquo;  That sums up the personal impact this type of legislation will have on those it affects most profoundly.</P>
        <P>In Fine Gael we have had our own democratic debate on this legislation and we will be supporting it in the House today.  There are obviously widely held views on it.  It is a mark of a civilised society how widely views are held.  Our debate today will be a testament to and a reflection of that.</P>
        <P>I want to speak on an issue, about which many people will gather before the gates of Leinster House today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Many Members will have seen the headlines in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> today about the lives of those with an intellectual disability whose respite care will be cut.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extraordinary.  We live in very difficult economic times, but we must have a serious debate on this issue in this House.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister with responsibility for disability strategy should come into House today to respond to what has been outlined by those individuals who will gather at the gates today, who are experiencing first hand cuts to their care, cuts to their respite care.  People who are at the edge of their coping, who are full-time carers, will now be pushed even further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in their ability to manage their own personal situations.</P>
        <P>As far as I and Fine Gael are concerned, the 2004 disability strategy is in tatters.  Two vital pieces of legislation, the Disability Act and the Education for People with Special Educational Needs Act have been shelved or have been cut so far back as to render them ineffective.  There is an enormous human cost to these cutbacks.  Today we will see the faces of those people, who are primarily affected by these cutbacks, at the gates of Leinster House.  On the day after we heard of the new approach to NAMA, the new information about it and the disparity in the figures of the profit it was meant to make going from &euro;4 billion to &euro;1 billion to maybe a loss, which seems to be the more likely situation; that we hear of the billions of euro that we have put and continue to put into banks, which are not accountable, with many of the same people still in place; and that we heard the CEO of NAMA say the banks have not told the full story <Col N="119"/>and the facts they have given to NAMA are under question once again; it is appropriate that today we have a debate in this House on the cutbacks in the disability sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the points made by Senator Fitzgerald.  I have lost count of the number of times that I have raised these issues, including the EPSEN Act and that fact that its implementation has not so much been put back but that it has not commenced.  We welcomed this legislation on all sides of this House when it was brought forward.  We were assured it would change the position of people with disabilities but the Government has simply shelved it.  It is absolutely appalling.</P>
        <P>A fair point has been made by the Government side at times, that cuts have to be made and every time a cut is proposed, that people on this side of the House will object to it.  There may be some element of truth in that but we could also be given choices.  The people &mdash; the Government will not like to hear this either &mdash; would be well ready to pay a couple of extra pence in taxation to ensure respite care and other such issues were maintained.  Perhaps, Deputy Boyle, let us put that to the people.  That is the thing to do.  The Government funked this issue in the last budget and the budget before that.  I am not talking about massive tax increases but we have said consistently here that public services need to be maintained and the only way that can be done is through revenue.  That is an issue we have to examine.</P>
        <P>There is an another issue, which is a good example of the same principle.  The first item on the agenda of today&rsquo;s business is a motion to change of names of committees, which it is proposed will be passed without our taking any notice of it.  I would like to get an impact statement on that.  I would like people to be aware of what it means.  What does it mean when we go to all this trouble to change the names of a Department?  Are people aware that at a time when we are examining reform of the public sector that this proposed change will have an immediate impact?  If the name of a Department is changed, it becomes a new Department and, as far as I know, the clock begins again, for instance, on the term of the Secretary General, which position is supposed to be a seven-year term.  This proposed change also has contractual and cost implications.  I would like a serious debate on why this is necessary and the impact in terms of costs and human relations in the Department in terms of contractual impact etc.  This is a serious issue and this kind of motion slips through after every Government reshuffle etc.  I ask that we discuss it.</P>
        <P>It was with some reluctance, as the Leader will know, that I agreed on my own behalf to the time allocation of 15 minutes for spokespersons.  I am not comfortable with it.  I have never seen it happen here before.  I indicated to the Leader that I have agreed to it but I do not think there is complete agreement with it on these benches.  We have also decided on these benches, after deep discussion on it, that we will have a freedom of conscience vote and Members will have a free vote on these benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Uncle Joe has removed the Whip.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on the issue of the civil partnership legislation over the next two days.  Members should not be surprised if the Whip seems a bit soft on this side of the House in the next two days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I too am delighted that we have reached this day when we will debate and I hope pass the civil partnership legislation in the next two days.  My party has long supported this legislation and this change to our law.  It will be a progressive change.  It is enlightened legislation.  My party as a whole will support the Bill with a heart and a half.  We will try to amend it in some respects but we believe it is an excellent initiative.  We congratulate all concerned in preparing it and bringing it before this House today.  I look forward to the debate.</P><Col N="120"/>
       <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The Leader might be able to clarify another development in regard to legislation referred to in the newspapers today, which I have not heard previously mentioned in these Houses that, apparently, the Government intends to introduce legislation to alter the legal environment for the placing for adoption of the children of married parents.  We know the children of married parents can only be adopted in very restricted circumstances because of our laws and the interpretation of them.  It is one of the issues that is at the heart of children&rsquo;s rights, the proposal for a referendum to amend the Constitution, the so-called children&rsquo;s rights referendum.  One of the things that will have to be done to facilitate the introduction of the legislation, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, referred in the newspapers today, and which I would welcome, would be that the children&rsquo;s rights referendum would have to be brought forward, put to the people and passed.  That is important.  Can we take this indication by the Minister of State in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers of an intention to bring forward this legislation, as an indication that the Government now clearly intends to hold a children&rsquo;s rights referendum this autumn since the holding of such a referendum would be a necessary precursor to the introduction of legislation of this kind?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise the issue that the ESB is to buy the Northern Ireland Electricity networks business.  This will represent a move from having two grids to eventually having one grid and one-island energy.  In the week when the North-South Ministerial Council met and its members spoke about economies of scale, co-operation and infrastructural integration, it is appropriate that today we should welcome the fact that matters have moved on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have not had a great deal of input into what is raised at North-South Ministerial Council level nor have we had an adequate opportunity to respond to issues raised at North-South Ministerial Council meetings.  Given that the council is very much concerned with bread and butter issues in regard to the development of the island of Ireland and given that there will be another North-South Ministerial Council meeting in the autumn, would it be possible to have a session in the next term at which we could put forward our ideas on the issues remaining to be raised, for example, the all-Ireland mobile phone packages?  We could contribute to the agenda of the council in terms of many issues raised in the House and get a response from it following its meeting in that respect.  The circulation of a press release is not adequate.  In the North the Assembly debates these things before and after they are issued and it is a sign of our interest or disinterest in an all-island economy if we do not have it on our agenda as something to which we would aspire and want to see realised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I called a vote on the Order of Business asking the Minister of State with responsibility for disability to come to the House which was voted down, yet many of those on the Government side of the House chose to speak on this emotive issue against the cuts for people with disabilities.  They had their own reasons for not being able to support the Minister of State coming before the House which is why I support Senator Fitzgerald today.  I ask those on the Government side to come out to the gates of Leinster House at 1 p.m. today and meet the people who are suffering.</P>
        <P>Why do we choose to let people with disabilities, who are the weakest, the voiceless and the most vulnerable in society, pay the highest price?  Why can we not let Anglo Irish Bank swing instead of people with disabilities?  I still do not understand why we put Anglo Irish Bank, a bank which no one can justify, before everyone else.  I am equally astounded with the reports on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> today which notes that the expert group on home <Col N="121"/>mortgage debt said we should let home owners give back their homes and go on the social housing list.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Senator MacSharry and others in this House have been putting forward proposals for many months to help people to hold on to their homes.  It is very uncomfortable for all of us.  Did I hear one reasonable suggestion in the report such as allowing people to have an extra ten years&rsquo; term to pay off their mortgages?  No, I did not.  I want to know what the Minister for Finance will do to save people&rsquo;s homes and businesses and face down the banks.  We see that NAMA sold him a pup.  There are 75% non-performing loans.  It is a joke.  The banks are liars, they have proven it and have fooled the Government.  I want answers for the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication yesterday of the expert report.  I differ from my colleague on the Opposition side of the House.  As Members will know, the prevention of family home repossession group which I established with others had a number of recommendations.  I am pleased to say some of them are included in the report released yesterday.  It is important to say it is an interim report and the final report is due in September.  Our core objectives remain the same in terms of looking for legislative reform of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act to give cognisance and protection to people with family homes.</P>
        <P>There are many good things in the report.  I hope the work of the Hugh Cooney group will continue to bring forward more meaningful proposals.  I and other Members would like it to go a little further but it is not fair of the <i>Irish Independent</i> to ignore recommendations on so many issues when the House pioneered the recommendations in this regard.  I see it has sensationalised media reports today.  It is worth noting the<i> Irish Examiner</i> states &ldquo;Resolution offers hope for struggling mortgage holders&rdquo;, <i>The Irish Times </i>states &ldquo;Government moves to aid homeowners in mortgage arrears&rdquo;, yet the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the newspaper whose owner pontificates on so-called viewspapers rather than news and the provision of the facts to the public, is scaremongering people with headlines like &ldquo;hand back homes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If one reads the report one will find it is a very real option for people which needs to be included as some people wish to do that.  Other protections are included, which I welcome.  I want to ensure they are implemented quickly and built upon.  The report released yesterday is very positive.  This House and other Senators can take credit for much of what is in it.  We should ensure the measures are implemented quickly and are built upon with the final report to be issued later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share with others the great concern regarding the accuracy of the information provided by some of the banks to NAMA.  It is a disgrace.  We should have a debate on it in the House.  I am glad to hear the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, this morning moved to tell the public that if inaccuracies have been knowingly provided by banks in terms of misleading information, then criminal prosecutions will be faced.  I hope that will be the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the absence of my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, I welcome the delegation of ladies from west Cork who are in the Visitors Gallery.</P>

	<P>We are on the Order of Business.  Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are honoured to have them in our presence and I hope we will have ladies and gentlemen from east Galway in the Visitors Gallery very soon.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that we take, before No. 1 on the Order of Business, No. 35, motion 16, in my name and those of Senators Quinn and Ross, which states:</P><Col N="122"/>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann affirms that each Senator should vote according to his or her conscience on the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009 and, accordingly, calls on all political parties to allow a free vote to their members when any vote is called on the Bill itself, or on its individual sections, or on any amendment tabled.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I heard with interest what Senator Fitzgerald had to say when she quoted a person who said the Bill would change a young man&rsquo;s life.  I hope it does change a person&rsquo;s life for the better and I am sure it will, in some respects, change people&rsquo;s lives for the better.  However, other people&rsquo;s lives may be changed for the worse.  Senator Fitzgerald said her party had a democratic debate on the Bill.  If so, she cannot have any objection to a free vote.  It is not to the credit of the D&aacute;il that this Bill passed without a vote and the many concerns which I know were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;held about different parts of the Bill which were not reflected in amendments.  Therefore, given the profound cultural and social significance of the Bill, the changes it will introduce and there are acute issues, in particular around people&rsquo;s freedom of conscience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My point does not concern the Bill, rather that it is a Bill which merits a free vote.  It is important that the Seanad sends out a message that there has been such a stifling consensus today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, is that amendment in order?  Is it not a matter which is exclusively in the remit of political parties?  It is not a matter for the Seanad.  As far as the Seanad is concerned, every vote is a free vote and every Member exercises a free vote.  The issue of party discipline and decisions is peculiarly and exclusively a matter for parties and not the Seanad.</P>

	<P>I welcome the report on mortgage arrears from the personal debt expert group which has made very useful recommendations.  They are more than just recommendations because the Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield, is part of the group and will ensure they are enforced.  The 12-month period is quite short to sort things out before the banks move to repossess a house.  At least two years would be adequate and I ask the Leader to a request the Financial Regulator to adjust his recommendations.  I also commend the work of Senator MacSharry and his expert group and Senator Mary White, who issued a very useful document to party members and others on the current difficulties.</P>
        <P>I commend the Government on its decisive action in this regard.  In regard to NAMA, realism is coming into the situation.  It has a very difficult task.  It was misled by the banks, about that there is no question.  It was possibly misled on purpose in order that some of the executives could be accommodated in advance of the reality becoming known.  It is quite a cynical exercise that some of those who were involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement on NAMA is disappointing and disturbing.  It clearly shows that the business plan produced last year was a complete fantasy.  We now know that 25% rather than 40% of the transferred loans are producing income.  The banks supplied inaccurate information.  Some of the people responsible for this remain at the top in the boards and senior management of the major banks which the taxpayer is recapitalising through the Minister for Finance.  The Minister was wise to appoint public interest directors but neither he nor his Department is doing enough to clear out the banks.  We cannot have confidence in these institutions until this process has been completed properly.  These are the very people who are managing impaired portfolios for NAMA on an agency basis.</P>

We are now being told there will be 2,000 job losses among the staff of the banks.  I do not think a single person working in a bank branch should lose his or her job unless those at the top who are responsible for the appalling mess are rooted out.</P>

	<P>As the people gather outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, I concur with Senator Fitzgerald regarding a debate on the withdrawal of disability services.  I learned a thing or two about the story behind the scenario she described.  One would need a heart of stone not to be moved by the television reports on the difficulties people will face if respite care is withdrawn from them.  However, the Brothers of Charity organisation employs six chief executive officers and I understand each of them receives a salary in excess of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s.  This country has limited resources which should be invested in people who need care.  The last thing this Government needs is to waste public money on these six positions.  Before we get high and mighty in regard to where the Government should or should not withdraw services, we need to learn the facts.  It would be remiss of the Minister for Health and Children to continue spending limited funds on comfortable salaries rather than front line services.</P>
        <P>I can tell from Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s reaction that she did not know about this matter.  This is why we need an honest debate on the withdrawal of services.  The people who will be protesting outside Leinster House tomorrow have our support because nothing can be harder than facing the withdrawal of respite care.  I ask that the Minister be invited to the House to explain the costs of administration to the people.  The organisation is dealing with the issue by withdrawing front line services rather than rethinking its structures.  All of us would prefer to see the money invested in front line services.</P>

	<P>In light of the commitment the Leader gave yesterday, I ask him to take all-party motion No. 14, without debate if necessary.  I recognise we have limited time but I would like the motion to be taken despite the fact that it was referred to dismissively by one of my colleagues.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of a free vote, I will abstain on this extraordinary proposal.  As I noted to Senator O&rsquo;Toole when it first arose, this is an internal matter for the political parties and it would be improper for an Independent Member to intervene.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to convey to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, immediately upon the conclusion of the Order of Business, my request they would enable me to vote in favour of this Bill, which I would like to do.  The amendments I have tabled were substantially authorised by the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, who indicated in a document circulated to all Senators that the rights of children have been vitiated by their deliberate omission from this legislation.  This was done without clear reason or regard for the rights of children and against the advice of the Government&rsquo;s own Colley report that it would seriously damage the rights and interests of children in this country and may bring us into conflict with our own legislation, the European Convention on Human Rights and the international covenants under the United Nations to which this country is a signatory.</P>
        <P>The Government has been given the justification and the reason to act not by me or any crank or person whose views could be regarded as partisan but by the person it appointed to superintend and vindicate the rights of children.  It now has the opportunity to do what is necessary by supporting these rights.  In light of the way the rights of children were violated <Col N="125"/>over the past 100 years by church and State, it can do no less.  Let us see anybody vote to continue the violation of children&rsquo;s rights.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Ten weeks ago, the Minister for Health and Children met some of the 32 remaining survivors of thalidomide in this part of the island.  The Irish Thalidomide Association waited a year for this meeting but survivors were seriously irritated by the deal on offer.  A number of issues of significant concern were not addressed and the request to disclose documents from 1950 onwards was refused.  A disclosure would allow the full story of this drug to be told for the first time.  Certain legal issues were raised by the association and the Minister promised to respond within 24 hours.  Ten weeks later, however, she has not yet replied.  These people, about whom I have spoken on numerous occasions in this House, cannot afford to invest all their physical energy into their campaign for justice.  They are exhausted and in pain from the overuse of their disabled limbs.  They take pain killers morning, noon and night.</P>
        <P>I urge the Leader to speak to the Minister about addressing this urgent issue for the sake of the survivors.  I am putting my reputation on the line and I will continue to press their case until due compensation is paid to this group of people.  The State failed them miserably.  In his autobiography, Dr. O&rsquo;Connell wrote that he was able to purchase the thalidomide drug without a prescription three years after it had been withdrawn.  This scandal is being kept below the political radar.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley may be correct in regard to salaries but that does not give the Government the right to cut respite care to those who need it most.  Respite care is not a luxury; it is a necessity and it is a bad sign for our society if we make cuts to the most vulnerable and the voiceless.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, to debate this issue in the House today.  There is a wonderful term in the Irish language for people with a disability &mdash; duine le Dia.  As stated in the Proclamation, we must cherish all our children equally, but, unfortunately, the Government is not doing so.  Instead, it is forcing parents to take to the streets of the capital city, not to protest but to stand up for their rights and protect their loved ones.  I ask the Leader to implore the Minister of State to ensure services provided for those most in need are not cut.  </P>
        <P>I am disappointed the Leader has proposed that the motion on changes to the titles of Departments and committees be taken without debate.  These changes will give rise to substantial costs to the State in terms of personnel and revenue.  Why is it considered necessary to change the titles of Departments and Ministers?  The reason it is unnecessary is that the message will remain the same because the Government does not have a jobs policy or vision and people do not have hope.  The most appropriate course of action would be to change the personnel running the Government, as I hope the electorate will do in due course.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to change the manner in which the civil partnership Bill is to be taken, as ordered in a notification circulated to Senators last week.  May I assume from the Leader&rsquo;s comments that the Minister will reply to the debate on Second Stage at 4.50 p.m., that the debate will conclude at 5 p.m. and that proceedings on Second Stage will not resume after Private Members&rsquo; time?  If that is the case, why is the Leader going back on his word by imposing a guillotine motion?  The civil partnership Bill is the most important legislation to be discussed in the House for many a day, yet the Leader is curtailing Members&rsquo; speaking rights.  I ask him to provide for a resumption of the Second Stage debate after Private Members&rsquo; time.  If necessary, the House should sit on Friday or an additional day next week.  The Leader must not curtail debate on the most important social legislation before the House.</P>

        <P>The future outlook for the economy depends to a large extent on education.  I will give Senators homework to do during the summer because I doubt the House will have a debate on education before the summer ends.  I have spoken to a number of people from other parts of the world who are astonished that Ireland&rsquo;s second level schools take holidays for three months every summer.  They do not consider this realistic.  The Japanese, for example, inform me their schools take holidays for 16 days per annum.  While I do not suggest Ireland reduce the number of days to 16, we cannot continue to take three months off in the summer.  There must be a logical middle figure.  I am sure teachers and pupils would not be pleased if the current arrangements were changed but parents would be delighted if the summer holidays were reduced.  I gather the reason for taking three months off in the summer dates back to a time generations ago when teenage children were needed to work on farms.  This no longer applies.  Let us ensure we give thought to this issue during the summer and debate it following the recess.  Such a debate must focus on how we can get the best from the education system for teenage children at second level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to come before the House to update Senators on the position on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill which remains a long way from completion.  Although not by any means the complete item, the legislation addresses in a useful manner a number of issues relating to asylum applications and seeks to streamline the asylum appeals process to ensure asylum seekers will not be required to wait five, six or seven years for adjudication of their appeals.  While the initial response to asylum applications is usually provided within a reasonable period, the appeals process lasts forever and a day.  The various bases for appeal must be addressed in a single adjudication.  This would bring an end to the current position where appellants must wait for many years to have their cases adjudicated.</P>
        <P>This issue has acquired particular importance.  My local radio station has been doing the community a service in recent days by bringing to public attention the plight of many asylum seekers who have been in this country for many years and built reasonably stable lives for themselves.  The significant cost of the direct provision service is causing a great deal of anger and hostility among members of the general public.  In straitened times, with money tight, people are, perhaps unwittingly, straying into using language and voicing opinions which have the potential to turn nasty and become racist in character.  One hears expressions of concern and fear, but we need to nip the problem in the bud and bring to an end a worrying public <Col N="127"/>dialogue.  This could be achieved by placing on the Statute Book legislation to establish a proper appeals process for asylum seekers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The courageous and forthright contribution made by Senator O&rsquo;Malley underscores the importance of her accepting the amendment tabled by Senator Fitzgerald which proposes that the House debate today cutbacks to disability services.  If the cost of administration is a problem, the issue must be resolved as part of the debate.  It does not provide adequate justification or an excuse for denying basic services to people with a disability.  On the contrary, it challenges the Government to prune the tree and bring sense to public expenditure.  We are not cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  It is not right to remove front-line and respite care services from people with intellectual disabilities or that in many areas, including my constituency, there are explicit and implicit threats to day care services for geriatrics.  The Fine Gael Party courageously produces an alternative budget every year.  While it accepts the need to reduce public expenditure and the broad parameters for doing so, it does not accept that this reduction should be made at the expense of the weak and vulnerable.  A full debate is required to identify areas in which we can reduce public expenditure and increase revenue to the State.  Such a debate must establish priorities and draw a line in the sand by stating services for people with an intellectual disability, old people in day care centres and so forth are immovable and sacrosanct.  They are part of our republican philosophy that we cherish all the children of the nation equally and of a social and Christian society.  I ask the Leader to give a commitment that he will hold such a debate on the process and priorities of budgeting.</P>

	<P>It is important to start celebrating economic events.  We should recognise that the ESB has acquired Northern Ireland Electricity which will create synergies and opportunities, North and South.  It is important to discuss these flagship enterprises, take an interest in them and seek to ensure they develop to their full potential, especially in the light of the opportunities available in the green energy sector.  Ireland is the Saudi Arabia of the green energy sector because we can exploit wave, tidal and wind energy.  We are ideally placed to take advantage of green energy with an interconnector that connects us to the rest of Europe.</P>
        <P>There have been discussions of cutbacks in the area of disability.  Unfortunately cutbacks are part of what we need to do.  When cutting back we would always try to ensure no individuals are disadvantaged.  We need to recognise we are in tough fiscal times.  With that in mind, I ask the Leader for a schedule of the costs to the State of implementing the civil partnership Bill.</P>

This is one of these landmark discussions like the discussion about Articles 2 and 3, which arouse deep crises of conscience for people.  Had everybody in our history behaved as per his or her conscience there would have been no peace process.  Many people put their consciences in their pockets and acted in terms of representing republican democracy in dealing with the peace process.

There are people on the other side who oppose it &mdash; perhaps doing so in good conscience &mdash; and those of us who support it also do so in good conscience.  We need to understand that tolerance does not mean permitting things; it means permitting things of which we disapprove, as many of us had to do on Articles 2 and 3.  Those who talk about sensitivity and conscience <Col N="128"/>should remember that the founder of Christianity was absolutely broad and tolerant in his handling of sexual peccadilloes, mistakes and infringements, and was absolutely unflinching in his opposition to money lenders and bankers.</P>

	<P>On the note of bankers, last night on the Second Stage debate on the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, indicated he would be laying down the orders of reference for the new banking investigation before the summer recess.  He indicated he would do so in this House.  Given that the D&aacute;il will no longer sit after this week, I ask the Leader if he is aware of the Minister&rsquo;s intent in this regard.  Can the Leader guarantee us that if these orders of reference are laid down next week, a debate will be allowed in the House on them as the other House will not be sitting?</P>
        <P>A week ago I attended a large public meeting in my constituency on respite care services.  In many years of attending such meetings, this was by some way the most upsetting and disturbing event I have ever attended.  If the point Senator O&rsquo;Malley made is true &mdash; I assume it is &mdash; it is well made.  It again shows there are insiders and outsiders in our country.  For too long when decisions are made, the people who suffer first and most are the outsiders.  The investigation into the issue should take place first with the decision taking place afterwards and not the other way around.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that people opposing the civil partnership Bill do so in good conscience.  I appeal to people to consider the language they use in the debate we are about to have.  I look forward to hearing what Senator Mullen has to say later today.  He has said we are closer to Zimbabwe than to Holland.  We are not.  There is a deep respect in our country for individual rights, for families and for family units.  I emphasise a point and respectfully inform my Independent colleagues that it is not up to people who decide not to join a political party to tell those of us who do how to organise our business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree wholeheartedly with the thoughtful contributions of Senators Harris and Donohoe.  The civil partnership Bill will grant people basic rights.  It is not about attacking institutions or taking from those who already have.  It recognises that in the third millennium in present day society there are people who are being treated unfairly and unequally.  The Bill will rectify that wrong.  That is all it is, in deference to views on the other side of the argument.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The revised NAMA business plan, coming nine months after the first one was published, shows that in all likelihood it will not generate a &euro;4.8 billion profit and in the worst case scenario will suffer &euro;800 million of a loss.  Something is inherently wrong here.  I have asked on several occasions for the Leader to invite in the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance, the most senior of whom who is available, to describe what they were engaging in nine months ago.  Was it a complete fantasy?  Unemployment is reaching all-time highs, and small and medium-sized enterprises are going to the wall.  Banks are not lending and are throwing people out on the side of the street.  We now have a return to landlordism that was much worse than was experienced under British rule because it is being done by Irish people to Irish families.  No mercy is being shown to those people by the banking fraternity, yet nine months ago a NAMA business plan was devised on the back of an envelope.  The revised plan shows the harsh reality of those figures.  It is a very bad deal for the taxpayer with considerable pain and no gain.  It is an absolute disgrace.  I ask the Leader to organise for the Taoiseach or Minister for Finance to explain to the House the fantasy that was the first NAMA business plan.</P>

	<P>I support it.  I have no hesitation in saying I will be voting in favour of the civil partnership Bill and have no problems with it.  However, like Senators Quinn and Mullen I cannot understand why there should be a whip on this Bill.  Particularly in this House it is important that we show respect for people on the other side of the argument and recognise the very strong feelings in all parties.  In addition we should recognise that it will not threaten the Government if the Bill is defeated.  It is simply a matter of giving a free vote to people on issues of very strong importance to them.  I do not restrict this to the civil partnership Bill.  We should have far more free votes in this House.  The reality is that even if we defeat a Bill it will merely have a delaying effect.  However, it would give rise to a more genuine debate if people were allowed not only to vote as they wish, but also to speak as they wish.  The result of people being forced into the lobbies to vote one way or the other on the issue means it is very difficult for them to speak one way and talk the other because they are hypocrites.  I know perfectly well that today people will speak on one side &mdash; possibly not believing it &mdash; because they are under pressure to do that.  To relieve that pressure all parties should allow their Members to speak their mind, vote accordingly and let democracy take its course.  The Government is not threatened by this at all.  It would be healthy and would show respect for this House, which is a less political House, if we allowed the proposal made by Senators Quinn and Mullen and me to go through.</P>

The stones will be large enough to cause severe injury, but not so big that she will be killed outright.  It can take up to 30 minutes before she is dead or unconscious.  Not only that, but the hypocrisy of this regime means that it has a different judicial process for men and women and it is weighed against women.  People sentenced to death by stoning are spared if they can drag themselves out of the earth, but while men are buried up to their waste, women are buried up to their chest.</P>

I support calls from all sides of the House in respect of the difficulties being experienced.  The Minister is only too pleased to come to the House to clarify the up-to-date position on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, MacSharry, Coghlan, Donohoe and Hanafin spoke about NAMA.  The Minister for Finance was in the House last night and referred to this during the debate on the Bill to reform the Central Bank.  That was a terrific debate and a learning exercise.  We are grateful to the Minister for providing us with an update on what is going on.  His interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today was very encouraging and very enlightening.  I am strongly of the opinion that to get out of this downturn in the economy in Ireland, the Government and the public sector will not make it happen, but the private sector will make it happen when it has the tools of its wares, by which I mean funding from the banks.  I am pleased with the Minister&rsquo;s announcement this morning that he would bring forward an initiative next week on funding for SMEs by our two major banks, which the Government has called for in respect of the &euro;6 billion investment that they have to make over two years.</P><Col N="132"/>
        <P>The Minister assured the people this morning about the NAMA figures that were released nine months ago in comparison with those released yesterday.  In the worst case scenario where there was an &euro;800 million shortfall, he said he would levy the banks and it would not cost the taxpayer one cent.  That was an assurance that every taxpayer wanted to hear.  The confidence the people have in our Minister for Finance is our big hope for the future.  I look forward to very many more visits of the Minister to the House to listen to the proposals and suggestions made by him and by my colleagues in the House.  It was an enlightening time to be in the House last night during the debate on the Central Bank Reform Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Buttimer, Hanafin, Harris, Donohoe and McCarthy all expressed concerns about No. 1 on the Order Paper, which is to be taken without debate.  If colleagues wish to have a debate on it, I can certainly provide for one after the summer recess.  Most of this has come about because of the reduction in the number of Ministers of State from 20 to 15.  Certain portfolios had to be rejoined and put back together again, which has led to a massive net saving to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White spoke about the legal environment surrounding married parents, adoption rights and the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s strong views to the Minister.  I have no difficulty inviting the Minister back to the House.  He was in the House this week when we debated this issue and he updated it on his portfolio.</P>
        <P>I join Senators Keaveney and Hanafin in congratulating the ESB on this historic occasion.  I congratulate Padraig McManus, the chief executive officer, and all the ESB directors on their purchase of the Northern Ireland grid.  It makes good commercial sense.  The ESB is a flagship of success and the contribution it is making throughout the world is a shining example of what a good Irish company can achieve.  I wholeheartedly congratulate it on its initiative in this area.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney referred to North-South Ministerial Council meetings.  I intend to invite the Taoiseach to the House to update us from time to time on the progress of these meetings.  I will try to arrange for him to come to the House at the earliest possible time.  It is a good idea that we review the situation, as Senator Keaveney said, and are able to make proposals.  Senators living adjacent to the Six Counties could have an input into these meetings.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry and Leyden referred to mortgages.  I agree with Senator Leyden that a two-year timeframe is a must.  One year is nowhere near what is required.  In fact, a two or three-year timeframe is required.  Until people go back to work and get a good track record, we should fully support them in dealing with the difficulties 90% of them are experiencing for the first time in their lives.  I fully agree with what was said.  I congratulate Senator MacSharry on his report.  Senator Butler has also made a tremendous contribution in this area, as have many colleagues on the Opposition side of the House.  Good proposals have been taken from Seanad &Eacute;ireann and included in the report.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen, Norris, Quinn, Harris, Hanafin, McCarthy, Ross and Bacik all expressed their views regarding a free vote in the House.  We can all read about 1936 when the House was full of Independent Members.  The Taoiseach of the day had to dissolve the House because agreement could not be reached and legislation could not be processed.  That is why the party system must be in place.  The Government is elected by the people to govern and bring forward and amend legislation.  That is what we are doing today.  Everyone supports human rights and that is what we are doing today in a very meaningful way.</P>
        <P>We all have our strong Christian beliefs.  We all firmly believe there is a much better place than here to go to.</P>

         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Norris referred to motion No. 14.  I will leave time aside for this and will inform the House tomorrow when it will be taken.  Senator Mary White expressed strong support for the 32 men and women of Thalidomide Ireland.  The chairperson of the association is in the House.  The Minister fully supports trying to get a resolution to this very difficult issue.  A person&rsquo;s life is affected and it must be the most difficult challenge one could face or hand of cards one could be dealt.  We fully support the good work being done by Senator Mary White and the association.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s strong views to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on education and the three months&rsquo; holiday.  This is a common-sense proposal and another great initiative from Senator Quinn.  It shows how a person with a track record of success in the business world can change things for the better.  I read dispatches in the Sunday newspapers, which I hope are true, that someone like him might lead the capital city of our country.  We would dearly love to see that happen and wish him luck in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Dearey referred to the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which has been published.  I will come back to the House tomorrow with an update on its passage.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney outlined an horrific matter.  It is something one would expect to read about hundreds of years ago.  I have no difficulty arranging for an all-party motion to be sent from this House.  I thank him for bringing the matter to our attention.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke referred to funding for local authorities.  This is one of the important debates we will have after the summer recess.  I acknowledge the &euro;100 million local authorities have received in recent days from the second home levy which has been such an outstanding success in getting funds for local authorities.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on credit unions.  We had a terrific debate last night on the Central Bank Reform Bill.  The good work the credit unions are doing must be acknowledged.  Currently, credit unions are supplying finance to the SMEs and the motor industry and are keeping this country going financially.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 113, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping in the House.  A Senator may contribute once on each grouping and I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The purpose of amendment No. 39 is to clarify the application of the power under section 13(2) regarding searches of persons where that power is used by a customs officer.  The purpose of amendment No. 40 is to deal with cases where a psychoactive substance is being imported or exported by post or a courier service.  In such a case the powers under sections 12 and 13 cannot apply because the person in question would not be present in the mail centre or other place where the customs officer comes across a package suspected of containing such a substance.  The proposed new section fills this gap by giving customs officers the power to open packages or containers suspected of containing psychoactive substances.  The other amendments are technical.</P>

    <Title>Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009 is among the most progressive legislation to come to this House in its long history.  It enjoys the support of all parties &mdash; although there are individuals who have issues in respect of it &mdash; which is significant in that it shows that the measures it contains have the broad support of the people.  The level of support for the Bill also shows that securing the civil rights of gay people is a mainstream goal and that the ignorance and homophobia which gay people and their families &mdash; fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters &mdash; lived with in the past has no place in modern Ireland.  I am deeply proud of this legislation.  Members of the Houses and those of all political parties can also be proud of it.  The Bill bears the support and the input of all.  I hope it will be claimed by all.</P>
        <P>From the perspective of my party, our 2007 election manifesto contained a clear commitment to the effect that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Based on our republican ethos and building on the agenda for equality to which we are committed, we will address the need to provide a legal framework that supports the rights of same sex couples, including by extending State recognition of civil partnership between such persons so that they can live in a supportive and secure legal environment.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">There is a perception that the Bill belongs to one party, which is not correct.  I am of the view that it belongs to all parties.  As stated, my party made a commitment in respect of this matter prior to the most recent general election.  The Green Party also made such a commitment.  I am not sure whether the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Sinn F&eacute;in did so.</P><Col N="139"/>
        <P>During the negotiations on An Agreed Programme for Government in 2007, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats made a commitment to legislate for civil partnerships at the earliest possible date in the lifetime of this Administration.  In government, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has a long record in bringing forward legislation which has afforded protection to the gay community.  I refer here to the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial Religious or National Hatred Act in 1989, legislation to decriminalise the male homosexual act in 1993 and the various equality acts dealing with employment and equal status which were passed in 1998, 2000 and 2004.  All of the equal status legislation enacted since the foundation of the State, especially in the period since 1997, has been passed by Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments.</P>
        <P>We have, in advance of many other states, put in place an effective equality infrastructure to ensure people can have redress if they are unfairly discriminated against, whether in employment, or in the provision of goods and services.  We have made it clear in our legislation that discrimination against individuals on the grounds of their sexual orientation will be neither condoned nor tolerated.  Equality continues to be incorporated in the mainstream of policy making and the planning of service provision at both national and local level, in both the public and the private sectors.  In conjunction with these many initiatives, which deal largely with individual rights, the Government is fully committed to addressing the relationship rights of gay and lesbian couples.</P>
        <P>We all deserve equal treatment before the law and as we go about our daily lives.  The Government is committed to playing a full part in ensuring gays and lesbians can participate fully in society without exclusion or discrimination.  This Bill, by providing an important supportive legal framework for gay and lesbian couples, demonstrates our commitment to full equality.  The Bill creates for the first time in Irish law a scheme under which gay couples can formally and publicly declare their allegiance to one another, register their partnerships and commit themselves to a range of duties and responsibilities.  At the same time, they will be subject under new law to a series of protections in the course of their partnerships in the event of a failure of either party to maintain the other and in the event of disputes between them as to ownership of property.  They will have additional protections in their homes, and new rights to succeed to the property of one another are also being established.</P>
        <P>In the event of a dissolution of a partnership, there will also be considerable protections in place for a dependent partner, where necessary, by way of power to the court to order maintenance, to order financial relief by way of lump sum payment, to redistribute the ownership of property between them and to provide for transfer of rights between them under any pension scheme of which either is a member.  Where a person dies after dissolution of a civil partnership, the court may order provision from the estate of the deceased for his or her surviving former partner.  These are very specific measures that are being provided in law for the first time.  Until a few short years ago, such measures did not exist in any jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The Bill breaks new ground.  For the first time, the State will, in its laws, recognise and support the relationships of gay and lesbian couples who enter civil partnerships.  Our laws will explicitly validate and protect the relationships of thousands of couples whose mutual commitment has until now been invisible in the eyes of the State.  In conjunction with dealing with many vital and pressing legal difficulties experienced by gay and lesbian couples, the Bill will also try to address practical everyday matters.  It will ensure they will always be entitled to visit if their partner is hospitalised, that they can be treated as next of kin and that they will be in a position to notify the death of a partner and arrange his or her funeral.</P>
        <P>Gay and lesbian couples routinely face problems most of us are never obliged to contemplate.  These can range from an inability to access State benefits, such as carer&rsquo;s allowance when caring for seriously ill partners, to a man&rsquo;s additional grief that his partner is recorded on his <Col N="140"/>death certificate as being single, constituting an official denial of their lives together.  These are the real experiences of gay Irish couples and other couples will be exposed to them if we do not reform the law.  Enactment of the Bill will mean that the relationships of gay couples will no longer be ignored.  They will have the protection and recognition of the State in its laws.</P>
        <P>Senators will know that this Bill had to be carefully prepared and that the provisions of the Constitution had to be borne in mind during its drafting.  Were the Bill to go beyond what is allowed under the Constitution, it would fundamentally undermine the balance that it attempts to achieve.  In this complex exercise of trying to achieve balance, I am grateful to the Attorney General and his staff for their efforts in respect of the Bill and for the advice they provided.</P>
        <P>To comply with the constitutional imperative to protect the family, it is necessary to differentiate the recognition being accorded to same-sex couples who register their partnerships with the special recognition that is accorded under the Constitution to persons of the opposite sex who marry.  While there is a need to respect the entitlement to equality that same-sex partners enjoy under Article 40.1 of the Constitution, there is also a need to respect the special protection which Article 41 gives to marriage.  The Bill has been carefully framed to balance any potential conflict between these two rights.</P>
        <P>In formulating the civil registration scheme for same-sex partners the Government was mindful of the implications for children.  On the advice of the Attorney General, it concluded that it was not appropriate that the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill should develop principles on children that would have much wider implications than those on same-sex partners.  Apart from constitutional difficulties, issues which arise with regard to children and their welfare are so significant that it would not be appropriate to address them on a piecemeal basis without a thorough review of all of the implications such changes might have for children and also for those who might be affected by such changes.</P>
        <P>Given the complexity of legal relationships between children and their parents, a comprehensive review of the law in this area is under way by the Law Reform Commission.  It will in due course help to inform policy decisions on rights in general with regard to children of non-married parents and others.  The commission published a consultation paper on the legal aspects of family relationships in September 2009 and has invited submissions from interested parties on its provisional recommendations which were published some time back.  Its final report and recommendations are expected later this year.  However, the consultation paper did not make specific recommendations on the position of same-sex couples or civil partners.  It is not intended that the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill should deal with what is obviously a very complex issue, one with which other jurisdictions have had difficulties, with or without the constitutional constraints that clearly apply in this respect in our jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Alongside civil partnership, the second essential component of the Bill, the cohabitants provisions, gives recognition to the fact that the legal system needs to offer protection to vulnerable persons in long-term same-sex or opposite-sex relationships when that relationship ends.  Many cohabiting couples do not realise that they have few responsibilities to each other under existing law and that they have little protection when things go wrong, whether on the break-up of a long relationship or the sudden and unexpected death of a partner.  Many couples are under the misapprehension that the longevity of a relationship is sufficient to provide them with certain rights and protections in all sorts of areas, from common ownership of property to next of kin or inheritance rights.  However, there is no entitlement under existing law to financial support and property rights do not accrue to a cohabiting partner, unless he or she is making express financial contributions.</P><Col N="141"/>
        <P>The cohabitants redress scheme provided for in the Bill is largely as recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  It will provide protection in law for long-term cohabiting couples by establishing a safety net for a financially dependent cohabitant at the end of the relationship.  On break-up, a financially dependent cohabitant may apply to the court for maintenance from the other cohabitant, or possibly for a pension adjustment order or a property adjustment order.  If the relationship ends on death, a dependent cohabitant may apply to the court for provision from the estate of the deceased if, as often happens, no provision is made for the surviving cohabitant.  The courts will have substantial discretion in considering such applications.</P>
        <P>The Bill recognises the right of couples to freely choose the legal form their personal relationships should take and the legal consequences of this choice.  Some couples may prefer to opt-out of the redress scheme and the Bill makes provision for this.  At the same time, it is important to find a balance between interfering in personal autonomy and protecting vulnerable persons.  The Bill strikes that balance by providing that the courts, in exceptional circumstances, can vary or set aside a cohabitants&rsquo; agreement where its enforcement would cause serious injustice.</P>
        <P>I will turn now to the details of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The largest part of the Bill deals with the civil relationship of gay couples.  Part 2 confers power on the courts to make declarations on the status of a civil partnership where the status may be in doubt.  It also empowers the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to prescribe certain categories of relationship contracted in other jurisdictions as entitled to be treated as equivalent to civil partnership under Irish law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 3 makes extensive amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004 to provide for the registration of civil partnerships.  Section 16 inserts a new part in the Civil Registration Act 2004 dealing with the detailed arrangements for civil partnership registration, including notice requirements, information requirements, declarations to be made, venues and effect of civil partnership.  Three months&rsquo; notice of an intended registration is required unless, for example, one of the parties is very ill, in which case an exemption may be provided.  Registration will take place at the office of a registrar or another venue approved by the HSE and a registration ceremony may be conducted if the couple so choose.  The minimum age requirement is 18 years.  Section 16 was amended in the D&aacute;il to specify that civil partners must make the required declarations orally.  This is to ensure the registrar is satisfied that the parties understand the nature of the commitment they are making.</P>
        <P>Part 4 provides protection for the shared home of registered civil partners.  It is analogous to the Family Home Protection Act 1976 and prevents the sale of the shared home by one civil partner without the consent of the other.  Part 4 was amended in the D&aacute;il to allow civil partners to establish a joint tenancy in a home owned by one or both of them, other than under a joint tenancy, without being liable for the court fees or registration fees which apply to such changes.  The next finance Bill will provide that such a transfer is exempt from stamp duty on the transaction.</P>
        <P>Part 5 allows a civil partner to apply to the court for maintenance from the other partner during the course of the relationship where the other civil partner has failed to maintain the applicant civil partner.  Part 5 was amended in the D&aacute;il to allow the court make a secured periodical payments order or a lump sum order to ensure the maintenance is paid.  Part 6 allows the court to make an attachment of earnings order if it considers it desirable to secure payment under a maintenance order, an interim order, a variation order or a maintenance pending suit order.</P>
        <P>Part 7 makes a number of provisions related to Parts 5 and 6, including specifying that payments under maintenance orders are made without deduction of income tax; makes such <Col N="142"/>orders enforceable; provides that certain property is joint property; and makes unenforceable any provision in agreements which precludes the payment of maintenance by either civil partner to the other.</P>
        <P>Part 8 provides for succession.  On testacy, civil partners will have the same entitlements as spouses to a legal right share under the innovative Succession Act 1965.  Therefore, where there is a will, the entitlement is to one half of the estate if the deceased has a civil partner and no children, and to one third of the estate if the deceased has a civil partner and children.  A child of the deceased may apply, as may a child of a heterosexual couple, under section 117 of the Succession Act 1965 for provision from the estate if the deceased has failed to make proper provision during his or her lifetime.  Unlike the existing provision in law for spouses, an order made in favour of a child may reduce the share of the estate available for a civil partner.</P>
        <P>Where there is no will &mdash; in an intestacy &mdash; the rules of distribution will operate in the same way for civil partners as they do for spouses.  If the deceased dies leaving a civil partner and no children, the civil partner inherits the entire estate; if the deceased dies leaving a civil partner and children, the civil partner inherits two thirds of the estate and the remainder is divided between the children.  These rules are modified to provide greater rights for a child of an intestate civil partner.  Where a civil partner dies intestate, a child of that civil partner may apply to the court for a greater share of the estate.  If satisfied that it would be unjust not to make such an order, the court may order that a share be provided for that child not exceeding the share to which the child would be entitled if the parent had died with no spouse and no civil partner.  Such an order may not reduce the amount to which any other issue of the deceased is entitled and the net effect would be to reduce the share of the surviving civil partner.</P>
        <P>Part 9 extends to civil partners the same protections spouses enjoy under the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  Part 10 provides for a wide range of miscellaneous but nevertheless important legal consequences of registration, including in ethics and conflicts of interest.  A civil partner will be treated as a &ldquo;connected person&rdquo; or &ldquo;connected relative&rdquo; in determining matters concerning ethics and conflicts of interest.  A declaration of interest required in regard to a spouse must likewise be made in regard to a civil partner.</P>
        <P>In regard to civil liability, a civil partner is added to the list of dependants, in respect of whom a person may sue for damages for wrongful death.  A pension scheme which provides a benefit for a spouse is deemed equally to provide a benefit for a civil partner.</P>
        <P>In regard to protection from discrimination, the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2007 and the Equal Status Act 2000 prohibit discrimination against a person on the grounds that the person is single, married, separated, divorced or widowed.  The same prohibition against discrimination under the Acts will apply in favour of those who are in a registered civil partnership, or in a civil partnership which has been dissolved.</P>
        <P>Part 11 provides for decrees of nullity of civil partnership and the effect of a decree of nullity.  The grounds for nullity are that there was an impediment to the civil partnership at the time of its registration such as one or both of the parties being under age at the time of registration, or one or both of the parties not having given informed consent.</P>
        <P>Part 12 makes provision for the dissolution of civil partnerships and the effect of a decree of dissolution.  To obtain a decree of dissolution, the partners must have lived apart for a period of at least two years in the previous three years and the court must be satisfied that proper provision is made for both partners.  Jurisdiction in the dissolution of a civil partnership will lie with the Circuit Court and the High Court and the courts will have powers to make extensive ancillary financial relief, property and pension orders.</P><Col N="143"/>
        <P>Part 13 provides for matters of jurisdiction in civil partnership proceedings, including that cases will be heard <i>in camera;</i> proceedings will be as informal as possible; the Circuit Court and the High Court have concurrent jurisdiction to hear civil partnership dissolution proceedings and make ancillary relief orders; and the District Court has jurisdiction in domestic violence cases and in certain property disputes and maintenance matters.  These provisions are similar to those which apply in jurisdiction in family law proceedings.</P>
        <P>Part 14 provides for consequential amendments to other enactments, including the Family Law Act 1995 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  These amendments ensure that if a former spouse registers in a civil partnership, any ancillary relief orders provided for that former spouse under the Acts lapse on registration.  This mirrors the position in current family law, whereby many of the ancillary relief orders available under the Acts lapse on the remarriage of the spouse for whose benefit the orders were made.  Other enactments are amended by means of the Schedule to the Bill to confer certain property rights, rights of redress and other miscellaneous rights and responsibilities on civil partners as a consequence of registration.</P>
        <P>Part 15 establishes the qualified cohabitants redress scheme for unregistered or unmarried cohabiting couples.  It implements the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on the rights and duties of cohabitants.  As I explained, the redress scheme will provide protection for an economically dependent party at the end of a long-term same-sex or opposite-sex relationship.  There is much confusion in this regard, some of which is caused unnecessarily.  The redress scheme provides a protective mechanism for a financially dependent partner where the couple have not formally regulated their relationship.  It is available only to cohabitants defined as &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; in the Bill and may be activated on termination of the relationship, whether by break-up or death.</P>
        <P>Section 170 provides that a qualified cohabitant is one of a couple who have cohabited in an intimate and committed relationship for at least five years, or two years where there is a child of the relationship.  However, where one of the cohabitants is still married, neither of the cohabitants may be a qualified cohabitant until the married cohabitant has lived apart from his or her spouse for a period or periods of at least four years during the previous five years, the separation period provided in the Constitution for divorce.  The reliefs available on termination of the relationship on application to the courts are at the court&rsquo;s discretion and include compensatory maintenance and pension adjustment orders, property adjustment orders and provision from the estate of a deceased cohabitant.</P>
        <P>Part 15 also establishes that an agreement between cohabitants regulating their joint financial and property affairs can be enforceable, subject to the observation of certain formalities.  The court may set aside a provision in any agreement only in exceptional circumstances where its enforceability would cause serious injustice.  In addition, Part 15 extends certain statutory protections to cohabiting, unmarried, opposite-sex and unregistered same-sex couples.  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the Civil Liability Act 1961 are amended in order that provisions in these Acts which currently apply only to couples defined as &ldquo;living together as husband and wife&rdquo; will also apply to same-sex couples.  There has been much confusion in this regard.  This provision does not confer any statutory legal rights similar to the legal rights laid down in the Succession Act.  It is a right to go to court to prove financial dependency.  Ultimately, it is up to the court to decide whether orders are to be made in that respect.</P>
        <P>Part 16 specifies that in making orders under the Bill the courts must have regard to the rights of others, particularly to a spouse or former spouse, or a civil partner or former civil partner.</P>
        <P>On registration of a civil partnership, same-sex civil partners will be treated in the same way as spouses under the tax and social welfare codes.  The necessary legislative provisions are being prepared for inclusion in the next finance and social welfare Bills that will, on enactment, come <Col N="144"/>into effect at the same time as the commencement of the registration provisions in this Bill.  There is no question of the same tax and social welfare provisions being extended to cohabitants, be they same-sex or opposite-sex couples.</P>
        <P>As the law stands, gay couples are prevented from formalising their relationships in the eyes of the law and society at large.  Their relationships are legally unrecognised and unprotected.  This is addressed by the Bill as comprehensively as possible, consistent with the requirements of the Constitution.  The Bill recognises that there are persons in committed gay relationships who wish to share duties and responsibilities.  They are afforded the choice to register their partnership and become part of a legal regime that fully protects them in the course of that partnership and, if necessary, on its termination.  The redress scheme, too, is a measured response in law to a growing need for protection of vulnerable cohabitants, people who are living together but not married.</P>
        <P>I look forward to Members&rsquo; support for the Bill, the detail of which is complex and technical, but the object of which is to ensure our law is humane, tolerant and protective.  The Bill was the subject of considerable and detailed discussion in the D&aacute;il.  As I said, I always look forward to the discussion of Bills in the Seanad.  I can understand the views expressed on both sides of the House in this respect, but, as the Legislature, we are obliged under the Constitution, whether we like it, to frame legislation within the parameters laid down in the Constitution.  There are two significant articles in the Constitution, one of which states every citizen is equal in the eyes of the law; the other which has been confirmed many times by the Supreme Court relates to the special protection afforded to marriage.  The Bill has been framed to strike a balance between these two articles.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that there are those who believe the Bill does not go far enough and those who believe it goes too far.  I represent a political party which made a very significant promise in its election manifesto.  Sometimes politicians are accused of not keeping promises.  This promise was made by my party and completely endorsed by the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party as it entered government with the Green Party.  It was included in the agreed programme for Government and unanimously endorsed by the parliamentary party and again about a year ago when there was a review of the programme when I was one of the negotiators.  Another commitment was made to pass the legislation as quickly as possible, a commitment we are fulfilling.  The outcome of the review was also unanimously endorsed by the parliamentary party.</P>
        <P>I have heard arguments from some people that I would not engage in discussing this legislation outside the House.  We are often criticised for ignoring the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is the place to have the discussion.  If people want to have discussions on radio programmes, that is fair enough, but this is the primary place where we should have our discussions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">We are here to examine this legislation.  The Government has spent a considerable amount of time on it and my Department and my officials have spent a considerable amount of time adapting the balance that is required in it.  It is similar to some other legislation I have had to bring in where there has been a complete misunderstanding and, in some instances, a complete purposeful misunderstanding about the parameters within which legislators have to operate.  The Government cannot pass legislation that it is advised, by the legal adviser to the Government, does not fulfil the commitments in the Constitution.  If anyone <Col N="145"/>wants to change the Constitution, that is another matter, but there has been no suggestion, politically, that we should change the Constitution in this regard.  Perhaps in a year or two, or whenever, there may well be a proposal for a referendum, but we will cross that bridge when we come to it.  We have to deal with the here and now.  We have to deal with the reality in society in a tolerant and comprehensive way.  This is a fine Bill which acknowledges the reality in our society.  There will perhaps be people who contribute to the Bill who will be implacably opposed to the views and to the balance we have achieved in it, but I acknowledge the sincerity of everyone who will make that contribution.  While I accept there may be people who will say we can improve this Bill, we have taken detailed legal advice from the Attorney General on the arguments that have been made publicly and on the arguments that have been made, especially in the other House, on other issues that perhaps should be included in the Bill and that are not in it.  Time and again I have said the Government cannot propose a Bill which is advised to be unconstitutional.  For that reason, this Bill is framed in a way that is consistent with the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Some people have made the point that we should have dealt with the cohabitants issue separate from the civil partnership Bill.  This argument was made in the D&aacute;il.  I do not accept that.  Someone said it was unfortunate that these two issues are dealt with in the Bill, but I do not accept that.  If we have an opportunity to change the law, we should take it.  Time is precious enough in the Oireachtas and were we to have put things off to another day, we may not have been able to deal with the cohabitants issue.</P>
        <P>As someone who practised in a very busy family law practice before I was elected to the D&aacute;il, I was always very conscious of the fact that there were not necessarily same-sex couples who had difficulties in this respect &mdash; that was not an issue at the time &mdash; but that there were heterosexual couples who had not married, had decided not to marry and were setting up home, and that there was little or no provision in Irish law to protect such people who had long-term committed relationships.  It is for that reason I personally was very happy that I was able to initiate this Bill which deals with same-sex couples and the issues related to civil partnership but also responds to a significant dearth in our legal framework, that is, the protection of heterosexual couples who have not married and who have set up relationships, whether with or without children.  I make no apologies for dealing with these two issues together in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Many misconceptions have been sown in regard to what is provided for in this legislation.  It gives a right of access to court in order that the court can decide on these issues where there is a financially dependent spouse in the event of a break-up or a death.  I look forward to the debate and, as I said, the debate in this House is always excellent.  It is necessary, given that a significant body of legislation is being prepared in the Department of Finance and in the Department of Social Protection, that we pass this Bill soon rather than later.  That is the reason I look forward to the forbearance of the Seanad to have this Bill passed before the House rises for the summer recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his presentation of this Bill.  I have two preliminary points.  The Minister mentioned that he welcomes the debate on the legislation in this House, but it is unfortunate that it is taking place at this time when the D&aacute;il will rise tomorrow and there will no opportunity for it to deal with any amendments that might be deemed to be warranted in the course of this debate.  The effect of that is that no amendments will be accepted by the Minister.  This has happened on other occasions as we approached the summer recess and the Seanad was debating legislation but the Minister in question had taken a decision that no amendments to the legislation would be accepted.</P>
        <P>My second point is that the Minister referred at the start of his presentation to the commitment of his party to this area in the last general election and he wondered about the position <Col N="146"/>of other parties.  The fact is there was a commitment to this area on the part of all political parties, with variations on the form of civil partnership or recognition for same-sex couples that would be given in legislation.  In fact, the Minister&rsquo;s party, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, is a late convert to this notion of civil partnership because it successfully blocked legislation in this area in the last D&aacute;il.  I point out to the Minister that in 2004 Fine Gael pointed a way in this regard in terms of civil partnership which did not require an amendment of the Constitution but nevertheless could have gone a long way to meeting the needs of gay and lesbian people in this country.  GLEN in 2004, in its summary of the chronology of key events in this area, welcomed the new policy proposal by Fine Gael for civil partnership for same-sex and opposite-sex couples as an important step forward.  It said that this was the first policy proposal from any political party in Ireland for legal recognition of same-sex couples.  It is important to put that in context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is useful also to look back at the policy paper on civil partnership which was drawn up by a former Senator, Sheila Terry.  It pointed out that: &ldquo;In its 2002 document, <i>Implementing Equality for Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals</i>, the Equality Authority said that lesbian and gay couples have no guarantee of fair treatment under the law because legally their relationships do not exist&rdquo;.  The document went on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1">This situation leaves thousands of couples unable to benefit from the extension of rights in relation to pensions, residency, property, taxation, next of kin, welfare and various other areas.  Unmarried heterosexual couples experience the same discrimination.  For our part, Fine Gael believes it is time to end this anomaly.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That paper was published in 2004.  Some of the reasons given as to why it was important to end this anomaly were: &ldquo;It is the right thing to do&rdquo; and &ldquo;It is fair and equitable&rdquo;.  The paper particularly pointed out:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is not an attack on the family or traditional marriage.  The rights of married couples are not lessened in any way.  Marriage will continue to provide rights regarding children that Civil Partnership does not provide.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The paper concluded by stating: &ldquo;Our proposals do not involve a redefinition of the term marriage as expressed in the Constitution, and are completely secular&rdquo;.  That is the ground-breaking policy that was adopted in 2004 and it is on foot of that model the civil partnership Bill is based dealing with not only the issue of gay and lesbian couples but also with cohabitees in heterosexual relationships where they do not wish to choose marriage to formalise their relationship.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The change in attitudes of all political parties was one which reflected the changes in society. The polls which were conducted by GLEN and others clearly showed that in 2002 there were 76,000 unmarried cohabiting couples, that is, 8% of family units, while in 2006 the census showed this had increased to more than 120,000 or 12% of family units.  The research was conducted by Lansdowne Market Research.  The research also showed the attitude to gay and lesbian people changed dramatically over the years.  The parties have been slow to recognise the changes but that is what is happening today with the passing of this Bill.</P>
        
        <P>Lansdowne Market Research studied the attitude towards same sex marriage in 2006 and found 51% believed that same sex couples should be allowed to marry, 33% believed that should be allowed to form civil partnerships but not to marry and 10% believed there should be no legal recognition of same sex relationships.  In 2006 attitudes had already changed dramatically.  A further study in 2008 found that 61% of those questioned felt that denying <Col N="147"/>same sex marriage was a form of discrimination and 62% answered that they would vote Yes if a referendum to extend civil marriage rights to same sex couples was held tomorrow.  Some 70% felt that being raised in a loving home was more important than being raised by a mother and father.</P>
        <P>We are taking account of the changed attitudes in our society.  We are also recognising the extraordinary discrimination and victimisation which has taken place in the past towards gay and lesbian members of our society.  The Bill attempts to deal with that by establishing a status of relationship for same sex couples which is legally recognised by the State.  There will be a scheme of registration of civil partnerships for same sex couples together with a range of rights which are attached and which allow cohabitees to regulate their financial affairs.  The Bill provides for a limited redress scheme where a cohabitant is left economically dependent.  The presumptive scheme for cohabitants which has been followed in the other jurisdictions is also to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>My party will support the Bill because it is modelled on the very policy document we adopted in 2004.  It is a way of dealing with a complicated, divisive and constitutionally fraught issue.  The manner in which we propose to regulate it is a step in the right direction.  It is progress and means the Legislature takes its responsibilities in this area seriously.  In the past we have tended to leave it to the courts to resolve our problems and in this case the courts here and in Europe have clearly indicated they do not wish to interfere in this area or transgress on our constitutional provisions or those of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>In the Zappone case, the comments of Ms Justice Dunne in the High Court confirms the point that what is proposed here does not interfere with the constitutional protection for marriage.  She also accepted that in so far as the institution of marriage is described within the Constitution that what was always understood by the framers of the Constitution was the traditional understanding of marriage as exemplified in cases such as Hyde <i>v.</i> Hyde, namely, the voluntary union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.  She went on to find that it was difficult to see how the definition of marriage could, having regard to the ordinary and natural meaning of the words used, relate to a same sex couple.  She said she did not see how marriage could be redefined by the courts to encompass same sex marriage.  Marriage was understood under the 1937 Constitution to be confined to persons of the opposite sex and the plaintiff&rsquo;s case was refused on those grounds.</P>
        <P>Another interesting High Court case which was ruled on by Mr. Justice Hedigan in 2008 helps to point the way in this area.  The fact that non-marital families are not protected under the Constitution in the same way as marriage is does not mean they do not warrant protection.  The case concerned guardianship.  Mr. Justice Hedigan stated that it seemed to him that there existed between the parties such close personal ties as gave rise to family rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and he found that the relationship of B, C and D was that of a <i>de facto</i> family within the meaning of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  He said he could find nothing in Irish law to suggest the family, composed of two women and a child, had any lesser right to be recognised as a <i>de facto </i>family than a family composed of a man and a woman unmarried to each other and a child.  He said it seemed to him the State has a strong interest in the recognition, maintenance and protection of all <i>de facto</i> families that exist since they are inherently supportive units, albeit unrecognised by the Constitution.</P>
        <P>It also brings one to a point regarding the lacuna in the Bill before the House which relates to the children of same sex partnerships.  On the European Convention on Human Rights, the courts have not imposed any obligations or restrictions on what we do in this area.  It identified marriage in the same way and recognises the wide margin of the appreciation of member states <Col N="148"/>and signatories to the convention as to how they define marriage.  It is left to the Oireachtas to decide this matter.  It is, in this instance, taking responsibility for it.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes some 130 amendments to existing legislation.  It is very complex and represents serious progress in this area.  The manner in which we are attempting to regulate the registration system for same sex couples and cohabitees is fair, reasonable and correct.  There is an anomaly in the case of the rights of children of same sex couples.  It is one issue about which the Minister and Government clearly have a sensitivity in terms of putting forward proposals.  I am not sure I understand the sensitivity.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman for Children in her opinion on this Bill made some very good points.  There is an acknowledgement that the courts may interpret sections 1 to 7, inclusive, and section 206 of the Bill as assisting in regulating the position of the children of same sex relationships but at the same time it is not quite clear and we are leaving it to the courts to, in a sense, fill the lacuna on which the Oireachtas is not prepared to legislate.  She recommends that provision should be made in law for special guardianship orders, either in civil partnership or other appropriate legislation.  Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to revisit the issue with amendments to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 or will it be left silent?  In the context of today&rsquo;s debate, it is important to know whether a commitment is being made on the issue.  The Ombudsman recommends that the Bill be amended to ensure adequate protection for the children of civil partners in the areas of shared home protection, maintenance, succession, dissolution of partnerships and related matters.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not specifically address the adoption or parenting of children by same sex couples but we will fail in our responsibilities if we remain silent on it.  Other jurisdictions, including Denmark, Iceland and Finland, provide for regulations which appear appropriate.  I ask the Minister to address this specific issue in his concluding remarks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House to debate the ground-breaking legislation before us, the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009.  I am honoured to make the first contribution on behalf of my party in the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a young law student in UCD in 1992, I recall reading about the Norris case and being astounded at the inequality in our society.  I was still in UCD when the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was introduced by the then Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  Those were times of change for Irish society and I think Senators would agree we have moved a long way since.</P>
        <P>When people look back on this Bill in 20 years time, the present Minister will be recorded in the annals of history as having been courageous.  The fact that every party claims ownership of the Bill shows we are doing the right thing.  Every party, including the Labour Party, has had an opportunity to input into the legislation.  Senator Norris deserves particular mention for his long struggle for the rights of gay and lesbian people.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Bill contains lacunae but nobody goes from awful to perfect in one fell swoop.  It is important we bring society with us because I do not want to see bigotry against certain factions or minorities.  Good leadership has brought society with us thus far.</P>
        <P>The Bill gives partners in same sex relationships the right to declare their allegiance to each other and to register their partnerships.  They will be subject to and benefit from a range of protections if their relationships end or in the event of the death of a partner.  The stability this will bring to same sex couples can only help society by increasing tolerance.  It should be celebrated whenever somebody wants to declare love for a partner and a desire to cherish him <Col N="149"/>or her.  I do not care what we call such a relationship, and we are calling it a civil partnership in this Bill.</P>
        <P>I have often heard young gay people say: &ldquo;I do not want to be tolerated, I want to be accepted.&rdquo;  As a society, we need to move to that position.  Enshrining these rights has no consequence for people who are not involved in these partnerships.  Nobody else&rsquo;s rights are being diluted or restricted.  The widely accepted definition of marriage is not being undermined.  In essence, there will be no losers in this Bill, only winners.  The ultimate winner is society.</P>
        <P>As leaders in society, we need to stamp out hatred and intolerance.  Thankfully a long list of legislation over the past 20 years, including the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Equal Status Act 2004 and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, is bringing us towards that goal.  A mere 16 years ago, an intolerable situation obtained whereby a young man would avoid announcing he was gay for fear of being criminalised.  A once conservative Irish society has moved a great distance in the intervening period but it is important that all strands of the community are brought with us.  I declare myself a republican because I believe every person is equal.  I do not think we should be mealy mouthed about this because I do not want <i>Animal Farm</i> style equality, where some people are more equal than others.</P>

	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>In 18 years time, I would not be upset to find out that one of my two young children was gay because that is the way a person is born.  However, I would be upset about the prejudice and intolerance my child would face in society.  Today we are taking a step towards stamping out that hatred.  As leaders, we cannot tolerate racism or inequity in our society.  For too long, our laws have been influenced by religious values.  These values should not be allowed to marginalise the 10% of people who are gay simply because it is easier to hold on to outdated beliefs than it is to accept change.  We must accept change because we cannot ignore the fact that some people are gay.</P>
        <P>Like other Senators, I have received a considerable number of telephone calls in regard to this issue.  When I told one person who called me yesterday to live and let live, the person said that is what was being done until we introduced this Bill.  Nobody should tolerate that level of prejudice and it is incumbent upon us as leaders to leave religion outside the door and treat every person we govern with the respect and equality he or she deserves.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>A couple of red herrings have been thrown into this debate.  One of them concerns the opt-out clause for conscientious objectors or a register of people who do not wish to officiate at ceremonies for two gay people.  It has also been suggested that if a gay couple want to hold their wedding breakfast in a parish hall, the local church leaders should be able to refuse them.  This would be a very dangerous amendment to introduce because it would create a moral hazard.  Regardless of what we may personally believe, we should not introduce such a clause.  I could give many examples of objections to coloured people or Travellers.  The Equal Status Act 2004 is the place for those who want to amend the law to allow for conscientious objectors.  This State cannot support dressed up bigotry, which is what it is.  We cannot allow civil servants to pick and choose which part of their job they will perform.</P>
        <P>There is a lacuna in the Bill in respect of the biological children of same-sex couples.  If something happens to the partner who is the biological parent of a child, the child will be left in a lacuna.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s assurances that he will examine this issue and introduce legislation to deal with it.  This should be done as quickly as possible.  Perhaps we will be in a position to adopt stronger legislation in this regard following the constitutional amendment on <Col N="150"/>children.  We cannot have &ldquo;Children of a Lesser God&rdquo; in society or allow little children to believe they are second best or not equal to the person sitting beside them in school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides when he states he will move quickly on this issue.</P>
        <P>While the part of the Bill dealing with cohabitees may be smaller than that dealing with same-sex couples, as I have stated frequently, cohabitees also need protection.  We must realise that an estimated 10% of the population are gay, although it is possible that many more people are living in denial or afraid to be honest about their sexual orientation.  I hope the position will change as we move towards a more tolerant society.  Those people living in <i>de facto</i> families account for a further 12% of the population.  As I noted yesterday, the Supreme Court recently rejected the concept of a <i>de facto</i> family.  In total, therefore, 22% of the population will be affected by the legislation.</P>
        <P>I have been contacted by many mothers of gay children who are delighted with this legislation.  When children tell their families they are gay, their parents worry because they are aware of the prejudice their children will face.  That more Irish people are gay than speak the Irish language speaks volumes.  We must remember where we are and where we are trying to go.  All young people deserve a safe and supportive environment, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Tolerance is about accepting that others have the right to make choices one would not make personally.  I am a married Catholic, albeit not one who always practises, who has two children.  I do not have a right to expect others will live their lives as I live mine.  We must realise that people have choices and are entitled to make them.  People cannot help the way they are.</P>
        <P>Donal &Oacute;g Cusack recently gave an interview on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; in which he courageously spoke about being gay.  He stated his father&rsquo;s response on being told he was gay was that he would try to fix him.  It was equally noteworthy that Donal&rsquo;s younger brother had patted his father on the back and told him the news would broaden his mind.  Many courageous individuals deserve mention in this debate for standing up, being counted and pointing out that they deserve equality.  I acknowledge the work done by the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and other organisations which have fought tirelessly for gay rights.</P>
        <P>There is a group of people who take the view that their children are normal and that they do not know anyone who is gay.  Most people of my age have gay friends and are aware of the impact the current legal position has on gay people.  Thankfully, this is about to change with the passage of the Bill.  Once enacted, it will affect today&rsquo;s children and the generations to follow.  Being gay, like the colour of one&rsquo;s skin, is about being treated as equal and securing civil rights.  The Bill affords fundamental human and civil rights to a section of society.  Someone once stated democracy was not about taking care of the majority but protecting the minority, albeit a rather sizeable one in this case.  That is what we are doing today.</P>
        <P>While surfing the Internet in advance of this debate, I noted the following from quotation from Harvey Milk:</P>
        <P LI="1">It takes no compromising to give people their rights.  It takes no money to respect the individual.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These words must be at the forefront of our minds, as legislators.  This legislation is a long overdue but significant milestone.  Speaking from experience as a family lawyer, it is high time the injustice visited on same-sex couples was removed from the Statute Book.  A same-sex <Col N="151"/>partner cannot even register a partner&rsquo;s death or sign for his or her funeral.  In many areas, cohabitees cannot secure State benefits and same-sex and opposite-sex partners have been excluded from many decisions, for instance, on withdrawal of life support.  These issues have been discussed in detail elsewhere.  As I stated, the legislation is long overdue and I am delighted it has been brought before us.</P>
        <P>As the Bill passes into law, we must take our hats off to the Minister; the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who gave a commitment to produce this legislation, and many other politicians who in the past 20 years courageously moved us to this position.  As a younger Member of the Legislature, I believe the Republic will be much stronger when the Bill passes into law.  I am proud to be a Member of the House today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and, in particular, the sensitive language in which his speech was couched, although some of the claims made regarding full equality were a little exaggerated.  I warmly welcome the superb and moving speeches made by the spokespersons for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, Senators McDonald and Regan, respectively.</P>
        <P>For most of my life, including most of my adult life, I was branded as a criminal by ancient and alien laws for something over which I had as little control as the colour of my skin.  I was what was known in those prim days before gay liberation as a &ldquo;homosexual&rdquo;.  At one time I was both technically a known criminal and a Member of this House at the same time, yet I have come through to this week when we shall see the passage of a Bill that will give a degree of recognition to same-sex couples.  That is certainly a remarkable and radical transformation to be experienced by any human being.</P>
        <P>This is an historic debate and I shall do my best to understand and respect its historic nature.  I will do so by dealing honestly, openly and sincerely with the truth and facts, rather than the hollow debating points employed by some who are opposed to the extension of civil rights to gay couples.  Let me be clear about one thing.  There is nothing visionary in the legislation, nor is there anything revolutionary about it.  An historic opportunity has been missed.  From being among the leaders, we are now among the laggards of Europe in this regard, falling behind not only the Netherlands and all the Scandinavian countries but even Catholic Spain which has introduced full civil marriage for same-sex couples without society falling apart.  This legislation does not grant equality; it merely improves the second-class status of gay people in some practical ways.</P>
        <P>Let us not have any sanctimonious hand-wringing about supposed unconstitutionality.  Authoritative opinion obtained some years ago by the Law Reform Commission held that legislation in this area would only be unconstitutional if it purported to give greater powers to the new institution than were already given to existing marriage.  That the Constitution, as it stands, is open to same-sex marriage is made clear by the fact that as far back as the conservative 1960s, a very eminent lawyer, Mr. Declan Costello, in his review of the Constitution expressed concern that the Constitution, as it then stood, was clearly open to the interpretation that same-sex marriage was legal because marriage was not defined as being between a man and a woman.</P>
        <P>Opponents of social advance have never allowed logic or reason to cloud the clarity of their prejudice.  These are the very same groups which but a few decades ago accused the gay community of being incapable of sustaining relationships and addicted to compulsive promiscuity instead.  Now it appears that the plain desire of many within the gay community to settle down and make a commitment in a relationship disturbs them just as much as did their former grievance.</P>
        <P>The first and most important of my reservations regarding the Bill is the complete abdication by its drafters of moral responsibility for the welfare of children.  Yesterday evening I received <Col N="152"/>the comments of the Ombudsman for Children in a report which strongly endorses my position and calls for amendments of the kind I have tabled.  One would have thought that given the history of this country in the past 100 years, in respect of which successive reports have conclusively proved that both the Church and State were guilty of the most horrendous crimes against children &mdash; actively, by neglect or turning a blind eye to their suffering &mdash; neither the Church nor the State would dare prejudice the innocence of children once again.  Let us be clear about the facts and cut through the deliberate and misleading obfuscation that has been created by elements within a number of the Christian traditions.  First, children can and already have been adopted by gay people.  They can only be adopted singly, however, which means quite starkly that if the legally adopting parent dies, the surviving parent who has helped to rear, nourish and parent the child is instantly cut off in the legal sense.  Much worse than that the child himself or herself has no connection with the surviving parent and is cast adrift.  What is this except child abuse?  Let no one say this was done unawares for I and others have made the situation very clear.  Even the Roman Catholic Church has abolished limbo and yet the State of Ireland, with this legislation, has brought it back again for a minority of our most vulnerable children.</P>
        <P>Two letters appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday on the subject of the impact of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill.  The contrast could not be greater.  The first from David Wilkins states disappointment and betrayal.  He so wanted to celebrate, to dance in the street and to be able to get married as a gay man.  So much has been granted in the Bill, but that last piece which would allow him to celebrate and dance has been callously withheld.  The other letter from David Nelson points to the pontifical yearbook 2010 to calculate the statistical increase in the number of Roman Catholics on the planet.  He is pleased to note that the church continues to increase both in nominal membership and as a percentage of the global population pointing out there are now more than 1.166 billion Roman Catholics in the world, representing 17.4% of the global population.  This is a vast number and in the numbers game so often played, this time by Mr. Nelson, he believes that this alone confers moral authority and democratic sanctions.  He reminds us of the instruction issued in March 2003 by Pope John Paul II that Roman Catholic law makers in whatever country throughout the globe must express opposition clearly and publicly and vote against any civil partnership legislation.</P>
        <P>The Roman Catholic Church is a chameleon-like entity.  It is at one and the same time one of the great religious traditions historically and by far the largest of the Christian denominations.  The Pope is its spiritual leader, but he is also head of a tiny state unusual in its microscopic size, its religious nature and the fact that the entire population is celibate.  Despite this, the Pope occupies this dual position, acting sometimes as Bishop of Rome and sometimes as master of the shrivelled remnant of the former Papal States in Italy.  Presumably it was acting in this capacity as a secular Head of State that the Pope issued his instruction to legislators.  I will not castigate the Pope or criticise him, but I will ask my colleagues to consider what the situation would have been had any other Head of State or any other ambassador instructed duly elected representatives as to how they should respond to legislative proposals of an independent democratic government.  Neither is this a back number.  This specific instruction has been mentioned repeatedly in the sometimes obscene and vitriolic correspondence I have received in my office from various elements of the reactionary rump of Christendom.</P>
        <P>Gay people cannot marry, but murderers, child abusers, burglars, bank robbers, ex-priests and ex-nuns can marry.  I, a Member of this House in good standing, have no such right.  I find myself in the position that is complained of universally within the gay community of being deprived of full equality.</P><Col N="153"/>
        <P>My second objection to the Bill is to the language.  There is a nasty, mean-spirited separation between gay people and the rest of the population which militates against their full equality in terms of the language used to describe living arrangements.  For heterosexual couples, whether they be married, cohabiting or partnered, their dwelling place is to be called the family home, whereas in a gesture of contempt towards the gay community, for same-sex couples the home is merely to be described as &ldquo;shared&rdquo;, like a seat on the bus or a visit to the cinema.  This is despite the fact that even with its recent skewing towards the conservative right, the European Court of Human Rights has found that two persons of the same sex living together in a committed relationship form a <i>de facto</i> family.  Under this law that the Minister thinks generous, we are not to have legal rights to children, even our own children, we are not even to have marriage, and we are not even to have a family home.  Everything is to be temporary, partial and second rate.</P>
        <P>In defence of these positions it is sometimes argued that to rear a child in a same-sex relationship is to cause him or her damage.  I would like to place on the record of the House the report of the commission appointed by the Swedish Parliament in 1999 to investigate the situation of children in homosexual families.  Its conclusion was as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">The combined research shows that children with homosexual parents have developed psychologically and socially in a similar way to the children with whom they were compared.  Nor did any differences emerge as regards the children in terms of sexual development.  For some children conflicts may arise at certain stages of growing up that are related to their parents&rsquo; sexual preferences.  These mainly relate to the fact that in the early teens they may experience their parents&rsquo; homosexual preference as a problem in relation to peer groups and children of the same age.  Research shows the children&rsquo;s ability to handle such conflicts depends on how their relationship is to their parents.  Children growing up in a loving environment with the child as the focus of its parents&rsquo; love and care are well equipped to handle crises and problems of this kind.  Nor have any differences emerged from the research between homosexual and heterosexual parents as regards their ability to offer children good nurturing and care.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The report continues: &ldquo;In the light of what has emerged in the research in the field the Commission considers that the legal differences that exist today regarding homosexual and heterosexual couples&rsquo; ability to adopt are no longer objectively justified&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The same is true throughout Scandinavia with regard to the supposed detrimental effect upon marriage of allowing for the marriage of same-sex couples.  The statistics unambiguously demonstrate that the rate of decline in marriage has become considerably less severe and in some years and in some countries actually reversed after the introduction of same-sex marriage.  Is this not logical in any case?  What else would one expect?  The same values that lead gay people to seek commitment are those very values that are cherished in marriage.  Instead of being the antagonists and opponents of marriage, gay people are turning into some of its most effective and ardent advocates.  Indeed there is evidence, some of it anecdotal in terms of specific case histories, some statistical, to show that a certain percentage of cohabiting heterosexual couples were inspired in the Scandinavian countries to enter into the fuller commitment of marriage by the example of their gay friends.</P>
        <P>There has been a very sinister and deliberate attempt by those who wish to deny full rights to their fellow citizens for specious reasons to co-opt the language of liberation, tolerance and human rights as a mask for prejudice.  I completely reject their right to so do.  The shadow of the Penal Laws has been invoked by opponents of the Bill.  I have personal experience of penal laws.  As I said at the beginning of this speech, I grew up in this country at a time when my very nature made me a criminal.  This was not an empty threat.  Many people were jailed.  I <Col N="154"/>know for I analysed the Garda statistics on crime at the time and I dealt with many people who were brought to court for the private expression of sexual feelings.  People were jailed and lost jobs and family.  People were referred to forced psychiatric treatment.  People were subjected against their will to electroconvulsive shock therapy and aversion therapy.  As a result, the gay community has historically displayed unusually high levels of suicide and addiction, which is not surprising when they were subjected so often to criminal blackmail.</P>
        <P>I find myself in an unusual position for someone of my social background.  I have known six people who were murdered.  They were murdered specifically and solely because of their sexual orientation.  I doubt if this unenviable record can be matched by any other Member of this House.  That, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, is what penal laws achieve.  I think it a shame that anyone in this House should seek to rescue from oblivion the slightest fragment of such laws.</P>

	<P>Let me turn to my own benches.  Seated upon them is a colleague, Senator Mullen, who consistently calls for civilised and respectful debate.  He has also been consistently on the airwaves seeking to undermine this legislation.  He told the main radio news programme during this last week that GLEN, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, was wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money republishing some of the speeches from the earlier debate in the other House.  This was completely untrue.  Does such untruth reflect a respectful attitude or is it a rather mean-minded attempt to smear?  Its money is confined to the funding of advice and policy development in the area of HIV and AIDS.  Any publication was funded by Chuck Feeney who has given &euro;700 million to Irish universities.</P>
        <P>We are told that we must respect the views of the churches.  I do not extend such a blank cheque to any person or group.  I do not automatically respect them, but I cherish their right to express views with which I strongly disagree.  It was for this reason that in the 1970s, when I mounted a case in the courts to challenge the criminal penalties under which citizens like myself suffered, I offered an opportunity to the then Archbishop of Dublin or his representative to make their position clear within the court system.  This was done in writing by a letter sent personally by me to the archbishop&rsquo;s palace in Drumcondra.  When no reply was received after a week or two, I sent a copy and a reminder by registered post.  There was no reply.  I called personally to the house and hand delivered a copy.  Only then was I given indirectly and at several removes a kind of answer.  That was a denial.  I have offered to debate the matter publicly with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, but my offer has been ignored.  I wrote to Cardinal Sean Brady in recent weeks, offering to debate these laws and their provisions in public in the full glare of the media &mdash; I sent a copy to the director general of RTE Television &mdash; and have only just received a reply.  Once again, my offer was declined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This could have been such a great day in the moral development of Ireland.  However, thanks to the subterranean pressures applied to neuter and reduce the liberalising effect of the Bill, although we do have something to celebrate, at the end of the day it is not as much as it could have been.  We have shown that we have failed to live up to the vision of the Liberator, the great Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, who pointed out to similar mean-minded and begrudging opponents of Catholic emancipation that by granting freedom, dignity and equality to others, one did not diminish the general resource of such values but multiplied them. We must ask ourselves how much greater could have been the level of freedom.  How much more enhanced would our values be if the Government really had vision and courage?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  The discussion on the civil partnership Bill has evoked deep emotions on all sides of the Chamber and in the wider public sphere.  I have embarked on a difficult personal journey in examining my conscience and deeply held beliefs and I am satisfied that I have reached a balanced and principled objection to the provisions of the Bill.  In relinquishing the Whip, I regret any difficulty my decision causes for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  My stand has caused me some angst, as I have been a member of Fianna F&aacute;il for 42 years and a public representative for 36 years, and it has not been easy to take the position I have taken.</P>
        <P>Before I discuss my principal objections to the legislation, it is necessary to state clearly and unambiguously the rationale for my opposition to the Bill.  I am strongly of the opinion that diversity in Irish society should be recognised and protected.  I realise that in modern Ireland new forms of relationship must be afforded certain protections to reflect their circumstances.  I am on record as having said same-sex couples and others in caring, dependent relationships should and must be respected and granted certain limited protections.  I have watched in dismay as my position on the Bill has been misrepresented and distorted.  I have been subjected to personal abuse and branded a bigot by certain elements.  Once again, let me be perfectly clear that, as a republican and a Christian, I abhor discrimination against any person on the basis of his or her sexual orientation, gender, race or religion.</P>
        <P>I have a quotation that captured my imagination on the back of my business card by Pedro Arrupe, a former superior general of the Jesuits:  &ldquo;Let there be men and women who would bend their energies not to promote the interests of the privileged, but to the extent possible, to reduce privilege in favour of the underprivileged.&rdquo;  I would belie this if I were to take a prejudiced position against same-sex relationships.</P>
        <P>As a democrat, I staunchly defend the right of every person to state his or her views on any matter.  As a public representative, I am acutely aware of the position I hold in the public eye and the responsibility it carries.  As difficult as this journey has been for me personally and professionally, I am compelled to follow my conscience and ask those who disagree with me to respect my contribution to this debate, as I have respected theirs.</P>
        <P>I am not a recent convert to the opinions I hold.  This matter was debated in the House as far back as 16 February 2005 and again on 27 February 2008 at the initiation of Senator Norris.  I put the following motion to the parliamentary party:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party calls on the Government to ensure, when prescribing civil partnership legislation, that they guard with special care [taken from Article 41.3.1&deg; of the Constitution] the fundamental position of the family; acknowledges that all forms of the family are entitled to help and support; and calls on the Government to continue giving <Col N="156"/>special support, including unique financial and legal protections, to the institution of marriage, because of its uniquely pro-child nature, thereby protecting the traditional family unit as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State as is prescribed in Article 41.1.2&deg; of our Constitution.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Bill, as drafted, is flawed in a number of ways.  It discriminates against people in caring dependent relationships that are not sexual in nature, even though the Bill is being introduced in the name of equality.  It also weakens the special status of the family in marriage, a matter we will deal with as we go through the Bill.  I thought these problems could have been addressed without in any way detracting from the rights and entitlements justly due to persons in civil partnership arrangements such as property settlements, maintenance rights, succession rights of next of kin and so on.</P>
        <P>Last week I received an e-mail from a lady and it is worth quoting from it:</P>
        <P LI="1">I have been in a relationship for almost ten years, yet if my partner got ill, I would not even have the right to be by their side in hospital.  This has happened once and it broke my heart.  I urge you to consider how you would feel if you or someone you love were in my position.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I responded and thanked her for the reasonable way she had presented her case:</P>
        <P LI="1">I note your comments regarding next of kin and fully support your point of view on this.  I am not at all unmindful of the major step forward it is for people in same sex relationships with regard to commitment, security, respect, social acceptance etc.  My primary concern is in respect of protecting the Constitutional status of marriage, and in particular, the reasons behind that being in the Constitution.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Existing marriage rights should remain unique to marriage because of its uniquely pro-child nature.  It is not discrimination to treat a unique institution such as marriage between a man and a woman in a unique manner.</P>
        <P>I have concerns about data published in recent times which show the increase in the rate of marriage break down in the last 25 years and the growth in the numbers of lone parents and cohabiting couples.  Personally, I do not think that this is desirable for society or in the best interests of children.</P>
        <P>Anthropology and complementarity are important considerations in this debate.  I accept fully that marriage is not the only relationship in which children are well cared for.  However, we all form our views based on our education, life experiences, reason and conscience.  When I ask myself if a child has rights, I say, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Most would agree with me.  Do the influence and complementarity of a mother and father in a loving environment benefit and enhance the development of child?  In reply to this question I say, &ldquo;Definitely yes.&rdquo;  Does a child have a right to a mother and a father?  The answer is in the affirmative.  Does the State, by its laws, have a duty to promote with unique measures the institution of marriage?  I have challenged my own views on this matter and it is interesting that studies I have examined show that in the areas of health, education, employment and mental health children all score higher when they come from good, committed, loving, caring relationships within the institution of marriage.  These studies were completed in Britain and the United States because we do not carry out such studies here.</P>
        <P>I would like to challenge the definition of equality as provided by some.  Equality is a concept that emerged in the late 18th century.  It emerged in the American War of Independence, the French Revolution and the 1798 rebellion here.  The aim was to ensure there was equality of <Col N="157"/>opportunity for individuals.  One of the principal forms is the right to life, about which I feel strongly.  We also have a right to shelter, education, employment and to be cared for in ill health or old age.  Some people who classify themselves as republican are adopting the 20th century left-wing liberal thinking in regard to their interpretation of equality.  I have said before &mdash; I make no apology for it &mdash; that many causes have hijacked equality as a way of advancing their own cause.  I do not criticise them for it but we must look intelligently at, and interpret precisely, what we mean by it.</P>
        <P>When we come to the formulation of legislation, independent, objectively evaluated studies must be done.  In that regard, I am interested to note that Ms Kearns of the Equality Authority is in favour of marriage equality.  Since it is not in the Bill, she is going to contact the Law Reform Commission to make that case.  The chairman of the Law Reform Commission, Judge McGuinness, has clearly expressed her views in that regard.  The Ombudsman for Children has done the same.  Do people working in the public service and in institutions funded by the State have any obligation to uphold our Constitution and its requirements?  Is choreography at play here?</P>
        <P>The question of conscience has been brought up.  I have noticed with alarm, as have others, aggressive secularism entirely intolerant of any contrary views or opinions.  The other day I quoted Anan Grover, a UN official on human rights, who has taken a view that not only is Poland wrong in regard to abortion but that there cannot be any freedom of conscience on that matter.</P>
        <P>I refer to an article I read lately which stated that conscience is the only bulwark against the totalitarian tendencies of all states and that this finds recognition in the present German Basic Law, or conditions, which, to avoid a repetition of the totalitarianism of the Nazi period when the conscience of citizens was mercilessly crushed, insists that those elected to parliament shall be representative of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions and responsible only to their conscience.  That comes from Article 38.1 of the German Constitution.  We would do well to be mindful of it.</P>
        <P>I said I received abusive e-mails and posters were put up in my own town.  However, I also received communications from gay people who have genuine concerns that my stance would, in some way, impede progress for their relationships.  I will read from a correspondence I received, which is worth reading.  While it may seem self-congratulatory at the start, when one gets to the substance of it, one will note a headline lesson for all of us:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Senator,</P>
        <P LI="1">I watched with interest your contribution to &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; programme this week.  Your views were expressed with care and in a thoughtful fashion and any bill before the Senate should be subject to careful examination, amendments, thoughtful argument and an unimpeded discussion.  The idea that anyone who contributes to this discussion and asks hard questions and looks at options is a bigot, homophobic or anti-equality is completely foreign to me as someone who supports the ideas and philosophy of a true and inclusive republic.  I am the founder of GLEN in 1988 and a FF supporter.  I am not conflicted in either as a Gay man.....</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The issue before you in the Senate is civil partnership and the bill can only be strengthened when you and others speak honestly and thoughtfully about your concerns, reservations and alternatives.  By doing so you articulate the views of so many people who have legitimate democratic views.  I sir may be a gay man who has founded and worked with GLEN and other equality organisations/issues.  Today I work as a shop steward . . . </P><Col N="158"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I will not stand by and have people who disagree with my views on union issues dismissed by one line comments of bigotry, homophobia etc. . . </P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I suggest with genuine respect that you make your views known in this debate without fear or apology and in doing so you will continue to enhance democracy and help recover any lost reputation that the political class have suffered recently.  If I had the fear of speaking out in the past because my views were unpopular or not of their time, many people would not have the courage today to take their views forward to enhance this society.  Any suggestion that societies development is only or best served by everyone agreeing with the most popular contemporary ideas is dictatorship by the back door.  Publish your views and be assured that I will be one of the many people who will continue to regard you with respect as an honest, thoughtful man who has the best interests of our republic at heart.  Need I say any more?</P>
        <P FLI="0">All I would say to that is what an enlightened and generous mind to articulate such a challenging standard of thought and debate.  It is the epitome of true democracy.</P>
        <P>I will again quote Edmund Burke who gave his views on the role of a public representative.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents . . . But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If Edmund Burke is not a sufficient authority for Members of the House, I will quote one of the great intellectuals in history, Albert Einstein, who said never do anything against conscience, even when the State demands it.  We would do well to remember that.</P>
        <P>I spoke to the Taoiseach about my reservations and I genuinely appreciate the fact he had respect for the principled stand I took and I thank him for that.  The Minister and I have been good friends for many years.  A long time ago, I told him I would oppose him every step of the way in regard to sections of this Bill but hoped it would not interfere with our friendship.  It is my intention that it will not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also spoke to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, because the Green Party is our partner in government and I did not want anything misdirected his way as to why I am taking this position.  When I finished speaking, he said to thine own self be true.  It is a maxim I have lived by all my life and I will continue to do so now and in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It gives me great pleasure to be here on behalf of the Labour Party to welcome the introduction of this ground-breaking Bill.  I am proud to be here to represent the party with a proud tradition on gay rights and the first political party to bring before either House legislation recognising the status of gay couples in law.</P>
        <P>In 2004, my dear friend and colleague, Senator Norris, a pioneer on gay rights, was the first person to bring forward legislation.  His Civil Partnership Bill was debated in this House in 2005 and 2008.  However, the Labour Party introduced a Civil Union Bill in the D&aacute;il in 2006 and again in 2007, which Deputy Howlin proposed.  That Bill would have gone a great deal further than this one does.  We have a proud record on gay rights and I am proud to be here to say we will support this Bill.</P><Col N="159"/>
        <P>However, we have reservations.  In the party&rsquo;s view and in mine, this Bill does not go far enough.  It does not represent equality for gay couples.  It does not provide for recognition of gay marriage and it has a most glaring omission in that it has only a very minimal reference to protection for the children of families involving two parents of the same sex.  It lacks protection for children of gay parents and this is a major flaw which we and Senator Norris will attempt to address through a series of amendments.</P>
        <P>While we support this Bill as a step forward, an advance in the rights of gay people, we do not see it as being an ending post.  As the Irish Council for Civil Liberties said, this is a staging post and not a milestone.  It is only a step on the way to true equality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Moreover, I do not see why we could not have gone further in this Bill.  A great deal of time has passed in which this Bill has been campaigned for.  This Bill has not come about easily.  I pay tribute to the great work of groups like GLEN and the NLGF, Senator Norris and many other courageous individuals, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery and whose work has brought about this Bill and a situation in which all the political parties have signed up to this.  We could have gone further given the long genesis of this Bill and the long road we have all travelled to get here.</P>
        <P>I should declare an interest here.  I am junior counsel in the Zappone-Gilligan case, which is awaiting a trial date before the Supreme Court.  A wonderful couple, Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan, are seeking recognition not only of their Canadian marriage but of their right to marry in Ireland.  As I said, that case is awaiting a date.  The Supreme Court has never explicitly answered the question of whether or not the right to marry under the Constitution includes a right to marry for same sex couples.  That question has not yet been addressed.  As Senator Norris has said, the Law Reform Commission has said it would not be unconstitutional to give the same rights of marriage to same sex couples.</P>
        <P>I will address this point further after the suspension, but may I make a final point?  There is still a small number of people who object even to civil partnership and who have put their objections to marriage on the record.  However, it is extraordinary that they have never explained how recognition of gay marriage would impact adversely on the rights of any existing married couples or individuals.  They have never said what harm it would do.  In the absence of that, we know it will not do harm.  It will not dilute the rights of any other people, as Senator McDonald has said.  There is no need to oppose either civil partnership or full marriage rights for gay couples.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>Sitting suspended at 2 p.m. and resumed at 2.30 p.m</i>.</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  Before the suspension, I was speaking of the major problem that we in the Labour Party see with this Bill, namely, that it does not go far enough.  It does not provide for full equality for gay couples because it does not recognise within it the right to marry.  I want to emphasise that arguing for a more inclusive definition of marriage is not an attack upon marriage.  It has been misinterpreted in that way but it is far from it, because expanding the categories of those entitled to marry in law gives even greater support and protection to the institution of marriage.</P>
        <P>One must remember that our definition of marriage has changed over time.  Until 1995 in Ireland, which is very recently, marriage was seen as a permanent state from which no divorce was possible.  Now, we have introduced divorce and this did not destroy the institution of marriage despite the many doomsday predictions of those who campaigned against the divorce referendum at that time.  Similarly, in the US there were legal prohibitions against mixed-race marriages, a concept we would find absolutely abhorrent today.  Again, this was something that changed.  One day very soon I hope and believe we will see a prohibition on same-sex marriage <Col N="160"/>or rather the failure to include same-sex partners within a definition of marriage as similarly outdated.</P>
        <P>That day has already come in a host of other jurisdictions.  It is not as if this is something that is a radical or far-fetched proposition.  We have seen it in Canada, South Africa and a number of European jurisdictions such as the Netherlands and more recently in Spain and in Portugal, which legalised same-sex marriage in the last few weeks.  Both Spain and Portugal are countries we should well look towards as countries with a strong conservative and Catholic tradition, as we have, but which recognised that this was a matter of human rights and of equality and recognised that the right to marry should be an inherent aspect of humanity &mdash; a recognition that each and every one of us is capable inherently of entering into loving, committed and intimate relationships and that the law simply needs to recognise that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Public opinion has moved on.  Others on this side of the House, notably Senator Regan, have already quoted opinion polls that show the majority of people favour legal recognition for same-sex couples and the recognition of marriage.  The vast majority of submissions to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, of which I am a member, argued that the Bill did not go far enough.  We should take a lead from other countries and recognise in our legislation not only partnership but also marriage.  We are supporting an amendment from Senator Norris which would give some effect to that.  As I said, Senator Norris has led the way on this issue for many years.  He introduced the first civil partnership Bill in either House in 2004 and it was debated in 2005, a Bill on which I worked with him and which was drafted in a way that was far more inclusive and far-reaching than the current Bill.</P>
        <P>Why does all of this matter?  There will be those, such as the Minister in his remarks before the break, who say that civil partnership is enough.  There are those who say the name of the institution may not matter but it does matter.  There are two key reasons for this.  First, it matters in law.  It amounts to second class citizenship not to permit gay couples to marry.  Even in the UK, where the civil partnership law is far more inclusive and far closer to the marital status than this Bill, we still see a difference in status; it is still not marriage.  It matters in particular in Ireland because, of course, in the Constitution the only family that is given constitutional protection in Article 41 is the family based upon marriage.  As Senator Regan said, this is a far more restrictive interpretation of the definition of family than we see in the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence, where Article 8 on family rights has allowed for a much more expanded definition of family to include cohabitants and children, be they gay or straight cohabitants.  We need to see in our law a recognition of much more diverse forms of family and we need to see constitutional change on that.  However, while marriage is given this privileged status, it gives an even greater reason that gay couples should be entitled to enter marriage and why this Bill falls short of what is necessary to provide for equality.</P>
        <P>Second, the difference between marriage and civil partnership matters greatly in practice.  It is not the same in reality.  What we have is a very different model to the UK civil partnership model; it is a far more restrictive version of civil partnership and it falls far short of marriage in many respects.  The most glaring aspect of this is in the absence of any reference to the rights of children, many of whom are currently living with gay parents and in gay families, and who deserve and require this recognition.  There are other ways in which it falls short of marriage, to which I will return, but the lack of reference to children is the most glaring omission in this Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The lack of legislative recognition for the children currently living in gay families in Ireland means they will continue to be discriminated against legally as they will not have any rights <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the non-birth parent in the relationship.  The Minister addressed this when he said he did not want to see piecemeal development but, in fact, this Bill was the right place to introduce <Col N="161"/>the amendments that are necessary.  The advice just published from the Ombudsman for Children, with which we have very helpfully been supplied, makes this point very clearly.  At page 2 of her advice, the Ombudsman states:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . the Bill does not adequately address the rights and needs of children . . . it is unclear why [the consideration of children] resulted in a Bill that did not prioritise the rights and interests of children.  Although the situation of same-sex couples will be improved considerably by the enactment of the . . . Bill, the situation of children with same-sex parents will remain largely as it is at present . . . It should be borne in mind that this is not a hypothetical problem.  The omission of robust protections for the children of civil partners will have real consequences for the young people concerned and it is in their interests that the law reflect and provide for the reality of their lives.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is a very robust critique of the Bill and we would absolutely share that view.</P>
        <P>In fact, there are two references to children when one considers the Bill very carefully.  There is a very welcome amendment in section 73 on succession rights to allow the children of a civil partner to succeed to their parents&rsquo; estate but there is no right of succession if the parent who has died is not their birth or adoptive parent.  In section 129, there is some broader reference on the dissolution of a civil partnership where the court may have regard to a child to whom either civil partner owes an obligation of support.  While that is welcome, it does not go far enough and we have put forward amendments to try to address this.</P>
        <P>I put forward various amendments of the sort the Ombudsman for Children has proposed, as did Senator Norris, when we debated the Adoption Bill.  I put forward an amendment on special guardianship and both Senator Norris and I proposed amendments explicitly permitting gay couples to adopt.  The Minister, Deputy Andrews, at that point said these amendments were not appropriate in that Bill and he explicitly referenced the introduction of the civil partnership Bill.  Now, with the civil partnership Bill, we see the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, saying a comprehensive review is underway of the rights of children and it will all be dealt with later.  When are we going to deal with it?  We need an answer to that question.  It is simply not good enough for the many children who are currently existing in what Senator Norris has described as a legal limbo and whose rights <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> their non-birth parents are simply not being recognised.</P>
        <P>There has been a good deal of talk from those opposed to this Bill more generally about the need for the preservation of marriage as exclusively opposite-sex because that is better for children.  Again, I have not seen any evidence to support the contention that extending marriage rights or civil partnership rights to gay parents or gay partners in any way impacts adversely upon children &mdash; nothing has been produced to show that.  All the available research shows it is the quality of parenting that matters, not whether the parents are gay or straight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many of the studies cited by the other side, including the infamous Fourth National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect produced by the US Government this year, do not look at all at gay parenting as against straight parenting and have different research criteria.  That US study made a series of very different and somewhat inconclusive findings, and explicitly stated that issues other than family structure needed to be considered.  The incidence of child maltreatment varied as a function of several characteristics of children&rsquo;s families, including parents&rsquo; employment, family socio-economic status, family structure and living arrangements, grandparent caregivers, family size and metropolitan status of the county.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other studies have also been done, including a recent Spanish study of 214 families of various types, including same-sex parents and families with married parents, etc.  It found that young children and adolescents generally benefited from attention received by two engaged, caring <Col N="162"/>parents of the same gender.  Gay parents were as good if not better at raising healthy, well adjusted children than the heterosexual counterparts.</P>
        <P>The point made in the study was that often studies touted by the other side do not address same-sex couples and their children.  Instead they tend to examine the differential effect on children of being raised by single parents rather than two parents.  It is an important point.  In this jurisdiction marriage equality has presented some experiences from children of gay couples and those who are adults have expressed their own view that the only discrimination experienced was from other people, and they were otherwise brought up in a healthy and loving environment.</P>
        <P>As legislators we must deal with the reality that there are gay couples in Ireland with children who deserve equal treatment.  There are children who have and are growing up with gay parents and in gay families, and gay couples foster children, as the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, has said.  He has said such people make excellent foster parents.  Gay individuals adopt children, although they can only do so as individuals and not as couples.  It is long overdue for the children in such families to be given legal recognition.</P>
        <P>There are other flaws in the Bill and areas where it falls far short of anything close to marriage.  This is notable in the area of immigration law and the recognition of foreign marriages.  Gay couples who have married abroad will see their relationship only given the status of a civil partnership in our law.  In the dissolution of a civil partnership there is a differential treatment, and a couple may only seek dissolution where they have lived apart for two of the previous three years.  A longer period is required for couples seeking divorce from a marriage at four to five years.</P>
        <P>There is a lack of specific protection in the Bill relating to equality in social welfare and taxation.  We are told other legislation is necessary to bring those changes into effect.  I was glad to hear the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, say those changes are being drafted to be included in finance and social welfare Bills, but I would like clarification on when we can expect to see those in place.  I presume the full effect of this Bill will not be seen until that is done, but I would like confirmation in this regard.</P>
        <P>Many people in Ireland want to know when they can enter civil partnership ceremonies.  They have been waiting a long time and need to know when this will happen.</P>

        <P>We will support the Bill and we will also support the protection for cohabitees which has been provided.  It is relatively limited and does not amount to unwarranted State intrusion on the lives of couples who have chosen not to get married or enter into civil partnership.  It will resolve the real injustice which has occurred where a cohabitant is financially dependent on a partner and who until now has had to endure a very unwieldy legal process to get any form of redress.</P>
        <P>We support the major elements of the Bill as a stepping stone.  In the words of an Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann advertising campaign, we are not there yet but we are getting there.  It is an important step which we welcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>In these Houses of the Oireachtas we have the sometimes dubious privilege of passing much legislation.  Some Bills are quite regular in how they come to us and concern the daily running of the State.  They are finance and social welfare legislation.  Some Bills are amendments to previous Acts seen through time and circumstance to be in need of change, or where the original tends to be seen as flawed.  Some Bills have an emergency nature and we have seen more than enough in recent years dealing with the banking crisis and the financial position.  Some legislation helps to define who we are as a society and this is one such Bill.</P>
        <P>As it is defining legislation, it does not come without controversy.  There are those in our society who say: &ldquo;Thus far and no further&rdquo;, and there are those who quite legitimately have the right to expect that we need to go further.  My party sees this as stepping stone legislation and there will be further Bills to advance the continuing equality this legislation brings about.  Nevertheless it is a significant leap forward and we should mark the effect it will have on society.</P>
        <P>Most European countries have chosen to take a stepping stone approach in this respect.  In France, Germany, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Finland, legislation is at the status of civil partnerships.  Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Belgium and the Netherlands have legislation on full single-sex marriage.  We should not see ourselves as unique in this regard and the process must be followed.  I am proud that we are taking a significant step in that direction today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a society we must acknowledge our continuing immaturity in the area of sexuality.  How sexuality is acknowledged, expressed, recognised and not celebrated in our society is something with which we must come to terms.  For too many generations, many have had to endure a stigma that should never have been attached and, as legislators, we have ignored the problem for far too long.  If there is anything in the debate we are having and the legislation we will pass today, it will be to remove from the shadows a stigma that should not have been placed to begin with.  I can think of friends like Arthur Leahy in Cork who was involved in a television documentary in the 1970s, when it was first acknowledged that homosexuality existed in our country.  It is a bit like the comment about &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; that there was no sex in Ireland before television.  We have come a long way since but we still have a journey to travel.  As a result of the repressed attitude to sexuality, where people were made to feel wrong if they had or expressed an inclination or felt part of a certain society, this Bill only goes some of the way towards redressing the imbalance.  I took part in recent gay pride parades in Cork, where 2,000 people marched, and in Dublin, where 22,000 people marched, and I finally got a sense, as a public representative, that we are emerging from those shadows and finally creating a society where people do not have to live in an undergrowth produced by people who for far too long expressed a vision of our society that was never a reality.</P>
        <P>The sexual repression we have experienced in the past 100 or 150 years is not a natural Irish inclination and is as far removed from the Brehon laws as could be.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We are coming to terms with who we are as a people.  In having this debate and passing legislation, we should mark it as a celebration and an expression of pride.  That it is not full equality or perfect is something my party and I acknowledge.  That it needs to address elements such as children and the opinions of the Ombudsman for Children is most important.  The contents of the Bill will bring us forward and I look forward to the day, as Senator Bacik has said, when the first ceremonies will be performed in the country.</P><Col N="164"/>
        <P>I wish to address the question of conscience, as it has been expressed as a retarding effect on whether the legislation should pass.  I acknowledge the presence of Senator Norris and the role he has played.  In the game of social catch-up this country has played and coming to terms with our repressed attitude to sexuality, we have waited far too long and experienced intervals far too wide.  The decriminalisation of homosexuality occurred in the United Kingdom in 1967, but it was 26 years later that such legislation was passed here.  It is almost 25 years since Senator Norris initiated his action in the European Court of Justice that helped to bring about the Irish legislation in 1993.  Such an interval is far too long.</P>
        <P>We can never have an Irish solution to an Irish problem with these issues again.  This was a society where condoms had to be purchased on prescription if a person was married.  How was that ever seen as a stepping stone approach to a modern society?  We have come a long way.    I am concerned that some repressed attitudes remain.  Some of these attitudes were expressed earlier today, while others were expressed in 1993.  We must acknowledge that some of the negative comments made in 1993 are being reversed and that the matters to which they relate have been addressed.  The passage of this legislation will lead to a similar change of mindsets.  The holding of ceremonies marking civil partnerships will create the momentum required to see to it that the full legislation required in this area is brought forward.</P>
        <P>On the subject of conscience, I refer to John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his US presidential campaign of 1960.  During that campaign he was subjected to a high level of criticism from religious fundamentalists about his Catholicism, how this would affect his role in office and how social policy in the United States would, if he were elected, reflect a particular Roman Catholic bias.  During a speech he made in Dallas he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I believe in a president whose religious views are his own private affair ... and whose fulfilment of his presidential oath is not limited or conditioned by any religious oath, ritual or obligation ... Whatever issue may come before me as president &mdash; on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other subject &mdash; I will make my decision in accordance with these views, in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest, and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The term &ldquo;aggressive secularism&rdquo; has been used in the debate on the Bill.  I take the opportunity to out myself as a secularist.  I do not perceive secularism to be in any way aggressive.  To me, it is the essence of tolerance.</P>

        <P>We live in a society in which certain people&rsquo;s rights are not properly recognised within the legal system.  These rights are only partially furthered by the legislation.  When I hear it stated conscience should be the guiding principle with regard to whether people should co-operate with the legislation when it has been passed by the Houses, I do not hear people speaking from conscience, rather I hear them referring to the right to discriminate.</P>

It is an Ireland we need to leave behind.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is left to me to make only one further point which I will place in the context of a quote from Shakespeare&rsquo;s play &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;.  I ask others to bear it in mind when they put us through the engaging debate in which we are going to partake for the remainder of today and tomorrow.  The relevant quotation is, &ldquo;Thus conscience does make cowards of us all.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important and good day for the Seanad and the Oireachtas in general, particularly given the passage of legislation of this nature.  I wish to outline the reasons my party and I are supporting the Bill.  I also wish to examine some of the arguments made to the effect that passage of the Bill is a bad development and that it will in some way harm our society.</P>
        <P>The personal insight which makes me want to support the Bill is that none of us can chose whom we love or the nature of our sexuality.  These are chosen for us by others.  We grow into them, they are not determined by the choices we make.  One does not look at another person and decide that one is attracted to or loves him or her.  It is something that happens; it is something one finds within oneself.  It is something that represents one of the finest dimensions of what it is to be human, care and be a social being.  That is what the Bill is about.</P>
        <P>Legislation is often justified by the use of the language of rights.  I understand why this happens.  At times, however, the language of rights &mdash; perhaps because it is contested &mdash; is cold and unforgiving in nature.  The Bill must be passed because it relates to matters of a softer nature.  It is about the idea that one can love another person and that the State must accord a degree of worth to people&rsquo;s relationships and recognise that equality must be afforded to them.</P>
        <P>I have considered the track record of my party in this matter.  Senator Bacik detailed the work her party has done on it.  Following her contribution, I discussed with her the worth of that work and that fact that it had led to the creation of a consensus which had led us to today.  In 2005 my party published a document &mdash; put together by former Senator Sheila Terry &mdash; in which we argued in favour of the concept of civil partnership and outlined why we were of the view that civil partnership would be an addition to Irish society.</P>
        <P>It is for the reasons I have outlined that I am glad to take the opportunity to acknowledge that at last matters over which we have no control &mdash; namely, our sexuality and the people we decide to love or to whom we decide to be attracted &mdash; are, as Senator Boyle stated, coming out into the open.  These are issues we are now prepared to discuss and which the law is willing to recognise.  There will no longer be a need for tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands of relationships in this country to be conducted in the shadows.  Under the Bill, such relationships will be given recognition by the State.</P>
        <P>I have indicated my views on this matter and stated what I believe love and sexuality to involve.  I am married to a woman and have two children.  In many ways, I am the kind of person who others might say could be threatened by legislation such as that before the House.  There are those who might argue that the Bill somehow threatens the value of my marriage and my family and the foundations on which these are based.  This prompts me to ask how giving somebody the right to be recognised on the death certificate of his or her partner &mdash; this was an example to which the Minister referred &mdash; might lessen the value of that which I possess.  How would granting such a right threaten or subdue that of which I am lucky enough to be a <Col N="166"/>part?  Does it make me love my wife any more or does it make my children love me any more?  How can it do this?</P>
        <P>I am of the view that granting this right does the opposite to that which certain people perceive and, in fact, recognises that my neighbours and friends, the neighbours I do not know and the people whom I do not know and may never meet have feelings and emotions that are equal in worth to mine.  I have no doubt that this legislation will not threaten my family.  Rather, it will add to it because it recognises that there are others who will be accorded the same recognition and sense of worth already accorded to me.  This does not threaten the family, rather it broadens its definition and allows more people access to it, which must be good.  I argue that this is a development we must welcome.</P>
        <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about the concept of conscience and the notion of freedom of conscience.  This leads on to some of the religious themes that have framed the overall debate.  I try to follow my faith and attend church.  However, I am a legislator and a public servant.  In that context, I cannot merely legislate for those who are of the same faith as me.  Neither can I legislate only for those who are of the same sexuality as me.  It is my duty to put in place a framework within which all faiths and all those of differing sexualities can prosper, be secure and exist alongside each other.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>That is what I believe our duty is and what the concept of a republic is all about.  That is why I see the introduction of legislation such as this as being an addition to our republic and a refinement to it.  It is another step in a journey we must continue to make.  The idea that someone who is a public servant trusted with implementing the law would have the ability to choose not to do so shows the lessons we claim to have learned in other parts of our lives about one law being the law and having no choice but to implement it, and about all people being equal in front of the law and those charged with implementing it recognising that, makes me contend that idea has not sunk through.</P>
        <P>A public servant has a duty to serve the public.  If one is legislating for the public one must recognise that public is varied, wide and has many definitions within it.  I fundamentally reject the concept that the Bill represents a threat to conscience and asking someone to implement the law which they are sworn to uphold represents an attack on them.  A Bill such as this moves us a step forward and not a step back.</P>
        <P>Another point I hear made by people who have concerns about the Bill is on the idea of choices and that deciding not to give legal status to brothers or sisters who might be looking after each other or to individuals who might be caring for each other is a reason to reject the Bill.  However, sometimes law making is about making choices and doing one thing today and something else tomorrow.  The fact that tomorrow one will deal with the needs of a separate group of people does not deliver a valid argument for rejecting what is being done today.  The idea that by looking after and recognising the worth of one part of our community and stating that the issues and needs of another part of the community will be dealt with on another day is not a reason for rejecting what is being done today.  Law making, like economics and other decisions we must make in life, is about choices.  It is about deciding that a certain matter will be done today and will be done well.</P>
        <P>Other colleagues have spoken about how this represents a step along the way and there are other issues we need to look at.  I happen to agree with the Government&rsquo;s decision to look at the issues in the Bill and to contend with and manage many of the difficulties on children on another day.  On an issue such as this, building consensus and support to allow people time to reflect on their positions and themselves is the right way to go.  Implementing it and dealing with amendments such as those tabled by my colleague, Senator Regan, does not mean these <Col N="167"/>points should not be made or looked at today.  However, the approach of the Bill is the right choice to make.  We are recognising what we should have recognised a long time ago, that to be human is to be governed by forces over which we have no control, and that is what the Bill is about and why I am glad to see it before the House and glad that my party supports it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I thank him for staying the course with us, as he is with this important legislation.  I am very proud of the Bill and I am very pleased to be associated with it.  I listened to the Minister from my office because I was preparing to speak on it.  I heard him state it is ground-breaking legislation and he thanked the Attorney General and his officials.  I also thank the Attorney General, the Minister and his officials because it is a very carefully framed Bill, of which we as a people can be truly proud.  Those of us from all parties and none who fall under the banner of true republicans can be proud of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister mentioned that our party in its manifesto in 2007 thought it important enough to include our commitment to this Bill if we were to return to Government.  We thought it important to have a legal framework to support the rights of same-sex couples.  I fought and canvassed for my party and my colleagues who ran for the D&aacute;il on the basis of what was in our manifesto.  I subsequently took to the roads and asked my electorate on the basis of what was in the manifesto &mdash; at that stage together with what was in the programme for Government agreed with our partners in government, the Green Party &mdash; to give me a mandate to return to the Seanad and ensure this vital Bill was put through.  I am proud to play my part in that today.</P>
        <P>Once I knew it was to be introduced I wanted to be on the list of speakers because it is ground-breaking.  The Minister will go down in the history of the State as the reforming Minister he is.  I have known the Minister for a long time and I respect his views and his values.  Quite often they conflict with mine but that does not get in the way of a friendship and the good working relationship I enjoy with him.  I was sad to hear an Independent Senator having a little go at him.  He used a horrible phrase; he said the Minister was &ldquo;got at&rdquo;.  I shouted at the radio, as I do quite often when I am on my own&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>The Minister will go down in history and history will be very kind to him.  Future generations will look back at today&rsquo;s debate as we have looked back at the debate on the Health (Family Planning)(Amendment) Act in 1985 when Des O&rsquo;Malley, the father of the Senator sitting beside me, lost the whip in my party for voting against the party.  When my children ask me what type of a country we lived in then, I wonder the same thing.  However, we accepted it and we got on with it.  In the same way, in 1993 the then Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, went down in history for all the right reasons for decriminalising homosexuality.  We also had the divorce referendum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year, during the discussions on the Lisbon treaty referendum, the waters were muddied with statements that the sky would fall in and hell would freeze over before any of it would go through and that abortion would be introduced through the back door.  It frightens me to think there are people who would introduce red herrings such as these to keep good legislation, as we have today, out of the State.  It also hurts and frightens me to hear someone stand in the Chamber I share and talk about children of a family with two parents doing far better than in any other arrangement.  It hurts me because through no fault of my own I have reared my family on my own.  The thought entered my head that equality is great and everyone is equal but that some are more equal than others.  Shame on the mind that can stand and say that.  I <Col N="168"/>almost feel bad for saying it because I respect the views of others and the views echoed here today that differ from mine have a right to be heard and I respect that right.  However, I feel slighted because I worked very hard for the past 12 years rearing children, like thousands of other people, whether they are widowed, like me, or separated.  Nevertheless, because we do not fit into the norm of a family as seen by other people, we are told our children do not do so as well.  I am proud of my four children whom I have reared according to the motto, &ldquo;Live and let live&rdquo;.  In values they have been reared in the Catholic Church.  They are not all churchgoers and I, too, am hit and miss when it comes to the church.  However, I am a believer.  I believe in God and have a faith.  In recent days I have been told by people who oppose the Bill that I will have to meet my God on judgment day, to which I have responded that I will, and I hope God will look at me for the kind of work I am doing.  I do not say I am right on everything.  I hold my hands up; I am rarely right.  However, regarding this Bill I know I am fundamentally right and as a republican I know I am doing the right thing for society.</P>
        <P>If there is one thing I should say it is that I am glad the Bill is with us today.  My maiden speech in the House eight years ago was on a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill introduced by Senator Norris.  I was a nervous speaker in those days and probably still am a little nervous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>A good speaker, however.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I stood up and got a right earful and lashing from people around me.  I believe if one has it in one&rsquo;s heart, one should let it come out.  This matter is in my heart and I am glad we are here today putting through this legislation.</P>
        <P>No one has a monopoly on everything.  I look forward to the debate and to hearing views opposing mine.  I shall make one point on the conscience clause.  I always hope I would be big enough, if one of my four children came home and said, &ldquo;Mum, I am gay&rdquo;, that I would embrace them with the same love with which I embrace them every day.  My biggest fear would be that they would have to live in a society such as Ireland as been until today.  My fear would be for their safety, well-being and education &mdash; everything we, as Irish people, value &mdash; because they would not be accepted.</P>
        <P>I was very taken by what Senator Donohoe said.  We cannot choose the people we love.  He is entirely right about that and put the point across very eloquently.  It made me think that neither can we choose how we are born or who we are.  We have no control over our sexuality.  There has always been a debate in this regard; is it nature or nurture?  Some people will say it is a little of both.  I do not believe that; I believe it is nature.  I heard Senator Norris&rsquo;s contribution and would say, shame on us as a society if, when a person is not born as the norm, we turn our back on that person.</P>
        <P>I am glad today has come and am very glad I am a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and can play my part in saying today is a watershed in the lives of gay and cohabiting people.  Doing so, I apologise that society did not recognise the rights of gay people until now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No one has a monopoly of conscience or deeply held beliefs.  I and many of my colleagues have deeply held beliefs.  I firmly believe, for example, that a family which does not conform to a traditional father-mother-two children model is no less deserving of protection.  Love, fidelity and caring are what bind a family together.  These are the marks of a family, not whatever model to which the State decides it should conform.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  If this legislation had been drafted in a different way, it would have been excellent and would have attracted near universal <Col N="169"/>support.  Unfortunately, as drafted, the Bill merely masquerades as a piece of ground-breaking, compassionate, equality legislation.  The reality is that in parts the Bill is cruel and discriminatory, not something of which to be proud.  It elevates one group of people, who have a legitimate claim to certain rights, duties and protections and whose loving relationships deserve to be acknowledged and respected by all, over other categories of similarly deserving people in caring and dependent relationships.  This may be permitted by the letter of our constitutional law but it is at huge variance with the spirit.  It is done in the name of equality but this is a rather hollow claim when one examines the true meaning of equality under the Constitution.  There is no true respect for equality in the way, for example, in which this Bill will infringe on people&rsquo;s freedom of conscience.  There is no equality under this Bill for the conscientious objector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note, too, the title of the Minister&rsquo;s speech which referred, still, to the civil partnership Bill.  Does this mean it was a cut and paste job?  He mentioned that the forum was here, in this Chamber.  He is welcome to this forum which, he stated was the place to engage with people rather than in the media.  The fact remains this is a somewhat privileged forum.  The Minister is in some way protected from what we might call the close-ground hurling and man marking under which some of his arguments might have withered.  He would not meet people.</P>
        <P>On the matter of the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network receiving funding, while I acknowledge Senator Norris&rsquo;s correction that the funding for a particular booklet came from another source, the fact remains that a great amount of money from the Government has gone to GLEN.  I have no problem with that <i>per se</i> but by refusing to meet other people who have legitimate concerns, the Minister was allowed to get away with glib rhetorical responses to people&rsquo;s concerns in the D&aacute;il, responses that did not address the careful nuances in the argument people made around conscience.  That is greatly to be regretted.  In recent months as we debated this Bill what we have heard are stock rhetorical responses.  There has been no serious willingness to engage, which says a lot.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister spoke of  the ignorance and homophobia which gay people and their families have lived with down through the years.  Sadly, this Bill will not change that but will add further injustice.  I would like to think I, too, am the enemy of ignorance and homophobia.  For example, I am on the board of trustees of approximately 112 secondary schools and wish to do my utmost to ensure those schools are cold houses for anyone who would target or humiliate a person on grounds of any kind, including perceptions around sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke of State recognition of civil partnership between such persons so that they can live in a supportive and secure legal environment.  I support such an environment for people, whether same-sex partners or others.  The Minister said we all deserve equal treatment before the law and as we go about our daily lives.  I, too, agree with that.  What does equality mean, however, in regard to the specific issue of public recognition for certain relationships other than marriage?  We have not had a real, thoroughgoing debate about that.</P>
        <P>My view, which I do not believe to be bigoted, is that the right to marry is the right to form a stable, publicly supported union with a person of the opposite sex.  The reason we traditionally distinguish in favour of such unions is because they provide the socially supported context for the upbringing of children.  That is our constitutional position but also, I believe, the position borne out by the analysis of what works best for children most of the time.  Advocates for same-sex marriage and this Bill have no problem distinguishing between couples on the basis of whether they have a sexual, intimate or committed relationship.  If they are capable of that distinction, why do they reject my right and the right of others to make another distinction, namely, to distinguish between relationships on the basis of whether they provide that socially preferred context for the upbringing of children?  That is the key to the difference of opinion about this legislation, but the Government has been somewhat silent on this.  We hear many <Col N="170"/>references to what cannot be done because of constitutional requirements but hear no real understanding of, for example, what social science data have to say about what works for children nor have we heard of any thoroughgoing analysis of what children&rsquo;s best interests would demand.</P>
        <P>The Government talks about the need to validate and protect explicitly the relationships of thousands of couples whose mutual commitment has been invisible.  There should be freedom to have a private life, to be free from humiliation and mockery, and to be free to confer rights and benefits on other people.  What exactly &ldquo;validation&rdquo; means will be a matter for legitimate debate.  At a time when in many quarters in our society there is an acknowledgement of the need to support and encourage people into the institution of marriage, most people, if one were to ask them, would give huge marks, for example, to the courage and dedication of lone parents but very few people would say there is no difference, all things being equal, in the outcomes for children.  Most people who are attentive in a sincere way to the needs of children would say there are certain models we should promote.  The model in which I believe is one where a child, as far as possible, has the right to the care and support of his or her two biological parents.  That is not always possible, sadly, owing to life circumstances, but are we going to shed it even as an aspiration?  The willingness to shed that as an aspiration underlines the comments of many people who have supported this Bill.</P>
        <P>The are good provisions in the Bill, which must be acknowledged, including the accessing of State benefits, for example, carer&rsquo;s allowance to care for a seriously ill partner, and addressing the problem of the recording of a deceased partner on a death certificate as single.  I have no problem with measures to cater for those kinds of situations.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the Minister spoke of constitutional balance.  He spoke about the need to balance the entitlement to equality under Article 40.1 &mdash; which in reference to equality also refers, let it be noted, to the need to acknowledge differences in capacity and function &mdash; with the special protection Article 41 gives to marriage.  We could ask questions about the Bill in regard to marriage, for example, whether the provisions on maintenance and property adjustment orders, rights of redress and so on could in some circumstances fetter the rights of a future spouse of someone who is currently a civil partner.</P>
        <P>There is another balance that the Minister has completely failed to take into account and this why the conscience issue is so important.  It is the need to balance the State&rsquo;s ability to provide for a model of civil partnership and its need to require that its officials enable it to carry out that new legal responsibility with, on the other hand, a recognition that on this issue there are sincere and divergent views in our society.  This issue is not the new slavery.  Many people who have been very strong over the years in advocating for rights, whether of immigrant people or members of the Traveller community, have what some people in this House would call a conservative view on traditional sexual morality.  It seems that Senator Boyle would refer to it as a continuing immaturity in regard to sexuality.  I regret those comments because whereas I support the removal of stigma in general terms, I believe there are truths and disagreements about what is true when it comes to discussing what works best for people.  There are divergent moral views in the areas of sexuality and to what relationships the State should give public recognition and privileges.  Does Senator Boyle believe that classic Christian teaching on sexuality is a sign of immaturity?  In his comments there is a reaction against the narrowness and meanness of the past when people were humiliated, mocked, derided, treated as different and their lives were made miserable as a result.  However, one is going to the other extreme if one insists that people who have what one might call a traditional, conservative view on what relationships should get State support and particular recognition, leaving aside the issue of sexuality, also have a view that is what we might call officially discouraged and that they might <Col N="171"/>face the might and the rigour of law in certain circumstances.  That is more redolent of Communist Russia where religion was officially discouraged.  The balance that the Minister has missed out on here is that he has forgotten, or chosen to ignore, the protections specifically given to freedom of conscience in our Constitution and to the rights of churches, among other groups, to organise and manage their own affairs.</P>
        <P>On the John F. Kennedy issue, there needs to be a very careful discussion about the interconnection between faith and politics.  My belief is different from Senator Boyle&rsquo;s.  I believe that everyone has the right and the duty to bring their understanding of reality to the ballot box and into their job as legislators.  However, as a legislator, I may start from a point of view, I may try, as Senator Donohoe said, to be Christian in my life and try to live out my faith, but when I make an argument on public policy, I make an argument that can also be shared by people who do not share my religious views or who, perhaps, do not have any religious views.  When debating the issue of abortion, for example, it would be wrong to categorise those who have a conservative position as coming from a religious perspective which means, therefore, we do not need to engage with their argument.  What nonsense, what intolerance and what anti-intellectual rubbish.</P>
        <P>The same principle applies to the issues in this debate.  If I make a point that the State ought to support the institution of marriage, I believe the social data on marriage supports the notion that marriage is what works best for children and I can point to it supporting that notion.  If I further believe it is unjust to give particular privileges to couples on the basis of a sexual, intimate relationship other than a more general caring, dependent relationship, that certain religious people whose concerns I may not personally share feel that in conscience they want to go the other way, for example, that they would rather not rent a facility, and that those people should be catered for in a pluralistic society, that is not coming from a religious inspiration and it should not be categorised as some old fashioned, narrow kind of bigotry.  What I am proposing is something much healthier than what the Minister is proposing or what the Green Party is supporting, which is a form of moral coercion.  The Government has gone from the old extreme of the past, where people were morally coerced into one kind of lifestyle, to a new extreme whereby, in future, if people who differ in conscience &mdash; the most respectable and law-abiding people who are members of the families of the parties in government &mdash; dare to signal a conscientious objection to civil partnership because they have a particular view about the importance of marriage in society, the Government will impose the full rigours of the law on them.  I can only say shame on it for contemplating such an approach.  The same goes for an individual or an institution which has a property which, were it to rent it out in certain situations, might feel in all conscience it would be violating its ethos.</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister of section 37 of the Employment Equality Act.  Our equality legislation is full of legitimate exemptions to deal with different types of situations related to age, height in some cases, and gender in some cases, such as where one was hiring a person to look after one&rsquo;s mother and give her intimate care.  There are many exceptions in equality legislation.  Surely it is possible to recognise that we live in a society where there are divergent moral views.  Can the majority here not be tolerant enough to recognise that and say it does not impinge on the implementation of the civil partnership legislation if we allow such people to courteously and constructively disengage?  Section 37 of the Employment Equality Act allows religious-run institutions to make necessary decisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I doubt if it would pass today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that the Supreme Court said that this legislation might not be constitutional if there were not such an exemption.  If that is true in regard to employment matters, given the implications for employment for people who might have com<Col N="172"/>plained about that legislation, surely it applies <i>a fortiori</i> that when all one is doing is withdrawing from the provision of a particular service in circumstances where people may go elsewhere for the service, there is even less of an incursion into people&rsquo;s rights.  It should be possible to provide for legitimate differences here and I suspect the Minister is acting unconstitutionally in failing to take account of that argument.</P>
        <P>To return to the core values that underlie this legislation, an issue we must address is the equal dignity of all people.  All people are equal in dignity.  It cannot ever be denied and it ought not be denied.  This is not an argument between people who think that homosexuality is sinful and people who think it is okay.  It wrong to characterise the argument as being based on such polar oppositions.  Many people have very strong support for people&rsquo;s right to a private life, for their right to their values and for their right to love whom they want, but they also support the right of society to make certain values known, to support certain ideas around family and so on.  On Committee Stage I will look in more detail at the some of the evidence which supports the point of view that there is a case to be made for distinguishing in a particular way and giving particular privileges to marriage over and above all comers, regardless of their sexuality or other considerations.</P>
        <P>I have heard good speeches from both sides of the House.  I compliment Senator Walsh, in particular, on taking a stand, which is not easy to do, against his friends and party.  Our democracy is the poorer for the fact that the many in Fine Gael who had concerns about the Bill were not allowed to table amendments in the D&aacute;il.  Our democracy is poorer for the fact that the Bill was passed in the D&aacute;il without a vote.  It is very easy to pretend, when everybody is in agreement, that we have reached a new nirvana of tolerance, rather people have chosen to hide their intolerance behind the party Whip.  A lot of people in our society who are not bigots and respect the private lives of others do not agree with the parties which were not willing to celebrate diversity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  This is ground-breaking legislation and I feel very proud to be standing in Seanad &Eacute;ireann as a Senator.  It was interesting to listen to the previous speaker.  Because of what he said, I would like to explore the issue of tolerance.  As we are on Second Stage, we can explore some of the issues issues rather than the specifics of the Bill.  I do not see where the issue of conscience arises on the Bill and would like to use the word &ldquo;principle&rdquo;.  This is a matter of principle, rather than conscience.  People have values.  We are here as the representatives of all the people, not of any narrow group, and we have to represent the people to the best of our ability.  Tolerance, therefore, is very important.  As Senator Mullen said, it is crucial that we accept that there are divergent views.  I also accept that it is important that we have a vote on the Bill and it will be good to do so.  I hope and expect there will be an overwhelming majority in favour of it, as we have moved on.</P>
        <P>My mother is English and came to Ireland from London in the 1960s.  She moved to Thurles, where I was born and which was a very interesting place.  The first place she lived in was Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s hotel.  She told me she was the first woman in Thurles to wear trousers, which was extraordinary, and that ladies dressed in shawls spat at her.  Ireland was very different then.  It was a society which was not tolerant of change in the way it is today.</P>
        <P>What does that have to do with the issue of civil partnerships?  Our society has changed enormously during the years.  If one considers the figures, one will find that in 1996 there were 150 registered same-sex couples.  In 2006 there were more than 2,090.  Does that tell one there has been a huge increase in the number interested in being part of a same-sex couple?  I do not believe that is what it tells us, rather it tells us that our society has changed and that people are now more comfortable in admitting they are gay.  I hope we will see a lot more people <Col N="173"/>admitting they are gay because one does not have to be in the closet.  I hope it is something people will say with pride and honour and without fear that they will be abused by others or have to deal with some other issue.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to the point of principle rather than conscience.  Legislation concerns the law, not matters of conscience.  Conscience falls within the realm of spirituality, religion and feelings.  This is not a matter of conscience.  We are dealing with civil partnerships, not religious ceremonies.  It is simply a matter of principle.  I respect the right of people to have principles which are not the same as mine, those of my political party or the majority.  We have to be tolerant.</P>
        <P>I have spoken to members of an older generation who have said they can accept civil partnership but not gay marriage.  That is the current position.  According to Lansdowne Market Research, some 51% &mdash; a very narrow majority &mdash; would accept gay marriage, whereas 84% are prepared to accept civil partnership.  It is clear, therefore, that the majority are prepared to accept the Bill.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Boyle, I give credit to the House.  In 2004 Senator Norris introduced the Civil Partnership Bill.  I also give credit to the Labour Party.  Senator Bacik made an impassioned speech and has done a lot of work on this issue.  In 2006 the Labour Party introduced the Civil Unions Bill which was groundbreaking legislation and laid the basis for the Bill which I hope we will pass today.</P>
        <P>This is a complex Bill which I understand refers to 130 pieces of legislation.  For the first time we are recognising something other than marriage in the context of equality.  For those who believe the Bill does not go far enough, it needs to be recognised how far it goes.  It is groundbreaking legislation.  I feel great pride as an Irishman in being able to support it.</P>
        <P>An Irish rock star in the 1980s had a song called, &ldquo;Love and Pride&rdquo; &mdash; I understand he was called King.  I will not sing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Was he called Queen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was not Queen but King.  &ldquo;Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;pride&rdquo; are the words I have heard more than any other.  &ldquo;Pride&rdquo; is a word associated with the gay community.  &ldquo;Love&rdquo; is also a very important word but is not something which can be legislated for, as previous speakers said.  We are recognising people&rsquo;s right to feel love for each other and to find a way at last of enjoying a legal partnership.  It is a legal, not a religious or spiritual partnership.  Whatever happens, I hope all Senators will come to recognise that this is a very important Bill which we will accept and move on.  I have examined it and the dissolution of a civil partnership and divorce are not the same.  There is a difference between civil partnership and marriage; they are not the same in the terms of the rights given.  As Senator Boyle said, this Bill is a stepping stone.  I would like to see us move towards a situation where society will move towards recognising gay marriage.  That will be a matter for the people to decide, not the Seanad.  When they are ready to decide, they will do so.</P>
        <P>With love and pride I stand here as a proud Irishman and commend the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House.  I look forward to the outcome of the votes later.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I know of many people of my generation and older who never thought this day would come because until the mid-1990s when we saw the legalisation of homosexuality in Ireland, there were many citizens living in the shadow <Col N="174"/>lands of Irish life.  Today they will feel proud of their Parliament and country in introducing this Bill.  As Senator Bacik said, we would like to see it go further, in dealing with the needs of children in particular, but we will support its passage, with the intention of reviewing it when we next enter government.  We view this Bill as a stepping stone on the way to full equality for gay citizens.  Same sex couples are becoming more common in Ireland.  The 1996 census recorded only 150 same sex couples but this figure rose to 1,500 in 2002 and 2,000 in 2006.</P>
        <P>However, the law has not kept up with the pace of change and these relationships have no legal recognition at present.  We have been happy to lead the world in other areas such as the plastic bag levy but, as Senator Boyle has noted, we have been slower to move in the areas related to sex.  This can be seen in our laws on contraception, divorce and homosexuality.  The ban on homosexuality was only removed 17 years ago thanks to Senator Norris and others.  On most matters pertaining to sexual relationships this country has been relatively slow in making progress.  Spain, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden have passed legislation to allow gay marriage.  Four out of five of these introduced civil unions initially and then progressed to full civil marriage after a number of years.  Denmark, Finland, Germany, the UK and Slovenia have passed civil partnership laws.  At this stage, therefore, almost half of our European neighbours have passed laws allowing civil partnership at least.</P>
        <P>My party introduced our own civil unions Bill to offer same sex couples the greatest measure of equality possible under our Constitution.  It would have afforded same sex couples access to a relationship which is similar to marriage in every practical way, including the right to adopt a child.  As I accept that the Labour Party Bill will not proceed while we remain in Opposition, I welcome the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009.  It addresses issues relating to inheritance rights, power of attorney and next of kin.  I note the Minister has stated that he will deal with other matters such as tax and social welfare issues in future Finance Bills.  I accept the Government&rsquo;s commitment on this but I will be watching closely to ensure it delivers.  I am disappointed, however, that the Bill does not address the issue of children.  We will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage with a view to improving the legislation.  I hope the Minister will accept at least some of these amendments but, if not, it is our intention to update the legislation to give effect to these amendments when we next enter Government.</P>
        <P>I recognise there is still an element of opposition to any legislation in this area.  It is clear from walking through the gates of Leinster House today and reading some of the e-mails that my colleagues and I have received, that a number of people are uncomfortable with this legislation.  Many of these are good, fair minded people and I recognise that their concerns are heartfelt.  Some are uncomfortable because they find the whole issue of homosexuality objectionable, based on their own moral or religious standpoints.  However, they also accept that Ireland grants certain rights to its citizens.  It has to be said to those concerned citizens that while this legislation may be unpalatable to them they should consider it as a price worth paying for the protection and continuance of their own rights and privileges.</P>
        <P>Others are uncomfortable because they see this as in some way undermining the institution of the family.  I ask these people to think again about their concerns because, on the contrary, it strengthens that institution.  It will allow many couples who are currently unable to make a public record of their relationship to show their love, support and commitment to one another.</P>
        <P>There have been calls for a freedom of conscience clause.  My view is that a public servant is tasked with implementing the law of the land.  It is no different if a registrar is asked to preside over an interracial or interdenominational union.</P><Col N="175"/>
        <P>There is strong evidence to suggest that civil partnerships benefit society.  A regulatory impact assessment in the UK prior to the introduction of legislation there suggested that such partnerships will help the economy because it can be expected that civil partners will share their resources and support each other financially, thereby reducing the demand for support from the State.  A study in Denmark found that the introduction of civil partnerships led to significant benefits to society, including a reduction in the suicide rate.</P>
        <P>As someone who keeps an ear to the ground and speaks to people on their doorsteps on a regular basis, I am convinced that the vast majority of Irish citizens have a live-and-let-live attitude to this issue.  I do not believe they have any interest in denying same-sex couples the right to take care of a sick loved one, inherit the family home or commit to each other for better or for worse.  Legislating for same sex couples is the right thing to do and it will bring us into line with our neighbours.  It will not lead to the end of civilisation.  It will bring benefits to society and, most importantly, it will provide security and fairness to a small section of our society who are currently not protected by law.  I will be voting to support this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of this hugely important and momentous legislation.  As my colleagues, Senators Hannigan and Bacik, have indicated, the Labour Party enthusiastically supports the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations for Cohabitants Bill 2009.  We will try to amend it in some areas and, while we can to some extent predict the Minister&rsquo;s response to our proposals, we will push them as strongly as we can.  We hope to expand on the vital work done on this Bill with further legislation when the Labour Party is in Government.</P>
        <P>I think this is the first time since I entered the Oireachtas three years ago that I have commended the Government on any issue but I am happy to congratulate it on bringing this legislation before the Houses.  I also acknowledge the heavy lifting that was required from the Green Party in order to bring the matter to its present status.</P>
        <P>When we discuss this Bill in more detail on Committee Stage, we should not forget that we are trying to improve the lives of individual citizens.  We should, therefore, also congratulate the thousands of campaigners who have fought for this legislation.  None of this would happened without people who were prepared to go to meetings, spend time on campaigns and work out how incremental change could be achieved.  Perhaps some felt they were compromising themselves while others wanted to progress their goals without being seen as incrementalists but they made the same intelligent political decision as so many other figures in history by accepting this Bill as legislation that could be achieved and leaving for another day the fight to build something better.  For that reason, I am delighted to be a Member of this House as this Bill comes before us.</P>
        <P>I wish to respond briefly to the conceptual issues raised by Senator Mullen.  He stated the legislation might find favour across the House if it had been drafted in a different way but he did not tell us what changes were required to meet his approval.  It is not enough to say he could have supported the legislation if it was drafted in a different way.  Perhaps if it was never introduced people would have felt comfortable.  I have much more respect for people who say they do not agree with or believe in the legislation because they think it is wrong.  I have no difficulty with people saying in Parliament that we should not have it or we should vote against it but what does it mean to say it should be drafted in a different way?</P>
        <P>The legislation is not discriminatory.  In regard to the so-called conscience clause, I have never come across such a contrivance masquerading as a basis for opposing legislation.</P>

	<P>It is a complete fabrication.  The opponents of this legislation are creating a class of people that they posit will have a difficulty.  There is no evidence that such a difficulty would ever be felt by people or has been expressed.  It has been wholly contrived and fabricated to try to create a basis for objection to the legislation on equality grounds.  Examples have been given, including by the Minister in the Other House, to which we will return later.  It is simply inconceivable, however, that if someone is appointed to be a judge, for example, of the Circuit Court which administers the divorce legislation, he or she would refuse to make an order for divorce in circumstances in which he or she has a difficulty or objection to it on a personal basis or as a matter of conscience.  It is not conceivable that the Houses of the Oireachtas would pass legislation providing for a so-called freedom of conscience clause.  The torturous way in which this matter has been imported into the debate is dishonest.  Opponents of the legislation should come to the House and argue against the Bill.  The notion that freedom of conscience is a factor in this matter is utterly implausible.</P>
        <P>I struggle with the issue of people objecting to this Bill because their argument is dressed up as if they are being excluded from the debate.  Senator Mullen, for example, states he has a right to make a distinction between what is proposed and what he regards as being the traditional and most desirable form of marriage.  He has a right to hold this point of view, campaign and argue for it, urge the education system to promote it to a greater extent or raise the issue in the House as often as he wishes.  I do not seek to demean the point the Senator makes.  For two years, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, in which the Minister was involved, debated this issue.  The wording of the proposed constitutional amendment produced by the joint committee, which I do not have before me, makes clear that children are best cared for in a loving relationship in the family in which they are brought up.</P>
        <P>Nobody is arguing that Senator Mullen cannot maintain his view as to what constitutes a desirable and satisfactory form of marriage.  Who has argued otherwise?  The Senator argues that we are shedding this as an aspiration.  How is this done in the legislation?  I genuinely cannot understand his argument given that he can continue to maintain, promote and campaign for his view and aspiration?  In what respect is the Senator excluded?  He and others who share his view are able to maintain their view.  The task of legislators is to make laws.  In the case of this legislation, our task is to make a law that is not directed towards a particular philosophical or traditional view of marriage but to legislate for all those in relationships and none.  It is not our role to promote a particular religious or moral standpoint.</P>
        <P>There is no difficulty in us continuing to have divergent views.  I object to the suggestion that because people find themselves in a minority on an issue, they are somehow being subjected to what is being described as &ldquo;aggressive secularism&rdquo;.  I fail to understand precisely what this notion means given that Members are freely and openly legislating and are prepared to debate with Senator Mullen and others any changes they wish to propose.  No one is excluding debate or arguing that people cannot hold certain views.  A disingenuous attempt is being made to try to portray those who oppose the legislation as being shut out of public debate or precluded from advocating certain views.  They have every entitlement to do so.</P>
        <P>This is a great and bright day in what is a relatively dark period for the country in many other respects.  The Bill is a major step forward and a great tribute to all of those who have been involved in it.  As a citizen, a legislator and the brother of a gay man, I am thrilled to be in the House for this debate.</P>

	<P>One of the benefits of speaking later in a debate is that one has an opportunity to listen to the views of earlier speakers.  I hope to give Senator Alex White reasons some of us oppose sections of the Bill and have proposed amendments thereto.  When one listens to other speakers one also hears inaccuracies.  I know certain of the Senators present <Col N="177"/>are pushing strongly for gay marriage in the belief that this is an area in which we can reach a certain type of enlightenment if we follow the European and American route.  I have news for the Senators in question.  We have seen the future and it is as follows.  Last week, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that gay marriage is not a human right.  Moreover, California, which is associated with Hollywood, flower power and Arnold Schwarzenegger, recently voted against gay marriage.  That is the future.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to my home town of Thurles.  I raise this issue because Thurles was made to appear like Birmingham, Alabama, or Little Rock, Arkansas.  I assure the House that it is a fine town of good, decent and tolerant people who would offer assistance if asked to do so.  I do not like my home town being presented as if it was a bigoted place.</P>
        <P>We also heard the words of President John F. Kennedy being misquoted.  The words cited were used out of context.  In the 1960s, President Kennedy made a speech in Dallas in which he referred to the politics of the time.  His sister, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, has repeatedly made clear, without contradiction by any other member of the Kennedy family, that John F. Kennedy was pro-life.  There is a limit to the distance some people are prepared to go in separating their sincerely held religious beliefs from their civic duty.</P>
        <P>Those who regard opponents of the Bill as negative are wrong.  Truly inclusive civil partnership would include all couples in caring dependent relationships, including same sex couples, cohabiting couples and individuals in caring relationships which are non-sexual, and give such persons rights that would protect them against economic vulnerability in the event of a break-up.  A group of Senators will propose an amendment to this effect.</P>
        <P>The rights to which the amendment refers should include property settlement and maintenance rights, succession rights and next-of-kin rights, while other existing rights should remain unique because marriage is uniquely pro-child.  It does not discriminate to treat a unique institution such as the marriage of a man and woman in a unique manner.</P>
        <P>It is proposed in the Bill that the words &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; be removed from other Acts such as the Pension Act 1990, Employment Equality Act 1998, Equal Status Act 2000 and Civil Registration Act 2004 and replaced with the words &ldquo;civil status&rdquo;.  This strongly implies that there is a direct equivalence between marriage and civil partnership and tends to undercut the argument of those who state they are different.  We will recommend on Committee Stage that the Bill be amended to read &ldquo;marital status and civil partnership status&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We also fundamentally believe that a constitutional challenge may be taken to the legislation on the basis of equality.  There is no doubt that the Bill should provide protection for religious organisations and individuals who conscientiously object to facilitating events and services where such conflict with their religious ethos.  We will recommend that the Government accepts the conscience clause proposed by two Church of Ireland bishops.  It is worded in such a way that the unintended consequences feared by some cannot occur.</P>
        <P>What do I mean by the words &ldquo;unintended consequences&rdquo;?  This morning, I walked through the grounds of Christ Church, a beautiful Presbyterian church on Rathgar Road.  I was taught how one should dance properly in a hall located under the roof of the church.  It would be unfair to ask to hold a civil ceremony breakfast or celebration in this hall, located as it is within church grounds, if the church authorities are unwilling to do so.</P>
      
        <P>It would be unfair to ask if those people did not wish to have, what should we call it, the civil ceremony breakfast or celebration in that hall within church grounds.  This was catered for previously in 1997 when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of section 37 of the Employment Equality Act.  This section exempts religious employers from aspects of employment equality legislation and in so doing allows them to protect their ethos.  In other words they do not need to employ people who would undermine their ethos.  In arguing in favour of <Col N="178"/>the constitutionality of section 37, counsel for the Attorney General argued that the Employment Equality Act had to contain section 37 in order to give effect to Article 44.2.1&deg; of the Constitution, which states: &ldquo;Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.&rdquo;  If section 37 was necessary to ensure the constitutionality of the Employment Equality Act, then logically a similar section should be added to the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill in order to protect freedom of religion and conscience as required by Article 44.2.1&deg;.  The absence of such a section surely calls into question the constitutionality of the Bill.  There is an alternative and where there is an alternative, it is grossly unfair to put a church, and those responsible for the church building and ethos, into such a position.</P>
        <P>There is a difficulty with the inheritance provision which appears to be anti-family.  The children of a deceased civil partner could be seriously disinherited if the partner dies intestate.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">We do not have a schedule of financial costs involved in the Bill.  It is unusual not to have a breakdown of the costs to the Exchequer over the ensuing years.  If that could be arranged, it would be helpful.  With that in mind, I wish to mention one further speaker who quoted Hamlet: &ldquo;Thus doth conscience doth make cowards of us all&rdquo;, implying that those who vote according to their conscience are cowards.  I wish to deal with that in the context of the three people in Fianna F&aacute;il because that is the specific reference.  I come from a family that has for generations supported the republican ethos.  I know there was a man in Clare who was asked how long he had supported Fianna F&aacute;il.  His answer was &ldquo;98&rdquo;.  He was asked if that meant 1998 and he said &ldquo;No, 1798&rdquo;.  He believed he had supported Fianna F&aacute;il from the start of the republican movement in 1798.  Thankfully I can trace a direct line back to that time, through the Fenians and the War of Independence.  There were two active service members, my grandfather and grandmother, founder members of Fianna F&aacute;il.  If somebody thinks it is easy or that it is cowardly to give up the whip in a party in which I solemnly believe and sincerely believe what it is about, then surely they are mistaken.  It is a most difficult thing to do when the repercussions of losing the party whip are ending up outside the parliamentary party.  For some of us that is like being outside the door of the family home.  Senators should not feel for a moment that acting on one&rsquo;s conscience is the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This is not an easy day to stand up and speak when one hears such differing views across the floor.  However, it is an important day for Ireland and represents a coming of age for our nation.  If one likes it is Ireland growing up and maturing?  That has to be difficult in light of what the previous speaker said.</P>
        <P>I am happy to support the legislation.  I would like to outline how I view this in my life and in the people I meet every day.  It is important for me to make judgments that do not necessarily influence me directly, but as a legislator I have a responsibility to be good for those who have been and are still marginalised.  I am a heterosexual female married in a traditional family unit. <Col N="179"/> I do not feel the Bill threatens my personal status as a married person or threatens the state of marriage.  I was gobsmacked to hear David Quinn from the Iona Institute speak on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; about how threatened he felt marriage was by this Bill.  He said marriage needed a good PR job just as we have healthy living programmes and advertisement campaigns on television.  Why does he feel so threatened?  Why is he so unconfident?  I have complete confidence in marriage and that marriage will continue to be very popular.</P>
        <P>I have not had a difficulty growing up or living in Ireland.  I have been fortunate because I was part of the mainstream because I was heterosexual.  However, what about those who are not from that mainstream group and are one of the approximate 10% of people who now say they are not straight and are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender?  That is a large number of people potentially without basic rights who have from my knowledge of them in some cases suffered personal torture prior to coming out and also after coming out.  The Bill delivers basic civil rights, as I believe I heard the Minister describe it.  It provides for property rights under the Residential Tenancies Act, succession rights, wrongful death action rights under the Civil Liability Act, power of attorney rights and personal safety rights under the Domestic Violence Act.  The Bill makes 130 amendments to existing legislation and from that point of view this is ground-breaking legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us consider whom this legislation helps and some of their personal stories.  With a research partner in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College in Drumcondra, I recently completed research on early school leaving.  One of the groups we interviewed were lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pupils at second level and post second level.  There were people who dropped out of school because they were excluded as a result of their sexuality.  This is happening today in Ireland.  Young people continue to suffer exclusion, bullying and homophobia.  Their early drop-out rate was not for traditional reasons.  It was not necessarily because of poverty, poor home support, literacy difficulties or other learning difficulties.  It was because they were not understood or accepted because of their sexuality.  This is about real social exclusion in school, class groups and society today.  The Bill will go a long way towards normalising their sexual identity.</P>
        <P>I also had a very humanising experience when I interviewed a fine 19 year old young man who was gay.  He told me that he grew to know he was different in his sexuality at the age of 12 or 13.  He said that he suffered total horror in changing rooms prior to PE class, which is a common occurrence for boys coming to terms with their emerging homosexuality and becoming aware that they are different.  I found that a very important learning experience about the very basic need in our schools.  We even provide for separate dressing rooms for people according to their sexuality.  He had to drop out of school because of the pressure he was under as a young homosexual man.  What struck me was his humanity.</P>
        <P>I am the mother of two children.  If I was the mother of a young gay son, would I not want the rights accorded in the Bill to apply to him?  Yes, I would.  A family friend recently told me that her son had just come out at the age of 17 and a half.  It was at a difficult time during the leaving certificate mock exams and a very difficult adjustment for the family to make and the consequences were layered.  There are still problems and we are talking about so many technicalities in law.  Let us talk about the human reality in Ireland today.  Before this boy had the courage to tell his parents, he had panic attacks which were not due to the exams, as his parents thought, but the fact that he could no longer hide the fact that he was gay.  His parents had many fears such as that he might be beaten up or promiscuous.  Over the course of the last three months they have worked through a lot as a family and still have a long way to go.  This is all the more reason we need to help families and young people who are gay, lesbian or bisexual to be what I call normalised. It is time to live and let live.  We bury our heads in the sand and risk an increase in mental health problems and suicides if we do not recognise orien<Col N="180"/>tation or same-sex unions.  GLEN does an enormous amount of work and has evidence to support these assertions.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a milestone and a watershed in our evolution as a nation, as a people coming to terms with our multiple identities and orientations, when we begin to legislate for the challenges facing us, take responsibility and deal with our own problems and promote tolerance and inclusivity.  We should not look to export our problems, as we so often did in the past.  How many gay people do we know who decided to emigrate to places such as San Francisco just to be able to live a normal life as a gay person?</P>
        <P>There are shortcomings in the Bill.  There is a glaring omission in dealing with the needs of children, a source of major concern.  We have an obligation to ensure children who have parents of the same sex are treated equally in the eyes of the State.  This could have come about for various reasons, be it through the use of a donor, through a previous marriage or heterosexual relationship involving one of the same-sex couple.  According to CSO 2006 census figures, one third of approximately 2,000 same-sex couples have children.  These children must be taken into account and provisions need to be made to ensure they are protected.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not address the issue of adoption and guardianship, leaving the law unchanged for same-sex couples.  That is a major flaw and I would like the Minister to address it.  When will we see the guardianship Bill?  The Ombudsman for Children, when advising us on the adoption Bill, recommended that the categories eligible to apply for adoption should be extended to include same-sex couples and that if the Bill remained unchanged, it would continue to deny certain children the possibility of enjoying a permanent and secure legal relationship with both of their parents.  Change is incremental.  A guardianship Bill is needed to protect the rights of children of same-sex couples.</P>
        <P>As a member of a democratic party and a legislator, my duty is to protect the rights of all citizens, not just those of the majority or in the mainstream.  For that reason, I am delighted to support the Bill and contribute in some way to making our civil society more inclusive, tolerant and stronger as a result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for staying as long as he has throughout the day.  This is an important Bill, one to which he is clearly committed.  I will praise him in the first instance, but later I will outline a few problems with the Bill.  He has a reputation of being something of a conservative, but I find that he is far from being a conservative in introducing the Bill.  It certainly is not one that would have been dreamed up by a conservative.  The way in which the Minister worded his speech showed that he was a man of compassion in his working environment before entering politics.  He has recognised for a long time that the issue of equality for gay and lesbian people needed to be addressed.</P>
        <P>To some extent, I am on the horns of a dilemma.  As a republican, I truly believe in equality, that we should all be subject to the same laws.  As legislators, we must frame laws in such a way that they provide for equality; we cannot wilfully frame laws that fall short of that expectation.  The Minister acknowledged that the Bill does not provide for equality.  That is why some in the Chamber and some in the gay and lesbian rights groups are not happy with it.  The Minister stated that the Bill &ldquo;demonstrates our commitment to full equality by providing an important supportive legal framework.&rdquo;  That was a lovely way of putting it.  I am not sure, just because it is not providing for equality by allowing all the same access to marriage, that this is a reason not to support it.  There are many in the gay community who welcome this step, while many on both sides of the House have mentioned that they see it as a staging post, not as the end.  Having gone this far and provided for drafting legislation to provide for equality to a <Col N="181"/>certain level, why do we not go the whole way and do what we know in our hearts is the right thing to do?  If we truly consider ourselves to be republicans, we should provide for this.</P>
        <P>Last night I spoke to my sometimes political mentor, Deputy Mary Harney, and she said all change was incremental,  that we must bring society with us.  Senator McDonald mentioned that we could not move from what was awful to what was perfect in one fell swoop.  That is why we need to bring society with us and provide for incremental change.  That is one of the reasons I will support the Bill.  It will bring us part of the way, but there are gaps in terms of the rights of children which these need to be addressed.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that he does not necessarily want to deal with them in this Bill, but they need to be addressed sooner rather than later.  We tend to frame laws that are somewhat unequal.  I do not think any of us can stand proudly over this.  We are, however, travelling a long way down the road in providing the supporting legal framework for persons in same-sex relationships.  There is currently no such protection in law.  It may not get the support it got in the other House, in Cabinet and the support I imagine it will enjoy here.  We cannot stop at that.  That we have gone most of the way to provide for equality should not mean we forget about it and put it at the bottom of the pile.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris&rsquo;s contribution was interesting.  My dilemma is that we must provide for equality but, as the Minister said, we must also ensure it is permissible under the Constitution.  We have a very outdated notion of what the family is and, as the Minister said, if we need to change the Constitution, that is another day&rsquo;s argument.  The contributions today have demonstrated that we need to change the Constitution on this issue in particular.  Senator Norris said that in the 1960s Mr. Declan Costello said the Constitution was open to interpretation because it did not state that marriage is between a man and a woman.  It was assumed that was the case because in 1967, we would never have imagined that a family could comprise two people of the same sex.  However, as we know, that is what some families comprise.  We need to recognise the changed environment in which we live and the not ideal, or the very varied, circumstances into which children are born and reared.  They all deserve equal treatment before the law and that must be our most important function as legislators.</P>
        <P>The Minister said the Constitution states we are all equal before the law.  We should all be equal before the law but this Bill falls a little short in terms of providing that everybody is equal before the law.  The status of the family needs to be protected and this is where the Minister had a dilemma, that is, in trying to frame legislation which would allow people to be equal before the law and yet protect the status of the family.  The Minister should correct me if I misunderstood what he said but I believe that is accurate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That shows there is a major flaw in the Constitution.  The rights of an individual should not be compromised because of the particular status that the family enjoys.  We need desperately to do much work updating the Constitution.  We would have an easier time passing equality laws if the Constitution was updated somewhat.</P>
        <P>I wish to address points Senator Mullen made.  He is a very persuasive and good debater and he made cogent arguments about his conscience clause.  I heard the Minister address that very well in the D&aacute;il last week.  What I objected to slightly in Senator Mullen&rsquo;s contribution was that he bent over backwards trying to look for status for the conscience clause and to ensure people have their consciences protected.  He is fundamentally missing the point that he is denying equality of rights.  He is overlooking that this Bill seeks to provide equality and is rather more exercised about having a conscience clause rather than dealing with the fundamental issue.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the debate on the issue of cohabiting relationships on Committee Stage.  The Minister said the Bill provides for nothing other than the right to go to court.  I object <Col N="182"/>slightly to this because we do not need the State interfering in relationships in any shape or form.  Marriage is one thing, although a four or five year cohabiting relationship is not necessarily causal.  I do not see the point of going down this road.  I look forward to the debate which will take place.</P>
        <P>There is a proposal in the Bill in regard to signing an opt-out clause.  If you and your partner are about to acquire rights, entitlements or the right to go to court and one tries to get one&rsquo;s partner to opt out of that, it is a sure sign the relationship will come to a conclusion very swiftly.  I agree with the fundamental issue that this Bill takes nothing from anybody&rsquo;s rights but merely seeks to provide equality for people.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Those who propose the abolition of this House should take stock of the contributions made by Senators on both sides today.  They were of a very high order.  I wish I could keep the promise I made to myself this morning when I appealed to Senators to have regard to the civilities of the debate.  When we discussed this last I said that toleration was not just permitting things of which we approve but permitting things of which we disapprove.</P>
        <P>In that regard, I have some problems with those Senators who said they have problems of conscience.  Essentially, these are not problems of conscience but problems of culture.  I am not a believer but I have profound respect for religion which I believe is a product of humanity.  I believe human beings created religion for their better moral regulation and without religion, we might be much poorer in Ireland, especially in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>I want to be straight about this even if it brings some heat into the debate but those who talk about matters of conscience are open to the charge that they are acting like this because they feel they are under some kind of obligation to some religious creed.  It is one thing if it is personal conscience but if it is coming out of some kind of ideology of religious beliefs, I would say to them that the Christian churches have a very deranged history in regard to human sexuality.  That must be said straight.  The founder, Jesus Christ, had a very liberal attitude to sexual morality but his disciples beginning with Paul, going on to the burning of witches and right up to the handling by the Catholic Church of child sex abuse in this country and all we know about it do not argue a very normal and sane attitude to sexuality.</P>
        <P>Human sexuality will always be evolving.  We do not know to where what we call the family unit will progress.  Once contraception came in in the 1960s, the connection between procreation and sexuality was broken for all time.  There is no necessary connection anymore between procreation and sexuality.  Sexuality must be given its own space in life as, indeed, does the whole question of human relationships.  Shakespeare said let us not to the marriage of two true minds admit impediment.</P>
        <P>Below the surface of everyone speaking on the other side is a kind of running stream of concern about sexuality as if homosexuals and gays were not drawn to each other by their minds, their views on politics and the passion to be with each other.  I fear this deranged sexual tone that lies beneath this debate because it comes out of a very deranged tradition if it is religion that is driving private conscience.  In the matter of private conscience, this is<i> res publica</i>.  Aristotle said that the public sphere is no place for political innocents &mdash; naturally, because it deals in irreconcilables.  There cannot be agreement on everything in the public sphere and, therefore, we must have a mechanism to deal with the public sphere.  The one we deal with is representative government.</P><Col N="183"/>
        <P>Representative government requires that public representatives act at all times in the <i>res publica</i>.  They cannot say they have a personal and private dimension, although if they do so, they come up against Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s rule who said we are all entitled to our private conscience provided we are prepared to die for it.  If they are prepared to lose their jobs in the public sector, let them declare themselves.  I hope the Minister responsible, if he meets any of these characters, will take the opportunity to make another cut in the public service if any of them refuses to do his or her duty.</P>

        <P>I feel the shadow of Wilde and Casement here today.  They, too, belonged to that tradition, our greatest literary genius and one of our great political icons who gave his life in public service to the oppressed peoples of the world and who &mdash; because he would not have been executed for high treason but for his sexuality &mdash; died for his sexuality.  I am glad to be here today in the shadow of Casement and Wilde.  We should be the country leading Europe.  With two such huge icons we should be the leading country in Europe in moving towards full marriage status for our gay community.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Harris for sharing time.  I grew up in an Ireland very different from the Ireland of today.  In my youth there was no divorce, or so we thought.  It was hidden.  In my youth there was no child born out of wedlock, or so we thought, because that was hidden.  In my youth there was no suicide, or so we thought, because that too was hidden.  In my youth there was no homosexuality, or so we thought, because that was hidden.  There was no loneliness, or so we thought.  I was elected to the Seanad 17 years ago.  Things had changed.  We found ourselves passing laws on those very items of divorce, contraceptives and suicide.  As we passed those laws I hope we relieved some of that loneliness.  Today, we hope to enact legislation to remove some of the loneliness of those who have been deprived of the ability to have a civil partnership, and that is another very welcome step.</P>
        <P>However, I believe the Bill can be improved and I hope it will be on Committee Stage.  The Constitution allows us to pass laws that discriminate between different sectors of our citizens.  For instance, we can give different benefits to people in the west from those given to people in the east.  We can give different pensions to the blind from those we give to the deaf.  In only one area does the Constitution debar us from discrimination.  Article 44 forbids discrimination on the grounds of religion.  Even in Article 44, while the word &ldquo;discriminate&rdquo; is used in the English text, the Irish version uses the words &ldquo;idirdheal&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh idir&rdquo;, which means to differentiate between but not discriminate against.  However, the Bill discriminates against couples who live together but not as sexual partners.  They could be brothers, sisters, relatives or a carer and patient.  The benefits of civil partnership are not allowed unless the two people are homosexual.  This Bill should not do that.  It should be amended to ensure it overcomes that problem.</P>
        <P>The other point that needs attention is those whose religious beliefs restrain them from being a participant in a homosexual civil partnership ceremony.  We have talked about this a lot today.  By refusing to be a participant, they are open to criminal proceedings.  I believe this is <Col N="184"/>wrong.  The penalty is not simply a fine or civil proceedings but criminal proceedings.  That is wrong and should be corrected.  I support the Bill but only if we can solve those problems.</P>
        <P>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley referred to the Minister&rsquo;s compassion.  He should show that compassion to those who feel they are unfairly dealt with in this legislation.  The Minister can do that in the next few hours and I urge him to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have listened to most of the debate today and will comment on some of the issues raised very passionately on both sides of the House.  I fully accept that the Minister has had an exceptionally difficult job to do.  He wishes to extend civil rights to a group of people who have been denied those civil rights in the past, which is not to our credit.  He has also endeavoured to ensure the Bill does not conflict with Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the Constitution.  It remains to be seen whether he has achieved that.  Senator Feargal Quinn has raised a point in that regard which may get a further airing in some other forum.</P>
        <P>When I relinquished the Fianna F&aacute;il Whip this morning, I did so to have freedom of speech.  I will talk about freedom of conscience in a moment.  Since the publication of the Bill, there has been very little public debate.  That disappoints me.  I have stated this on the Order of Business and I make that point again.</P>
        <P>While Senator David Norris made a powerful contribution, and I would not expect anything less from him, he invoked my name out of context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not and I withdraw not one word single word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I will also deal with that in a moment.  The record needs to be correct on all these issues.  I must also make it clear that my expressing views that may be contrary to Government policy has nothing to do with the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I admire Deputy Brian Cowen.  He has shown exceptional strength of character.  He has demonstrated integrity and patriotic leadership.</P>
        <P>It is important to put all these points on the record because I find much confusion in a debate of this kind.  Members of this House should be allowed to express their views without fear or favour.  Some Senators who support this legislation have been to the fore in that regard, and long may that continue.</P>
        <P>Anyone who takes the time to study the record of the House will find a comprehensive statement by me regarding same-sex union and civil partnership.  I felt it was important to lay out my stall on that occasion when there was an opportunity for each Member of the House to put his or her views on the record before the heat of battle.  I did that.  I believe Senator Norris complimented me at the time.  I mention that occasion because I want to get the<?oasys _jy ?>question of my attitude to same-sex unions out of the way and deal with specific issues in this regard.</P>
        <P>In so far as my name was invoked, I ask Senator Norris to check the record.  I said that since I came into the House I have upheld the rights of prisoners of conscience in Ireland and abroad.  I never missed an opportunity to do that wherever I felt it was necessary.  I followed that by saying it was possible, in the future, that I would have to speak for Irish prisoners of conscience who were imprisoned on foot of legislation in which I had acquiesced.  There is a penalty clause for anyone who wishes to exercise his or her conscience.  The penalty is six months in prison.  I do not think that is necessary or right.  It does not do anything for the Bill and I am surprised that even those who fully favour the extension of the Bill would want to see that happening in this country.</P><Col N="185"/>
        <P>I took grave exception to the fact that when we were endeavouring to create a debate so that people would know precisely what is in the legislation, that debate was being stifled.  For example, when the Catholic bishops issued a statement, they were told they should not interfere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Not by me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the same bishops whom we requested to enter the debate on the Lisbon treaty referendum to ensure its passage.  They did precisely that.  It is all right in one case but not in other cases.  We should also bear in mind that these bishops have a mandate because they represent the majority of people who happen to profess the Catholic faith on this island.</P>
        <P>It is not just the Catholic bishops.  The Protestant bishops have also put forward very balanced and reasoned amendments but the lid was put on that in exactly the same way and no opportunity was given for teasing out what they were putting forward at that time.</P>
        <P>We have had some sermons and lectures today on conscience.  Generally, it was on the conscience of other people we were getting the lectures whereas conscience is a very personal thing.  It is also what distinguishes us as human beings.  The State uses conscience in the judicial system.  In a court of law one is asked to take an oath based on one&rsquo;s conscience.  In that case, we regard conscience as very important as a cornerstone of the judicial system but, when someone like myself wants to express a view regarding my personal conscience, then to some extent the argument is being focused on the individual rather than on the legislation which we are debating here.</P>
        <P>I still hope the Minister would find it possible to exclude church property in this legislation.  It is unnecessary and should not be done.  We have recognised the ethos of churches in other legislation and there is no reason we could not have done so in this case.  I agree with Senator Feargal Quinn that there are still opportunities in the next few hours for the Minister to consider some of the issues we are putting forward.</P>
        <P>I have heard some debate on the rights of children.  It is a very big debate and I have no doubt it will take a lot of time, but I will say this much here.  There is an element in the Bill, if I read it correctly, which suggests that children who come forward from another relationship into a same-sex union can have their inheritance rights diminished.  I would have thought an amendment which we put forward whereby, in the case of one of the two partners passing on, the estate that is left should be divided equally between the remaining partner and whatever number of children were involved, would have been teased out and could have been dealt with.</P>
        <P>There is a firm argument regarding elderly siblings living together.  I heard two eminent people, one on television recently and another person speaking politically, suggest that this is for another day.  My point would have been that if proper debate had taken place, it would not have been for another day; it would have been precisely for this day because they too are entitled to consideration.  It weakens the whole premise of equality by not allowing consideration of this particular case.  Nobody can say it is not a loving relationship, although it may not be based on a sexual relationship.  We should revisit the issue at this time.</P>
        <P>I have listened to other speakers and I know they would have liked to have developed their points much further.  It is a pity that our time today is so limited.  However, with regard to conscience, I ask Members not to in any way ridicule or underestimate it.  Incidentally, I do not believe that anybody has a monopoly on conscience or on righteousness &mdash; quite the opposite.  We should all be very careful not to take the high moral ground in that regard.  Having said that, I would still suggest we might have got the best legislation if everybody&rsquo;s point of view could be made without it being personalised.</P><Col N="186"/>
       <P>I will finish on Senator Norris&rsquo;s reference to me.  I made it quite clear that I was referring to a prisoner of conscience when I referred to the penal law.  That is precisely what happened.  I did not use it in the context of the legislation itself.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well.  I know he is coming at this with goodwill and he is endeavouring to harmonise all the views on this island.  I hope from now on, when dealing with the amendments, there will be no personalising of the debate and that, whatever way we finish on this Bill, we can still end up as good friends and good colleagues, because that is the only decent way for any legislator to act in this House.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak.  I want to make some general points on the Bill but I also want to comment on some of the points that have been made in regard to conscience and a free vote, which I will come to later.  I will begin by commending the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for the manner in which he has dealt with this legislation.  This Bill must be acknowledged as a major step on a journey from intolerance to equality.  It is major step towards removing the suffering of a highly significant number of men and women within the Irish population.  As I said this morning on the Order of Business, when the legislation was passed in the D&aacute;il, there were many people around Leinster House and I met a young man who, unprompted, said to me &ldquo;This legislation will change my life.&rdquo;  He meant every word of that.  Clearly, this legislation will impact on the quality of people&rsquo;s lives in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill represents a further step in the incorporation of human rights thinking into  domestic law by providing more equitable treatment of persons of different sexual orientations.  It will undermine further the prejudice against gay and lesbian citizens.  This Bill is by no means perfect and does not address all the issues affecting gay couples, which I regret.  I hope the promised guardianship legislation will deal with some of the issues which I know will be addressed during the course of Committee Stage of this legislation.</P>
        <P>I will recap briefly the experience both in Ireland and internationally for gay people.  Secrecy and suffering is what, for generations, was offered to gay people.  Many within the heterosexual majority were hardly aware of the issue, except from occasional newspaper reports cast in such <Col N="188"/>coded words that readers were unclear as to why these men were going to prison.  We still hear reports internationally about this happening and we have a moral obligation to continue to speak out against this, as we have done in this House recently.</P>
        <P>The steps which lead us to this historic point are easily forgotten but they should not be.  These steps were taken by individuals of courage, such as our own colleague in this House and the many members of the campaigning organisations who for so long and until relatively recently were isolated, undermined and got very little support.  I am thankful that has changed.  It was extraordinary to hear Senator Norris speaking about the number of people he knows who have been murdered because of their sexual orientation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was pleased to be in the D&aacute;il at a time when a woman and Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, led the charge against the criminalisation of homosexuality.  There is a very well known story about how two mothers of young gay men visited her, speaking with pride about their sons as any mothers would.  These were not any mothers but had listened to their sons telling them about discovering they were different.  They did not choose to be different and did not want to be different but it was just the way they were.  It was as simple and challenging as that.</P>
        <P>As President McAleese recently remarked, homosexuality is a discovery, not a decision, and for many it is a discovery made against a backdrop where within their immediate circle of family and friends, as well as the wider society, they have long encountered anti-gay attitudes which do little to help them deal openly and healthily with their own sexuality.</P>
        <P>It took courage for those two young men to out themselves to their mothers and it took even more courage for the mothers to come to an understanding of what they had been told and to speak to a Minister for Justice about changing a law that made criminals out of two young men.  As a woman and mother, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn identified with and sympathised with these people but the task, from a legislative perspective, was not about sympathy.  Our task was not to approve what was then called a lifestyle but to legislate for the public good.  We had to assess whether the law as it stood served that end.  It clearly did not have a positive outcome for society and merely terrorised and criminalised people, and that led to the decriminalisation of homosexuality in this country.</P>
        <P>It must be said that society did not fall apart and individuals who believed homosexuality was wrong and sinful did not change their beliefs.  They were and are entitled to those beliefs, and it is worth stating that for some of my colleagues those beliefs amount to convictions essential to the holder&rsquo;s sense of self.  In the past there has sometimes been an unwillingness to fully understand how fundamental are the convictions on the opposing side.  There has been a tendency to caricature and stereotype.  It is a measure of how far we have come as a society that this has not happened, for the most part, during the debate on this civil partnership Bill.  Deep convictions have been expressed without drawing down the crude condemnatory caricatures seen so much in the past.</P>
        <P>I was struck recently when thinking about this legislation about some of the newspaper reports on the death of US Senator Robert Byrd, particularly how over a lifetime his attitudes towards race changed.  As he looked, listened and debated, his views changed radically from being someone who was racially discriminatory to someone with a greater understanding of inequality.  Many of us have been on journeys with regard to equality and it is good to see the kind of change he spoke about so much of towards the end of his life.</P>
        <P>Senators Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Harris referred to the quality of the debate in this House, which is important.  As a society we must be able to hold, tolerate and manage quite different viewpoints.  This legislation addresses the totality of two individuals, their mutual commitment <Col N="189"/>and their rights and place in society.  It protects two men or women who have chosen to commit their lives to each other.  The legal validation implicit in the Bill is of that commitment and mutual support on the part of individuals who have established a stable relationship.</P>
        <P>Some say civil partnership is a threat to marriage.  I simply ask how people can logically arrive at that conclusion.  Those who opt for civil partnership when it becomes law are no threat to marriage and it will complement marriage.  Many couples cohabit rather than marry but that is not because of a civil partnership Bill but wider societal issues which we can all address in different ways.  To discriminate against couples who wish to state in legal terms how much they value their relationship would not support marriage or persuade one of those cohabiting couples to walk up the aisle together.  Those who avail of civil partnership are those who know the importance of stability in society and wish, for the most part, to support that stability.</P>
        <P>There is an issue with the language used around this Bill.  The reality is that discrimination still exists and we have heard the insults still hurled around the playgrounds in this country.  One of the most frequently used insults in the playground is the accusation that another child is gay.  This does not happen by accident and is based on a deep fear that finds violent expression in sometimes lethal attacks on gay people.  Sometimes that leads to the majority using certain language around the Bill we are discussing today.  When we use that language in speaking about tolerance and compassion, we are using the language of the dominant group.  It is not that appropriate in terms of the debate we are having.</P>
        <P>The phrase &ldquo;free vote&rdquo; in some way seems to imply that to vote as a political party on the issue is a diminution of freedom.  That is to ignore the deep level of discussion, argument, advocacy, point and counterpoint which has certainly happened in Fine Gael and which will have happened in most political parties.  It is a deeply democratic process that should be valued.  To devalue the process and abandon it by removing the Whip, for example, is to separate it from a profoundly democratic process.</P>
        <P>At this stage, I pay tribute to former Senator Sheila Terry for the work she did on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>She worked on the issue and presented a paper for Fine Gael in 2004.  It has been remarked that the capacity to accept two mutually opposed viewpoints is the mark of genius but it is also the mark of a civilised and evolved society.  On conscience, I make the point that conscience is about owning a code of contact and abiding by it.  It is not about imposing one&rsquo;s individual code on others or using one&rsquo;s belief to limit the civil rights of others.  It is not about giving more rights to people we approve of and fewer to those whose code does not match ours.</P>
        <P>As legislators we must always create laws that free people to become the best citizens they can with the most to offer.  This civil partnership Bill is precisely such a law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, by agreement.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  This is truly landmark legislation in an Irish context.  It reflects strongly that Fianna F&aacute;il is delivering its promises from the 2007 election manifesto and programme for Government.  This issue is very important for same-sex couples.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened intently to Senators Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, John Hanafin, Jim Walsh and R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen. I could empathise with them in some of the points they made on certain matters.  Members of the House have a tendency not to tackle one another's arguments head on.  However, that is what I hope to do in respect of this Bill.</P>
     
        
        <P>All things being equal, a loving mother and a loving father constitute the ideal unit in rearing children.  This unit should be promoted and encouraged, but it is not always possible to have <Col N="190"/>such a unit in place, nor is it always the best arrangement in certain circumstances.  The argument made by the four Senators to whom I referred and others misses the point entirely in respect of this legislation.  There is no doubt but that we need to act in the nation&rsquo;s interests.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am a republican and a proud Irishman.  Passing this legislation will make Ireland more egalitarian and give rise to greater freedom and fairness within society, particularly for those who are gay.  If one is gay, so what?  It does not make any difference to me one way or another.  What is important is whether someone is honourable, caring or loving.  As many distinguished and famous people have stated, we should consider a person&rsquo;s character rather than who he or she is, the colour of his or her skin or his or her sexuality.  To me, as an Irishman, someone&rsquo;s sexuality is irrelevant; there should be no legal impediments placed in the way of couples, be they heterosexual or homosexual.  The legislation brings forward a new structure in respect of succession, financial and pension rights.  That is what is required.</P>
        <P>As the youngest Member of the Oireachtas, I have a responsibility to articulate my views and appreciate the opportunity to do so.  I also have a responsibility to echo the opinions of other young people, many of whom have contacted me about this matter.  As previous speakers stated, one cannot help with whom one falls in love.  In addition, one does not have a choice when it comes to the identity of the person who is going to make one go weak at the knees.  In many instances we wish that those who do make us go weak at the knees did not have such power over us.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that certain Senators have failed to tackle the issues to which the legislation actually relates.  Those who have spoken against the Bill are three or four of the most articulate Members of the House.  However, I disagree with them in the stance they have adopted.  I wish to analyse some of the arguments they made and indicate why I disagree with them, why I will be voting in favour of the Bill and why I encourage all other Members to do so.</P>
        <P>I accept that there are siblings who have lived together all their lives and whose arrangements are not addressed in the Bill.  However, that is a poor and weak reason for opposing the legislation.  Senator Mullen has stated the Bill will not deliver true equality.  I wish to examine this point.  The Senator has indicated that we are entering a phase in which just because one has a particular Christian or other religious point of view, one&rsquo;s arguments will be dismissed out of hand.  I disagree with him in that regard for the same reasons that I disagree with the inclusion of a conscience clause.  One might think it reasonable to suggest such a clause should be inserted to cater for those who are uncomfortable about this matter.  However, if such a clause were universal, it would lead to a horrendous state of affairs, whereby all civil and public servants could withdraw their services simply on the basis of their conscience.  Where does one draw the line when it comes to one&rsquo;s conscience?  I have not been contacted by any registrar who has a conscientious objection to the legislation.  However, I acknowledge that this alone is not a reason to oppose the Bill.  If one opposes it on the basis of one&rsquo;s conscience, one is missing its central thrust which is, as the Minister has indicated on numerous occasions, that it empowers people and enhances their rights.  In many respects, I wish the Bill went further.</P>
        <P>We need to examine how the country has developed during the past then or 20 years.  My father has often informed me that 20 years ago this country was inward looking and backward.  If one watches television programmes such as &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo;, one can witness the transformation that has occurred in Irish society in the past ten or 15 years.  This is a country of which we should all be proud.  If we do not pass the Bill, however, we will be less proud to be citizens.  As a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I am proud that the House will pass it tomorrow.  There is an urgent need for this legislation.</P><Col N="191"/>
        <P>I have been contacted by people who are in favour of the Bill and others who are opposed to it.  The individuals to whom I refer put many arguments to me.  As a relatively new Member of the House, I am of the view that we have a responsibility to do what is right.  Above all, this legislation is right for the country and all of its citizens, not merely those who are homosexual.  While I am a member of the largest grouping in the House, I accept that the members of the other groups are as passionate as I am in expressing their opinions.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will be passed.  I am delighted that it is being guided through the Houses by a fellow Louthman.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Carroll for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Gay and lesbian citizens of the State deserve opportunities that are equal to those enjoyed by all other citizens.  I know many gay and lesbian people whom I am happy to call my friends.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides significant rights for civil partners.  This raises complex legal issues in the context of the special protection the Constitution affords to marriage and in respect of the equality rights protected under Article 41.  This matter was referred to by many previous speakers.  The Bill will, by extension, also make provision for unmarried opposite-sex couples and unregistered same-sex couples by way of establishing a redress scheme to give protection to financially dependent persons at the end of long-term, cohabiting relationships.</P>
        <P>Given the time constraints, I wish to focus on one or two issues.  I received a large number of representations on the legislation, almost all of which emanated from persons who live in the constituency in which I reside, Donegal South-West.  The vast majority refer to serious concerns about certain aspects of the Bill.  It is important to highlight a number of these concerns, particularly as some relate specifically to Part 15 of the Bill which deals with cohabitation.  By extension, some of these concerns are also linked with the civil partnership arrangements contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that any claim for redress, that is, a claim against a former cohabitant who is still living, or a claim for provision in the case of a former or now deceased cohabitant can only be satisfied from the part of the respondent cohabitant&rsquo;s assets or estate that he or she had intended to be used to provide for his or her children or that he or she had intended to leave to his or her children.  In that context, I am concerned about the rights of children under the age of 18 years.  While the Bill does not specifically state this, section 173(5) provides that, &ldquo;The court shall not make an order referred to in this section in favour of a qualified cohabitant that would affect any right of any person to whom the other cohabitant is or was married&rdquo;.  On the other hand, section 194(11) provides that a claim for provision from a deceased cohabitant&rsquo;s estate must be met from the net estate.  The section goes on to define &ldquo;net estate&rdquo; as:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) other liabilities of the estate having priority over the rights referred to in <i>paragraphs(b)</i> and <i>(c)</i>,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) any rights, under the Succession Act 1965, of any surviving spouse of the person, and</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) any rights, under the Succession Act 1965, of any surviving civil partner of the person.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It appears, therefore, that under the Bill &mdash; perhaps the Minister will clarify the position &mdash; the rights and shares of a surviving spouse or registered civil partner will be ring-fenced against any claim by a surviving cohabitant.  In summary, once the debts of the deceased or the estate have been satisfied and provision made in respect of the entitlements of the spouse or civil partner, any responsible parent would wish for the remainder of his or her estate to be left, more or less in its entirety, to his or her child or children.</P><Col N="192"/>
        <P>However, under the Bill it appears the children of the respondent cohabitant, whether born of an earlier or subsequent marriage or born out of wedlock, are to be seriously disadvantaged by the granting of either redress or provision in favour of a surviving cohabitant.  My view, which has also been expressed by my constituents, is that this will leave the entitlements of children from the estate of a parent in a very vulnerable position.  I am concerned that the inheritance rights of children in certain circumstances are being eroded in this Bill.  That appears to be the case.  I am open to clarification from the Minister.  I am raising the concerns that have been expressed by many parents in my constituency.  Another example is section 194&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I will sum up.  I thought we had 15 minutes, rather than ten minutes.  I would like to refer to other sections of the Bill.  Section 194(4)(<i>d</i>) provides that when making an order for redress, the court must have regard to &ldquo;the rights and entitlements of any dependent child or of any child of a previous relationship of either cohabitant&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to clarify if the rights and entitlements of a child of the current relationship will be protected under this section.  In the relevant Part of the Bill &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;any child of whom both the cohabitants are the parents&rdquo; but may only be relevant to a previous circumstance.  Any child of the current relationship is not referred to in the Bill.  I am open to clarification from the Minister in this regard.  I have expressed a number of concerns with regard to children.  They relate more to the redress provision elements of the Bill.  During his Second Stage speech, the Minister referred to the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s consultative document on certain aspects of this matter.  Perhaps we can get further clarification in that regard.</P>
        <P>In general, I welcome the debate we are having in the House.  It is important for the Seanad to embrace such discussions and to give all Senators a chance for their views to be expressed and heard.  I welcome the opportunity to raise in this forum some of the concerns that have been outlined to me.  Like people in my constituency, I have concerns about the protection of the interests of the child in the event of redress or any future provision.  I will give a brief example before I wrap up.  I will suggest the case of a married couple who are in a loving relationship and have two dependent children but, by the grace of God, happen to be killed in a car accident.  Let us assume that the father, having cohabited with someone ten years previously, had been making a periodical payment of &euro;1,000 or &euro;500 to his former cohabitant, perhaps at Christmas.  I would like to know whether this Bill provides that his former cohabitant will have an opportunity to make a claim from his estate ahead of his two children.  The Bill is not clear in this regard.  I feel it is important to highlight this matter, which has been raised <Col N="193"/>with me, in the House.  I appreciate the latitude I was given by the Acting Chairman to extend my contribution beyond the time available when other Members were waiting to speak.</P>

	<P>I would like to make a passing comment on the Bill before we deal with it in detail on Committee Stage.  I listened to the end of the debate in the other House.  I believe in plain English.  Section 172 of the Bill has to be adjusted.  The Bill provides that civil partnership is not available to people &ldquo;within the prohibited degrees of relationship&rdquo;.  Section 172 states that &ldquo;2 adults are within a prohibited degree of relationship if .... they would be prohibited from marrying each other in the State&rdquo;.  That includes people of the same gender.  I think that has to be changed.  I think it will be challenged and there will be a problem with it.  That is for down the road.  We will deal with such matters on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the issue of conscience.  Those of us who deal with national school teachers who teach religious knowledge in schools have come across the issue day in, day out for the last 30 years.  It might come as a surprise to the people of Ireland to learn that teachers all over Ireland teach religion every day even though they do not believe a word of it.  I do not refer to all of them, but to some of them.  They just get on with it.  We should not get carried away about what can be done, or what does not need to be done.  I will spell that out at a later stage.  The Minister is absolutely right in this regard.</P>
        <P>This is a debate about society.  In society&rsquo;s wild and savage stage, people fought each other because they looked different or acted differently.  At the football matches of today, supporters spit hate at each other.  They share the same space at the football pitch but, like oil and water, they will never mix.  As society moves on, difference is accommodated and respected.  Perhaps there is parity of esteem and, at some stage, equality.  During all of those stages, the real test is how society melds and blends.  A true society or community should be like a precious stone, with many different facets, directions and reflections.  Over many generations and centuries, it should grow and become more precious.  At the end of that process of maturation, we should have a true society.  Today&rsquo;s debate is part of that process.</P>
        <P>We are talking about the gay culture of Ireland.  It may be described as a sub-culture &mdash; I hate that phrase &mdash; in the sense that gay people constitute a group within a group.  The gay people of Ireland are being brought into society.  That is really what today is about.  I have had many arguments about the education of mutual understanding, with the objective of tolerance, in Northern Ireland.  That is never enough.  Tolerance is no longer an acceptable objective in society.  It is not about multiculturalism and getting people to share the same space.  It is not about having a Muslim school, a gay school, a Catholic school or a French school.  It is about how people who are different engage with each other.  The benchmark of a successful society is not the space it gives to its different parts &mdash; it is the quality of the engagement and participation of all the different groups.  That is the measure.  There is no other measure.  When we accept that, we will be able to see where we are going in today&rsquo;s discussion.</P><Col N="194"/>
        <P>Words are important.  However, I suggest that significant confusion between words like liberalism, progressivism, pluralism, interculturalism and multiculturalism has been a feature of this debate.  Liberalism, in its true meaning, provides for an okay measure of the extent to which society is open, tolerant and free.  Any attempt to create a culture in which everyone supports, adopts and buys into the same liberal agenda is anathema to, and the antithesis of, liberalism.  We should rejoice in difference as an adornment of our society.  It lifts and enriches rather than threatens our society.  It is not something with which we have to cope reluctantly.  We should not try to rein in those who are different.  We should learn from difference, which enriches us on a daily basis.  It is a welcome aspect of society.  I ask people to think through these issues in a different way.</P>
        <P>Similarly, people who mock and sneer at conservative Catholicism are as objectionable to me as those who do the reverse.  It is anathema to me.  People have to open and respect each other&rsquo;s different points of view.  By engaging in argument with those who are different, across the floor of this House and elsewhere, we can bring about the creative tension that leads to progress in society.  As we find our way forward, we can blend, design and create a better society.  That is what we are about today.  We are not just dealing with the smaller aspects of this individual Bill &mdash; we are also making a major move forward as we try to create a better society.  I am just getting into my stride.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will hand over to my colleague, Senator Ross, by saying there is much to be done in society.  This is an important step forward.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley, who said earlier that all change management is gradual and incremental.  That is why I suggest that people who have problems with the Bill, but generally approve of it, should see it as a stage in our development and should support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what Senator O&rsquo;Toole has said.  I do not know whether this legislation is based on pluralism, tolerance or human rights, but it seems to me that it represents eminent good sense.  All it does is recognise something that should have happened a very long time ago, namely, the granting of straightforward human rights for people who deserve to be treated exactly as everyone else is treated.  Sometimes I look at this Bill and wonder what all the fuss is about.  This should have happened ages ago.  I had lunch today with a group of young people who, when I told them what we were discussing today, thought we had horns.  They thought this had happened ages ago and was no longer an issue.  It should have happened 20 or 30 years ago.</P>
        <P>I have been in this House for a very long time and know how long it has taken for the gay community to be recognised.  I heard Senator Norris describing very eloquently how he was a criminal and a Senator at the same time.  That was an appalling and unforgiveable situation.  I further state that this Bill, not all of which he entirely approves, is a great monument to the leadership he gave in this area.  That should be recognised by all Members of this House because for many years the treatment of the gay community was indefensible.  Those people were kept in that situation by politicians who were reluctant to take measures that were essential and made pure common sense.  Today&rsquo;s Bill is a recognition, not only of what Senator Norris has done, but of the fact that political parties, some perhaps reluctantly, have come of age.  They have come to recognise this is basic, common-sense human rights.  That is all we are doing here.</P><Col N="195"/>
        <P>To those who feel the Bill does not go far enough I say it is a great deal better than it was yesterday.  When this Bill is signed in two days&rsquo; time, the gay community and other people will be a great deal better off than they were 48 hours before.  We should recognise that as a tribute.  I recognise and salute Fianna F&aacute;il for taking this on, with great difficulties.  I salute the Green Party which probably gave the leadership in Government on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know it.  I apologise.  I suspect it.  That should be recognised too because it is important.</P>
        <P>There is a measure in the Bill to which we will come to and about which I feel uneasy.  I believe those who have broken ranks in Fianna F&aacute;il will table an amendment in its regard.  I cannot understand why it is necessary to criminalise people such as registrars, etc. who say they will not do certain jobs in this situation.  I do not believe in the conscience clause, by the way, although I thought long and hard about it.  However, if the conscience of these people tells them that they cannot take such an action, that is fair enough.  If they do not do what is required of them in their jobs they are dismissed, they resign or are deemed to have resigned.  However, the idea of locking them up for six months, or whatever, is totally wrong and unfair.  This may apply in other areas of the public service, as I believe it does, but it should not do so.  I plead with the Minister to accept an amendment whereby such people are deemed to have been dismissed because of behaving in this way, or are otherwise dismissed by the head of their department.  To say they should go to jail for something in which they believe, however wrongly, is totally wrong.</P>
        <P>This is a very great day.  It is a good day for the House.  It is Ireland coming of age and, without being patronising, it is the Fianna F&aacute;il Party coming of age.  We should salute Senator Norris, in particular, for bringing us this far if not quite as far as he would like us to go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is welcome.  I commend him on the even-handed way in which he steered this legislation to the point it is at today.  I have heard him speak about it at a number of events and his advocacy and even-handedness on an issue that might have got away from us, causing much unease and a great deal of not very useful debate, have managed to confine and frame it in terms of the civil rights it will confer on relationships that until now have not been recognised properly.</P>
        <P>People have described this as a landmark.  I like to think of it, also, as a stepping stone.  I and my party see it as an important moment in a journey towards ultimate equal status in terms of marriage for gay people.  We are not there today but we are talking about civil partnership.  Undoubtedly, this is a significant day.</P>
        <P>Gay love is not tainted love.  I believe there is a sub-text for those who oppose this legislation when they suggest it is a tainted love.  Senator Mullen referred to classic Catholic teaching on sexuality.  In the Judaeo-Christian tradition there is a truly unhealthy interpretation of sexuality which has not served the church well.  It did not serve me well in my education.  My education, which I value in many ways, was on one level an attempt at social control when it came to the area of sexuality.  I resent that and carry that resentment to this day although I left school a long time ago.  In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, Adam and Eve&rsquo;s first recognition of original sin was to cover their nakedness.  It was, so to speak, the marker of original sin that sexuality was something of which to be ashamed.  Down the centuries, that has characterised the Judaeo-Christian attitude to sexuality.  The great theologian, Hans K&uuml;ng, has discussed this in regard to the virgin birth which, he states, serves a useful symbolic purpose but, biologically, is simply not possible.  That is a very controversial belief for an eminent Catholic theologian to state.  I hope I do not misquote him but I understand very well what he means.  He was attempting to <Col N="196"/>break away from the traditional notion to say that just because something has its origins in a sexual act that does not mean it is due any less reverence or respect.  The sub-text of that particular Catholic belief is that it is necessary to separate the Christ child from the act of sexuality.</P>
        <P>I refer to the classic Catholic teaching on sexuality.  Senator Mullen weaves an impressive web of words around all of this but I believe he is fundamentally wrong.  Church teaching on homosexuality is fundamentally wrong in that it teaches that the call to the homosexual person is to live a chaste life and, by the virtues of self-mastery, prayer and sacramental grace, homosexuals will gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.  That is fundamentally incorrect and must be set aside when we speak about the rights of gay people in civil law.  That is what the Bill does.  I would hate to see any Senator, in his or her contribution, drag the State into people&rsquo;s bedrooms.  At some level that is what has been attempted in the House today.  I am glad we are resisting it and that the Bill enjoyed cross-party support in the other House.  I hope it will enjoy overwhelming support in this one.</P>
        <P>Coming to this somewhat late in the day, I have been impressed by the background research and consideration, going back to the Colley options paper through to the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on cohabitees which recommended changes in areas such as succession, pensions and so on.  There was the all-party Oireachtas committee which reported in 2006 on the need for legislative provision for same-sex couples.  There was major research by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties in 2006 which recommended legislative reform designed to ensure legal recognition of, and enhanced State support for, various types of interpersonal relationships.  The Equality Authority&rsquo;s report on partnership rights of same-sex couples, which dates back to 2001, highlighted the need for legislative action in this area.  Most importantly, the gradual coming around of public opinion on the matter demands of us that we work on bringing full recognition to same sex couples in their relationships.</P>
        <P>The Bills digest summarises some of the findings of the Lansdowne Market Research of 2008, which is pretty recent.  Some 61% of people felt that denying same sex couples marriage was a form of discrimination, 62% said that they would vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in a referendum to extend, not civil partnership, but civil marriage to same-sex couples if held tomorrow.</P>
        <P>There is a new dispensation around this issue.  Most Members have spoken about the new Ireland, the new tolerance and I agree that tolerance is not the aspiration towards which we should be moving, it is how we relate to each other, not simply how we stand by from each other and tolerate each other.  We need something far more than that.</P>
        <P>Allowing for that, to welcome this new Ireland, our new capacity to welcome all and our new liberalism and then not to legislate for it is disingenuous in the extreme.  We must legislate for the new set of opinions based on the body of research during the past ten years that had led us to the point that we are at today.  I wholeheartedly welcome the point we are at today and I view it as a stepping stone towards further progress in the future, which I hope will come to pass.</P>
        <P>I recognise that change is incremental.  Incremental change is probably more sustainable in the long run than revolutionary change.  I am happy that we have reached this point today while hoping that tomorrow will be the start of the next phase, as we move towards full and equal status in the area of marriage.</P>
        <P>In regard to some of the other peripheral issues &mdash; I see them as that &mdash; around cohabitees who are in non-sexual relationships, there is an element of hard cases making bad law to bringing this issue into the legislation.  It can be dealt with in other ways.  I refuse to be deflected <Col N="197"/>by it in my consideration of what this Bill is trying to achieve today.  I welcome this important day in Irish legislation.</P>

        <P>Our sexuality is a gift given to us at birth by God.  It is not a choice we make, it is given to us.  It is about time we accepted that.  This Bill is not an attack on the church, on the institution of the church or on the sacrament of marriage.  It is a Bill not about sexuality but about rights, equality and people.  It is incumbent on each of us as Members of the Oireachtas to legislate for all of our citizens.  Civil rights are based on personal freedoms, freedoms to which we are born and to which we all have a birthright.</P>
        <P>The issue of conscientious objectors to the enactment of this Bill has been raised and it must be dealt with maturely.  I have a conscience and I am acting on my conscience.  I will vote for this Bill and support the Minister in this case.</P>
        <P>Intolerance of one section of our society, for whatever reason, in a fair and free nation must always be intolerable to each one of us as legislators.  This country in our awful history has seen our citizens, or subjects as they were then, disenfranchised because of their religion.  If our history of occupation has thought us anything, it is that when a state seeks to disenfranchise a group of its people, that state fails its people, the very people it seeks to govern and protect.  It is our duty to protect and govern all of our citizens.</P><Col N="198"/>
        <P>Discrimination against anybody covered on the nine grounds of equality must be and should be anathema to any modern government.  There can be no excuse or opt out clause.

Some people have suggested the liberal agenda has come too far, but I suggest that gay and cohabiting couples have lived far too long under the strain and pressure of no legal recognition and no legal protection.</P>

	<P>State discrimination against these groups in society has gone on for far too long and it is time it was addressed and I believe this Bill will do that.  Even though the Bill is not perfect, it is a start and represents a great progression in this area.</P>
        <P>I thought it ironic when I heard that some of the contributors not only in this House but in the media, descendants of our disenfranchised people, would seek to disenfranchise another sector of their own people.  We could never in this modern State contemplate an objection to the union of two people from diverse religious backgrounds or racial backgrounds, equally we should never contemplate or tolerate any objection to the union of two people in a loving relationship from a same-sex background.</P>

	<P>Equality for all embodies the true spirit of republicanism, as handed down to us from the ideals of Wolfe Tone.</P>
        <P>Tonight the Minister and many other politicians have given us a great choice.  Is the State, if the Minister was to accept some of the amendments that have been put before us, to further perpetrate a stigma, bias or prejudice or will we collectively, as citizens together, take up the gauntlet and proudly enter the 21st century, realising the ideals of those proposed at the start of the 20th century?  Will we as politicians be mature, and putting aside the Civil War divide, finally realise the lofty ideals of the Republic, proclaimed on the steps of the GPO, that we cherish all of our children equally.</P>
        <P>Tonight we will remove the ignominious stigma of being gay to one of acceptance.  We remove from gay people the legal barriers regarding property, inheritance rights, social welfare, succession, maintenance, pensions and tax, and the same applies to cohabiting couples.  It is a day of which we can be proud, a day that we can say we are Irish, we are one and we have a common purpose.</P>
        <P>Equally, there must be a separation of church and State in the modern Republic.  While all the time cherishing our private spirituality, we must cherish the principles of equality legislatively.  As a practising Catholic, I respect the rights of the church to its teachings.  I disagree with it teachings on homosexuality and on sexuality in general but I believe in the right of the church to promulgate its teachings.  I understand tolerance.  I respect the rights of the bishops to use the magisterium to preach.  I agree with them but I accept the right to have a view.</P>
        <P>In a modern republic we must be tolerant of one another in a society where we are all equal &mdash; men, women, gay or straight, black or white, it does not matter, we are equal.  In a modern republic, I also believe that the equalitarian ideals of a republic must be to the fore and I fully endorse the separation of church and state.  The state should not interfere in the spiritual matters of a church, nor can the state be led or influenced by the spiritual stance of a church.  We are a pluralist State not a theocracy and, as such, the State must operate a system of laws that is wholly inclusive of all its people.  In the democracy in which we live, we must safeguard the rights of all of our citizens.  I am conscious that in 1916 and during the Civil War many <Col N="199"/>brave men and women fought.    They were brave people who strove to accomplish a republican democracy.  Today the truest model of a republic is not one which is driven by the ideals of a particular set of church teaching, but rather those which are based on the rights of all to live in a free and just society, one which withholds the privilege of one group over another and which ensures the rights of all our people.  This Bill is a stepping stone, as was said, and a bridge builder.  I hope following today we will have a gentler, more caring and inclusive Irish society where we can all be free.</P>
        <P>We have a duty to all our citizens to break down the walls of prejudice which have oppressed a largely silent majority for far too long.  The stigma of homosexuality, on which Senators Fitzgerald, Healy Eames and Norris eloquently spoke today, has brought unbearable pressures on many young men and women.  Ironically, Senator Fitzgerald used the words of President Mary McAleese when she said sexual identity is a discovery not a decision.  I never thought I would stand in Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann and be proud to support legislation which the Minister brought before the House.</P>
        <P>He has not come here alone, rather, he has come here with the help of many people.  It is a great day to be a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and as Senator Harris correctly said, today is a day where we can say we are proud to be Members of the Upper House where the standard and quality of debate has been second to none.  It is a day we should celebrate and rejoice, a day we say we are all free and equal.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>They are just chatting.  As the Minister said, this is one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation to be agreed since Independence.  It builds on the 1993 Act which was proposed by the then Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, which decriminalised homosexuality.  Fianna F&aacute;il passed the Bill in 1993, contrary to the perception that it is not interested in equality and human rights.  I vividly remember M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn striding through the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The cross-party support for the Bill in the D&aacute;il, which was passed without a vote, shows the measures contained in it have the broad support of the Irish people and that securing the civil rights and human rights of gay people is a mainstream goal.  As the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for gay people who have lived through times of severe oppression and discrimination, I know many entered their current long-term relationships against a backdrop of criminalisation of homosexuality, lack of family support and the absence of the current Bill.  The Bill represents the dawning of a new era for the thousands of older gay and lesbian couples who have for many years cherished their relationships in the absence of social and legal recognition.  They will now be able to celebrate publicly their relationships with family <Col N="200"/>and friends and avail of a comprehensive set of legal protections, rights and obligations in the areas of taxation, pensions, inheritance, social welfare and shared home protection.</P>
        <P>In my paper on what we can do about suicide in the new Ireland, I said that anxiety about gender and sexuality is one of the risk factors which has been linked to suicide and deliberate self-harm.  It was echoed in a systematic review in the United Kingdom of mental disorder, suicide, and deliberate self-harm in lesbian, gay and bisexual people which concluded that lesbian and gay people are at higher risk of mental disorder, suicidal ideation, substance misuse, and deliberate self harm than heterosexual people.  This was reiterated by BeLonGTo, Reach Out and the national strategy for suicide prevention which showed that lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people are more likely to be medicated for depression and are more likely to engage in alcohol misuse, drug abuse and deliberate self-harm.  This is because gay and bisexual people have been subjected to institutionalised prejudice, social stress, social exclusion,even within families, and anti-homosexual hatred and violence, and this can internalise a sense of shame about their sexuality.</P>
        <P>When I drew up my document on what we can do about suicide in the new Ireland I held public meetings to learn what people&rsquo;s feelings about suicide were.  When I held public meetings they were crowded.  It is not up to the Government, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children alone to help to reduce the level of suicide and deliberate self harm, it is also our responsibility.  I call on local communities around the country to call public meetings about this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and explain it to people all over the island and get people to open up, discuss it and lift the cloud, oppression, ambiguity, pain and isolation because talking about the issue will help.  Young people have the Internet to keep in touch with the latest discussions and help available and can interact with one another in private, but older people do not have such a communication network, which is why I am calling for public meetings because we have to help those of all ages with the issues contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the Bill and the economy.  As well as being a great advance in civil and human rights, there is also an economic perspective of which we need to take account.  There can be no doubt that a society which is more open and tolerant and where diversity is cherished is one which is more innovative and productive.  Our openness to gay people will be an important part of our success as an advanced, competitive and smart global economy.  This fact is not lost on the world&rsquo;s biggest companies, many of which employ thousands of people in Ireland.  Multinationals based here such as Microsoft, IBM, Facebook and Google all have strong equality policies in place for their gay staff.  Ireland&rsquo;s increasing openness and acceptance of diversity is a significant factor in the capacity of people to attract and retain the workers they require.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am currently reading <i>Beyond Business</i>, a memoir of Lord John Browne, the former chief executive of British Petroleum, BP.  He has a detailed chapter on how he had to step down from his role because he was gay.  He told a lie about where he met his partner.  He said he met him running in Battersea Park but had in fact met him at an escort agency, a fact of which he was ashamed.  He suppressed his sexuality for years because his mother was in Auschwitz and he did not want to upset her any more after her torture there.  He was afraid to come out as chief executive of BP because he felt he would be finished.  It is a perfect example of a company where it was a stigma to be gay.  I recommend the book to everybody because it not just about the current troubles of BP.  He also refers to his experience in Columbia, to where <Col N="201"/>I have travelled seven times, on which he has a very detailed and blunt statement regarding the lack of human rights and oppression there.</P>
        <P>I thank GLEN for its professionalism in the support we have been given in order to pass the Bill.  A young man who has a great political future is Tiernan Brady.  I hope his colleagues will not mind if I say he is a great young man.</P>

If the birth parent of a child reared in a same-sex relationship dies, the child will be left without a legal protector.  I had a discussion earlier with friends of Senator Leyden who were totally opposed to the Bill, but I told them the Minister would push ahead on the issue.  Children are the most vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P>This is about liberty, equality and fraternity in the true republican sense.  The 1916 Proclamation asks us to cherish all the children of the nation equally.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister from my neighbouring county.  Other speakers have rightly recognised Senator Norris&rsquo;s lonely advocacy of this issue during the years.  After a long, forensic and vigorous debate at a specially convened parliamentary party meeting, Fine Gael Members have decided to support the Bill based on a synthesis of the various views expressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My attitude to this legislation derives from a beautiful expression commonly used in the rural community in County Cavan in which I was reared &mdash; &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo; or &ldquo;lig dom agus ligfidh m&eacute; duit&rdquo;.  While that expression may not have gained currency in institutional settings, it was the way of the people.  Ordinary people were tolerant and appreciated human difference and individuality.  This outlook had its genesis in Christianity and Celtic tradition.  If one peruses the New Testament, particularly the Sermon on the Mount, one will find a rationale for this live and let live philosophy.  The principles of republican philosophy, as expressed in the French Revolution and this modern republican democracy, also encompass this outlook.</P>
        <P>According to the most recent CSO statistics, 121,800 cohabiting couples and 2,000 same-sex couples live in this country.  The Bill will confer pension and succession rights and maintenance obligations on the people concerned, as well as afford protection against domestic violence<?oasys _jy ?>and State benefits such as carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Implicit in any live and let live philosophy is acceptance of and adherence to the rights and responsibilities on all unions, irrespective of their nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The world view that allows me to accept this legislation also makes me tolerate those who oppose it in all conscience.  I am disappointed that the legislation does not include supports for siblings who have lived alone.  The Minister will be aware of a particular union common in rural society, that of two brothers or sisters living together.  They may run a shop, farm or other business together and have a community of interest.  In effect, they are married without a sexual relationship for a number of years.  It is important that the special rights that accrue to such couples are not undone by other siblings who may have done well in the new world before returning home for the funeral.  It is a pity we are not legislating to deal with this issue. I made that point at our parliamentary party meeting.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        
        <P>In the event of the death of one sibling, there is no protection in law for the surviving sibling who finds himself or herself battling a distant relative who contests the will of the deceased.  Many siblings who found themselves in this position have been evicted from the home in which they lived their entire lives.  As a professional lawyer by background, the Minister will be more aware than I am that certain rights accrue from personal investment in a property, working on a property and so forth.  Notwithstanding such<?oasys _jy ?>rights, it is an omission in the Bill to place on a distinctive footing the rights of siblings living together.</P>
        <P>The issue of providing a conscience clause has generated a great deal of debate.  Like everyone else, I grappled with this issue and found, on a superficial analysis, that it is difficult to object reasonably to permitting people to act in accordance with their conscience.  However, <Col N="203"/>when one considers the potential for bizarre circumstances to arise if people were allowed to exercise a right to act in conscience, one concludes that one must be careful in this regard.  While it would probably not occur in practice, one cannot provide for a case in which a nurse in an accident and emergency unit, a general practitioner, a medical practitioner or a ward sister would refuse treatment to a patient on the basis of his or her perceived sexuality.  The law of the land, as this legislation will become once it has been signed by the President, must not be thwarted by a succession of officials refusing to process civil partnerships.</P>
        <P>Common sense should apply.  If, for example, there is a conscientious objector in a legal office where there are two or more officials performing the function, provided it is practicable to do so, the non-objector should perform the relevant role on the given days.  I expect that common sense will prevail and such flexibility will be shown in practice.</P>
        <P>The criminal dimension of the Bill, which provides for a prison sentence of six months and a fine of &euro;2,000, is excessive.  It is not excessive to provide that an official who thwarts the law of the land in an unreasonable and unacceptable fashion should lose his or her job but it would be unacceptable to send such a person to jail for six months.  The Minister should reconsider this provision and allow common sense to prevail.  I believe this will be the case.  While the bizarre example I cited of a nurse in accident and emergency refusing to treat someone he or she perceives to be lesbian or gay may never arise, the problem is that it could arise.  The law must be predicated on the most bizarre possibilities.</P>
        <P>The traditional or nuclear family &mdash; a heterosexual married couple rearing children &mdash; is the most common union in this country, although cohabitation is gaining in popularity.  This legislation will not thwart such unions.  On the contrary, a tolerant, Christian and caring society which encompasses and accepts everybody and reflects human realities will enhance all family units and institutions.  We should not do anything that would besmirch the traditional family but this does not arise with this legislation as the traditional family continues to be protected by the Constitution and many realities.</P>
        <P>The legislation must be accepted because society needs to be understanding, humane and accepting of all.  In an open society, all relationships should be allowed to prosper, provided they are based on consent and do not involve harm to another person.  On that basis, the Bill should be supported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Acting Chairman, Deputy Coghlan, was about to overlook me.  Given that I have agreed to postpone the taking of my Private Members&rsquo; motion to facilitate an extension of the debate, I wish to welcome the Minister and take an opportunity to express my opinions on the Bill.</P>
        <P>I spent my first five years in the Seanad sharing an office with former Senator Sheila Terry who, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, drew up a policy in support of civil partnership.  In 2004,. Fine Gael became the first political party to adopt such a position.  Sheila Terry did substantial work on this issue and I recall having many long debates with her on it.  It is interesting to note that the Bill before us is largely modelled, whether directly or indirectly, on the proposals made by the former Senator six years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having listened to virtually every contribution, I find this debate one of the best I have experienced in the House.  I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on how society changes.  There is often a perception among politicians that we know what people think or we can tell them what to think.  Our duty, however, is to engage with society as it is and this legislation is an honest effort to try to engage with society as it is, which is not to say I do not have a couple of reservations about specific aspects of the Bill.</P><Col N="204"/>
        <P Just="Left">Previous speakers cited all sorts of people, including Edmund Burke.  My favourite quotation from Edmund Burke relates to how politicians are supposed to use their judgment: &ldquo;Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.&rdquo;  Burke was correct in this matter.  I had reason to use these words recently at a selection convention which followed a turbulent period in my party.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the contributions of Fianna F&aacute;il Party Senators who had the courage of their convictions and expressed reservations about the Bill.  It is a credit to them that they did so because the House should have a full, frank and open exchange of views.  Unlike the Seanad, the other House did not have a fully rounded debate.  This is an example of the usefulness of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>My bugbear with the Bill relates to section 23 and the prosecution of registrars who fail to do their duty.  I understand registrars exercise an important role in implementing the law of the land and failure to perform this function should result in them losing their position.  However, it is not acceptable that in righting a wrong done to people in same sex relationships &mdash; or opposite sex relationships in which the partners are not married &mdash; we should criminalise registrars who hold a different opinion.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, I have grappled with the issue of a conscience clause and concluded that it would provide too much scope for people to opt out of performing their functions.  Registrars who have an objection and refuse to perform their role should lose their position but they should not be prosecuted for doing so.</P>
        <P>I propose to address the issue of providing rights of siblings and carers, whether in this Bill or other legislation.  I come from a rural area.  I know a number of elderly siblings who have lived together all their lives and are not entitled to any State recognition of the relationship they have with each other.  I would like to see that enshrined in legislation, whether in this Bill or in new legislation.  We also need to address the issue of carers who may have given up their lives to look after family members.  That effort on their behalf should be acknowledged by the State.</P>
        <P>Many previous speakers mentioned the position of children.  I used to hold a very particular opinion that children should only be adopted by a man and a woman.  My mind was changed by a very good friend of mine when we were canvassing for the local elections in 2004.  He pointed out to me the number of children who have a father and mother but were unfortunate enough to grow up in an abusive home.  The most important thing for children is to be in a loving family environment.  Whether that is a man and a woman, two men or two women is not the most important issue.  The State has neglected children for too long and that is the most important thing I would like to see enshrined in legislation in the future.</P>
        <P>I have absolute respect for the church&rsquo;s right to express its opinion on this issue and other related issues.  It would be in dereliction of its duty and function within our society if it did not express its opinion.  Equally people who are opposed to this legislation have a right and obligation to express their opposition and to be heard.  Sometimes I get the sense from people who hold very liberal views that they can be very illiberal to people who hold the opposite opinion.  The debate in this House has been conducted very well and in particular I was struck by the contribution of Senator Walsh, with whom I mostly disagree on other issues.  He expressed his opinion very honourably on this subject.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We previously criminalised relationships between people of the same sex.  For many years we have not allowed them to have that relationship recognised by the State.  Despite some reservations I have about registrars and their treatment and strong views I have on the rights of siblings and how that should be acknowledged by the State, because we are taking a step <Col N="205"/>towards the acknowledgement of the relationship of same-sex couples, I will be supporting the Bill on Second Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I genuinely thank Senators for what I believe was a fantastic debate.  Despite the fear of getting criticism yet again from a particular Deputy in the other House, every time I take a Bill to the other House having debated it here, I always mention that there was &mdash; as there always is &mdash; an excellent debate in the Seanad.  A particular Deputy suggested that I might have a hankering to join the Seanad.  I assured him that I do not.  The debate on this and on a number of other significant Bills I have brought through are all the better for the input from the Seanad.  We have had populist soundbites and proposals off the top of the head suggesting that we abolish something that is defined in our Constitution, which is having two Houses in the Oireachtas.  Woe betide anyone who changes that because our legislation is the better for the type of debate we get in this House and indeed in the other House.  If I have any influence on any suggestion to abolish the Seanad, I can assure Members that I will use that influence to ensure it does not happen.  I do not say that in a political way.</P>

        <P>Today&rsquo;s debate does everyone credit.  I have personal friends who spoke against the Bill.  I genuinely understand the conviction they have on the matter.  While I do not agree with it, I respect their views and the way in which they expressed them.  Senator Phelan is correct.</P>
        <P>The decision to introduce the Bill is not just mine, it is the Government&rsquo;s and it is based on the commitment my party made in our manifesto in 2007, building on the republican ethos and the equality agenda to which we are fully committed.  In our previous years in government we showed we were committed to that equality agenda.  I believe this is the right thing to do.  If I had any doubts &mdash; I did not have any doubts &mdash; about introducing this legislation, they were totally dispelled recently when I attended a function at which I launched a report promoted by Outcomers, the gay and lesbian organisation in Dundalk.  It was a very significant report in that it was not about those people who are gay in Dundalk, but about the families of gay people who had come out in Dundalk.  Excellent contributions were made by family members, who were heterosexual, on how they were affected and how they reacted to a member of their family coming out.</P>
        <P>A lady I have known for most of my adult life in Dundalk &mdash; I will not mention her name &mdash; spoke publicly to say &mdash; I did not know this until she said it &mdash; that she was the mother of a gay son.  More than 20 years previously he told her that he was gay.  She and her husband went to a local GP in Dundalk to get advice on what to do about their now declared gay son.  She said they were shown the door by the GP.  She had to come to Dublin to get advice on how to handle this.  She said very eloquently in her own words that regardless of his sexual <Col N="206"/>orientation, she still loved her son.  Any society that does not react to assist not only the gay son but also the family of that gay person to help them deal with the coming out of their child is not the type of society to which we aspire.</P>
        <P>Republicanism has been used by many speakers on both sides of the House in a way that epitomises republicanism.  I do not refer to the type of republicanism that has been hijacked for many years through the troubles, but true republicanism means dealing with people not as how we want them to be, but on a one-to-one basis as they are.  This legislation fulfils that republican ethos.  Despite the reservations of some church leaders, this legislation represents the epitome of dealing with people in a charitable and Christian way.  We are not dealing with the optimum situation as they see it; we are dealing with reality on the ground.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have heard Senator Mullen say we do not have enough research and have not carried out enough examination of all these matters.  I suggest that he go back and look at a report to which I was party when I became Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The title of that ministerial position specifically included &ldquo;family&rdquo; when the then Taoiseach appointed me to the role.  He asked me to go around the country and listen to the public about how we needed to sustain the family in a much changed environment.  A broad consultation was carried out and a massive tome of a report was brought forward in 1998.  It went through all the issues that were pertinent to the Constitution.  Article 41.1.1&deg; states that: &ldquo;The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;.  Article 41.1.2&deg; states that: &ldquo;The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State&rdquo;.  Article 41.3.1&deg; states that: &ldquo;The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack&rdquo;.  The report was exactly about all this.</P>
        <P>Many recommendations were made in the report as to how we should sustain family life in society.  We set up various agencies, such as the Family Support Agency, family resource centres and a family mediation service.  A huge amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money was invested in all sorts of issues to do with counselling for couples and children throughout the country.  This was not a report that sat on the shelf.  This report was implemented by governments of which I was a member and of which I am very proud.  I reject any suggestion that we have not done enough over recent years to sustain family life as recognised in the Constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was no definition of the family in the report because it was not possible to define the perfect family.  There is a good reason for this, as there are so many diverse types of families in society.  That is why I do not accept the argument that this is in some way diluting what some of us would describe as the ideal family, namely, husband, wife and children.  I do not accept the argument that this Bill takes away from that.  This Bill takes from no one but gives basic civil rights in fulfilment of Article 40.1 of the  Constitution, which states that: &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law&rdquo;.  There is a rider to that which states that &ldquo;This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.&rdquo;  That allows the State in its enactments to make differences and distinctions between society, but the general principle is that every citizen should be treated equally before the law.  As far as I am concerned, that is what this Bill does.</P>
        <P>I accept the argument that this Bill perhaps does not go the way everyone would want to go on one side, and equally so for those who believe it goes too far.  It is a balance between those two constitutional imperatives that every person should be treated equally before the law and leave special protection for their family and for marriage.</P><Col N="207"/>
        <P>Some reference has been made to the exclusion of children from the Bill.  The Government spent a significant amount of time looking at this particular issue.  There is an extensive body of law on the welfare of children in areas such as guardianship, maintenance, access and custody.  Many of those issues are faced by different persons, whether they are married or not.  However, the issue of children creates distinct issues, such as the welfare of the child, the constitutional position of the family and surrogacy issues.  A neighbour of mine who is married is becoming involved in what is known as gestational surrogacy.  I found out that there is no law on this issue in the State and that raises problems in respect of the citizenship of a surrogate child born outside the State and how we deal with such issues in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of children also creates rights of the natural father.  Members have referred to &ldquo;our children&rdquo; of same-sex couples, but the reality is that one of the natural parents may not be part of that couple.  Such a natural parent, not part of the same-sex couple, also has rights under our Constitution.  The primacy of rights and duties of parents under the Constitution is based on the biological link between the parents and the child.  If we were to deal with issues in this Bill solely in respect of children of same-sex couples, we would be leaving out issues such as how to deal with children in heterosexual step-families, whether they are based in marriage or not.  The legal issues are similar in those cases.</P>
        <P>If this Bill were to assign parental rights to the civil partner of a child&rsquo;s mother in circumstances where the law does not assign equivalent rights to the mother&rsquo;s heterosexual partner or husband, this would potentially discriminate between children, based on the sexual orientation of the adults caring for them, as well as encroaching on the rights of the biological parents.  It is easy to say that we are not dealing with children in this Bill, but I can assure Senators that it would not be capable of dealing with the issue on its own, especially in such space of time.  I received a submission from the Ombudsman for Children just last night, even though the Bill was published in June 2009.</P>
        <P>Given that some people think the Bill goes too far and others think it does not go far enough, while the ombudsman thinks we should look at the issue of children, perhaps we should just withdraw the Bill and add in these things at a later stage.  However, I think people want this Bill to pass because it deals with the issue of civil partnership in respect of same-sex couples.  There is an issue in respect of children, but there is already an existing body of law.  It may not go as far as some of these people would wish for same-sex couples, but we cannot deal with this issue without dealing with the biological parent who is not part of the same-sex couple.  That is a much wider issue and the Law Reform Commission is looking at it.  I suggest that it is better left to that debate.</P>
        <P>I have heard a lot about freedom of conscience.  I suggest to some of the Fine Gael Senators, in particular, who said that people should just lose their jobs, that we should not go as far as criminalising them and that it is terrible that all these registrars might have a conscientious objection.  This is already provided for in the Civil Registration Act 2004 where on summary conviction, one is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;2,000 or imprisonment for a term of six months or both or on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;10,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to five years or both.  It has been in legislation since 2004 and it has worked very well.  No registrar has been convicted under the legislation.  Registrars could have objected on religious grounds on the basis that they object to divorce but they have not done so.  I respectfully suggest that is a bit of a red herring and another issue thrown up to throw dust in the eyes of people and say we are going to send all these registrars to prison.  We have had consultations with An Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheoir in this regard and no registrar has indicated any difficulty with the implementation of this legislation or of the divorce legislation since 2004.</P><Col N="208"/>
        <P>As a matter of public policy, it ill behoves anyone to suggest that when we pass a law, we should give public servants the opportunity to decide whether they wish to implement it.  People quote section 37 of the employment legislation in regard to goods and services.  Perhaps we will go into this on Committee Stage when we can discuss it in more detail.</P>
        <P>I respectfully suggest it is tailored, and decided on by the Supreme Court, in a way that clearly indicates that, in regard to the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression and of religion, there is some ability for people to ensure the ethos of their religion is retained.  Again, I respectfully suggest there is a muddying of the water in this regard.</P>
        <P>Some people referred to the use of church property.  Section 59E states: &ldquo;A civil partnership may be registered only at a place and time chosen by the parties to the civil partnership with the agreement of the registrar and, if the place chosen is not the office of a registrar, the approval of the place by the Executive, and the question whether to give or withhold the approval, shall be determined by the Executive by reference to the matters that the Minister may specify.&rdquo;  The executive is the HSE.</P>
        <P>To suggest that a church could be used for a ceremony is a red herring.  The only way a church could be used by a gay couple for a civil partnership ceremony would be at the behest of the church involved.  Under the legislation, the couple must apply to the HSE to have the church certified as being capable of being a place for a civil partnership to be registered.  Any church which does not want to participate in this has a complete get out clause in section 59E.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, if a church hall is not used for worship but is rented out by the church, under existing equality legislation, the church is precluded from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation.  There are nine grounds on which it cannot refuse use.  We are not touching the existing legislation which prevents discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, ethos, etc.</P>
        <P>Many amendments have been genuinely tabled.  We have looked at them in the relatively short space of time available.  I thank my officials, in particular, for the hard work they have done over the past 48 hours.  We have looked at the amendments but I am very reluctant to upset the balance we have struck in this legislation.  However, I will listen to the debate.</P>
        <P>Originally we intended to take this legislation in the House next week.  Senator Regan mentioned in his opening words that the D&aacute;il would not be sitting so we could not have accepted amendments but it will not be for that reason.  We decided to take the Bill this week rather than next week in deference to any suggestion that we might be taking this House for granted.  I have looked at all the amendments closely with my officials and there are a couple of major issues, such as freedom of conscience in regard to registrars, church property, children and siblings, which we can address on Committee Stage but my hands a relatively tied in regard to acceptance of amendments.</P>
        <P>I thank all the Senators who spoke.  This was one of the best debates in which I have participated since I became a Member of the Oireachtas more than 23 years ago.  It is a credit to Senators on both sides of the argument who participated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for taking this Bill at short notice.  This is a small two section Bill with just one section of a substantive nature.</P>
        <P>The amendment to section 217(6) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 proposed in this Bill was introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il during discussions on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which was initiated here in the Seanad.  That Bill is due to return to the Seanad next week for report and conclusion.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately a timing issue has arisen which has necessitated the introduction at short notice of this Compulsory Purchase Orders (Extension of Time limits) Bill 2010 to deal solely with the amendment to section 217(6) of the Planning and Development Act.  Under section 217(6), once An Bord Plean&aacute;la confirms a compulsory purchase order, the local authority has 18 months in which to serve notices to treat on any landowner affected.  If they fail to do so, the CPO lapses.</P>
        <P>Where judicial review proceedings are taken the likely timeframe for reaching a conclusion means the CPO notices to treat may expire before the legal action concludes.  The difficulty this presents is that the work undertaken and expense incurred by local authorities on schemes that go into judicial review but which are subsequently given the go-ahead, will then be redundant because the prescribed time period for the CPO has expired.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Such a situation may arise if this Bill is not enacted today.  The project involved is the Galway city outer bypass where, as the result of a referral to the European Court of Justice arising from a challenge to the An Bord Plean&aacute;la approval for the road scheme, the CPO 18 months limit will expire at midnight tonight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Bill providing for the amendment to section 217 of the Planning and Development Acts will not be enacted in time to deal with the lapse of the Galway CPO notices to treat, a Bill has been prepared which contains the relevant provision from the proposed Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.  This will resolve the situation where court proceedings lead to the expiry of local authority CPOs before a decision is reached.  It will mean the CPOs in the case of the Galway outer bypass project will be extended until at least 30 days after the court decision is reached.</P>
        <P>The European Court of Justice is not likely to rule on the referral for some time.  Therefore the purpose of the Bill is to avoid the considerable expense and work associated with repeating the CPO process in the event of a positive decision by the European Court of Justice.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 217 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The effect of the proposed amendment is that where there are legal proceedings <Col N="210"/>challenging a compulsory purchase or consents relating to a particular project, and a notice to treat is not served within 18 months, the time limit for serving the notice can be extended to the earlier of 30 days after the conclusion of the legal proceedings or 18 months after the expiry of the initial 18 month period.  This section also provides that in the event that the legal proceedings are not concluded within the extended time limit provided for in section 1, the relevant local authority can apply to the High Court for a further extension and the High Court if it considers there is sufficient grounds for doing so can allow such a further extension as it considers reasonable and fair in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that this Bill only deals with CPOs and notices to treat involving local authorities.  No Government agency, such as the NRA or CIE, will be in a position to avail of the provisions of this Bill.  This is a matter which should be reviewed at a later stage.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the Bill is merely the Short Title and collective citation and is a standard provision in all Bills placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the Minister of State.  However, it is unfortunate we are welcoming him in this circumstance.  For the second time in a week, we are correcting legislation that has proven to be inadequate or not properly co-ordinated because of lack of communication between Departments.  The House is being used to correct legislation that should have been properly debated and all loopholes closed.  This is a lesson for us that legislation should not be rushed and should be given proper focus and attention by those who bring it before the Oireachtas.  I do not know if this has been caused by a lack of communication.  The Government seems to be in disarray at present.  The Government&rsquo;s eye is off the ball with regard to fulfilling basic legislative duties.  This is the second example of this disarray in a week.  Last week we had rushed legislation to make provision for firearms certificates because people had been carrying firearms illegally because a Criminal Justice Act had not been implemented properly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nevertheless, this is important legislation.  Compulsory purchase orders are an important power of the State and of local authorities.  They are often required to ensure that large infrastructural projects, like the Galway city bypass, go ahead.  It is important that such facilities are available to local authorities and State agencies.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the Bill is being rushed through to save unnecessary expense and increase the time limits of compulsory purchase orders.  However, it is unfortunate that legislation is being rushed through the House in the second last week of our sitting.  This should not happen.  It shows that the Government&rsquo;s eye is off the ball and that it is distracted at present.</P>

	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State, even in an express role to deal with an urgent problem.  Senator Coffey says the Government is at fault.  The fault lies with the administrative staff of various organisations who do not do their job in time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities are to blame.  We are all running into this problem.  Compulsory purchase orders are issued and left lying so nothing is done for an age.  On top of that, the authorities do not even fulfil the payment terms and everything ends up in a mess. <Col N="211"/> Some local authorities, and the NRA, end up paying people years after roads have been completed.  This is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>This is emergency legislation to save the State money.  That is the most important point.  It is terrible to think we must have rushed legislation because someone did not do his or her<?oasys _jy ?>job.</P>
        <P>We must also remember that the Bill we are amending is ten years old.  We all know what can happen in the space of ten years.  What is legally correct one day might, because of a judgment somewhere along the line, be totally turned on top of its head.  This evening&rsquo;s work has to be done.</P>
        <P>I am sure Senators Coffey and Hannigan will agree that if the State would save money by having this emergency legislation passed it should be done.  No one wants to see the State spending money unnecessarily or having to pay legal costs because legislation was not passed in time.  I commend the Bill to the House because we are doing the State some service and also saving it some money, which means we are saving the ordinary taxpayer money also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Calleary.  However, I would prefer to be looking at the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, because it is my belief, having examined the Bill, that it should be dealt with by his Department, not, with all due respect, by the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department.  I would like to see the Minister take on this legislation.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Ellis&rsquo;s comments about who was at fault on this rushed legislation.  I have in my hand a letter from the Galway county manager who states very clearly that she brought this issue to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe.  It appears she is also of the view that it should be dealt with by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Therefore, I query why the Minister is not in the House today, as I would like to hear his views on the rights and wrongs of the matter.  My view is that any legislation which is rushed is very dangerous.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Ellis&rsquo;s point on the potential cost to the State.  No one in this House wants to see the State incur additional costs, but, at the same time, we have a duty to make sure any legislation enacted is proper and fit for purpose.  This legislation was only placed in my hands two hours ago and we have not had an opportunity to take legal advice on the matter.  I have no problem with the Galway city outer bypass project in terms of the benefits for the people of Galway and beyond, but this is not about the rights and wrongs of the matter but of the Government&rsquo;s failure to get its act together.  As a result, we face serious difficulties with this rushed legislation which should be dealt with by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government rather than the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department.  Therefore, we will be opposing the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I am taking the legislation is that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has other engagements; that is the only issue.  The reason it is being taken in this fashion is that it was due to be debated as part of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill which is being brought back to the House next week, but there are unique circumstances in regard to the CPO for the bypass project for which I am glad the Senator has been so definitive in his support.  I believe this is the first time a Labour Party politician has been so definitive in his support for the project.</P>

We should see the matter through and then have a full discussion on the amendments made in the D&aacute;il to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.

	<P Just="Left">I draw the attention of Senators to a drafting error in the Bill.  In the version of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on page 91, line 15, &ldquo;on that behalf&rdquo; should read &ldquo;in that behalf&rdquo;.  Accordingly, as provided for in Standing Orders, I will instruct the Clerk of the Seanad to make the formal correction to the text of the Bill.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 13, subsection (1), lines 16 and 17, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;Civil&rdquo; in line 16 down to and including &ldquo;2010&rdquo; in line 17 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Partnership and Cohabitants (Non marital Relationships) Act 2010&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As stated on Second Stage, we have a number of concerns with regard to this Bill.  One aspect in this regard is the fact that the rights it confers more or less mirror those relating to marriage.  Many of the amendments we have tabled are designed to ensure there is a clear distinction between civil partnership and marriage.  The first of these, amendment No. 1, proposes a change to the Title of the Bill.  In the D&aacute;il, the Minister amended the Title so that it now reads &ldquo;Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 1 proposes that the Title should be &ldquo;Partnership and Cohabitants (Non marital Relationships) Act 2010&rdquo;, which is a tidier formation.</P>
        <P>We have not, however, tabled amendment No. 1 in order that the Title to the Bill might be more streamlined.  Effectively, we wish to signal that there is a definite distinction with regard to partnership, cohabitation and marriage.  That is why the term &ldquo;non-marital relationships&rdquo; is included in the amendment.  For various reasons outlined on Second Stage, we are of the view that it is imperative this change be reflected throughout the Bill.  A number of the later amendments we have tabled do, perhaps, put the case in this regard more clearly.  When they are discussed, we may be able to argue further in respect of this matter.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On Second Stage, the Minister and various Senators stated there was all-party agreement on the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  While there may have been all-party agreement, it is certain there was not agreement among all Members of the Lower House on the Bill.  The reservations I articulated on Second Stage were also reflected within my party.  At that point, I read into the record of the House a motion tabled at a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party and which was signed by 15 Deputies and 11 Senators.  Within Fine Gael, the second largest party in the Houses, a significant number of people were particularly engaged in respect of the conscience clause.  I spoke to a number of these individuals.  Five or six Deputies from Fine Gael were very much engaged with regard to the conscience aspect and some of them indicated publicly that they wanted changes to be introduced and that they intended to table amendments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not wish to comment, in a pejorative sense, on the business of the Lower House.  How it conducts its business is its own affair and how the Seanad conducts its business is our affair.  However, when Marriage Equality and the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland applied to appear before what was then the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights to outline their views on the Bill, several members of that committee, including me, suggested that we should also seek the opinions of other bodies.  On foot of this, a decision was made that submissions would be accepted but that there would be no oral hearings.  On the day on which this decision was made, Fine Gael&rsquo;s then spokesperson on justice, Deputy Charles Flanagan, sought clarification to the effect that only members of the select committee would be in a position to table amendments.  That removed the option for certain members of his party to bring forward amendments.  Some of these individuals expressed their personal views on this matter on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It is important that this fact be highlighted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had a good debate on Second Stage.  That was acknowledged by Senators on both sides of the argument.  If I recall correctly, the Minister stated that it was as fine a debate as he has heard in either House during his time as a Member &mdash; a period of some 23 or 24 years.  Having <Col N="214"/>engaged in such a good debate, it would be a pity if none of the amendments we have tabled, some of which are substantial and others of which are more symbolic in nature, was accepted.  Symbolism is nonetheless important.  The message we, as legislators, send to society on this matter, especially in the context of our system of values and the matters within our Constitution that are held to be important, must be clear.  It is for that reason we have tabled an amendment to the Title of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not support the amendment because it is unnecessary.  The Title to the Bill was changed in the Lower House and is perfectly clear in its intent.  On the general issue of the distinction to be made between the family and non-marital relationships, which is the purpose of the amendment, there is no confusion.  The Bill does not involve a change to the Constitution.  It is designed to provide rights and dignity to people involved in relationships which are different in form from marriage.  There is no lack of clarity in the Bill and, in such circumstances, I cannot support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party is also opposed to the amendment.  It is clear that civil partnership is not marriage.  The Labour Party has been critical of the Bill because it is of the view that it does not create a status that is close enough to equality or marriage.  However, we support the concept of civil partnership as an advance.  It is only now that the many people who were involved in loving and committed relationships for a long period will obtain legal recognition from the State in respect of those relationships.  It is a shame that there are those who are seeking to restrict the Title of the Bill so that it will, as it nears its entry into law, only refer to partnership and non-marital relationships.  That is mean-minded and mean-spirited and is not in keeping with the generous and progressive nature of the legislation.</P>
        <P>Even though the Labour Party believes the Bill does not go far enough, we are of the view that it is generous and progressive.  This legislation represents an enormous step forward not just for the members of the gay community in Irish society but for all citizens.  It marks a step up in maturity and a move towards a more inclusive and more tolerant Irish republic.  As a republican, I am of the view that even as we criticise the Bill for not going far enough, we should support it to the fullest extent possible.  Seeking to restrict it further is something neither I nor my party could support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment and I concur with the remarks made by Senator Walsh.  The Senator placed into perspective the fact that we engaged in a good debate on Second Stage.  I am disappointed, therefore, that Senator Bacik in some way resents that we are seeking to protect our ideals.  We engaged in a good debate on Second Stage because, as democrats, we accept that this is the process which must be undergone.  To use a term such as &ldquo;mean-minded&rdquo; so loosely is very unfair and could almost be regarded as being anti-democratic.  We have tabled a number of amendments to the Bill.  It might be the case that those of us who do not agree with the Labour Party&rsquo;s amendments could use terms such as that to which I refer in respect of them.  I will not be using such terms because I respect everyone&rsquo;s right to put forward their views.  The best legislation is produced when people feel free to express their views.  There should be no personal animosity involved.  The cut and thrust of political life is built on the notion that we should tease out every single element of legislation brought before us in this House.  I would like to think the Minister accepts that, when we propose an amendment, we are not trying to muddy the waters.  I am certainly not trying to do so.  I feel strongly about what I am saying.</P>
        <P>Messages have been pouring into my office for the last few hours.  I am inundated with messages.  I have not received any hate mail from anyone.  I respect those who did not send me <Col N="215"/>such mail.  They accept that we are going through a democratic process.  I would be worried for the future if we were in some way to feel restricted or, even worse, intimidated, as we try to express our views.  That is not the intent of this House and certainly should not be.  Perhaps it was in the past, but I have not noticed it in my 13 years as a Senator.</P>
        <P>I accept that people may believe they have a reason to celebrate.  They have expressed that feeling exceptionally well in the House and I wish them well.  I am anxious to make my views known in the hope we might be able to convince the Minister to revisit some of these issues.  Our proposals are very reasonable.</P>
        <P>The suggestion the Title of the Bill be amended is not mean-minded.  It has been proposed to copperfasten what the Minister is saying about the difference between civil partnership and marriage.  That message needs to be transmitted.  If, on some future occasion, the Minister or some future Minister introduces legislation to move these arrangements in the direction of marriage, we will debate the issue at the appropriate time.  I am supporting the amendment for the reasons mentioned by Senator Walsh.  If it is accepted, it will clarify issues for the general public.</P>

	<P>The Senator was extremely restrained.  I would like to comment on the language used during the debate on the amendment.  I compliment the three gentlemen on the other side on their newly acquired, if specious, status of victimhood.  They were politically astute when they jumped before they were pushed.  If they had not been pushed, I had a loaded pistol and most certainly would have pulled the trigger.  I will tell the House why.  On the subject of respect, there has been no retraction of the odious comment made about the Penal Laws, about which I continue to feel very deeply, if I am allowed to have feelings.  The other day, after I had been struck by posters and prevented by the allies of the conservative side in this debate from expressing my right to freedom of speech on Bloomsday, a democrat on this side of the House told me it would be better to make a laugh out of the incident rather than pretending to have feelings I did not have.  Apparently, I now have to apply for permission to experience my own feelings.  That is a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make it clear that I think this is a mean-minded and thoroughly nasty amendment.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; presumed to tell me what those whom he <Col N="216"/>inaccurately described as the bishops of the Protestant church believed on this issue.  He got it wrong.  I am a long-standing member of the Anglican church.  Apparently, I cannot even stand by my own church.  I know exactly how to interpret what is happening.  I say the amendment is mean-minded because, having persuaded the Government to make a clear distinction between various marital states, certain interests then felt the need to rub our noses in it, as a community, by making an amendment to the Title, contrary to all the evidence from other countries.  The entire purpose of the change was to rub the noses of the members of the gay community in their second-class status, just in case we had not noticed it.  For that reason, I will definitely oppose the amendment.  </P>
        <P>I have a lot to say about freedom of speech and freedom of conscience.  It would be wonderful if that debate were to take place tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the amendment, too.  The inclusion of the word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; is fine, but the inclusion of the term &ldquo;non-marital relationships&rdquo; could cover many forms of relationship not of an intimate variety.  There can be partnerships in business, etc.  This change would water down the Title of the Bill and make it so broad that it would cover almost every form of relationship in society.  Each of us has plenty of relationships of various forms.  We had a good debate on Second Stage.  It would be a shame if the debate on the Committee Stage amendments were to degenerate into insults and name calling.  I hope we can try to keep this out of the debate.</P>

	<P>I am surprised, delighted and somewhat bemused to hear Senators Bacik and Norris express their support for what Senator McDonald said.  However, I am glad to hear it.  I support the reasonable amendment proposed by Senator Walsh.  I do not understand why Senator Bacik characterised it as restricting further what was on offer.  The Title of a Bill is largely descriptive of what is contained in it.  Senator Walsh is striving for accuracy in the context of the constitutional preference for, and recognition of, marriage.  He is simply seeking to describe what we are talking about in direct terms such as &ldquo;partnership&rdquo;, &ldquo;cohabitants&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-marital relationships&rdquo;.  If such a modest proposal leads to the kind of response we have just heard from Senators Bacik and Norris, I do not know what is in store for the rest of the evening, when Members who have more substantive objections to the Bill stand up and explain their reasons.  As I listened to Senator Norris, I could not help asking myself if this was the man who wanted to unite everybody as President of Ireland.  That was not showing a spirit of kindness towards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to nip in the bud a rather unhealthy tendency towards using a divisive and aggressive debating technique.  I hope I will succeed.  I will try to avoid using terms such as &ldquo;mean-minded&rdquo; which was used by Senator Bacik.  I never look at the motives of those who disagree with me.  I never try to claim they have a particular reason or motivation for doing what they do.  I criticise them on the merits of their case.  If I have ever failed to achieve such a distinction, I apologise.  I certainly try to live by this rule which involves <Col N="217"/>not looking into people&rsquo;s motivations and not judging them personally, even if I disagree with their approach to an argument.</P>
        <P>I would like to respond briefly to what Senator Regan had to say.  One cannot take away people&rsquo;s dignity, or confer it on them.  They have their own dignity.  I would oppose any legislative measure that sought to detract from their dignity.</P>
        <P>We have heard many references in recent times to the &ldquo;new republic&rdquo;.  I suspect some have a certain idea of what the new republic will be like.  They seem to expect it will involve the separation of church and State, which I would support.  People have to remember that the new republic will have to accommodate all of its citizens, including those who can be characterised as traditionalists, liberals or radicals.</P>
        <P>In supporting Senator Walsh I appeal to Members to moderate their language and be temperate in their disagreements.  If they are not going to be temperate, I have to ask the following question: if this is what they are like in victory, what would they be like in defeat?</P>

	<P>There is time to step back from the temperature being created in this debate.  When I spoke on Second Stage I do not believe I offended or insulted anyone nor did I personalise the debate but I was shocked by the aggressive tone I just heard and the underlying virtual threats which come with it.  That cannot be correct.  Amendments have been tabled in a democratic way.  It is up to both sides to put forward their case and set out their stall.  It will not help the debate if we are to go down the road of name-calling, personalisation and insults.  I will not engage in that.  I never have in my 13 years in the Seanad and do not intend to start now.  For the sake of the debate and the amendments, it is time for those who started it to step back at this point.</P>

	<P>I shall refer to this when we come to much more fundamental amendments in regard to what we will allow take place, whereby people of reasonable and tolerant views will find themselves in jail as a consequence of those views.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested we are mean-spirited.  That would not be my intention in any way.  Senator Bacik may have had a point, which I had not noticed until now, with regard to placing &ldquo;civil&rdquo; ahead of &ldquo;partnership&rdquo;, so that the title would read &ldquo;Civil partnership and cohabitants non-marital relationships Bill 2010&rdquo;.  If the Minister is minded to accept the amendment, I am happy to allow him bring back his own proposal in that regard on Report Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The thrust of what we are endeavouring to do in this amendment is to make a reference in the Title that clearly distinguishes the civil partnership, which is the subject of this Bill, and the cohabitant arrangement as being entirely different from marital relationships.  I make no apology to anyone inside or outside this House.  I have stated that consistently since Senator Norris tabled his Civil Partnership Bill in 2005.  I said I would support measures he sought, justifiably, in respect of people in his own community who have suffered long and hard because of discrimination.  I acknowledge that.  However, I stated that the threshold for me would be equivalence to marriage.  I oppose marriage equality measures for same-sex couples because I believe marriage is for heterosexual couples.  It is safeguarded in the Constitution and there are very good reasons, which we may touch on later, as to why that is the case.</P>

	<P>When I concluded on Second Stage I said this had been one of the best debates in the past 23 years.  I hope I will not have to retract that statement at the end of the evening or whenever this Bill passes.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand this amendment and cannot put that point better than Senator McDonald did.  Before I came into this House I was a member of a partnership although it was not a civil partnership.  The proposed amendment suggests the Bill should be called the partnership and cohabitants non-marital relationship Bill 2010.  I believe Senator Walsh is nodding in the direction that instead of his amendment deleting the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; the word should be left in which might make it better from his point of view.  In other words it would be the civil partnership and cohabitants non-marital relationship Bill 2010.</P>
        <P>However, the reference to non-marital does not describe the Bill properly.  The Bill is in two parts, one being the civil partnership element, the other the cohabitant element.  In the D&aacute;il we accepted the suggestion from the Opposition that, as originally initiated, the Civil Partnership Bill did not properly reflect the two distinct elements to the Bill.  That is why we tabled an amendment and although we did not accept the exact amendment proposed by the Opposition, having discussed it with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and within my Department, the best solution as far as we were concerned was the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>All right.  That is fine.  I am very happy to leave it at what the Minister had to say.  I cannot speak for other people but I am a humble and totally imperfect member of the Anglican communion so I doubt if I can accurately be termed an aggressive secularist.  However, I believe in the separation of church and state and just as I believe the state should be separated from the church so the church should be separated from the state.  It is an equal position and I believe in equality.  Senator Walsh acknowledged, very charmingly and honestly, that in this instance he simply does not believe in equality.  I do not think I misinterpret him because he said he did not believe in marriage equality or that the two should be equal.  He stated he does not believe in equality and on that point I beg to differ with him.  However, despite the various imprecations, I hope I am still allowed to express this view in the House.  I shall not speak on this amendment again and hope it comes to a vote shortly because there are a very large number of amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I believe I am in order to speak on issues that arise on Committee Stage.  I am not trying to delay the Bill.  It is not our intention to delay.  However, I wish to deal with it because the Minister made the same point in his summing up on Second Stage.  I clearly outlined on Second Stage my interpretation of republican equality which differs from the interpretation of left-wing liberals.  It is equality of opportunity for the individual.  The Constitution refers to equality for each person, as the Minister rightly pointed out when he quoted from it.  Senator Norris is talking about equality for different types of relationships and what is involved is not individual relationships but couples or institutions such as marriage.  The interpretation of republican equality does not stretch to all relationships or to all situations such that they should be equal.  It pertains specifically to persons.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the specific amendment that my colleagues and I tabled, I accept it could be interpreted that due to the omission of the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; the proposed wording to be inserted <Col N="220"/>could appear narrow-minded.  If the wording proposed to be inserted was &ldquo;civil partnership and cohabitants (non marital relationships) Act 2010&rdquo;, I would press the amendment.   However, in view of the fact that we have omitted &ldquo;civil&rdquo; from the proposed words to be inserted and that people might take offence, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome what Senator Walsh said by way of clarification.  The more widely accepted principle in regard to equality is that all persons are equal but different situations can be treated differently.  It is worth remembering what our Constitution has to say in that regard in Article 40.1 on equality, which provides that the State can have regard in its enactments to differences of capacity and function.  Therefore, just as it is acceptable for some people to see an appropriate inequality between intimate couples and non-intimate couples, by the same token it is surely appropriate to argue that the doctrine of equality does not necessarily mean that all relationships have to be viewed by the law in the exact same way.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo; &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; means a person under the age of 18 years, or if the person has attained that age&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) is a person who is or will be or, if an order were made under any Act providing for periodical payments for his or her support or for the provision of a lump sum for the child, would be receiving full-time education or instruction at any university, institute of technology, college, school or other educational establishment and is under the age of 23 years, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) is a person who has an intellectual or physical disability to such extent that it is not reasonably possible for the child to maintain himself or herself fully;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">All these amendments deal with the important matter of the defence of the rights of children.  As I spoke on the Order of Business today concerning this matter, I do not intend to rehearse these matters in any great detail, but it is important that we highlight the strong support of the majority of the Members of this House for the rights of children.  I had tabled these amendments with considerable care before I received a very significant document, entitled Advice of the Ombudsman for Children on the Civil Partnership Bill 2009, yesterday afternoon from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  The ombudsman is the person and office charged with vindicating the rights of children in this State.  For that reason it is important that those who cherish the rights of children in this State, especially politicians and particularly in the passage of legislation such as this, should listen with due attention to what is in this document.  I will, <Col N="221"/>with the indulgence of the House, as it is directly relevant, quote briefly what I regard as the most salient points of this significant document.  I would like the House to consider that I believe that these comments cover all the amendments I have proposed.  I cannot speak for my colleagues who tabled the other amendments.  Amendment No. 64 is in the name of Senator Bacik and her colleagues and amendment No. 63 is in my name.  All these amendments represent the same point of view.  I know that to be the case from my conversation with Senator Bacik.</P>
        <P>In the introduction to this document, the ombudsman states:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]he Bill does not adequately address the rights and needs of children.  It is clear that the situation of children was considered at length in the drafting of the Bill; it is unclear why that resulted in a Bill that did not prioritise the rights and interests of children.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is very clear.  It is not prejudiced.  There is no intolerance and there is no name calling.  It just states an objective fact, that it is clear the rights of children were considered but were omitted from the Bill and it is not clear why it did not prioritise them.</P>
        <P>The ombudsman goes on in the document to indicate that this is not a hypothetical problem or abstraction, it is something that deals directly with a very real and existing situation.  The ombudsman states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The omission of robust protections for the children of civil partners will have real consequences for the young people concerned and it is in their interests that the law reflect and provide for the reality of their lives.  Current research being carried out in Ireland on the experience of young adult children with same-sex parents has indicated that there is a strong awareness among these young people of the lack of recognition of the reality of their family lives.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I outlined the very clear results of the Swedish commission which was instructed to investigate this matter in 1999 by the Swedish Parliament.  Interestingly, it acknowledged that there might be some negative consequences for children in same-sex relationships, but it also made it very clear that this came not from the same-sex partnership relationship but from peer group pressure.  In other words, the children were expected to pay in their own lives for the prejudices of the society that some groups would still wish to foster.  That puts the blame very squarely on opponents of these kinds of measures.</P>
        <P>The ombudsman goes on to say in the document: &ldquo;the failure to provide adequately for children in the Bill is concerning, particularly as no arguments based primarily on the interests of children has been advanced by the Government to support its approach to children in the Bill&rdquo;.  I understand it is suggested that this will be addressed in other Bills.  The Adoption Bill was passed recently and there was no hint that this issue would be addressed in it, although there were some interesting points made in the debate on that Bill.  The Government did not take opportunities already offered to address this issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister might feel a sense of pleasant surprise about this, as I did when I got this document yesterday evening.  I had no inkling that the Ombudsman for Children was so deeply concerned about this matter that she would provide impetus politically for this kind of change.  Even long before that the Minister will know very well, because he is not only a decent man he is a highly intelligent man, that the Colley report stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Given that the welfare of the child is paramount, in principle, same-sex couples who are married or in a full civil partnership should be eligible for consideration to adopt any child who is eligible for adoption.  It should be noted that, rather than confer a right to adopt, this <Col N="222"/>would allow registered same-sex couples the right to be considered for adoption subject to the existing rigorous assessment process for married couples and single adopters already in place under the Adoption Acts.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I emphasise that I will not be returning to make these quotations.  I apologise to my colleagues if they are long-winded but they are directly germane to the content, and I will not be repeating them.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that part of my amendment deals with the protection of &ldquo;a person who has an intellectual or physical disability to such an extent that it is not reasonably possible for the child to maintain himself or herself fully&rdquo;.  I would be interested to learn of an objection to that, particularly on, as we would say in Ireland, the day that is in it when a very large number of people campaigned outside the gates of these Houses for the rights of people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The recommendation of the ombudsman&rsquo;s document states: &ldquo;Provision should be made in law for special guardianship orders, either in the Civil Partnership Bill or in other appropriate legislation, particularly in the absence of an amendment to the law governing the eligibility criteria for adoption.&rdquo;  I respectfully say to the Minister that this is what I have provided.  I hope the amendments I and my distinguished colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, tabled with the support of the Labour Party will have the support of the Fine Gael Party.  If I may allow myself an aside on this, some negative comments were made about Fine Gael from the other side of the House.  I will not be negative in my response but I would like to take the comments positively and say that I am deeply grateful to Fine Gael, its Leader in the House, Senator Frances Fitzgerald, and Senator Eugene Regan for their dignified and courageous espousal of this cause.  Even before that, in very difficult times when in their party there was a nasty attempt to amend the legislation decriminalising homosexuality, a wonderful group of Fine Gael people filibustered the amendment out of existence.  I honour and salute them for it.  I would not like Fine Gael to be excluded from the paean of praise which has been rightly paid to Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour and the Green Party.  All the parties have behaved with great honour in this process.</P>

	<P>Can we get back to the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  It is clear that the children of same-sex parents who enter into civil partnerships are greatly disadvantaged.  I have tabled these amendments with the intention of starting the process of redressing this wrong.  I believe, from the comments of the Minister in his speech earlier today, that it is his intention to address this at some stage.</P>
        <P>I was told there would be a vote on Second Stage and I am determined to vote with the Government and will continue to do so until the very last minute in the hope that this Bill will be amended, even on Report Stage.  If that does not happen I will have to vote against the Bill but I believe it will pass anyway.  It is important for people like me, who have the significant luxury of being Independent, to be able to hold the Government to the gold standard, even in circumstances where it may not feel it to be a practical approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to support these amendments, three of which were tabled by Senator Norris with the support of the Labour Party and one of which we tabled, amendment No. 64 which in essence has the same aim as amendment No. 63.  All four amendments have in common the main and critical aim of seeking to write into the Bill the rights of children which are noticeably lacking now.  The single biggest criticism of the model of civil partnership with which the Minister has presented us is that it makes no provision for the rights of the children of gay couples.</P><Col N="223"/>
        <P Just="Left">As I said, we know many children are living in families with gay parents whose rights are not recognised, in particular their rights <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the non-birth or non-adoptive parent in the relationship.  Senator Norris referred to the very helpful advice of the Ombudsman for Children, which I quoted.  It is worth noting that she said the children of same-sex parents who enter into a civil partnership will be left at a clear disadvantage compared with other children if the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill remains as it is.  She made some very practical suggestions for amendments to the Bill and many of her recommendations are incorporated into these amendments and in amendments Nos. 5 and 37 which we also tabled with the support of Senator Norris.</P>
        <P>The ombudsman recommended that provision be made in the Bill for special guardianship, which is what amendment No. 37 seeks to do, to ensure the non-birth or non-adoptive parent in a gay couple who enter a civil partnership would be able to be made a guardian of the child, which would then give him or her rights of access and other rights if the relationship were to break down.  Any provision for that is notably absent from the Bill.  She also recommended that the Bill be amended to ensure adequate protection for the children of civil partners in the areas of shared home protection, maintenance, succession, dissolution of civil partnerships and related matters.  They are very important areas.</P>
        <P>It is wrong to say there is no reference to children in the Bill.  I am sure the Minister will refer us to the provisions which exist and are welcome but they are very limited.  Section 73(8) provides for the succession rights of a child of a civil partner&rsquo;s estate but it does not refer to the child of a non-birth or non-adoptive parent in a civil partnership, which again is a major omission.  Section 129, which was section 127 when the ombudsman referred to it, also refers in the context of the dissolution of a civil partnership to a court being able to have regard to the child to whom either civil partner owes an obligation of support.  Again, that is welcome because it will give some discretion to the courts to make maintenance orders but there is nothing in the Bill about the rights of child to the guardianship of their parent who is not a birth or adoptive parent within a civil partnership which is a glaring omission and will place the children of gay families at a real disadvantage.</P>
        <P>I am very grateful to Senator Norris for tabling these amendments.  We planned to draft similar amendments and when we saw his amendments were framed in such a well-crafted way, we felt they were worth supporting.  Amendment No. 2 defines &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; very similarly to the definition already provided in the Bill in section 171 which provides for the children of cohabiting couples.  It is very close to the Minister&rsquo;s wording and I do not see why he could not support it.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 22 simply refers to writing in the dependent child in section 29 and amendments Nos. 63 and 64 seek to do similar things, giving the court specific power to have regard to the circumstances of the dependent child or children of civil partners.  These are vital amendments which need to be made to ensure the children in gay families have rights and status equal to those in marital families.</P>
        <P>In 1987 we abolished the status of illegitimacy and no longer think it acceptable for a child to have a different status depending on whether his or her parents are cohabiting or marital, but we still regard the children of gay couples in a different and discriminatory way, as the ombudsman has so clearly pointed put.  The Minister said he is awaiting a review from the Law Reform Commission on this area but we have been waiting a long time.  Senator Norris pointed out that when we debated the Adoption Bill, to which he and I tabled amendments on special guardianship and extending eligibility to adopt to gay couples, the Minster of State, Deputy Andrews, told us this Bill would come to the House which would be a more appropriate time to consider the issue.</P><Col N="224"/>
        <P>We have been waiting long enough.  It may well be that the review will provide greater guidance as to how we may see a comprehensive reform of the law on children, which we very much welcome, but this is the time, given that we are passing a law which will recognise gay couples for the first time and giving the status of civil partnership, that we should also be giving status and rights to the many existing children of gay couples and give them rights in this Bill.  I urge the Minister to accept these amendments and the others we have tabled with the aim of seeking to write the rights of the child back into the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support these amendments.  They are carefully crafted and fill the lacuna in the legislation.  The Bill, as drafted, assumes there are no children of same-sex relationships.  On whether the issue is dealt with in this Bill or another, the Minister has not been clear as to his intentions in this regard and I raised this question on Report Stage.  For example, amendment No. 64 simply provides for the court to have regard to the fact that when a partnership is dissolved, provisions that the court considers proper, having regard to the circumstances which exist, will be made for any dependent child or children of the civil partners.  It is very light, sensible and appropriate.</P>
        <P>I referred on Report Stage to the judgment of Miss Justice Elizabeth Dunne in the Zappone and Gilligan case.  She stated that undoubtedly people in the position of the plaintiff, be they same-sex or heterosexual couples, can suffer great difficulty or hardship in the event of the death or serious illness of the death of his or her partner and that it is hoped that the legislative changes to ameliorate these difficulties will not be long in coming.  She went on to say that ultimately it is for the Legislature to determine the extent to which such changes should be made.</P>
        <P>I also referred to the judgment of Mr. Justice Hedigan in which he speaks about the <i>de facto</i> family.  He stated that it seemed to him that the State had a strong interest in the recognition, maintenance and protection of all <i>de facto</i> families which exist since they are inherently supportive units, albeit unrecognised by the Constitution.  In terms of children not following through, there is a lacuna.  The general principle of recognising the relationships of same-sex couples and cohabitants confers dignity on them by acknowledging their worth and, as Mr. Justice Hedigan stated, the strong interest in maintaining and protecting all <i>de facto</i> families.  For too long that has been denied.</P>
        <P>I support the amendments, although I do not expect the Minister to accept them because he has set his face against all of the amendments.  I hope, however, that he will indicate whether he intends to address the issues raised by revising the Guardianship of Infants Act or other legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I find I have conflicting attitudes to the amendments.  I am inclined to support Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendments.  As I have consistently supported the principle that our legislation should be child rather than adult centred, it is difficult to argue against including the concept of a dependent child in amendment No. 2.  The wording proposed in amendment No. 22 in regard to any dependent child of either civil partner appears to recognise the possibility that there is a child from a previous relationship.  Amendment No. 63 is similar and, as such, deserves our support.  However, I oppose the Labour Party amendment because its drafting is poorer and refers to any dependent child or children of the civil partners.</P>
        <P>Those who emphasise the importance of putting children&rsquo;s welfare at the centre of policy have rightly identified certain shortcomings in the Bill in terms of its failure to consider the needs of children.  However, it is more difficult to get them to engage adequately in the debate on the context in which we should provide for children in the first place.  It is undoubtedly the <Col N="225"/>case that some children will be cared for outside marriage or the society of their two parents.  Similarly, there will be cases in which same-sex couples care for children who are the offspring of one of the partners.  However, I do not want children&rsquo;s welfare to be used, whether accidentally or deliberately, to buttress the argument for making alternative relationships to marriage equally valid in the eyes of the State and society <i>ab initio</i>.  In that regard, I understand why the Minister is keeping the issue of children largely separate from this legislation.</P>
        <P>In the context of our general discussion on equality, it is interesting to note that our adoption laws provide that in nearly all situations a married couple shall seek to adopt.  A single person is allowed to adopt in special circumstances.  This is the context in which same-sex couples are often assessed for adoptions.  When the legislation was debated in the D&aacute;il in the early 1990s, however, the concept of special circumstances was taken to mean exceptional situations.  I understand the example outlined was that of a single person working in an orphanage abroad who wanted to adopt a child.  When we are rushing headlong, we can conveniently forget that there are places where our law deems it appropriate to make distinctions.</P>
        <P>In regard to the needs of children, I read with interest what the Ombudsman for Children had to say.  I disagree with her approving citation of the Colley report on the extension of consideration to adopt any child to same-sex couples because I do not believe this is in the best interests of children.  I note, however, that she discussed the need for further measures to support children, including special guardianship orders.  She made the point that such orders could be beneficial to children in a range of circumstances beyond those immediately relevant to civil partnership such as step families, families reorganised following divorce or the children of a widow or widower and that an argument could be made in favour of addressing this issue by means of other legislation.</P>
        <P>To some degree, this offers us an answer to the puzzle.  Instead of lumping together ostensibly well intentioned measures aimed at protecting the welfare of children in civil partnership legislation in a way that might cause confusion about the State&rsquo;s intentions for children, it would be better to legislate at all times from a child-centric perspective.  Just as I have argued that civil partnership should be available to all couples in caring dependent relationships who have made sacrifices for each other, our provisions for children should be included in separate legislation in a way that they are not confined to civil partnerships.  This would make it clear that our primary and sole motive was securing the welfare and best interests of children.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested on occasion that children are more bereft than is actually the case.  It is possible, for example, under section 7 of the Guardianship of Infants Act to appoint a testamentary guardian where a non-biological parent is in a partnership of the kind we are discussing.  For these reasons, while there is a strong case for making child-centred amendments to the Bill, perhaps an even stronger argument can be made for looking at it as a separate matter precisely because it is not only in the context of civil partnerships that there are gaps in the welfare and well-being of children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree the amendments are important.  They go to the core of the reservations people have about aspects of the Bill, including those who have children in loving and caring same-sex relationships.  There is a temptation in dealing with such sensitive issues to sidestep them, but, while that is wise in some instances, it is also dishonest.  I concur with the view of the previous speaker that the focus in this area should not be on the interests of same-sex couples or adults of any particular gender but should centre on the child.  For this reason, I do not embrace the notion of gay adoption.  I know there are good gay couples who have children and I have no doubt the children in question are well cared for but, as the Minister acknowledged, children have an entitlement, where possible, to a mother and father. <Col N="226"/> This is recognised in the Constitution and, as Senator Mullen correctly noted, in our adoption laws.  We should have a hierarchy of adoptees and preferences in the interests of the child.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I referred to reports that were done in the United States and Britain, especially in the former, with regard to children in various relationships.  I am sure those countries have the same multiplicity of relationships as we have in this country.  The reports in question clearly indicate that children reared by their mother and father tend to have better outcomes in a range of areas.  One of my colleagues in the House took some umbrage at this point and may have understood it to be a criticism of single parents.  I came from a single parent family.  In the past two decades, I have seen many young girls who were single mothers sacrifice careers and give full and absolute attention to the rearing of their children.  It is commendable that they chose to do this and many of their children have turned out to be excellent citizens.  That is not the point, however.  A child who has the complementarity of the influence of a male and female &mdash; his or her mother and father &mdash; as he or she grows up through childhood, adolescence and into adulthood has better prospects.  This is the issue on which we should focus.</P>
        <P>I was appalled the other evening on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; television programme to hear the chairman of the Law Reform Commission dismiss as insignificant the surveys to which I referred.  A young man in the audience asked whether the judge was dismissing evidence.  I raise this because I have listened not only in this area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>No, I am dealing precisely with issues related to children, which are to the core of all the amendments.  My concern is that those in pivotal, influential positions should be objective, irrespective of what role they occupy.  I was amazed to receive a report from the Ombudsman for Children dated July 2010 given that the heads of this Bill were published in summer 2008.  It is astonishing that she is only now making her views known on the legislation.  We need an explanation for this.</P>
        <P>I noted the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report indicates that, in producing further recommendations to be submitted to the Law Reform Commission, she will rely on a survey which has been undertaken by Marriage Equality.  While I have the height of respect for the good people involved in that organisation, if we are serious about examining these issues of fundamental importance to the development of society, we must do so with independence and absolute objectivity.  Not only should this be the case but it should be seen to be the case.</P>
        <P>Similarly, a spokesperson for the Equality Authority stated that this Bill is only a stepping stone towards what it seeks to achieve, namely, marriage equality.  As I stated earlier, the individuals to whom I refer are all recompensed from the public purse.</P>

While I believe in the principle of the Bill, I am concerned about an anomaly in the area of the protection and welfare of children.  The Minister indicated he would revisit this issue and Senator Mullen referred to child centred legislation.  The Law Reform Commission will publish a report on how children will be protected.  Will the Minister revisit the Bill on the issue of the protection of children?  My only concern is that children may not be protected, specifically children from a previous relationship who find themselves disadvantaged as a result of the legislation.  While I welcome the Bill, I am concerned about the protection of children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments, as drafted, have some merit, as does Senator Mullen&rsquo;s contribution.  For too long, we have swept under the carpet issues related to children and their welfare.  I do not want to say there is blood on many people&rsquo;s hands on that issue, but we do not have a proud history in the manner in which we have dealt with children&rsquo;s rights.  As a matter of urgency we need to bring forward the amendment to the Constitution enshrining children&rsquo;s rights.  We need to review the area of the <i>de facto</i> family cohabitants.  We need to be upfront and realise that biologically gay people can have children.  As I said on Second Stage we do not wish to create children of a lesser god and we need to ensure those children are protected.  If our past has taught us anything it is the need to ensure that children are protected for the common good.  There is great merit in parking this issue to one side, but not for long.  We need to move on it immediately in separate legislation.</P>

	<P>It needs to be relevant to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, very much so.  It is a directly relevant element.  It is the practical question of payment and financial support.  That is in the first amendment.  Some of the others deal with guardianship and so on.  I am parking to one side the question of adoption and <Col N="229"/>whether single parents are capable of doing the job or whether two parents are needed.  I am just considering the question of financial support, which is what this amendment addresses.  I would be surprised if anyone on either side of the House questions the fact that all the indicators and sociological surveys demonstrate that financial security is an important factor in developing a child&rsquo;s emotional security and welfare.  For that reason I welcome the moderate tone adopted by my colleagues who take a different view on this.  It slightly surprises me.</P>
        <P>We are all capable of unfortunate sentiments and occasionally I indulge in them myself.  I will not name anyone, but with regard to impugning the motives of people, I remember people not too far from me indicating that they wanted to impugn the motives of scientists by saying they were motivated not by humanity but by an interest in fame and wealth.  That was actually impugning.  I very much welcome that that kind of thing has not been engaged in here tonight.  For that reason, for the time being I will suspend this hand-written note that I made from radio broadcasts of other unfortunate comments made in the area of this general Bill.  It is a temporary suspension, but I do so as an earnest of goodwill so that we can all get on with the debate without name calling.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify a number of points on these four amendments, in particular amendments Nos. 63 and 64.  I will stick to points on those amendments and not stray into other territory by mounting attacks on anyone at all.  In essence these amendments are child-centred.  They are about trying to ensure the rights of existing children &mdash; some of whom are now adults &mdash; who were brought up by gay couples in loving families where they deserve the same recognition as children brought up in any other type of family.</P>
        <P>I believe Senator Mullen was critical of amendment No. 64.  That amendment is not poorly or shoddily drafted.  It is very carefully drafted to ensure that it refers to the child or children of the civil partners.  A child or children of a civil partnership may not be the biological or adopted child or children of either civil partner in fact.  We can all think of examples.  There is one very high-profile couple who have children who are not their biological or adopted children.  We need to be careful to be inclusive in our definitions and that we cover all children.</P>
        <P>We also need to ensure our laws are extensive enough.  Senator Mullen referred to the testamentary guardian provision.  While I am very much aware of that provision, it only applies where one of the existing guardians or parents dies.  One needs to have made provision in one&rsquo;s will for testamentary guardian.  That is the nature of testamentary guardian.  Clearly it is not adequate to cover guardianship rights of a child to his or her guardian where the partner is alive.  That is why I was careful to give the example of a civil partnership that breaks up and a non-birth or non-adoptive parent is the one of the civil partners.  In that case the child will have no right of access to that parent &mdash; someone he or she has always regarded as a parent &mdash; because of the absence in our law on guardianship.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome Senator McDonald&rsquo;s comments.  She is right that we need to address all these issues.  Perhaps it will be in some other legislation.  Senator Regan has already specifi<Col N="230"/>cally asked the Minister, if he is to introduce this legislation on the rights of children of same-sex couples and in other situations, when he will do so.  I acknowledge that special guardianship orders have relevance considerably beyond civil partnership.  That is why, with the support of Senator Norris, I tabled an amendment to the Adoption Bill about special guardianship orders.  I am well aware of them and am familiar with them from Britain.  I used the model of the British legislation.  The provision is commonly used there where children are in long-term foster care.  I have practised in this area and I know about it.  When a child is in long-term foster care and wishes to have a more permanent relationship with the parent, the special guardianship order is a means of doing so that is short of adoption, which means the child does not break the tie with the birth parent.  It fulfils a very specific role, but in a range of different areas, for example, long-term foster care.  It could also fulfil that role for civil partners.</P>
        <P>As we know very well and as the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, acknowledged during the debates on the Adoption Bill, many gay couples are engaged in foster parenting for the HSE and doing an excellent job.  There is no reason not to extend adoption rights to gay couples.  I know that is addressed in another amendment.  I have strayed somewhat, for which I apologise.  Critically, these four amendments are simple and straightforward.  They seek to make provision for the dependent child or children of civil partners.  Amendment No. 64, which we drafted, simply makes that provision in section 110, which already provides that where a court is making a grant of decree of dissolution of civil partnership, the court must have regard to whether proper provision has been made for the civil partners.  We have simply added in &ldquo;for any dependent child or children&rdquo;.  Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment No. 63 is to the same effect.  These are very simple and provide a safety net for a child of a civil partnership in the event of dissolution.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I know you will want to be very fair in allowing it to me.  Senator Walsh was correct in pointing to the need for objectivity when it comes to assessing what is in the best interests of children.  In that regard I, too, was surprised by the comments of the president of the Law Reform Commission.  I recall an occasion when a previous president of the Law Reform Commission lost his job because he dared to express a view on the abortion issue.  As we know, he subsequently settled a case.  When people pooh-pooh evidence, it worries me as to what extent any of us would get any respect were we to approach the Law Reform Commission with any kind of evidence.</P><Col N="231"/>
        <P>Likewise, I had not considered the timing of the report of the Ombudsman for Children, but I would prefer if, generally speaking, personages such as the president of the Law Reform Commission and the Ombudsman for Children would confine themselves to assisting us within our constitutional apparatus.  To recommend, for example, the widening of the law to provide for applications by same-sex couples for adoption would be to go beyond the requirements of the Constitution.  Therefore, I think one is justified in questioning the appropriateness of that particular recommendation being made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of what Senator Bacik said about guardianship, we must be careful.  It is agreed that there is a wide category of situations where something may have to be done for children in respect of guardianship.  However, things are different in circumstances where a non-married biological father just has the right to apply to be considered for guardianship.  Let us be very careful of doing anything under the heading of civil partnership that would undermine the child&rsquo;s primary right, which is to the care and society of his or her biological parents as far as possible.</P>
        <P>Internationally, it cannot be said that there is anything like a recognised human right to same-sex marriage or same-sex adoption.  There has been correspondence in that regard.  Last year, Amnesty International sought to bring the case for same-sex marriage and adoption under the international human rights architecture.  In fact, it is patently clear that the references are to the rights of men and women of marriageable age to marry and to found a family.  Those terms &ldquo;men and women&rdquo; are used quite distinctly, because there are more general references to &ldquo;people&rdquo; or &ldquo;persons&rdquo; elsewhere in those human rights instruments.  The very specificity of the reference to men and women suggests it was clear what was intended.  None of the contracting parties sought to enter protocols or distinctions when these rights instruments were being drawn up.</P>
        <P>It is important that we have a debate about where the best interests of children lie.  There will be other times in this debate when we consider the appropriateness of people making arrangements with surrogate parents or sperm donors to bring children into the world so that they may parent.  I will certainly be opposing any sense of a right to have a child under that heading, but that is all in the background of what we are discussing here.  In trying to secure the best interests of children, we must not be blind as to what are the ideal and preferred circumstances in which children come to be parented.  We cannot be bleeding hearts about the best interests of living children and totally neutral about the circumstances in which children come to be parented.  We have to open our eyes and take one hard look at what the evidence has to tell us in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with those Senators who express the view that the ideal situation is a loving and caring relationship for the child with a mother and a father.  If that is a biological mother and father, then all the better, but if not, then it should be an adoptive mother and father because that is as nature has given it to us.  Given that nature would have some interest in this matter, we should send a clear message for the future in that regard.  There are many scientific developments that allow the development of children, be it surrogacy or sperm donors, so we will have to come back to this issue and I ask the Minister to be cognisant of what I have suggested.</P>
        <P>I also share Senator Mullen&rsquo;s point about the list that may or may not be produced.  Things seem to have gone full circle.  It was Joe McCarthy who had a list that he might produce in certain circumstances.  If Senator Norris has a list, he should just produce it.  I think we can stand up for ourselves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  They deal with the issue of children, which includes the guardianship issue to which other speakers have referred.  There are issues that need to be carefully evaluated and examined.  We have to be mindful of where children bond in a relationship.  If civil partnership had gone on over a number of years and children had been living in a good, low conflict environment, that should be taken into account.  It cannot be taken into account without regard to the biological fathers.  There are many problems with that.</P>
        <P>These complex issues should be examined fairly, openly and objectively.  It is essential that we get commissions and vehicles that will do that.  If I want to count my chickens, I will not send the fox in to do it for me.  We need to be careful with who we put in charge of these jobs on behalf of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have been somewhat of a bystander during this debate on children.  I have no doubt this Bill will be tested in the courts at some stage, so I think it is appropriate I outline the reasoned view of the Government of the proposed amendments.</P>
        <P>Under the Family Home Protection Act, a spouse may be considered by the court reasonably to withhold consent to the conveyance of the family home, where there are dependent children of the family.  Amendments Nos. 2 and 22 propose to impose the same restrictions on the conveyance of the shared home of civil partners where there is a dependent child of one of the partners.  The Bill does not impose these restrictions on a civil partner in respect of the child of the other civil partner.  This is because the Bill&rsquo;s scope is confined to the relationship between adult couples and the extensive range of mutual rights and obligations between them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 110 of the Bill provides that a court may grant a decree of dissolution to civil partners, only if proper provision is or will be made for the partners, having regard to the circumstances of the case.  Amendments Nos. 63 and 64 propose that in order to grant a decree of dissolution, a court will also have to be satisfied that proper provision is made for the dependent child of either of the civil partners.  The Bill again makes no provision for children for constitutional reasons we have discussed at some length.  This does not mean the court is required to ignore the needs and requirements of a dependent child or children of either civil partner.  Section 110 requires the court to be satisfied that proper provision, having regard to the circumstances, exists or will be made for the civil partners.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The parental responsibilities of the civil partners represent a relevant circumstance for the court to consider in making ancillary orders on dissolution of the civil partnership.  Section 129 sets out factors for the court to consider in making ancillary orders.  This includes, under section 129(2)(<i>l</i>), &ldquo;the rights of any person other than the civil partners but including a person with whom either civil partner is registered in a new civil partnership or to whom the civil partner is married, or any child to whom either of the civil partners owes an obligation of support&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>A dependent child cannot be regarded as a child of both civil partners, but safeguards are in place to require the courts to have particular regard to the parents&rsquo; responsibility to maintain dependent children.  The Bill can go no further than this without, in our view, undermining the fine constitutional balance it attempts to achieve.  The Bill has been rigorously scrutinised by the Attorney General during the drafting process and he has given advice related specifically to making provision for children within the Bill.  In particular, he has advised that &ldquo;Giving a familial unit that is not based on marriage a constitution &mdash; two adults who are co-parents of <Col N="233"/>children &mdash; and authority &mdash; full parental powers, rights and duties of adoption &mdash; substantially identical to that of a family would probably be viewed as reneging on the guarantee to protect the family in the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>My legal advice is very clear on these matters, and I have no doubt that introducing substantial legislative provisions relating to the children of a civil partner will upset the careful constitutional balance of this Bill.  The issues surrounding children are extremely complex and I do not wish to ignore the fact that there are children being brought up by same-sex couples.  However, this is not the Bill to deal with matters relating to children being cared for in non-marital households.  The position of children in a marital family is different by virtue of the additional constitutional protection afforded to the marital family.  Civil partners caring for children do not have the same constitutional protection, and we cannot impose obligations on them with respect to their parents&rsquo; children in the same way as is done in family law Acts.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s advice on the constitutional robustness of the Bill has been very clear that providing a formal legal relationship between a civil partner and children of the other civil partner may undermine the constitutional protection given to the family.  The amendments would make the Bill more vulnerable to a constitutional challenge.</P>
        <P>However, as Senator Bacik said, the Bill is not entirely silent on the matter of protecting children.  Section 129(2)(<i>l</i>) the Bill expressly mandates the court in making financial and property orders to consider the rights of people other than either of the civil partners, specifically including any child to whom either of the civil partners owe an obligation of support.  This is an important provision to protect children as the right of the child to the financial support and care of its parent must be considered before any financial or property order is made in favour of the civil partner.  We believe the Bill achieves a balance in protecting children while respecting the special constitutional position of marriage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Government looked at the formulation of the civil registration regime for same-sex couples, it was very mindful of the implications for children.  As I stated previously, there is a very extensive body of law in regard to children generally in areas such as guardianship, maintenance, access and custody and many of these issues are faced by persons, whether they are married.</P>
        <P>Some people have made the suggestion that there be express provision in this Bill, including the Ombudsman for Children.  As I said when concluding on Second Stage, I received just last night the submission from the Ombudsman for Children.  I had an opportunity during Second Stage to read the submission.  I made the point that this Bill was published in June 2009 and I was somewhat surprised I only got that submission last night.</P>
        <P>As I said, a significant examination is being carried out by the Law Reform Commission in regard to legal aspects of family relationships.  It issued a consultation paper in September 2009 after the publication of the Civil Partnership Bill.  It outlines the sort of issues that need to be discussed.  It is an extremely complex and well set out paper.  It does not refer to same-sex couples as such but refers to step-parents.  Interestingly, the Ombudsman for Children is thanked by the commission for her valuable assistance along with other people.  Obviously, she has had an input in this regard, although the paper is silent in regard to same-sex couples.  That shows that one could not just deal with the issue of children of civil partners in this Bill without affecting a myriad of other types of relationships which children have with biological parents and adopted parents and the rights of the natural father who may not be part of the civil partnership.</P>
        <P>There are also issues relating to guardianship.  That is being considered by the Law Reform Commission.  The consultation forms part of its third programme of law, involving the examination of the rights and duties of fathers in regard to guardianship, custody, access to their <Col N="234"/>children and the rights or duties of the extended members of families, including grandparents and step-parents.</P>
        <P>This document also examines the area of the law.  The issue under discussion by the commission is whether Irish law should continue to distinguish between categories of fathers for the purpose of guardianship and so on.  The commission sought submissions by the end of 2009 with a view to publishing its final report and recommendations within 18 months.  If anyone in this House or outside it has not made a submission, in particular in this area, I suspect the Law Reform Commission would be able to take one on board in the context of the consultation it is carrying out.</P>
        <P>In her submission, the Ombudsman for Children states she is mindful that I have outlined previously the reasons behind the Government&rsquo;s approach to this Bill.  She refers to the reasons we have dealt with it in this way, Article 41 of the Constitution, the desire to avoid addressing discrete questions relating to guardianship outside the wider context of reform of this area of law and the review currently being undertaken by the Law Reform Commission in regard to legal aspects of family relationship.  She recognises that these issues relating to children are complex and interact with other areas of the law beyond the scope of the civil partnership Bill.  That is the very reason the Government decided not to include specific provisions in regard to children of same-sex couples in this Bill.  She concludes by stating that she fully appreciates that these matters relating to the rights and welfare of children in the Bill are complex and interact with areas of the law beyond the scope of the civil partnership Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan raised the issue of the <i>de facto</i> family.  He referred to a High Court judgment which was appealed to the Supreme Court.  In the Supreme Court judgment on that case, Mrs. Justice Denham stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The term &ldquo;de facto family&rdquo; has arisen as a shorthand method of describing circumstances where a couple have lived together in a settled relationship for some time with a child.  Such a set of relationships are relevant in considering the welfare of the child.  There is no institution of a de facto family.</P>
        <P LI="1">79. Thus, there is no institution of a de facto family which may be applied by analogy to the respondents.  Therefore, it was an error on the part of the learned High Court judge to describe the respondents and child as a de facto family as if it were a recognised institution.  However, the circumstances of the case show that the respondents have lived together for years in a loving relationship and that they provide a settled and loving home for the child.  These factors are critical and of importance in assessing the welfare of the child.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I return to the point that has been raised time and again that the way the Supreme Court has adjudicated on the issues has confirmed that a family is made up of a heterosexual couple.  That was confirmed as recently as December of last year.</P>
        <P>In regard to children, I wish to make a number of points which again show the complexity of this issue and the reason the Government has made the restriction in regard to the Constitution.  There must be material differences between civil partnership and marriage.  I accept people do not accept that but it is the case in regard to the Constitution.  Until the Constitution is changed, we must work within it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of children creates significant distinct issues relating to the welfare of the child, the constitutional position of the family, surrogate issues and other issues relating to IVF etc. and the rights of the natural father.  Senators adverted the fact the children of a same-sex couple are children.  However, the fact there are obviously other biological parents of the children involved raises the issue as to how their constitutional rights are dealt with.  These are <Col N="235"/>extremely complex legal and social issues and we believe would not be appropriately dealt with in this Bill.  When Irish law assigns parental rights and duties, it already accords primacy to the biological link between the parent and the child.  The law does not currently recognise the concept of what is sometimes termed social parenting.  A child living with a same-sex couple can only be the biological and legal child of one of the couple, and the child&rsquo;s other biological parent has rights in respect of the child, whether or not those rights are currently being exercised.  This was confirmed recently in a Supreme Court case, JMcD <i>v</i> PL and BM.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>If we were to deal in this Bill with children of same-sex couples and not deal with a similar situation, that could lead to the accusation of discrimination on the basis of sex.  We would not be dealing with similar situations such as heterosexual step-families, whether based on marriage or not.  If the Bill were to assign parental rights to a civil partner of a child&rsquo;s mother in circumstances where the law would not assign equivalent rights to the mother&rsquo;s heterosexual partner or husband, this would potentially discriminate between children based on the sexual orientation of the adults caring for them, as well as encroaching on the existing constitutional rights of biological parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under section 129 there is protection for the children in relation to division of property.  I go back to the point I made about the major report of the Commission on the Family, which I was party to when I was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs as far back as 1998.  We could not come up with a definition of a family, given that even in those days there was a myriad of different relationships and, flowing from that, different relationships between those family units and children.  Given that this is being dealt with by the Law Reform Commission in an ongoing consultation leading to a final report,  I suggest to Senators and others outside the House who have made submissions on the Bill that the proper place to provide for dealing with legal aspects of family relationships is this consultation process.  A composite response to looking after the best interests of children of civil partnerships is this vehicle and not a very focused Bill which would not be able to deal with the concurrent issues of the relationship and the constitutional rights with natural parents who would not be part of the same-sex couple.</P>

	<P>The Guardianship of Infants Act is referred to in amendment No. 37 which proposes to insert a new section before section 90.  Amendment No. 37 may be discussed with amendment No. 5.  This point was raised and I merely clarify the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose, with your permission, a Chathaoirligh, to address some of the remarks the Minister has, most helpfully, made.  I will be as brief as I can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those points may relate to other amendments.  I am anxious that Senators should confine their remarks to the amendments we are discussing at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, I will return to these issues.  However, I must address one matter to which the Minister referred, that is, the decision of the Supreme Court concerning a <i>de facto</i> family.  I found the judgment of Mrs. Justice Denham surprising.  In any event, I believe it has been overtaken by a recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights.  The Minister will know better than I do that since the absorption into Irish law of the European Convention on Human Rights, a citizen can seek a declaration of incompatibility.  It seems to me very clear that the Supreme Court view would be incompatible with the most recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights which clearly states that there is in existence a <i>de facto</i> family.</P>
        <P>With regard to the rights of the natural father, the Minister is absolutely right.  I wish something could be done about it but the Cathaoirleach will say, perfectly appropriately, that this is not the place to do it.  The natural father has virtually no rights whatsoever.  Mr. John Waters has been properly eloquent on this subject for many years.  I have supported him in this, as I <Col N="236"/>have supported my colleagues who say one should consider the rights of housekeepers, siblings and so on.  I was the first person to raise this and I got certain ameliorations of that situation from the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie McCreevy.  However, it is a separate issue and I saw it as such.  It is now muddying the waters.</P>
        <P>I have many other comments but under your direction, a Chathaoirligh, I will save them until amendment No. 37, except to say this is developing into a mature and interesting debate.  The Minister, in particular, has been extraordinarily helpful in illustrating how very complex these issues are.  They are not simple or easy to separate and I absolutely agree with him on that.  However, if we are not able to accept in good faith the view of the Law Reform Commission and the Equality Authority, even after it has been disastrously politically tampered and interfered with, we are in trouble because we are not going to trust anyone at all.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister will understand the human situation of people.  I am sure he says, in all good faith, that this is not the appropriate Bill and we should wait for the Law Reform Commission.  These matters have been pushed into so many commissions and long-fingered.  We were told the Adoption Bill was not appropriate and we should wait for the Civil Partnership Bill.  I refer the Minister to Seanad debates of March 2009, May 2009 and March this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope Senator Norris is not suggesting that the Minister politically interfered with the Equality Authority.  If anything, the Equality Authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;was used in a very political way by others, but not by the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make three brief points in response to the Minister.  First, we are disappointed that he is not going to accept any of these four amendments or indeed any of the others on children.  If that is not going to happen, the promise of a composite response with regard to the rights of children is welcome.  Can the Minister give some indication of when that is likely to happen?  He says the Law Reform Commission is likely to report within 12 months from now.  Has any work been done preparatory to legislation following that?  I know the Minister for Health and Children is working on legislation on IVF and assisted human reproduction.  That might be part of it.</P>
        <P>Second, the Minister said any amendment dealing with the rights of civil partners to guardianship should also deal with a step-parent in a heterosexual relationship.  Amendment No. 37 would do that.</P>
        <P>Third, I must take issue with the Minister&rsquo;s point that there are constitutional difficulties with providing for dependent children.  There is some very limited provision for dependent children in the Bill and that creates no constitutional difficulty.  I do not see how some form of recognition for the children of gay couples could cause a difficulty with the Constitution.  The Law Reform Commission, in its earlier work on cohabitants, stated categorically that there would be no constitutional difficulty with creating a bundle of rights and responsibilities for cohabitants so long as they were not greater than the rights of a married couple.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>They could not be greater than the status of married people but they could be equivalent.  Legal recognition could be given to a cohabiting couple, including a same-sex couple, to a level equivalent with marriage.  I do not see how our amendments go anywhere beyond that.  They are not even equivalent to marriage.  I do not see how there could be a constitutional difficulty with those.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="237"/>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not spoken to the amendments.  He has given a blanket rejection of any provisions in the Bill for the protection of children of same-sex relationships.  He refers to careful constitutional balance.  I do not quite get the point he is making.  What the Minister said is that the design of the Bill is to deal with the relationship between adults, and the line he takes is that this does not conflict with the Constitution.  However, he suggests that to provide any protection for the children of those relationships would be, in effect, unconstitutional, if I understand him correctly.  I cannot fathom the premise, the basis or the logic of the argument which is being advanced.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that this matter will be examined by the Law Reform Commission in a wider context.  What he might confirm, perhaps, is whether he is happy that the chairperson of the Law Reform Commission is and will be objective in carrying out her duties, because it has been suggested by a Senator that she is not objective.  That would be an important point to clarify.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept Senator Regan&rsquo;s contention that I did not address the points in regard to each of the amendments.  I have full confidence in the members of the Law Reform Commission, including the chairperson.</P>

	<P>It is clear the Government has won a victory and I deliberately front-loaded my concerns about some of the other issues involved in a general discussion on the first couple of amendments.  That was the only vote to be called by me and it is perfectly obvious we will not have any more.  It is very important that we get that out of the way in order that we can discuss the principles and the Minister&rsquo;s view and urge people of goodwill who are in any degree moved to act within the parties.  I am sure, for example, that many want to provide financial support for children with disabilities who are very vulnerable.  There is not a single person in the House who would not want to see such children properly catered for.  It is open to people of goodwill within the parties to urge the Minister to address this issue as rapidly as possible in another Bill.  I am a realist and as such, I do not believe in wasting time, or at least I try not to do so.  I have had my vote and have demonstrated that I am serious about dealing with this issue.  I have ventilated and voted on the principles about which I am most concerned.  For that reason, I will not challenge the section.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">3.&mdash;For the purposes of this Act, a reference to the presence of any person in the State or co-habitation in the State shall include presence or co-habitation while abroad in the service of the State.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As this amendment was tabled on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, I will not press it here.  It is to clarify an important point in that has been designed to preserve pension and other rights for partners of diplomats or members of the military posted abroad.  It takes into account civil partners abroad while in the service of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a most practical amendment.  We can be very pleased that at a very early stage a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Defence, Mr. David Andrews, indicated there would be full equality in the consideration of gay members of the Defence Forces.  This is clearly a practical arrangement which applies not only to the Irish diplomatic and foreign service but also to those of other countries.  I am aware of the Minister&rsquo;s interest in the area of foreign affairs and he will know that a number of distinguished diplomats who represent other countries and who are resident in this city at present are not only gay but are involved in partnerships or married relationships which are recognised in their home countries.  All we are doing in this amendment is reflecting the reality that exists.  However, for the technical reasons to which I referred earlier, I accept it is highly unlikely that this or any other amendment will be accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator misunderstands what is contained in the Bill.  The terms used in the legislation are &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; and they act as alternatives to each other.  The court may have jurisdiction if a couple, or one member thereof, is ordinarily resident in the State or is domiciled here.  Being ordinarily resident does not require that one need be present within the State at all times in the relevant period.  However, some measure of residence within the State will be required.</P><Col N="239"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is difficult to understand why the Irish courts should have jurisdiction over a person whose domicile is not in the State and who is also not ordinarily resident here if a question arises as to his or her civil partnership status or if there is a dispute between him or her and his or her partner.  Having one&rsquo;s domicile here certainly does not require presence in the State.  The argument is made that a person posted abroad in the service of the State for an extended period could lose his or her Irish domicile.  This is a highly unlikely eventuality.  To lose a domicile, a person must have actively decided that he or she is moving abroad permanently.  It is very difficult to lose domicile in law.  A person posted abroad by the Department of Foreign Affairs, for example, would not lose domicile.  Furthermore, the ongoing links with the State are crystal clear.  Members of the Defence Forces do not lose their domicile of origin merely because they go on overseas missions to Lebanon or wherever.  The person in the Department of Foreign Affairs would, while abroad, still be paid and taxed by the State and would be working on its behalf.  Much looser links than these are sufficient to establish domicile within the State.  The amendment is designed to remedy a problem which, I respectfully suggest, is not encountered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated that there might be some question of a particular, if fairly flexible, timeframe.  Does he have in mind a timeframe within which residence or domicile might be established?  In this regard it must be borne in mind that a question of domicile relating to a member of his party, who is also a Member of this House, has given rise to difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No, there is no particular timeframe involved.  One has a domicile of origin and if one wants to change this, one can then adopt a domicile of choice.  In the context of the people to whom the Senator refers, namely, members of staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs, members of the Defence Forces and others in the employ of the State who are stationed abroad, they do not lose their domicile unless they make a conscious decision to the effect that they want to have a different domicile.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment involves the insertion of a new section into the Bill and involves the granting of a degree of retrospection in respect of an extremely serious situation.</P>
        <P>I wish to place some flesh on the bones of the amendment.  The Minister may have been too busy to hear an extremely important discussion on this matter which occurred on radio in recent days.  During that discussion, Henk Krol, who has been involved in the areas of civil and human rights for many years and who hails from the Netherlands, referred to a situation in which a young Dutch woman married a Frenchman.  They had one daughter together but after some years the marriage broke down.  The biological father and ex-husband did not pursue an interest in the child and the former wife took the child back to the Netherlands to live with her.  Tragically, the biological mother and former wife was killed in a traffic accident.  As stated, the biological father had no interest in the child but his parents &mdash; of whom the child had no recollection whatever &mdash; intervened and took a case in the Dutch courts in order to secure access to her and transport her to France, a country of which she had no recollection and in <Col N="241"/>whose language she was not conversant.  Needless to say, that young person had an extremely troubled childhood as a result.  It was in the aftermath of this case and others like it that the Dutch authorities changed the law.</P>
        <P>I am realistic with regard to whether these two amendments are going to be accepted.  It is highly unlikely that they will be accepted but the Minister may, of course, spring a surprise on us.  However, I do not believe this will happen.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 37 is quite substantial in nature and the Minister has indicated a degree of movement in respect of the area to which it relates.  I hope he will request that his officials pursue this matter.  If it is an issue which should be explored by the Law Reform Commission &mdash; I share the Minister&rsquo;s confidence in that body &mdash; I hope the effect of what we are doing here will be, at the very minimum, to impel the debate forward and provide a new vigour in respect of it.  As the Minister will see and as colleagues on all sides of the House have been kind enough to remark, amendment No. 37 is very detailed and carefully crafted.  I pay tribute to the various individuals who assisted me in its production.  It is important that we take it seriously.  I am a realist, but I hope, at the very least, the Minister will accept it is important that we advance all of these issues.  I would like to see a full resolution of all of them.  If we are forced by circumstances to adopt an incremental approach instead, I hope we will be moving in the right direction, at least.</P>
        <P>I again quote from the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report on the Bill:</P>
        <P LI="1">However, if the intention of the legislation were to provide such protection to children of civil partners, then it should have done so explicitly and mandated the courts to consider the needs of children affected by such orders, rather than relying on courts to utilise the latitude provided by the Bill in a discretionary manner.  It would not be unreasonable for a court to assume that the clear decision not to provide for the children of civil partners in the areas outlined [there are many] signified an intention on the part of the Oireachtas for there to be some substance to the difference in the level of protection afforded to those children.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister has spoken about what he perceives as the required differential between marital status and the status of civil partnership.  I assume he would not wish to discriminate between children.  That brings us to the nub of the moral issue.</P>
        <P>As the Minister said, this issue is extremely complex.  He has indicated that there was a ruling in one of our higher courts to the effect that in a partnership a child could only be the child of one of the partners in a civil partnership of the same sex.  That is not necessarily the case.  I respectfully suggest the courts may have misdirected themselves in law.  This is not the first time they have done so.  There was a notorious example when the late Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Higgins &mdash; I hope I am right in that regard &mdash; misdirected himself in law in a case in which I was involved.  I do not have any malign intention when I say I hope I am right.  I do not want to suggest he is dead if he is not.  I believe he is.  I mention this because it is theoretically possible &mdash; I wonder if the Minister agrees &mdash; to have a relationship between persons of the same sex, with the biological child of one being adopted by the other.  It may be unlikely and may not be contemplated by law, but it is certainly a theoretical possibility.  I respectfully suggest the judgment in this case was wrong.  If possible, I would like to extract from the Minister some comfort, in advance of a possible court case, on the question of whether it is the intention of the Oireachtas for there to be some difference in the level of protection afforded to these children.  If so, that would be a very worrying concept.</P>

	<P>I support these two amendments which are related in their purpose.  We have already put to the Minister the need to ensure the rights of children are protected in this legislation.  I know he has said he will not accept the amendments at this stage.  I am glad to hear him say, however, that he will adopt a composite response to the needs of children, as part of a more comprehensive review of guardianship law.  I do not think he has indicated when that is likely to happen.  Even if he does not accept these two amendments now, they should inform any future development of legislation.  Amendment No. 5 provides that &ldquo;where one of the partners in a civil partnership has, or had prior to the entry into a civil partnership, adopted a child or children to whom they may or may not be biologically related, and in the event of the death of that adopting parent, the surviving partner shall be regarded in law as a guardian&rdquo;.  It would overcome the difficulties that would arise if the partners had not made a will appointing the non-adoptive parent as the testamentary guardian.  It would ensure the rights of the child in that situation and such a child would not be left without a guardian in law.  I know a good deal of work has gone into the well crafted amendment No. 37 to section 90.  I commend the officials in the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network and elsewhere who assisted Senator Norris with the amendment.</P>

	<P>It may have been.  I am not sure who it was.  </P>
        <P>The amendment covers many issues.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister to examine it in a broader context because it would give rights to a child beyond a civil partnership.  It would amend the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 to ensure the acquisition of guardianship by a step-parent, regardless of whether that person is &ldquo;a person who is married to or is the civil partner of a parent of that child&rdquo;.  It would address the current anomaly where a woman who has a child subsequently marries a new partner and that new partner has no relationship in law to the child, unless he is the father of the child.  It would also include coverage of civil partnership and recognition of the natural father.  It recognises that a child may have a number of guardians, all of whom would have to consent to the step-parent being made a guardian.  It is commendable because it would encompass the voice of the child, providing that the court should consider &ldquo;the views of the child himself or herself in relation to the application, as the court thinks appropriate and practicable&rdquo;, &ldquo;the views of the guardian or guardians of the child&rdquo; and &ldquo;the views of any other parent of the child&rdquo;.  It would cover a natural father who is not a guardian.  It would covers circumstances in which the guardianship may have ended.  It is not quite the special guardianship provision I mentioned, but it would help to address the difficulties faced by children of a civil partnership when the partnership dissolves and they have no relationship in law with the non-birth or adoptive parent.</P>

	<P>Regretfully, I disagree with thee amendments.  However, I would like to join Senator Norris in commending Mr. John Waters for his excellent work in drawing attention to the rights of non-married fathers.  He has done public debate a great service in his <Col N="243"/>writings on this and other issues.  Senator Norris has raised the issue in the context of the recent decision in the case of Schalk and Kopf <i>v</i>. Austria.  It is true there was some recognition in that case of the family status involved.  The case is probably more notable for the fact that it was found that under the European Convention on Human Rights, there was no obligation on member states to legislate for same-sex marriage, nor was there an obligation on them to legislate for same-sex partnerships.  It has to be said any references to the European Convention on Human Rights or decisions of the European Court of Human Rights should also recall that we have incorporated the convention at sub-constitutional level.  Therefore, everything here is subject to the over-riding requirements of the Constitution.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to take a closer look at the issues raised in the amendments.  Amendment No. 5 proposes that &ldquo;the surviving partner shall be regarded in law as a guardian of the child&rdquo; in a case in which the deceased partner was the adopting parent.  Amendment No. 37 is similar.  It seems we are getting very close to the boundaries of the Constitution.  I recall my earlier comment that, although we are right to seek to affirm and vindicate the rights, welfare, dignity and best interests of children, we must not do so in a way that will have the result of relativising the context in which we would like children to be brought up.  That seems to be a recurrent problem in this debate.  I hear constant appeals to the rights and best interests of children, but they often seem to be linked with seeking a particular status for an adult relationship.  I have a problem with this.  I do not question the motivations or bona fides of those who make this argument, but I point to the downsides of that political approach.  That is why I commend the wisdom of the Minister on this issue in keeping the issue of children separate from the issue of civil partnership.  In this context it must be said we want to vindicate the rights of children in a way that does not undermine the marital family as the socially preferred context.  We should not regard that as an anachronistic constitutional inheritance we have not yet shaken off.  It is worth pointing out that social science studies consistently show that family form is not an accidental feature of relationship quality.  In the context of married and cohabiting couples, for example, the millennium cohort study of 2008 stressed the right of children to be brought up by their biological parents and was able to show evidence that where parents were living together at nine months, the question of the family form involved had a material impact on the child experiencing family change.  Children living with married natural parents at nine months were much less likely to have experienced family change than children living with cohabiting natural parents or with a lone natural mother.  The figure was one in ten in the context of married parents who experienced family change within the next five years or first five years of the child&rsquo;s life.  It was one in four for cohabiting parents and one in three in the context of lone parents.  That is just one example, admittedly from an area examining marriage and cohabitation.  Miss Justice Elizabeth Dunne considered the evidence in her decision in the Zappone-Gilligan case and expressed concerns about arguments being made that sought to relativise where the best interests of children lay in the context of same-sex parenting <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> married parenting.  We cannot ignore those issues as we consider these amendments and for that reason I oppose them.</P>

That is my firm belief.  I gave my views with regard to guardianship which may have surprised Senator Norris.  These issues need to be looked at and teased out thoroughly and objectively because they are complicated.</P><Col N="244"/>
        <P>Senator Norris said that although the Minister may take the view that he must discriminate between marital status and civil partnership status, he should not discriminate between children.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The converse is true.  Why should we discriminate between civil partnership and marriage if marriage was not the institution into which children are born in the natural order?  Without that issue surely there would be no need to have any such discrimination and there would be very little need to give any sort of unique financial assistance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator approve of discrimination against children?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not.  I mean that the natural order where children emerge focuses my mind.  In the overwhelming majority of cases that will be through the institution of heterosexual relationships, specifically marriage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was very taken by and wish to acknowledge that I was reassured by the Minister&rsquo;s response to us on the last amendment, tabled by Senator Norris.  We touched on this issue and on adoption although I recognise the Senator&rsquo;s current amendments are probably more relevant to the topic of guardianship.  I was reassured because it was obvious from the Minister&rsquo;s comments that very careful consideration had been given to these issues by him, his officials and the Government.  Knowing the Minister as a good family man and knowing the value he would place on children, it does not surprise me that such is the case.  He pointed out that it is a comprehensive and complex area.  We need to be extremely balanced.  Many interests are involved, including, as Senator Norris rightly said, biological fathers in instances where they have no say in the rearing of their biological children.  It is an enormous area and I agree with the Senator.  John Waters has been a champion in this area for many years, often a lone voice.  That should be considered.</P>
        <P>I heard Senator Regan ask the Minister if he had confidence in the Law Reform Commission.  Like the good lawyer he is, the Senator knew the answer before he asked the question.  The Minister would not be in a position in the House to say other than what he said.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Given that this is an extremely important matter I ask the Minister to consider appointing an objective committee, commission or group &mdash;  I exclude the Law Reform Commission because its views have already been expressed &mdash; to look at international surveys which have been done, especially in the United States and Great Britain, with regard to the impact on children of the various kinds of relationships.  We would thereby have some international comparisons and could consider the matter in the House.  This is a very complex area and it needs to be evaluated objectively and comprehensively.  Obviously, we should look at international practices and experience in that regard.  I put that as a genuine suggestion to the Minister.</P>
        <P>No Member in this House has any priority in regard to family values or anything else.  We must approach this collectively and must ensure we make the right decisions.  Although I have a very firm view as to what I think is best in this regard, I believe it should be fairly, objectively and independently evaluated.</P>

	<P>Given the contribution I made earlier, I must say to Senator Norris and the Labour Party I do not see anything wrong with that amendment.  I heard a lovely couple, two women who live in County Kildare, being interviewed, perhaps on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; or on the radio.  Between them they had two children, the biological children of one of the women.  They spoke about no arrangement being in place in the event of the death of the biological mother, yet from the time the two boys were very young, the female partner was the only other parent they had ever known.  This amendment made me think of that interview.  I ask the Minister whether there might be a case in which provision could be put in place by a same-sex couple to be enacted in the case of a death.</P>
        <P>Before my husband died we had an arrangement which applied in the event of both of us being killed together.  We had four children.  We put a provision in place that in the event of both of us being wiped out at the same time, our children would go where we wanted them to go.  We had chosen family members to look after and rear them as their own children.  Perhaps nothing can be done with regard to in-laws in this case but might a couple, having all their faculties and being well, put a provision in place that if something were to happen to the biological mother, the children could be cared for by the partner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate my support for the position of Mr. Waters on the problems attaching to the status of the natural father, although he is almost as much of a monomaniac on that subject as I am on some others.  He acknowledged that I had spoken out on this matter at a very early stage.  I believe my credentials are established in that area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the business of getting reports and statistics, I also refer to the report of a formal commission initiated by the Swedish Government in 1999, and I regard that as authoritative.  We may be getting ourselves into a situation such as that described in a short story of the late Seamus O&rsquo;Kelly in which there was a court case involving two families regarding land.  They had no knowledge of the intricacies of law but they acquired lawyers who produced maps and one said to the other &ldquo;sure our maps are as long, as big and as complicated as yours and isn&rsquo;t our lawyer even bigger, fatter and more expensive.&rdquo;  I am not sure about the benefit of comparing these things, especially in light of a case that is still before the courts.  I believe it at the level of Supreme Court and therefore we must be reasonably careful.  I recall clearly that a consultant psychiatrist gave evidence in that case and it was very strong evidence as I remember, but under cross-examination it was established that this particular highly reputable consultant had not written or published papers, lectured or had any detectable expertise in the area.  Therefore one must be extremely careful.  I say this without reference to anyone present.  Following on from the person to whom I previously referred, there are an enormous number of crackpots in the United States on both sides.  If we get into selecting and firing crackpots, it would be almost like the Deputy Bertie Ahern situation, which so endeared him to the nation, when he said &ldquo;We are not going to get anywhere if we sit here all night throwing red elephants and white herrings at each other.&rdquo;  </P>

I am disappointed that amendments to this legislation on the rights of children will not be accepted, but I hope we will see comprehensive legislation on the rights of children very soon.</P>
        <P>As Senator Norris said, one can cite all sorts of evidence and studies.  A great number of the studies cited have not looked at gay parenting versus straight parenting versus parenting by <Col N="246"/>heterosexual couples.  The US NIS-4 study, which has been quoted routinely by many people, shows that biological parents are better in this respect, but it did not look at gay parents in particular.  The studies which have looked at gay parenting as opposed to parenting by heterosexual couples have shown over decades that there is no adverse impact on children raised by gay and lesbian parents.  In 2002, the American Academy of Paediatrics Committee, which is not made up crackpots but is a respected American body, found no substantial difference between children raised by gay parents and heterosexual parents.  One can quote all these studies but the specific studies looking at and contrasting gay parenting and heterosexual parenting have found there is no adverse impact.  What matters is the quality of the parenting and the bond between parent and child.</P>

	<P>With respect, I did not interrupt the Senator.  It is true and that is the evidence that has been put before the High Court here and it is the evidence internationally.  We are looking also at independent research commissioned by Marriage Equality which has not yet been published but which the ombudsman referred to as ongoing research on the experience of children born into gay relationships and raised by gay couples in Ireland.  That will give us an interesting set of findings also, but in the meantime we are left with the situation where a large number of children are being raised by gay couples and they have no legal protection at present.  We should not forget that one third of children in Ireland are born outside of marriage.  Senator Walsh may refer to the natural order of things but clearly the natural order is changing.</P>

I have listened to the debate with<?oasys _jy ?>interest.</P>

	<P>Those who are in same-sex unions were once children.  We all went through the same experience.  As a father, the best thing one can ask for any child is to ensure they are being brought up in a loving relationship.  I commend Senator Norris, with the help of outside support, on crafting these amendments, in particular amendment No. 37 which goes further than dealing with same-sex unions in that it also deals with the issue of step-parents.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response to it.</P>
        <P>I have spoken previously on civil partnership, same-sex unions and same-sex marriage.  My position and that of my party on this area is very clear.  This Bill falls short in a number of areas.  It definitely falls short in regard to the rights of the child.  The amendments discussed earlier and particularly these amendments, if accepted, would go a long way towards making this legislation more worthy of our support.</P><Col N="247"/>
        <P>It is great to be in this House today as a republican because the Seanad is clearly republican.  Everyone has outlined how republican they are but, unfortunately, perhaps some of them are talking about American style republicanism instead of Irish republicanism.  We talk about cherishing the children of the nation equally.  These amendments deal with that principle.  They give rights to those in same-sex families, to the partners in a civil union, but it does take away rights from the biological parents.  The issue of the rights of fathers in particular has been mentioned, which needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to deal with a number of points.  Senator Bacik raised the point of conferring rights on others that do not supersede the rights of the family.  My second point is if these amendments are not accepted, when can we expect legislation to be introduced to deal with the complex issues that have been raised by members of the Opposition?  I am not asking the Minister to give a date or month but to indicate a reasonable timeframe.  I am sure that Members of the Government parties would like to see these amendments, or some of them at least, in some way, shape or form, encompassed into legislation that would give rights to children and to those who are in same-sex unions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is difficult when listening to the various contributions not to reflect on how increasingly complicated children&rsquo;s lives are becoming and it is not, it seems to me, in the direction of their well-being.  I listened to what Senator Feeney said.  She spoke eloquently about a situation that can arise.  I draw her attention to something that was said earlier about the existing possibility under section 7 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, whereby one can appoint a testamentary guardian to provide that in the event of one&rsquo;s death, someone else can take up the role of being a guardian.  The difficulty with doing this in one&rsquo;s lifetime is that one must ask what price is the role of the absent biological parent.  I do not want to be flippant but I was reminded of a song Brendan Grace used to sing when I was child called &ldquo;I&rsquo;m my own Grandpa&rdquo;.  We are discussing issues of such complexity that such outcomes look increasingly possible with the twists and turns in people&rsquo;s lives.  It is very much to be regretted if we are talking about situations where there are not one or two but three guardians, if one considers a civil partnership couple as the new <i>de facto</i> family.  Therefore, one starts arguing in favour of a guardianship or formalised role for the non-biological parent.  One is also trying to factor in what we could call the John Waters agenda which is valid and legitimate.  The sheer complexity of the issue illustrates just how much we are losing our way as a society in failing to have a vision for what we want for our children.  It is, of course, right and proper to consider <i>de facto</i> families.</P>
        <P>One point which struck me while listening to the debate &mdash; I would like the Minister to consider talking to the Minister for Health and Children about it &mdash; concerned the policy of adoption authorities when assessing individuals.  Does the State take the view that when it comes to adoption, a married couple is best, or is there a nod and a wink, whereby we say it does not matter, that we will use the exceptional circumstance of a single person as cover in assessing same-sex couples who wish to adopt?  Are the organs of the State neutral on the issue?  Perhaps we need answers on it.  Perhaps it is a fit topic for a future debate because I do not believe the organs of the State should be neutral on the issue.</P>
        <P>I have a concern because I hear much talk about children&rsquo;s rights.  However, I do not hear much about what is the best context in which to bring up children.  In that regard, I support some of Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments on our being willing to consider international evidence.  It is one thing to be aware of the fact that sometimes the evidence is flawed, it is another to use that fact as an excuse never look at evidence.  That is why the recent comments of the chairman of the Law Reform Commission were worrying.  It is legitimate to consider her comments in a critique; it would have better if she had not intervened on one side of the debate in a television <Col N="248"/>discussion programme because of the role she plays.  It does not necessarily flow, however, from such a critique that one should immediately ask the Minister whether he has confidence in the Law Reform Commission.  We are entitled to offer a degree of fraternal correction from the national Parliament when we see something like that happen which is not in the best interests of proper public debate and a thorough scrutiny of the issues.</P>
        <P>On the issue of evidence and having said what I said about the concerns we should have for the increasingly complicated and compromised nature of child welfare because of fractured family structures, a meta-analysis was made by Moore, Jekielek and Emig in 2002 in which they said research clearly demonstrated that family structure mattered for children and that the family structure which helped children the most was a family headed by two biological parents in a low conflict marriage.  Children in single parent families, those born to unmarried mothers, those in step families or cohabiting relationships, face a higher risk of having poor outcomes.  I cannot remember when I last heard a State official confess to the reality which causes me profound concern.  The meta-analysis of 2008 concluded that even in nations with the most extensive welfare measures such as the Scandinavian countries and France, a substantial gap in child welfare remained between those children who grew up in intact families and those who did not.  It has been correctly suggested some of the studies cited do not refer specifically to same-sex parenting.  There is a very good reason for this, namely, this area of life is very new in the sense of formal recognition of same-sex parenting and legal rights being accorded to it.  I am not suggesting homosexuality is new.  That is partly the reason <i>festina lente</i> should be our motto.  We should be advancing with great caution.  That is why I am very concerned about the potential radical reach of some aspects of the Bill.</P>
        <P>One person whom we can trust is Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne who spoke on this issue in the Zappone and Gilligan case.  She referred to Professor Green who had advanced evidence in support of the case for same-sex parenting.  She said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Taking on board the evidence that I also heard from Professor Casey and from Professor Waite, I think that one must have some reservation in relation to the conclusions drawn by Professor Green.  The phenomenon of parenting by same sex couples is one of relatively recent history.  The studies that have taken place are consequently of recent origin.  Most of the studies have been cross sectional studies involving small samples and frequently quite young children.  I have to say that based on all of the evidence I heard on this topic that I am not convinced that such firm conclusions can be drawn as to the welfare of children at this point in time.  It seems to me that further studies will be necessary before a firm conclusion can be reached.  It also seems to me having regard to the criticism of the methodology used in the majority of the studies conducted to date that until such time as there are more longitudinal studies involving much larger samples that it will be difficult to reach firm conclusions on this topic ... Having considered [Professor Linda Waite&rsquo;s] evidence it reinforces the view that there is simply not enough evidence from the research done to date that could allow firm conclusions to be drawn as to the consequences of same sex marriage particularly in the area of the welfare of children.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Clearly, the precautionary principle is being invoked.  Evidence and studies are useful and will help us to make a decision, but they will not be the final decider because we have to factor in issues of principle.  However, evidence will have a very strong role to play.  The judge in that case said the jury was still out.</P>
        <P>In addition to the lack of longitudinal studies and the small number of samples, there is also the point which arises indirectly as a result of something said by Senator Bacik when she referred to an Irish study that very often the studies are based on people self-assessing their <Col N="249"/>well-being, a flaw in many studies one comes across.  None of us can arrive at full conclusions on this issue, but it is clear that for the time being and a long time into the future the precautionary principle is the one we will have to adopt.</P>

	<P>I am taken by one of the points made by Senator Mullen on testamentary guardians.  Perhaps there is some scope within it for a resolution of this issue.  Issues surrounding children need to be addressed in their best interests; there should be no other agenda attached.  In that regard, to underline the complexity of the matter to which the Minister referred, some time ago I chaired a meeting which a woman from England, Ms Joanna Rose, addressed.  She was conceived with the aid of a sperm donor.  Her father was a student who was a sperm donor and she estimated that she probably had some 300 siblings.  There was a recent case in which a brother and sister married each other, not knowing they were siblings.  We need to put in place significant safeguards in this regard.</P>
        <P>I fundamentally disagree with Senator Bacik.  If we are to hand over to a gay rights group responsibility for conducting studies on our behalf which we will accept as being independent &mdash; that is why I said any studies should be independent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Norris that studies were conducted in the United States and Britain which were not as objective and that the correct methodology may not have been used.  However, we should not just consider the position in Sweden, rather it should be part of a process.  There should be an independent body with no axe to grind and whose sole interest would be to come up with propositions and recommendations exclusively directed towards the best interests of the child without regard to various relationships.  That would inform the debate and be a valuable input in teasing out what is an extremely complex issue.  Just because it is complex does not mean we should not address it.</P>

	<P>Under section 7 of the Guardian of Children Acts 1964 to 1997, the father, mother or adoptive parent of a child may appoint a testamentary guardian.  In a case where a child is being brought up by a parent and a civil partner, the parent is free to appoint the civil partner as testamentary guardian of the child.  Although such guardianship does not bring with it succession rights, the testamentary guardian will otherwise have parental responsibilities if he or she is the sole remaining guardian of the child.  The matter may be complicated if the child has another living parent who is a guardian.  Any dispute over custody and guardianship in such a case may be referred to the courts, which shall take the welfare of the child as their first and paramount priority in considering what orders to make.  We believe, therefore, that amendment No. 5 is unnecessary.</P><Col N="250"/>
        <P Just="Left">There is clear provision in existing law for a parent to decide who best should care for his or her children in the event of his or her death.  Often, the person concerned is a spouse, trusted relative or, with the passage of this legislation, a civil partner.  The amendment specifies that the civil partner shall have the same parental relationship with the child without regard to wider circumstances.  This may remove the discretion of the child&rsquo;s civil partner parent to decide who should be the child&rsquo;s guardian.  It may also infringe on the rights of another guardian of the child and we believe it ignores the sometimes complex relationships between parents and their children.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 37 proposes extensive reforms to the Guardian of Children Acts.  It would have an effect on a marital family where the child is not the offspring of the marriage, which is outside the scope of the Bill, as well as on civil partners.  I have outlined the strong advice I received from the Attorney General regarding the constitutional scrutiny required of this Bill.  The issue of giving a unit which is not based on marriage a constitutional authority that is substantively identical to a family would probably be viewed as reneging on the Constitution&rsquo;s protection for the latter.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I do not want to rehearse our earlier discussion on children generally but the Law Reform Commission is examining this area.  In regard to Senator Bacik&rsquo;s specific question, the LRC indicated approximately six months ago that it would require 18 months to prepare a report.  I do not think it is necessary to state that I have full confidence in the commission.  However, that is not to say this or any other Government should slavishly adopt its recommendations on any subject.  The home defence Bill which I will publish tomorrow is based on a Law Reform Commission report in that area but we are not going as far as it recommends.  Similarly, we will debate the Multi-Units Development Bill 2009 in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  With due respect to the LRC, the Bill we published some time after it issued its own draft legislation on this subject was much more comprehensive.  The rationale behind the commission is to bring together independent experts who can objectively investigate a range of issues and make reports and recommendations to Government and the Oireachtas.  Senator Walsh called for independent and objective analysis of these issues but what better place than the Oireachtas to consider them?  We are elected to make those decisions.  The Government proposes and the Oireachtas disposes.</P>

	<P>I do not worry about the ability of the Oireachtas to deal objectively with issues.  Senator Feeney described the example of a female same-sex couple, one of whom is the biological parent of a child.  Leaving aside the testamentary guardianship issue, they can make arrangements for the death of one or both partners in the form of a will but this would be subject to the Succession Act 1965.  If the biological parent previously divorced the natural father of the child, the father may be entitled to a legal share under the 1965 Act.  If there are other children from previous relationships, they could apply under section 117 of the Act for proper provision on the basis that they were not looked after.  These are not simple issues.</P>
        <P>As I noted in my response to amendment No. 1, Irish law gives primacy to the biological link between parent and child in assigning rights and duties.  While emotive issues arise from the loving relationships between children and same-sex couples, this does not detract from the rights of natural parents who are not part of this relationship.  The Supreme Court has ruled that they are constitutionally entitled to these rights irrespective of whether they exercise them.  John Waters regularly defends the rights of unmarried fathers and this is a relatively analogous <Col N="251"/>situation in that ignoring the rights of a natural father in the example to which Senator Feeney referred would be a contravention of the Constitution.  That is further reason for looking at this issue in a holistic and comprehensive way.  I accept the bona fides of Senators who say they are not happy we are opposing their amendments but the Ombudsman for Children accepts wider issues arise.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised a case which he acknowledged was hypothetical involving a biological parent who is the same-sex partner of the adoptive parent of the child.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen spoke about the issue of adoption.  I do not like to bring personal circumstances into a debate, but as an adoptive parent who has been through the adoption process, I know that the best interests of the child, rather than the interests of the adoptive parents, are primary in the decision to sanction an adoption.  It is entirely a matter within the law laid down by the Oireachtas for the Adoption Board to authorise an adoption in circumstances as they are presented to it.  I fully accept that there have been circumstances in which same-sex couples have adopted children.  To the best of my knowledge, such circumstances were not envisaged when the legislation was initiated.  The exceptional circumstances to which it refers relate mainly to the circumstances cited by the Senator.</P>
        <P>I return to the central point, namely, that whether through the Hague Convention or our Adoption Acts, the best interests of the child are regarded as paramount, which is as it should be.  Ultimately, the decision should be left to the Adoption Board, which has served the country well in that respect.  The Senator may be correct that the Oireachtas should discuss this issue in due course.  It might not necessarily form part of the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission on the Legal Aspects of Family Relationships report.</P>

	<P>While I had not intended to contribute further on this amendment, the Minister stated that the complexity of these issues &mdash; all sides acknowledge that they are complex &mdash; could be addressed by the Executive making proposals and the Oireachtas making decisions on the disposal of these complex matters.  If it is suggested that this will be done under the Whip system, the necessary checks and balances will not be in place.  If, however, a free vote will apply, as I believe it should, Members of the Oireachtas may have personal views on the matter.  To have these views informed by socio-scientific studies that have been collated independently would be of remarkable assistance to the process given the large number of issues involved and the difficulty associated with steering our way through these matters and arriving at good decisions in the interests specifically of children.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 4</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, subsection (2)(<i>c</i>), lines 33 to 35, to delete subparagraph (ii), and substitute the following:</P><Col N="252"/>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(ii) prior to the death had ever been ordinarily resident in the State for a period of one year.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment, which was, I understand, tabled on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, responds to submissions we received.  Its purpose is to address injustices that are occurring by extending the coverage of protection by broadening the category of person who may apply to the court to make a declaration of civil partnership status.  This would apply in cases where a person has died before the date of the application, in other words, where one of the civil partners has died and the other applies for a declaration of civil partnership status.  Currently, section 4 requires that the deceased person was domiciled in the State or ordinarily resident in the State for one year immediately preceding the date of death.  The amendment proposes to broaden this to provide that the person had been ordinarily resident in the State for a period of one year at some stage prior to the death rather than immediately prior to the death.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Declarations as regards civil partnership status will rarely be required.  If, after the passage of this Bill, a person enters a civil partnership here, he or she will always be entitled to be treated as a civil partner for the purposes of Irish law, unless and until the civil partnership is dissolved.  Likewise, if a person has entered a civil partnership or equivalent registered partnership elsewhere and both of the couple are alive on the date that the relevant order recognising that relationship comes into effect, he or she will always be entitled to be treated as a civil partner for the purposes of Irish law, again unless and until that civil partnership is dissolved.  This includes for all relevant rights and obligations which accrue under civil partnership, including succession, pensions, shared home protection and so forth.</P>
        <P>The circumstances in which a declaration as to the status may be required are, for example, where a relationship entered into in another state was dissolved and there is a question as to the validity of the dissolution, whether it took place in the same state or another, or perhaps where a civil partnership entered into in this jurisdiction was purported to be dissolved in another jurisdiction after the couple concerned had moved their permanent domicile elsewhere.  This may have implications for whether the civil partner is free to enter a new civil partnership or whether the person has certain succession rights and so forth.</P>
        <P>In a case where the relevant person does not have a direct or continuing connection with the State, it is not appropriate to confer jurisdiction on our courts to deal with such matters.  However, domicile gives extensive jurisdiction to our courts because it is not easy to lose domicile in this State.  In 2003, the Supreme Court judgment in F.L. <i>v.</i> D.T. related to a foreign divorce of a married couple who had emigrated to the Netherlands in 1988.  The court concurred with the prior finding of the High Court that the couple&rsquo;s Dutch divorce obtained in 1994 was not recognised in Ireland on the basis that the husband&rsquo;s domicile was still in Ireland.  In the judgment in question, Chief Justice Keane remarked: &ldquo;Evidence as to a form of residence in a foreign country so dependant on the particular personal circumstances of the person alleged to have abandoned a domicile of origin is very far removed from the evidence of a fixed intention to make one&rsquo;s permanent home in a foreign country, which the authorities stipulate as the essential precondition to a finding that a domicile of origin has been abandoned and a domicile of choice acquired.&rdquo;  As I indicated, it is very difficult to lose a domicile of origin.</P>
        <P>The jurisdiction we have conferred on our courts is directly comparable with the jurisdiction in relation to marital status.  This is based on clear, well-understood and applied principles of jurisdiction in private international law.  I do not see any case for deviating from that settled policy.  This is exactly what pertains in regard to the manner in which we deal with foreign divorces.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, subsection (1), line 27, after &ldquo;into&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(including a relationship entered into prior to the commencement of this section)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 5 relates to recognition of registered foreign relationships.  The amendments are all aimed at strengthening this provision.  The first amendment is a simple statement that the provisions will cover relationships entered into prior to the commencement of the section.  I believe this may already be the case.  Given that the Minister is nodding, I presume the amendment is unnecessary.  It was proposed for the simple purpose of clarifying that persons who had entered same-sex marriages or partnerships abroad prior to the commencement of the Act would still be entitled to recognition.  I am glad this is clear from the wording.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Labour Party supports amendment No. 8 in the name of Senator Norris which addresses an important point on which I have received submissions.  Where a gay couple get married abroad in a jurisdiction in which same-sex marriage is recognised, as it is increasingly in various European jurisdictions, including most recently Portugal, as well as Canada, South Africa and elsewhere, under section 5 a marriage contracted abroad will only be recognised here as a civil partnership.  Senator Norris has correctly tabled a simple and straightforward amendment providing that the Minister can declare a class of legal relationship to be entered into by two parties of the same-sex as entitled to be recognised as a civil partnership or marriage.  Under section 5, as it stands, the Minister would only be entitled to recognise a Canadian same-sex marriage as a civil partnership here, which clearly does not give the marriage equivalent status to that accorded in Canadian law.  From the point of view of the couple concerned, this could be viewed as a downgrading of their status since they have entered a marriage.  We propose to give recognition to foreign marriages as marriages rather than just as civil partnerships.  It is complicated because there are many types of civil partnership across EU countries, some open to same-sex and opposite-sex couples and some only to same-sex couples.  It is difficult to say they are all equal.  The amendment recognises that same-sex couples may marry abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 9 is to address submissions we received about individual cases of hardship where persons have died before the Bill commences.  While we very much hope that will not happen, there may be cases where people would wish to enter a civil partnership arrangement but there is likely to be some delay before the Bill is commenced.  If one partner in a relationship dies before the Bill is commenced, we are seeking to ensure that if they entered a foreign civil partnership or marriage abroad, that could be recognised retrospectively here as a valid civil partnership.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify when the Bill is likely to be commenced and whether he is willing to accept amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  I will not press amendment No. 7 in the light of what he has said.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Bacik that the issue of foreign relationships is extremely important.  The Minister may remember a previous occasion &mdash; it may have been on the Order of Business &mdash; when I brought in three enormous files, each 1 ft thick.  That is the degree of the practical problem on the ground.  It is essential that we establish a clear position on the recognition of foreign relationships.  Senator Bacik has absolutely intuited what I intended in this amendment.  While I will not press it tonight, I reserve the right to re-enter it, as I might do with some other ones, on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to consider the following proposition.  I am sure he is well aware that the Icelandic Prime Minister, Johanna Sigurdardottir, has married within the last week in Reykjavik her female, same-sex, partner.  That is a marriage.  If there was a visit, or a decision to come and live in this country, would the Minister consider it appropriate to purport to downgrade the recognition given to that relationship in a foreign country?  That would be colossal impertinence.  I would be astonished if that happened.  We ought to have respect for other institutions.  Even if there is reluctance to recognise marriage here, we should certainly recognise the right of other jurisdictions to make what arrangements they democratically, with free votes, in full conscience, with due deference to tolerance and all the rest of that decide to make for their citizens.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 7 proposes to specify that a relationship entered into prior to making an order under section 5 is also recognised by that order.  However, there is no doubt that this is already the case.  The wording of section 5 makes this abundantly clear.  A relevant relationship is recognised from the later of the date on which the order took effect or the date on which that relationship was entered into.  For example if a couple entered into a civil partnership in the United Kingdom in 2006, that relationship will be recognised as and from the date on which the relevant order takes effect.  If a couple entered a same-sex marriage in Spain in 2012, a relevant order having been made in 2011, their relationship will be recognised as and from the date of their marriage.  Officials in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel considered the issue carefully during the drafting of the Bill.  Since the passage of the Bill through the other House my officials have again reconfirmed with the Office of the Attorney General that this is the correct and only interpretation possible.  As I believe Senator Bacik has already acknowledged, amendment No. 7 is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 8, section 5 makes provision for recognition by ministerial order of certain legal relationships entered into by same-sex couples in other jurisdictions as being entitled to the same legal treatment in Ireland as a civil partnership.  The amendment is intended to allow such relationships to be recognised as a civil partnership and a marriage, presumably in the case where the relevant relationship is a marriage between a same-sex couple entered into in a country such as Spain, Canada, Belgium or South Africa, which provide for marriage between same-sex couples.</P>
        <P>Public discussion since the Bill was published has concentrated on a number of specific areas of which the most fundamental is why we have not decided to open civil marriage to same-sex couples.  My clear legal advice on this area has consistently been that it would not be constitutionally sound to legislate for same-sex marriage without holding a constitutional referendum on the definition of family.  Marriage may not be expressly defined in the Constitution, but it has always been understood in common law as being between a man and a woman, ideally for life.  I do not believe the necessary political and social consensus exists to make such a constitutional referendum desirable.  The all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution concluded that a referendum to change the definition of family would be extremely divisive and would by no means be certain of success.  When I was party to the Commission on the Family, its report was unable to define the family as such.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 9 allows for recognition of foreign civil partnership where one of the partners dies before the section is commenced and possibly prior to the enactment of the Bill.  The effect would be to give recognition here of a foreign-registered civil partnership entered into, for example, in 2006 where one of the partners died, for example, in 2008 when civil partnership was not recognised in the State.  This would introduce grave uncertainty for the tax code and for succession law.  It is not possible to provide for retrospective recognition of foreign civil partnerships where there is a potential detriment to third parties, such as by improving the share of a surviving partner in their deceased partner&rsquo;s estate.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested that the Lourdes Marriage Act 1972 provides a direct precedent to allow retrospective recognition.  However, I cannot accept this.  There is a substantive difference <Col N="256"/>between the situation of an opposite sex couple who marry in another jurisdiction with the belief that marriage is internationally recognised and binding, and that of a couple who enter into a same sex civil partnership elsewhere in the full knowledge that there is no provision made in Irish law for recognition of that relationship.  In the first circumstance, the couple have always assumed that they are married for the purposes of Irish law with all its rights and obligations.  In the latter circumstance, the couple can have no assumption in respect of rights and benefits that would accrue to them under existing Irish law.</P>
        <P>The amendment would also have a discriminatory effect on the basis of nationality.  Some of a particular category of legal relationships where the partner has died would be recognised as existing at a particular time, whereas others would not be recognised, depending on whether one or both of the partners was Irish and was resident in Ireland at the time the relationship was registered.  A further anomaly would arise simply if the couple had registered the relationship before the arbitrary cut off point of 1 January 2004.</P>
        <P>The amendment also proposed the insertion of a new subsection 4.  This would create a new function for an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir in enabling him to register relationships entered into in another jurisdiction as civil partnerships.  The making of a ministerial order under section 5(1) is sufficient in itself to entitle the parties to foreign registered relationships to be treated as civil partners of each other under the law of the State.  There is no requirement or necessity for re-registration.  By way of comparison, opposite sex couples who marry in another jurisdiction are neither required nor permitted to re-register their marriages under Irish law.  There is no reason that couples entitled to be treated as civil partners should do so either.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 16, to delete lines 37 to 40.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">These amendments go to the core of the motivation that has prompted us to relinquish the Whip of our own party, which has been a difficult decision for all three of us.  It goes back to comments we have made over a long period about upholding the constitutional position of marriage, specifically for the reason that the constitutional protection is provided.</P>
        <P>Marriage is not only the foundation stone for the family, but it is also for society.  This has been the case for many generations.  We need to be extremely careful that we do not jettison an institution that has stood society in good stead for many generations and many centuries.  It is a Christian institution, but not only that.  No matter what part of the world one visits, the structures of the society and the value system they have within their society emanates from the quality of their family systems.  One will be struck by this in many parts of the world, particularly in China, where there is a strong family ethos.</P><Col N="257"/>
        <P>We should remind ourselves that those Christian values have given rights to us.  It is fair to say that our human rights in the main flow from those Christian values.</P>
        <P>We are proposing to delete the paragraph that defines civil status.  We feel that putting civil status in is creating the equivalence between marital status and civil partnership status, to which we object.  We have replaced it with what we think is a reasonable amendment, which replaces it with marital status and civil partnership status.  I do not want to anticipate the Minister&rsquo;s response, but I hope we will not be reducing the importance of marital status to society down to an issue of administrative convenience.</P>
        <P>The child focus of marriage is the main reason &mdash; perhaps the only reason &mdash; it enjoys the unique constitutional protection that is specified therein.  It puts an onus on the State to protect it in unique ways and to give it the necessary financial and other supports in order to maintain it as the priority that it has for society.  It follows obviously from this that the State must respect marriage.</P>
        <P>We are of the view that this particular amendment, and the change in the wording, is inconsequential for the thrust of the intent of the Bill to bring benefits to civil partnership between people in same sex relationships who commit to each other.  However, we think it is very important for the signal that society gets from the Minister, the Government and these legislative Houses.  For that reason, we think it is important.  It is also fair to say this signal is also being sent to adolescents and we see an importance in that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask that the Minister concede this particular amendment, which does not cause any particular difficulties from the point of view of a genuine distinction, if the intent of this Bill is to recognise clearly the distinction between the marital status and the civil partnership status, and that they are not all left under the same heading of civil status, which insinuates the equivalence we will not and cannot support for reasons I have outlined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment goes right to the core of what people who have been endeavouring to put forward a counter balance to the debate on this Bill have been saying for a long time.  The Minister has been saying the same thing.  In other words, the civil partnership Bill is not marriage.  The reason for that is that marriage as we understand it is protected within the Constitution.  If we were to conflict with that, it is evident we would require a referendum.  If we had a referendum, there really would be a full and comprehensive public debate on this Bill and its import.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the same time, we are sending a message to the people that we are talking about civil status.  It is important we differentiate between marital status and civil partnership status in the legislation.  I cannot understand how anyone who supports this Bill, on the basis the Minister put it to us, could disagree with this amendment.  In many ways, it would remove much of the confusion and misunderstanding.</P>
        <P>I am also surprised that it takes an amendment to highlight these issues.  Considering the matters we have been discussing in regard to the Constitution, one would have thought we would have embraced those very same points within the legislation when it came to us.  For that reason, I support this amendment.  I hope that even at this late stage, it will be possible for the Minister to understand the reason we have tabled this amendment and how it would help to clarify any misunderstanding among the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senators Walsh, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Hanafin on tabling their amendment.  Senator Quinn and I have tabled an amendment along similar lines.  It appears for the first time at the definition stage.  We propose that on page 16, line 37, we delete the words &ldquo;civil status&rdquo; and substitute them with the phrase &ldquo;marital or civil status&rdquo; which would encompass the range of possibilities, including single, married, separated, divorced and so on and that elsewhere in the Bill, where the words &ldquo;civil status&rdquo; appear and in the Acts to be amended by this Bill, the phrase &ldquo;marital or civil status&rdquo; would appear.</P>
        <P>Recently, I took part in a debate on the constitutional referendum on children.  One of the points I made was that the opening line in the proposed amendment that came from the Oireachtas joint committee was that the State would cherish all the children of the State equally.  I regarded that as being rather sloppily drafted and rather uncertain in its meaning, both now and in the context of future interpretation by the courts.</P>
        <P>One can say that sometimes when one starts out with a change of terminology or phrase in important legislation or in constitutional provisions, it is a bit like a ship changing course ever so slightly.  It does not seem to make much difference at the outset of the journey but it can make a hell of a difference at the point of destination.</P>
        <P>This amendment may look like it is symbolic.  In many ways, it is in the sense that it does not touch on the fundamental definition of civil partnership or the question of whether we should generously encompass other caring dependent relationships or whether we should provide for people&rsquo;s legitimate disagreements and conscience around certain issues.  It does not deal with any of those practical and portentous issues which surface in the Bill but, none the less, it could have a huge impact in terms of the ongoing shaping of our culture, of which all our legislation is part.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Everyone has a marital status, whether single, divorced, separated or married.  The point is that in the future, they will not have a marital status but a civil status.  That may not seem to make a whole pile of difference to many people.  I accept that, at some level, it may seem to be a symbolic change.  However, the underlying approach to the drafting and shaping of this Bill has sought to insist at all times that marriage continues to be special, different and privileged by the Constitution and respected in our laws in harmony with the Constitution.  The logic of that is that we should not change people&rsquo;s marital status to the civil status <i>simpliciter</i>.  If anything, the phrase &ldquo;marital or civil status&rdquo; envisages a certain compromise in that it recognises that there is now for the first time a new kind of State-sponsored, State-recognised partnership between people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For example, one could argue that civil partnership is a marital status of the non-marital kind of partnership but it makes some sense to maintain the special nature of marriage in the house and at front of house.  This is one of those front of house amendments.  It is about what we call things, how we name things and, ultimately, how we see things.  For that reason, we should keep marriage and the concept of marriage as a cherished institution in our society &mdash; I suppose it is the most cherished of all &mdash; front and centre at all times.  Therefore, our language and that of the Constitution, legislation and forms, whether applications for goods or services, <Col N="259"/>should reflect the special status we give to marriage.  It is on that basis I propose these amendments but I will listen with interest to what the Minister has to say about my colleagues&rsquo; alternative amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I spoke on Second Stage and said the reason I supported this Bill, subject I hope to certain amendments, was because of the loneliness of those who had been left behind by our legislation in the past.  The fact we did not have divorce, contraceptive legislation or legislation in regard to homosexuality meant there were some very lonely people.  I believe that loneliness very often led to suicide and we did not have steps to protect us from that.  I mention that because it is important we pass legislation which closes those gaps in society.  We have closed most of those gaps in recent years, or perhaps opened them might be the word.  I want to give that opportunity to those who have been left behind by what I would call the legislation which put a stigma on homosexuality.</P>
        <P>Given the answer these Houses found, namely, civil partnership which was acceptable to all sides, I felt the legislation was certainly going in the right direction.  These amendments pinpoint very clearly that the intention of this legislation is to have civil partnership and not a full marriage.  All these amendments do is ensure and emphasise that is the intention.  They are worthy of consideration and should be accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with great interest to five speeches all on the same side and, for a little bit of balance, I would like to say a few words.  I regret that I had no idea my colleague on these benches, Senator Quinn, was so extraordinarily insensitive that he is not aware of how patronising his remarks were.  He said we are lonely and left behind.  For God&rsquo;s sake, it reminds me of Jimmy Saville at 2 a.m. on the BBC and shut-ins.  I am not a shut-in.  I am not the slightest bit lonely.  I think I know as much about this as Senator Quinn because I have been working in this area.  At one stage, there was a proposal in the Hirschfeld Centre, which was very well meant, to have a group called the lonely gay society.  I thought, that will really copperfasten our lousy self-image.  I do not like it.  I do not like this nasty thing of trying to rub our noses in it and downgrade us.  That is what Senator Quinn was doing and that is why I find it very difficult to entertain the warm feelings I previously did towards him.  I say this in all honesty and with regret.  However, that is a fact.  I very strongly object to being patronised.  If that is offensive, it is not half as offensive as what has been said in the House by various people.</P>
        <P>This matter has been discussed already.  It was discussed in the Title and I made my feelings clear on that.  I hope we can dispose of it quickly and get rid of it.</P>

	<P>These amendments have no merit.  The term &ldquo;civil status&rdquo; is defined as being &ldquo;single, married, separated, divorced or widowed&rdquo;.  It is not a great extension of that term to include a civil status for a former partner in a civil partnership that has ended.  The amendments would make a nonsense of the proposed legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris is right.  We have discussed this in the context of the Title of the Bill.  The amendments should be rejected out of hand.</P>

        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about the import of the Bill and Senators Walsh and Hanafin spoke about the crux of their opposition to the Bill.  Herein lies the crux as I understand from them.  The Bill is about civil partnership and the tenet of it is civil status.  That is what the Bill is about.  It is about creating a civil partnership and recognising that partnership.  I have a <Col N="260"/>profound difficulty with the amendments.  I have listened to the debate on this section of the Bill and I cannot understand where the amendments are coming from.  They are the beginning of an attack on what the Bill is about.</P>

We either stand up and be counted or we do not.  I genuinely understand Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments.  He is not wrong, but we cannot have it both ways.  We are either for civil partnership and recognition of unions or we are not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask Members who proposed the amendments what is wrong with the wording of the Bill.  What is so clearly wrong with what Senator Regan said is the definition of civil status?

        <P>It is a fact that marriage under our Constitution is regarded as special and to be protected in a particular way.  It flows from this that one would seek that any legislation touching on marriage or other relationships would maintain the centrality of marriage as the preferred social norm.  That is, if one likes, the elephant in the room &mdash; the underlying constitutional position.  It is a position which the Government is not ready to deny, at least not yet.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 midnight</TimeSt><P>Senator Buttimer makes the mistake in that he thinks in some way, by our suggesting any references to &ldquo;civil status&rdquo; be changed to &ldquo;marital or civil status&rdquo;, we would be undermining the essential provisions of the Bill, when nothing could be further from the truth.  It does not undermine any of what the Bill actually provides for but it selects a kind of nomenclature that sends out a cultural and social message about the centrality of marriage.  It says more about other people&rsquo;s willingness to undermine marriage that they would have a difficulty with what is being proposed here and that they seem to resent the idea that marital status would be kept in a central way.  What Senator Buttimer does not seem to have recognised or realised, or what his comments did not recognise, is that this is not just about what is in this Bill.  The Bill amends many other Acts and it therefore has implications for existing laws and for existing references in those laws&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach <Col N="263"/>to bear in mind we are not limited for time.  It was necessary for me to bring in some clarification because Senator Buttimer clearly misunderstood&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">As George Bush would say, he perhaps &ldquo;misunderestimated&rdquo; our tenacity but he clearly misunderstood the effect of the change from marital status to civil status throughout the Bill, and he clearly misunderstood the intended effect of our amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have said many times since the Bill began in this House and the other House that the Government and the Oireachtas are constrained in how far we can go because of the Constitution.  I said many times that there are detailed and distinct differences between what is being proposed in this Bill, namely, civil partnership, and marriage, as Senator Mullen said.  While I cannot recall his exact words, the Senator begrudgingly, I think, states that the Government acknowledges this is in the Constitution.  It is clear that everything we have done in this regard, and Senator Walsh accepted this, was done in order to craft this legislation to show a clear distinction between marriage and civil partnership.  As I said, that may not satisfy people who want full marriage for same-sex couples and it may not satisfy others who feel we are nearly going too far and equating civil partnership with marriage in some instances.  That is a matter of opinion.  I have on previous occasions and I can again during the discussion on this Bill clearly indicate at least ten if not more clear distinctions between marriage and civil partnership.  I do not say that in any victorious way or in any way in which I would suggest that marriage is higher than civil partnership, but obviously it has to be because that is what the Constitution states.</P>
        <P>What we are dealing with here is terminology.  To date, the discussion has revolved around the change from using the term &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; to the overarching term &ldquo;civil status&rdquo;.  This does not in any way constitute a downgrading of marriage in any sense, nor could it, because of the very views we have expressed in regard to the special status of marriage as per the Constitution.  As has previously been said, &ldquo;civil status&rdquo; means single, married, separated, divorced, widowed, in a civil partnership or being a former civil partner in a civil partnership that has ended by death or being dissolved.  Again, I point out it is an overarching term which includes both marital and civil partnership status.</P>
        <P>The distinction the Senator is trying to get at is totally unnecessary in that the definition of &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; includes all of those terms.  The Bill extends protection from discrimination to take account of the civil partnership we are creating here &mdash; no more, no less.  The term &ldquo;civil status&rdquo; is being substituted for &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; throughout the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 so that the statutory obligation not to discriminate against a person on the ground that the person is single, married, separated, divorced or widowed is now being extended to prohibit discrimination against a person based on that person being in a registered civil partnership or formally in a registered civil partnership which is being dissolved.  While some may quibble with the terminology, I hope they accept it is important if we pass this legislation that we include civil partnership and those other aspects of it in the existing legislation about non-discrimination from an equality point of view.  Perhaps Members could clarify this point if it is otherwise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The term &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; throughout the Civil Registration Act 2004 and in that context the change is made for primarily administrative reasons.  The separate recording on forms of marital status and civil partnership status would otherwise inevitably lead to the collection of incomplete and misleading information.  For example, if we pass this Bill civil partners could be obliged to record themselves on a census form as single under the marital status designation, if we accept the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion, and as civil partners <Col N="264"/>under the civil partnership status.  Therefore, they would be designated on the same form as having both states.  Should single people record themselves under both states or only under one status which conforms to their particular sexual orientation?  While I understand what the Senator is suggesting, if it is merely to try to emphasise the distinction between marriage and civil partnership, that is fair enough, but if it is going to the heart of this issue, which is the extension of discrimination against civil partners if we pass this legislation, I would like to hear it.</P>
        <P>A criticism has been levelled that this substitution reduces the status of marriage to one of a list of possibilities.  This is not valid since in some places where the term civil status is now proposed to be used, being married is already one of the list of possibilities.  Marital status in the relevant enactments includes at least five separate possibilities &mdash; single, married, separated, divorced or widowed.  For completeness the further categories of being a civil partner or being a former civil partner whose relationship has ended on death or dissolution are being added.</P>
        <P>I am not saying Senator Walsh accepts the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government, but he should accept its confirmation that this legislation has been moulded in such a way that we must acknowledge the existing constitutional protections for the family.  I have said time and again that until that is changed, we are obliged, as legislators, to comply with the constitutional imperative.  I suggest to Senators that they accept the Government statement that any change we are making in this respect is purely for administrative purposes in order to ensure that there will be no duplication and confusion when people are signing forms after the passage of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister seemed to seek clarification.  If I understand him correctly, he is asking if it is the intent of the amendments to detract from the protections against discrimination on the grounds of civil status under equal status legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  It relates to the Equality Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, this would be just a change of phraseology in that wherever there is a reference to civil status, there would be a reference to marital or civil status.  That would apply to the proposed equality legislation also.  In other words, the new prohibitive ground would be marital or civil status.</P>
        <P>There is a separate amendment which I hope the Minister has studied in great detail and to which I hope he will respond in the affirmative.  It is proposed that difficulties of conscience be specifically catered for and that there be a limitation of the scope.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw that and that is why I asked the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two discrete issues.  I hope the Minister will consider the amendment on its merits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely, although I accept what the Senator says, that he is merely trying to emphasise that there is a distinction between civil status and marriage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is necessary for the Senator to say this publicly because it could be construed from what is being suggested in the amendments that there is an effort to restrict&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is another Senator offering.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="265"/>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>With the best will in the world, I do not think what the Minister suggests could be construed from the way the amendment and related amendments are worded.  It could have no impact other than at the level of nomenclature, if that is the correct word to use.  It is at that symbolic, cultural and messaging level the amendment would operate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has indicated he perceives a deficiency in what has been proposed because he suggests it might to lead to confusion.  For example, people might give one answer under the heading of marital status and another under the heading of civil status.  I have just heard the Minister&rsquo;s comments and do not know if that is a valid criticism of what Senator Walsh is concerned with.  Does the Minister accept he cannot make that criticism of what I have proposed, that we substitute one phrase with another throughout the Bill?  I do not see how the particular objection raised by him could possibly apply to the amendments I have proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not happy with the Minister&rsquo;s response and there is no point in saying otherwise.  On Second Stage I mentioned issues which motivated us in these amendments.  On marriage breakdown, divorce and cohabitation, the graph is moving upwards.  There is both a social and an economic cost, about which every Member of the House should have concerns.  The amendment would not advance the issue to any great extent, but it is essential that we send a message to society that marriage is the institution on which the fabric of society is soundly based.  I make no apology for saying this because of the child-centred nature of marriage.  I have already conceded that if this was not the case, marriage would be the same as all other relationships, particularly those of a sexual nature.  In this instance we must ensure the message is sent loud and clear.  The Minister and Members such as Senators Buttimer and Bacik should know the amendment would not have any consequences for the rights being granted in the Bill to civil partnerships. </P>
        <P>Senator Norris made some critical comments about Senator Quinn.  There is no more measured or considerate person in this House than Senator Quinn.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been suggested there is an administrative difficulty with the amendment.  I see no potential difficulty in filling in forms.  One should merely have a box to tick indicating whether one is married, divorced, single or in a civil partnership.  We have left in the phrases &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; specifically because we want to retain the <Col N="266"/>phrase &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; in the Employment Act, the Equal Status Act, the Pension Act and the Social Welfare Act.</P>
        <P>Apart from the signals sent to society, we have a further concern which has engaged me since the middle of 2000 when we had a debate within the parliamentary party.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should comment on the amendments before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  The removal of the phrase &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; is the source of concern, as I indicated to the Minister in writing in December 2008.  My specific inquiry concerned the implications of removing that phrase, given that the European Court of Justice had a remit to consider anti-discrimination measures.  Therefore, as a result of what we were doing in this Bill, we could be landed in a position where the European Court of Justice would give us a direction.  I asked for clarification but have not received it.  The letter is dated 19 December 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That has nothing to do with the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates specifically to a concerns which has motivated us in tabling the amendments before us and show why we feel so strongly about the issue.  We are concerned about the implications of removing the phrase &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; in the Acts mentioned, particularly the Equal Status Act.  I have not received clarification in that respect.  My second point relates to the importance of marriage and the signal being sent to society in that regard.  These beliefs are genuinely held.  We did not table the amendments lightly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Senator Walsh went into more detail, despite the late hour, because he gave us a broader understanding of where he is coming from.  I fundamentally disagree with him in much of what he said.  I still believe what the Minister is saying is correct.  There is absolutely no need for the amendments because as a society we have come to the position of civil status.  To suggest that there are married couples who, through no fault of their own, cannot conceive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Walsh appeared to state that the Bill is not about placing a tick in a box.  If that is the motivation behind the amendment before the House, then each of us should review where we stand.  This matter is not about placing a tick in a box.  I support Senator McDonald in respect of this issue.  She was correct in stating that there is no need for the amendment.  I am glad the Minister agrees with Members on this side of the House.  This Bill is not designed to undermine the institution of marriage.  As the Minister indicated, the Constitution protects that institution.  Under the Bill, marriage will not be diminished; it will, in fact, be given even further protection.  Marriage is enshrined within the Constitution of this land.  In such circumstances, the amendment makes no sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It is getting late and people are becoming tired.  However, I must admit that some terribly mixed messages are coming across in this debate at present.  Senator Walsh made a comment on an administrative issue which he understood to have been raised by the Minister.  That was where the box was ticked.  The matter in question had nothing to do with the overall debate.  Regardless of whether the Senator made his point at midnight or 4 a.m., that fact was quite clear to me.  In fairness to Senator Walsh, that must be highlighted.</P>
        <P>On the question of procreation and the family, I heard what the Senator had to say.  I do not believe these are fundamental issues.  There are many amendments remaining and if the debate <Col N="268"/>is going to come down to a particular level, then I am of the view that we will miss the opportunity, not to change the Bill &mdash; which is not going to happen &mdash; but to ensure every issue relating to it is teased out in a democratic and proper manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should stick to the words used and should not impute motivations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There also appears to be a suggestion that a distinction is being made in respect of persons who are civil partners as opposed to those who are single, separate, married or divorced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not contained in the paper.  We can only refer to the words that were used.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to re-emphasise that an overarching phrase which contains two words is being provided to try to deal holistically with different types of status.  If the legislation is passed, those in civil partnerships will be contemplated within those different types of status.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not questioning the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides.  He knows me well enough to know that I am a straight talker.  We tabled an amendment which, despite what anyone might say, is inconsequential to the interests of people who are in same-sex relationships who want to enter civil partnerships.  There is no way the amendment could denigrate the position in this regard.  However, the amendment constitutes a litmus test.  In that context, I ask the Minister to address the genuine concerns that I raised in my letter to him dated 19 September&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We are not discussing the Senator&rsquo;s letter.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator cannot discuss his letter.  We are discussing the amendments in this group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the Minister to clarify the position in respect of this matter and indicate whether we have moved beyond the issue of family law, with regard to which the European Court of Justice had no jurisdiction.  What will be the effect of this section on the Equal Status Act as a result of the removal of marital status?  This is a matter of genuine concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I can outline the position in very blunt terms.  The advice is that there are no implications whatsoever in that regard.</P>
