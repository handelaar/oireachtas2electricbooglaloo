        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ciaran Cannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to indicate the reason an application to carry out works at the Lorro Gate, Athenry, County Galway, has not yet been processed, despite it being over three years since the application was first submitted.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Members will have attended the briefing this morning, at which the Carers Association spoke about the value of the contribution its members make to the economy, namely, &euro;2.5 billion, as listed county by county.  This makes me think about the very difficult decisions that will have to be taken in the coming weeks on the budget and the public finances and, in that context, how we will protect our social capital.  This is a very important question, one that does not receive much attention.  How we support organisations such as the Carers Association is critical.  How we can help to develop and support community organisations and a community spirit at this very difficult time is an issue we need to address in the current context.  People believe they are being thrown back on their own resources, which is the truth in many cases.</P>
        <P>That brings me to the call for national consensus and the current state of play.  This morning it is clear that there is no agreement between the Government parties on the need for national consensus.  This became clear yesterday from what the Taoiseach said.  We are now trying to understand precisely what is on offer from the Government.  I want to make it very clear that Fine Gael is engaging with the Department of Finance and accepts the parameters set of needing to reach the figure of 3% by 2014.  We accept the degree of adjustment that is needed and that very tough decisions will have to be taken.  Of that there is no doubt.</P>
        <P>Last year we presented a very detailed budget proposal, outlining how we would approach the difficult decisions.  We will be taking a very responsible attitude to the serious decisions that have to be taken by the country.  The public want to see leadership and people are worried about their mortgages and whether they will be able to pay them.  They are worried about their incomes and how to meet their bills.  People are very concerned at the moment at the evident paralysis when it comes to support for mortgage holders, for example, and cutbacks in their income.  The country faces a really difficult period in the next few weeks.  I asked yesterday how we might best work in this House to begin to reflect some of these public concerns, to talk about the difficult decisions that have to be taken, and to begin to address them.</P>
        <P>We on this side of the House are certainly up for that.  We want to show leadership because the public is demanding it from the political system.  People want to see the political system responding in a very responsible way.  They want answers on the key questions facing them, whether they are going to get the type of supports they need, and where the cutbacks will take place.  I still say it is not good enough that the Minister for Finance is in the United States talking about cutbacks in social welfare and pensions but not discussing this here.  I call for those meaningful debates in this House over the next critical three to four weeks.</P>
        <P>I would also like a debate on the national children&rsquo;s hospital because it is unclear where the approximate figure of &euro;200 million that is outstanding will come from.  Will the Leader arrange that debate in the House as soon as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for ensuring there was no problem with the Order of Business.  I thank the Leader also for accommodating my colleagues by allowing a debate on CIE to take place during the discussion on the national spatial strategy tomorrow.  That certainly will be very helpful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the issues we have discussed many times in the House in the past 20 years is the democratic deficit created by the existence of social partnership.  I have always argued that the <Col N="889"/>elimination of social partnership would not create any greater involvement of the political parties, mainly because they were afraid of their lives to get involved in something that would require them to compromise, lead, take risks and establish timing.  The current debate on consensus proves that to me.  There is no appetite in these Houses for people to fill the gap created by a lack of social partnership.  Rather, the appetite is for having a go at whoever happens to be in power by whoever happens to be in Opposition at any given time, and there is no change to that.  There is a lack of leadership on this issue and a fear of risk taking.  I have never sat at a negotiating table but that the majority of letters and phone calls were telling me not to do so, to walk away and not to get involved.  I spoke to John Hume when he started his opening talks with Sinn F&eacute;in, and he had the same experience of being told not to do it, the timing was wrong, he would be destroyed, etc.  These are the risks of leadership and they are not being taken.  Now that we have reached this pass, let us hear all the great chat, proposals and so on from the parties in both Houses.</P>
        <P>We discussed many issues yesterday and my colleague, Senator Eoghan Harris, raised the point of making the Croke Park agreement work.  He also went on to talk about the public sector.  I take issue with one aspect of this.  He is completely right in saying we have to reform the public sector, but it should be remembered that more than 1.8 million people go to work every morning, only 500,000 of whom are public servants.  The idea that we can deal with the economic crisis through addressing the public service is a distraction.  The public service has to play its part but we must ensure those with wealth, assets and high salaries, wherever they are, pay more than the people on the other side.  No one can argue with that.  Before we get carried away with the productive sector, let us recognise it was not the public sector that got us into the mess we are in, although it had a part to play because, along with the Government, it was responsible for creating the economic circumstances that allowed the productive sector to grow.  It failed, in the event.  There is no question about this and the Croke Park agreement debate should look into that.</P>
        <P>Before we get carried away with what the business community could do, we might look back to three to four years ago to see what might have happened had we taken such an initiative then.  We might have had Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick as Minister for Finance and &ldquo;Fingers&rdquo; Fingleton running enterprise and employment.  This is the reality.  We need to be calm about these things and ensure everyone plays his or her part and allow no one to get off the hook in order that people on high salaries are pulled down and pay their share, while also ensuring a quality public service is in place that does its business of allowing economic growth to take place.</P>

	<P>I would appreciate it if people would reduce their use of Christian names and not use other names for people outside the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader for a debate on the need for unity in Government.  The news from yesterday shows that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, might have been looking for consensus with the Opposition parties, but he cannot even achieve it within the Government with his Taoiseach.  It is now very clear that the Government lacks any type of coherent direction and that there is a marked lack of unity and a difference of purpose.  This is yet another reason we need a general election urgently because it does not bode well for the budget.  In this House we could usefully debate the need for unity in Government and the lack of direction we currently have.</P>
        <P>I am sure Members will all want to join with me in welcoming the good news this morning of the rescue of the first few Chilean miners and the extremely and well thought out rescue operation that is under way.  We wish them very well in taking out the remaining men.  It reminds us, again of the unrelenting grimness of the economic news here, the lack of any good news in this country, while highlighting yet again the need for a change of Government, a <Col N="890"/>change of direction and a new unity of purpose in a unified Administration, which is clearly not what we have at the moment.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on third level education, as I have done many times before.  We need a debate, and not just on the financing of third level education, which is critical with universities and colleges being seriously underfunded.  We see our colleges and universities sliding downwards in international rankings and losing competitiveness at a time when these need to be maintained.  We also need a debate on the future for graduates in Ireland.  The Government said last year it would offer graduate placement programmes and training schemes.  There was even talk of internships within Departments for graduates, but we have not seen any of those.  At what stage are those proposals and can have a debate in the House in this regard?  On a day when the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, is organising a national lobby, we need some clear answers from the Government about its plans for third level education.  Otherwise, as USI has said, our graduates will just have two choices: emigration or the dole.  Those were the choices we faced when I was in college in the 1980s and it is a very dark day when we see that time returning again for graduates and for young people generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Ratings agencies have had an overall malign influence on the state of the international economy in recent years.  In Ireland we have suffered recently from what seems to have been a self-fulfilling prophecy of negative reviews from ratings agencies, yet today there is a positive indication from one such agency, Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, to the effect that our economic situation can be resolved in the short term, and if the necessary action is taken, this can be achieved more quickly than in other economies in Europe.</P>
        <P>I am not surprised that this has gone unmentioned by the Opposition.  I suspect that if a commentary to the contrary were on offer from Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, we would hear all about it.  If we are discussing the lack of consensus and the need for such a debate in this House, we should start by having a common approach to the international commentary on how Ireland is perceived in terms of its economy and its politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>What sort of nonsense is that?  How can we have that? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>My contribution was preceded by precisely this type of negative commentary which ignores a positive indicator of Ireland&rsquo;s present position and where we can get to.  We lack that proper debate.  I do not believe there was any contribution yesterday in the other House which disabused my party leader of the initiative he has undertaken.  The words of the Taoiseach were adequate as an acknowledgement of where we need to go.  Too many people are looking at body language and relying on false displays of enthusiasm and emotion to convey where we need to get to from here.  If we do not do this as a collective political body and see a general election as being the only alternative, where the main Opposition parties have no common platform and no areas of agreement as to how we should move forward economically, how is this supposed to offer any clarity?  That is why we need such a debate in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>As well as the big issues being discussed in the House, there are other matters we need to deal with urgently.  I am struck by the fact, mentioned by a previous speaker, that 75% of the workforce at Google are from outside this jurisdiction.  It is amazing that we, who pride ourselves on having a modern economy driven by information technology, are not actually able to provide enough graduates for one of the most forward-thinking companies in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="891"/>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an issue we must consider urgently.</P>
        <P>Another problem cropping up is the quality of junior doctors.  I have raised this issue in the House before.  A number of junior doctors have been placed under extra supervision by their consultants because their English is not of the required standard.  I am not talking about the quality of their medical education.  However, there are concerns about the standard of their English.  What hope do these doctors have of conversing with sick patients from a culturally different background when they cannot speak English to a sufficient level?</P>
        <P>When we talk about consensus in the House, we should be careful not to settle for a bar stool consensus.  We should not have a knee-jerk response to narrow discussions.  There is a need for us to think this through.  There are issues in that consensus goes against what some consider to be our democratic set-up.  There are also concerns about the agenda behind its promotion.  We on this side of the House will take a pragmatic approach to how the country should be run.  We have stated, as Senator Fitzgerald said, that we agree with many of the parameters suggested; I see this as consensus.  However, we will not be railroaded into a silly little grouping such as a HSE forum to discuss the future of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s view about graduates and the possibility of seeking internships.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We have given a lead, under the leadership of the Cathaoirleach and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, in establishing internships in the Seanad.  I compliment the commission, the Captain of the Guard and the Superintendent for their co-operation in this regard.  It is a good example of what can happen here and should be spread to the rest of the public service.  There is much room for the people concerned.  We should not be afraid of bringing in graduates because they might show up certain things.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the proposal made by the Minister for Education and Skills to reduce the number of VECs from 33 to 16.  This would be a major rationalisation which has been talked about for a number of years.  As I said at the parliamentary party meeting last night, we could end up in a situation similar to that which resulted when we amalgamated all of the health boards, which was not a great success.  Perhaps rationalisation is not always the best way to go, although there is certainly a need for improvements in the system.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister to come to the House for a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>As someone who has been in the House for a while and a former Minister of State, I am concerned about the lack of legislation before the House.  There should be far more legislation before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot understand why the parties involved will not deal with the matter.  The Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 was passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but has not yet been dealt with in this House.  It is an important Bill and the Minister concerned should bring it before the House.  Another Bill with which we should be dealing is the Communications (Retention of Data) Bill 2009, transposing European legislation, which was passed by the D&aacute;il in 2009.  That is what this House is meant to do.  It is a separate Chamber from the D&aacute;il, from which we are not under instruction.  We can initiate and process legislation.  I am suggesting to the Leader of the House and whoever is involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have to get a consensus on that issue also.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="892"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that they communicate with the relevant Ministers to find out exactly why these Bills are not being processed in the Seanad.  We have the time, the opportunity and the expertise and the Bills will be dealt with well here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Of O<sub>2</sub>&rsquo;s 1.7 million customers, 70% have switched to on-line or paperless billing.  Vodafone has a similar number of customers and is now taking the same steps.  That is a reminder of how easy it is for companies to save money with the consent of their customers.  Sir Philip Green, when he identified the costs of running the United Kingdom at Government level, found that the amount of wasted paper was huge.  I draw attention to what each Senator received in his or her box today.  Not only did we receive the Order Paper which contains 18 pages of text, most of which has been repeated every day for a long time, but also we received it in an envelope.  It is sent to each one of us and I assume the corresponding Order Paper is sent to each of the D&aacute;il Deputies.  There seems to be no understanding in the House and perhaps in Government circles in general of a modern way of communicating.  We can all communicate in other ways.  There is no one who cannot use a laptop, a mobile phone or some other system.  We cannot afford to sit back and let somebody else do something about it.  Let us do it ourselves.  Apart from anything else, it would help the environment, lower costs and save us from having to carry things around.  I, therefore, urge the Leader to draw attention to the opportunity to make savings and the benefits that might result from this.  Let us make sure we no longer ignore opportunities to engage in paperless communication, methods we are all capable of using.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the positive news on the front page of one of the national newspapers today about the economy turning the corner.  It is important that we talk up what is happening because the world&rsquo;s media are watching to see how confident we are about ourselves.  We must not talk ourselves into deeper problems.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise in road safety week the issue of visibility on the roads.  We should have had a debate on road safety this week; perhaps it might still be possible to have one.  The evenings are becoming shorter and many are out walking, running and cycling, but few wear reflective vests and few pedal bikes have lights.  This poses a danger to those involved.  In addition, we see cars, the lights on which are not working, or perhaps are not clean.  Whether in urban or rural areas, people are getting the message and participating in exercise &mdash; on that subject, I wish myself and the Oireachtas team well in the Dublin Marathon which will take place in the next couple of weeks &mdash; and are out and about on the roads, but many do not seem to be aware of their own safety or the fact that drivers often do not have enough knowledge of or respect for other road users.  A debate on road safety, therefore, is important.  I have mentioned before that traffic islands on roads into many towns are lit high up or sometimes not at all.  A simple reflective band around the cement base would be a major step forward in ensuring road safety.  There are many such issues.  I come from an area in which there have been many tragedies on the roads.  It is important, therefore, that we keep this issue to the fore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the serious problems in Cavan General Hospital.  Medical outpatient services were suspended last Friday, while surgical elective admissions were deferred on Saturday and Sunday.  All elective cases scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, today and the rest of the week, as well as medical clinics, have been deferred.  Effectively, one could say there is no functioning hospital in Cavan as of today, although the region it serves is large.  The assessment and rehabilitation unit is closed, except for the assessment of inpatients ready for discharge.  Things are very serious.  I ask the Leader to state he will convey my concerns to the Minister for Health and Children as a matter of urgency.  I also ask him to request the Minister or a Minister of State to make a statement to the House because we need to respond to people&rsquo;s <Col N="893"/>needs.  There is major fear and patients are not undergoing the surgery planned.  It is dreadful, the result of an administrative bungle, and cannot be allowed to continue.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to make an unequivocal and non-partisan statement in this regard.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It should be celebrated in this country and heralded internationally that we have a consensus to the degree that we have an agreement between all the parties on limiting the deficit to 3% by 2014.  Fine Gael has been distinctive in putting forward issues such as fairness, waste, cutting at the top first, and maintaining essential front line services like Cavan General Hospital.  Democratic debate in the country needs that.  Are we turn opposition out to the streets?  The fact that we have consensus on the essential deficit figures is the essential consensus.  That should be heralded internationally and the Government should admit this publicly for the sake of the country.</P>

	<P>I endorse the comments of Senator Boyle and Senator Keaveney on the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy.  I refer Senator Bacik to the editorials of <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning, neither of which has been very disposed towards the Government over the years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have often raised the issue of the gas terminal at Ballylongford on the mouth of the Shannon in north Kerry.  This project will create 500 jobs per year for four years.  It has gone through the planning process.  That was an interminably slow process, which made a complete mockery of the so-called fast track process.  We are now being held up again over relatively minor quibbles, and I am very frustrated at how this is being managed.  We are crying out for jobs and a new gas terminal and power station three miles away in Tarbert will create a further 500 jobs.  The Minister is quite concerned about it at this stage, but I have not seen a hands on approach by the Government to bring this project across the line.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to brief us on this important project.  It is not a parochial issue.  It will ensure energy security for the entire mid-west region for our lifetime.  It is clean and safe.  It is not renewable, but perhaps our Green Party colleagues have put too much focus on renewables.  This is important.  It represents jobs and the future.  I ask the Leader to make a serious effort to get the Minister to come in here and answer questions about this important project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The forthcoming budget and the thought of more cuts is certainly focusing people&rsquo;s minds.  How will the Government help people to keep their homes if it continues to cut away at their ability to repay?  We can say there should be 20% more cuts in the public service.  We know that 200,000 jobs have been lost in the private sector since this recession took hold.  What real solutions will the Government put forward while we sort out the public finances to help ordinary people keep their heads above water?  Real solutions involve them keeping their homes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Leader should ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come before the House<?oasys _jy ?>for two reasons.  What initiatives will she put in place to encourage an entrepreneurial spirit among our second level kids?  The over emphasis on exams at second level means that an important piece of creativity is being lost.  Entrepreneurship is the key to our recovery.  Senator <Col N="894"/>Leyden pointed out that the number of VECs will be cut in half.  How will that pan out in practice?  Will programmes will be cut?  Who will lose as a result?  VECs have been there for the weakest in society.  The Minister needs to come in here to address those issues as quickly as possible.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is no sign that the Opposition understands just how critical is the current situation.  There is a huge gulf on consensus on that issue.  This is an absolutely critical situation.  Our public deficit is running at &euro;19 billion per annum and this has to be borrowed.  This means the markets have to place some faith in this country in order that we fill that enormous gap.  This requires us to believe in ourselves.</P>

        <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its discovery of ready to use bomb making material at Togher woods yesterday.  It was very significant.  I wish the Garda well in its continued work to stifle this threat.  There are people in our towns who are using the current economic crisis as a cynical recruitment tool to draw young people back into ways we thought we had left behind.  I saw this with my classmates and I have seen it since.  People were led down the path to the supposed glory of an illegal army.  It is horrendous on families and on individuals, and I think we need to maintain our vigilance and our efforts in this regard.</P>

	<P>As we speak, a cylinder is ascending through solid rock carrying the seventh or eighth of the Chilean miners, and I know that all of us who have followed Chile and its struggle to establish over the last 30 years will salute the epic achievement of the Chilean people, and the Chilean and other engineers who have achieved this.  I do not think I have to labour the point about co-operation.</P>
        <P>I would like to clarify what I mean by consensus and the public sector.  I understand why Senator O&rsquo;Toole would be protective of front line public sector workers like teachers, firemen and so on, as Senator Buttimer was yesterday.  I have included myself in that list by mentioning librarians, and have been mocked for it.  When I say that I believe in consensus, it is not that I <Col N="895"/>start with some sort of obsession about consensus, but because I know there is a problem in getting political cover for the kind of reforms needed in the largest single area in which we can achieve those reforms.  That area is the public sector as a generality.  I am talking about the great mass of the HSE, the great mass of waste, the huge salaries paid out to semi-state employees in the ESB, the huge salaries paid out to politicians and that vast gudge of stuff in the public sector.  To achieve savings in this area, we need political cover.</P>
        <P>There is no way to reform the public sector in that broad sense except by parties getting together to give each other political cover.  That is the be all and the end all of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been much discussion about achieving consensus.  There was a need over the last two years for much greater cohesion in the political system to tackle the situation in which we find ourselves.  Nobody really believes that any area of expenditure will not be put under the microscope if we are to extricate ourselves from our fiscal difficulties.  The forthcoming budget will be essential for the future economic life of this country.  It will obviously impact on all sectors.  The public sector has to be examined in the same way as every other sector.  I am glad we will have a debate this morning on the Croke Park agreement.</P>
        <P>The challenge for the political system is to come together and display to the public that it can put party political interest second to the national interest.  That message is far from clear at the moment with some voices in all parties that are beacons in expressing it, but it is far from comprehensive as it needs to be.  It will take courage, but if we do not do it we will be betraying those who have gone before us and will be imposing on those to come after us a legacy of which we will not be proud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for an immediate and urgent debate on the tourism sector, a sector in which he has much experience.  The sector is dying on its feet following a &euro;1 billion drop in revenue since 2007.  There has been a catastrophic drop in the number of people coming from Britain, which has reduced by 30% since 2008.  There are now 75,000 fewer seats each week on planes coming into this country than there were two years ago.  This disaster cannot be totally attributed to the global downturn because even though our visitor numbers fell by 12% last year, Britain with a similar climate managed to increase its visitor numbers by 4.6%.  The only response from the Government has been a heart-sinking knee-jerk reaction of committees and taskforces.  When it set up a tourism renewal group, it chose to ignore that group&rsquo;s advice to remove the travel tax immediately.  We now have the renewal implementation group which was set up to implement the recommendations of the tourism renewal group.  Meanwhile numbers are dropping on a daily basis.  We need some innovative thinking and a new approach.  The first thing we need to do is to call Michael O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s and Christoph Mueller&rsquo;s bluff.  As they claim the air travel tax is an impediment to growth in the tourism sector, let us scrap the tax for two years and challenge them to produce the numbers they claim they can bring to this country on their planes every year.</P>
        <P>We should kick off the 2011 tourism season with an innovative approach.  The budget for tourism promotion each year is &euro;155 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We should take &euro;10 million of that and have an auction across all the airlines serving this country and buy 100,000 free seats into Ireland to kick off next year&rsquo;s tourism campaign.  On average each tourist to this country spends approximately &euro;600 here and we would reclaim that money in VAT alone.  We need to offer a genuine c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to all our neighbours in the EU indicating that Ireland is open for business at the beginning of the next season.  We need to be the land of 100,000 welcomes &mdash; a reputation we have always had and which should stand in the future.</P>

We recently had positive ageing week.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole was correct in what he said this morning in that when somebody proposes something different, new and visionary, 99% of people say it cannot be done.  People should have a choice over their retirement age and if they do not want to retire at 65, they should not need to do it.  I do not want that to be confused with people being forced to work until 67 or 68 because of the pension crisis.  I am talking about the human rights of a person to stay on in a job if they so wish.

	<P Just="Left">I want an urgent debate on positive ageing.  It is very detrimental to force people to retire at 65 and it should be a choice.  Forcing people to retire at 65 suggests they are beyond it or can no longer contribute to society.  <i>The New York Times</i> reports on the health retirement study, which is a survey of more than 22,000 Americans aged more than 50 <Col N="897"/>years every two years.

It is entrepreneurs who have new ideas and take action who will get this country back on its feet.  I put myself in that category, having been an entrepreneur in my previous life.  <i>The New York Times</i> article states that doing crosswords, Sudoku, etc. simply allows people to become good at crosswords and Sudoku, but does not improve cognitive skills.  The best way to retain cognitive ability is to remain in work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Harris and others who spoke about how wonderfully exciting and heartening it was to listen to the radio broadcasts about the Chilean miners.  They were in a very dark place, but their community with courage, determination and ingenuity got them out of it, which is a lesson for us.  We are in a dark place and can certainly get out of it.  I was astonished to hear Senator Boyle suggest that those of us on this side of the House never criticise the ratings agencies and even gloat when they come out with bad news for us.  I have consistently and scathingly attacked the ratings agencies from this side.  Senator Dearey said we did not understand the depth of the recession.  Everybody on this side, including myself, has a pile of e-mails and letters from people who are terribly agonised.  We need to reply to them immediately because some of them state they are on the point of taking their own lives.  None of us underestimates the scope of the crisis we are in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask for a debate on the siting of the new children&rsquo;s hospital at the Mater hospital.  At the beginning of the process I made a request, which had been passed on to me from consultants, that there should be an international peer review, which would have taken only a week; that should have been done.  There were many suggestions about the politicisation of the decision given that it was in the constituency of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  While I do not know about the rights and wrongs of that, we should have looked at it.  The site is in my area and it is in my interest to have it there, but I believe it is the wrong place because the site is not appropriate.  I heard a distinguished doctor mention that they will now need to expand with great ingenuity what is there even though it looks pretty on the drawing board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is it realistic in this climate to expect funding of &euro;110 million from philanthropy?  Yesterday when I asked somebody, who is involved, what this philanthropy was, I was told that most of it would come from national lottery funds, which is not philanthropy.  There is a significant funding gap and I believe the taxpayer will be landed with the bill.  I believe the site is inappropriate for access reasons.

        <P>Department of Justice and Law Reform figures indicate that more than 400 convicted criminals are at large at present.  They include persons convicted of attempted murder, sexual assault and weapons charges.  According to the figures from the Department, 161 were convicted of theft, 50 of attempted murder, assault and harassment, 32 of organised crime offences and 31 of weapons and explosives charges.  These are dreadful figures.  The Minister&rsquo;s prison system is dysfunctional when one looks at the number of convicted criminals at large.

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Cannon in asking the Leader, yet again, to seriously consider arranging a debate on tourism, a matter raised prior to the summer recess.  While I understand the difficulty of finding time for such a debate, as I have repeatedly said in the House, tourism is our second most important indigenous industry.  It is as important as discussing the Croke Park agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;perhaps even more so because it impacts on every town and village.  However, I take Senator Cannon to task to some degree in that we now have an innovative and creative Minister in that portfolio, as evidenced by the numbers putting together plans to encourage more people to visit the country  While I appreciate what the Senator said about the figures for the numbers who come here from England, the reality is that we are suffering from an economic downturn internationally, as a result of which people are not travelling to the same extent.  </P>
        <P>I share the Senator&rsquo;s views on Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary.  As I have often said in the House, I have tremendous admiration for Mr. O&rsquo;Leary and Ryanair for what they have done, which we should not forget.  However, the reality is that he has now taken it upon himself to continually attack the Government on the issue of the airport tax, as has Aer Lingus to a lesser degree.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s view that Mr. O&rsquo;Leary should either put up or shut up, as he has stated publicly he would bring over 600,000 people into the country over a number of years if the travel tax was abolished.  I do not believe this is about the travel tax and agree with what the Senator said.  The Government and the civil servants in the Department, while they might be losing &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million in these troubled times, should think about the potential financial gain to the Exchequer and the wider community.  I ask the Leader of the House to give serious consideration to arranging a debate in Private Members&rsquo; time in the immediate <Col N="899"/>future to allow the Minister to give us an insight into her plans.  I do not want to reveal too much, but there are wonderful plans to bring more people into the country in the next 12 to 18 months.  I would be grateful if the Leader considered my request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, strongly support Senator Cannon in his call for a debate on tourism, an issue on which Senator Mooney expanded further.  Jobs initiatives are vitally important.  We are aware of the scope for such initiatives in the tourism sector if it was properly harnessed, but, sadly, this year &mdash; I do not understand the reason for this &mdash; over 6,000 non-EU workers received work permits to work here.  I do not understand the criteria used when one considers we have over 450,000 people unemployed.  There is something wrong in that respect.  We are shooting ourselves in the foot and the matter must be addressed, perhaps in conjunction with a debate on tourism.  As Members are aware, many of the workers concerned are working in the hospitality sector in hotels and so on.  With no disrespect to any of them, they have received no training and have no skills.  They do not represent the Irish hospitality brand.  They are lost in the circumstances in which they find themselves.  I have heard complaints from many Members from the country who stay in Dublin hotels. The Government must do something about the issue.</P>
        <P>I wonder if we are getting carried away on the call for consensus.  Everyone wants to be positive.  We all want to wear the green jersey and do what is best for the economy.  We are not stupid.  It is part of our business in this House to go about that work properly, but I am concerned because, while Members opposite have a slight problem which I hope they can surmount, there is a suspicion that the Government is not at one.  It must come to the table with clean hands.  I, therefore, ask Members opposite to clean up their act.  We will then proceed in a positive way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the retail sector as part of the ongoing debate on the budget.  Those commentators who are talking down the economy are doing it harm.  The sooner we receive a direction on budgetary strategy, the better for the retail sector which is a major employer in the economy.  As part of that process I suggest we examine DIRT on savings which should be payable at the top marginal rate.  Anyone dependent on a fixed income would be able to claim back, but the purpose would be similar to that in Japan where a zero interest rate is offered to provide an incentive in this regard.  We have a problem here, about which we hear consistently, that too much is being saved.  If that is the case, we must incentivise people and the best way to do so would be to increase DIRT on savings which should be payable at the top marginal rate.</P>
        <P>I support my colleagues who spoke about Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s which has finally cottoned on to the fact that this is the third most open economy in the world.  If the world economy was to pick up by even 1% or 2%, we in this country would benefit significantly in terms of increased employment and exports.  Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s has seen the light, but, unfortunately, there was a comment made during the week by Fitch which was unacceptable, that the Irish banks were not putting a sufficient number out of their homes.  That would be bad business and I spent a long time working in that business.  It would be uneconomic in terms of auctioneering and security costs and legal fees, not to mention the hardship it would impose in terms of the medical costs people run up in such a crisis.  It would be bad business to put people out of their homes and for rating agencies to tell us that they want to see more pain being endured is unacceptable.  I agree with my Opposition colleague, Senator Norris, who came down strongly <Col N="900"/>against the rating agencies which got it totally wrong when sub-prime lending was rated as triple A when it was nothing more than junk.</P>

        <P>I was a little disappointed because when I heard Senator O&rsquo;Toole say there would be a debate on CIE, I thought he was being serious; I should have known better.  As far as I am <Col N="901"/>aware, there will not be such a debate.  There is a cover-up going on within these Houses in regard to the investigation taking place in CIE.  The Joint Committee on Transport has been frustrated, CIE has been protected by the Government on several occasions and the investigation has been frustrated by the absolute refusal, supported by the Government, of the non-executive directors to come to give evidence about what happens in corporate governance at CIE.</P>
        <P>Last week, a much more serious development arose with a key witness not being allowed to give evidence in public.  Why is this?  A vote was called at the Joint Committee on Transport to allow him to come in.  It was frustrated initially under the guise of there being a court case but that court case is completed.  The Green member, Deputy Trevor Sargent, to his credit, withdrew &mdash; he disappeared.  Fianna F&aacute;il voted down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il voted down a request that a key witness should come to an inquiry into CIE when people on the other side had already been heard in public.  What is going on?  Now, we are not being allowed a debate on the same semi-State organisation.  Something very murky is going on here.  I want the Leader to respond, not by saying we can discuss it under this, that and the other but with a specific debate that gets the Minister in to answer questions because another part of these Houses is being frustrated.</P>

	<P>In seeking a debate on consensus, I remind the Leader and Members opposite that for the past 13 years we had no consensus when there was money to be doled out, jobs to be awarded and benchmarking to be negotiated.  Why now, when there is a majority Government, does the Government want consensus given it has made a complete hames of the country?  That point needs to be addressed.  If the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is so serious about consensus, why did he do this in the way he did?  Surely he should have said to the party leaders &ldquo;Here is the time of the meeting, let us get there and talk.&rdquo;  He did not even talk to the Taoiseach, his so-called partner in crime &mdash; his consensus colleague.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator Harris&rsquo;s clarification this morning regarding the public sector.  We agree there must be reform of the public sector.  Fine Gael has always said that and I believe it personally.  However, we must go after the fat cats, not the small guy or the ordinary worker who is working hard but the guys who are creaming it.  I have no problem with that.</P>
        <P>If the Members opposite want consensus, the Fine Gael Party has said quite clearly that it agrees with the 3% target and the four-year fiscal plan, and that there must be austerity and reform of the public sector.  That is consensus.  We have given leadership, although the other side of the Chamber and the members of Government, who are getting paid far too much, are bereft of such leadership.  Perhaps we can have that debate and then we can have consensus.  Let us not have a phoney war with the Greens and Fianna F&aacute;il, who are trying to save their political hides.  The reality is the Irish people do not care what we say in here; what they want is action.  As Senator Healy Eames said, they want their homes protected and jobs created. <Col N="902"/> That is our task, not having phoney wars about consensus when the Government has made a mess of the country.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik, Boyle, Twomey, O&rsquo;Reilly, Healy Eames, Dearey, Harris, Walsh, Coghlan and Buttimer raised the issue of consensus.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Fitzgerald in regard to the massive contribution carers have made and continue to make.  Some &euro;2.5 billion is a huge amount.  The support for communities, as Senator Fitzgerald said, must be centre stage.  I often find that during a downturn in the economy, voluntarism and support for the community is much stronger than when the economy is buoyant.  We fully support the sentiments expressed this morning by Senator Fitzgerald in this regard.</P>
        <P>On the economy, we have statements on the Croke Park agreement immediately following the Order of Business today, and there will be statements again in four weeks and again before the Christmas recess.  We want to ensure the support of the Upper House of the Oireachtas for the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, and his Department in light of the special responsibility given to him by the Taoiseach.  We want accountability and we want to see that everyone who has given an undertaking in the Croke Park agreement is doing what they said they would do.</P>
        <P>I take Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point in regard to the Greens and Fianna F&aacute;il being in unity but what about Labour and Fine Gael?  I know Fine Gael&rsquo;s bona fides but I hear nothing in regard to consensus from the Labour Party.  I say that in good faith and I look forward to hearing it clarified tomorrow on the Order of Business by Senator Alex White.</P>

	<P>Senator Fitzgerald called for debate on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I gave a commitment on this yesterday and I have no difficulty with it taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to social partnership and its leaders.  I was in the Houses at the time social partnership was born and I always gave the credit to the late Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, and Mr. Michael Mullen, who were the pioneers of that partnership.  They were courageous and far-seeing, and laid the foundation stone, as we have all said, for the Celtic tiger part 1 and part 2.  I wish everyone well in this regard.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, 1.8 million people go to work every day, which is the big difference from the last recession 30 years ago in that almost 800,000 more people are working today than at that time.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Leyden and Healy Eames called for a debate on education, with Senator Bacik focusing on third level education.  Senator Leyden and Healy Eames called for a debate in regard to the VECs and the proposed reduction from 33 to 16.  The Minister will have a broad consultation with both Houses in this regard.  I have no difficulty in allowing a long time for colleagues to make their points with the Minister present.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle, Keaveney, O&rsquo;Sullivan and Hanafin raised the issue of the rating agencies and the recent comments of Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s on Ireland returning to growth and how it is perceived from outside as a nation.  There is a serious responsibility both on Deputies and Senators and on the media to tell the story as it really is, and not to overstate it, particularly when it is overstated in a negative way.  In saying that, I am not referring to Oireachtas colleagues.</P><Col N="903"/>
        <P>Senator Twomey referred to the success story that is Google which, as we know, has its headquarters in Ireland and makes a massive contribution to the Exchequer.  I understand the concern relates to a language skill problem in Ireland, rather than anything else.  It is an issue we must address urgently in the context of developing employment in the future.  In regard to second and third languages being taught in our schools, I understand we have one of the lowest levels in Europe at present.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn noted the possible savings in regard to the use of paper and the amount this costs the Exchequer.  I will pass on his views following the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney raised the issue of road safety.  I fully agree with her point, particularly as the autumn evenings close in.  I wish her and her Oireachtas colleagues well in their participation in the Dublin marathon.  They are to be wholeheartedly congratulated as they are courageous people who are making a huge commitment.  We want to support them in all their fund-raising activities in this regard.  If a further debate on road safety is needed, we will have no problem with it taking place.  As I said, the decisions taken by the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, which I chaired when I was a Deputy, have contributed to the huge reduction in deaths and the number being maimed for life on our roads that has taken place in recent years, as well as to the reductions on the insurance side.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly expressed his serious concerns about Cavan General Hospital.  The HSE has said that the curtailments in services are necessary to allow the hospital return to what it described as a safe level of activity.  It said that the cancellation of non-emergency services will continue until the end of this week.  The number of patients presenting at the hospital&rsquo;s emergency department or needing treatment in the medical units has risen by a whopping 50% in the past week, putting the hospital and staff under huge strain.  As a result, the HSE put in place a range of measures to reduce activity.  It is hoped this will be addressed by the end of this week.  An increase of 50% in the demand for services speaks for itself.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan raised the issue of the gas terminal in Ballylongford, County Kerry, and the delay in the creation of up to 500 jobs.  I will create a precedent in this House by allowing this issue to be discussed for one hour after the Order of Business tomorrow.  I will seek the co-operation of the leaders of the groups in the House to arrange this.  If someone or something is delaying the creation of 500 jobs, this House should lead on the issue.  I will endeavour to have this debate take place for one hour after the Order of Business tomorrow to find out who is responsible and establish the up-to-date position in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Deary and Senator Cummins congratulated the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the arms find in Togher woods in County Louth.  I wish to be associated with their remarks on the good work and vigilance of the Garda.  Senator Deary pointed out the hardship being endured by families that are being plagued by the continuation of this type of activity.  The Garda is to be commended.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik, Senator Harris and Senator Norris congratulated the President of Chile, the minister with responsibility for mining, the engineering staff and everyone associated with the happy return of the miners.  It was compulsive television viewing and I congratulate Sky television on the massive coverage it is giving the operation.  It is an uplifting experience.  I stayed up late last night and was up early this morning to watch the coverage.  It is an event we will never forget.  What has taken place is an incredible achievement of engineering skills.  The main thing that impressed me through all the broadcasts and in the words of the first miners to be brought up from the mining shaft after their 70-day ordeal was their great and strong faith.  They believed in their faith.  It is a shining example of how people who have a strong faith really believe in the art of the possible.  It is wonderful to see the achievements that have taken place.</P><Col N="904"/>
        <P>Senator Cannon, Senator Mooney and Senator Coghlan called for a debate on tourism.  I have agreed to hold such a debate and it will take place in the next two to three weeks.  They referred to proposals regarding the removal of tax, the provision of incentives and the challenge laid down by Michael O&rsquo;Leary to the Government.  We welcome those who can do anything to create employment and bring money into the economy.  I have often congratulated Michael O&rsquo;Leary on his achievements.  He is one of the greatest Irishmen of all time, and what he has done for tourism has transformed Ireland as a tourist destination.  Dublin is now the lowest cost city to fly into and in which to stay.  It has a huge amount to offer.  The new conference centre, the new stadium which has accommodated crowds of 50,000 for concerts and international soccer matches, and the new theatre have all opened the past 12 months.  Major infrastructural investment is taking place in the capital city and throughout the country.  Nothing should stop it.  Senator Cannon put forward some innovative ideas while Senator Mooney referred to the planning for his constituency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another innovative idea is having our own television channel on Sky and broadcasting it across Europe.  When the television programme &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; was first broadcast, tourism to Dallas the following year increased fourfold while when &ldquo;Hawaii Five-O&rdquo; was broadcast, tourism to Hawaii increased by 11 times.  There is huge potential for our tourism industry, which is one of the three fundamental planks for our return to growth.  The industry is also a major employer; the hotels of Ireland employ almost 300,000 people.  I have no difficulty in responding favourably to the Senators&rsquo; request for a special debate on the issue.  Our new dynamic Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, can update the House on the plans for the coming two years.  As the Senators said, this industry needs support and assistance, and Members of the House certainly will not be found wanting in terms of having debates when they are necessary.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White spoke about choice in retirement age, positive ageing and keeping the brain active.  That certainly will enhance the quality of life for people who have reached that age.  As I have said previously, I fully support the Senator&rsquo;s great work in this area and I have no difficulty with doing what we can to help and assist her, be it by holding another debate or whatever else is necessary.</P>

        <P>Senator Cummins raised the issue of the 400 prisoners who did not return to prison and are at large.  He called for a debate on prisons.  I will allocate time for this to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin asked for a debate on the retail trade.  The retail sector is on its knees at present.  It, too, employs huge numbers of people.  Perhaps it can be raised in the debate on the Croke Park agreement later today or we can hold a special debate on it, if necessary.</P>
        <P>I accept the points Senator Ross made about the Croke Park agreement and his call for a debate on CIE.  There is no difficulty with having a debate on CIE.

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members of the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to update the House on the progress of implementation of the public service agreement known as the Croke Park agreement.  I last spoke to Senators on this topic on 13 May.  I will begin by reviewing what has happened since then and set out some of the challenges that continue to face us in that context.</P>
        <P>Last May, we were in a very different space in terms of debate on the agreement.  Many unions were still conducting their ballots and it was uncertain whether union members would accept the agreement.  There were arguments about whether that was the right approach for the civil and public service.  At the time I said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The making of this agreement between the public service committee of ICTU and the Government is a key step in addressing the immediate fiscal and economic challenges facing the country.  A vote in its favour would show our European partners, and those watching around the world, that we are facing our problems and setting about putting our house in order.</P>
        <P FLI="0">At that time I asked public servants to decide on the agreement on its own merits.  A majority of public service union members have responded and heard the calls from their representatives and from the Government.  Public servants are practical people.  Of course they were concerned and angered at the impact of the decisions already taken by the Government in 2009, including the application of the moratorium and incentivised exit mechanisms, the pension levy and finally, the pay reduction implemented through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  However, they understood that the Croke Park agreement acknowledges the sacrifices they have made and seeks to give a measure of security to public servants over the lifetime of the agreement.  They focused on the commitments given by the Government which were, no further pay cuts, no compulsory redundancies where there is flexible redeployment, the commitments on pension rates for those retiring and the commitment to review pay in light of savings made in spring 2011 and annually thereafter.  They understood that the alternative put forward by some of continuing and escalating their industrial action was not a realistic long-term plan.  They knew that the agenda for change agreed in the Croke Park agreement was something they could live with and which they would<?oasys _jy ?>welcome in many cases.  They understood that adoption of the agreement would itself give a measure of certainty about policy and spending that would assist in the process of economic recovery.</P>
        <P>Although that was only a few months ago, the memories of some people are short.  Having called for an urgent agreement to stop the escalating industrial action, some are now calling for the Government to walk away from the commitments made in the agreement.  They are calling for this, despite the sacrifices already made by public servants and despite the consequences in terms of the delivery of major change in the public service and for industrial peace.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Finance, met the officers of the public service committee of ICTU last week.  He emphasised the gravity of the budgetary position and the consequent importance of the Croke Park agreement in delivering measurable savings.  He also took the opportunity to reaffirm that the Government intends to comply with the terms of the Croke Park agreement, given the benefit to be gained from delivery of the signifi<Col N="906"/>cant change that will be needed in the public service to accommodate the reduction in public service numbers, in a climate of industrial peace.  It is worth recalling that in the clarification of the agreement, issued in May of this year, the Government indicated that the provisions in paragraph 1.28 of the agreement, which stated that, &ldquo;the implementation of this Agreement is subject to no currently unforeseen budgetary deterioration&rdquo;, would be applied in a bona fide manner and that similar clauses had applied in previous agreements.  In the event that such a situation were to arise, the Government and unions would meet at central level to discuss the circumstances that had arisen and the implications for the agreement, prior to any decision being taken that would adversely affect the pay provisions of this agreement.  The unions have made it clear that, in the event of the Government invoking that provision, the unions will cease to be bound by the terms of the agreement.  The Taoiseach has made it clear that the Government wants to comply with the terms of the agreement, and I am happy to reaffirm this in the House today.  It may be worth noting that the fact this discussion is happening underlines to public servants how important those commitments were in the first place and how necessary it is to deliver on the promise and potential of the Croke Park agreement.</P>
        <P>I will now review the progress made on all sides to deliver on the promise of the agreement and to emphasise the need for greater commitment and urgency.  Once the agreement was ratified by the public services committee of ICTU, Mr. P.J. Fitzpatrick, who has a long track record of leading major change in the public service, was appointed as the independent chairperson of the implementation body.  That body has been given a role in driving forward the process of change and ensuring that any difficulties which may be encountered are resolved in a fair and speedy manner.  I met Mr. Fitzpatrick yesterday to be briefed on his work.  He has advised me that the body, which includes senior officials and trade union representatives, has been meeting regularly to address the issues raised as the agreement is implemented.  He confirmed to me the very high level of commitment from all sides, management and unions, to a delivery under the agreement and there is a clear understanding that there is a lot of work to be done by all to deliver on its potential.  As well as meeting with key stakeholders such as the heads of Departments and the public service trade unions, the LRC and the Labour Court, the body has been putting in place sectoral arrangements to drive forward the implementation of the sectoral plans in each area.  Chairpersons have now been appointed to the sectoral bodies in health and local government and I anticipate that those arrangements will be finalised in all sectors shortly.</P>
        <P>The Government has instructed senior management across the entire public service to accord the highest possible priority to implementing the agenda for change set out in the agreement and to working with the implementation body.  I reiterate that instruction.  It was disappointing that a large number of Departments missed the deadline for submission of the implementation plans but I am happy to say they have all now been submitted.  I emphasise to management that the transformation agenda is essential and central to their Departments and agencies.  Action plans have now been submitted by each Department to inform the implementation body on the significant changes proposed by public service management to achieve the reforms, efficiencies and savings in each sector.  The implementation body will begin its consideration of the sectoral plans next week.</P>
        <P>I will put these action plans into context.  I cannot pre-empt any decisions that will be taken by the Government over the coming weeks in the lead-up to budget 2011.  When the Government announces what measures it requires to restore our fiscal situation and reduce the cost of delivery of public services, these will impact upon public service managements&rsquo; plans for change to their areas.   Those impacts will then have to be reflected in the proposals they bring forward.  The implementation body, therefore, has indicated that this reporting will be a <Col N="907"/>dynamic process, with the plans being revised, added to and expanded over time, particularly having regard to decisions taken by the Government in the context of the budget.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the Croke Park agreement is not a cost-saving plan in itself.  Cost savings will come through decisions on changing services and work practices, with the introduction of new technology and a reduction in the number of public servants.  The Croke Park agreement provides the framework to manage those changes to work practices and service delivery, to boost productivity and improve efficiencies as the number of public servants reduces over time.</P>
        <P>We can expect to see changes to the public service over the next few years as the agreement is implemented.  The changes involved have already been set out in the Government&rsquo;s statement on transforming public services.  That requires a more integrated public service that is leaner, more effective and more focused on the needs of the citizen, thereby contributing to the process of returning Ireland to economic growth and prosperity.  In the context of reduced numbers and resources, the public service will have to be reorganised and public servants will need to show greater flexibility and mobility in working across traditional boundaries.  Overall, we need more joined-up government to respond to the needs of citizens as they live their lives and go about their business, particularly at such a challenging time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have already implemented the types of changes and efficiencies that will be rolled out across the public service in the coming months and years.  To give some specific examples, a national procurement service has been established and continues to leverage the public service&rsquo;s buying power by organising the procurement of common goods and services across the public service.  Last year, in addition to achieving better value for money, savings of &euro;27 million were achieved by public bodies with the support of the national procurement service.  Savings of approximately &euro;40 million are being targeted in 2010.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Yesterday&rsquo;s decision to reduce through merger the number of vocational education committees from 33 to 16 is also indicative of our agenda to transform the way in which public services are delivered.  As a result of this consolidation, our VEC sector will be stronger and better placed to provide support services to schools, not just those within the traditional VEC sector but to other schools in areas which wish to avail of them.  Work is under way on specific shared services proposals in the areas of human resources, pensions administration and payroll and financial management.  The aim is not just to make significant savings but also to bring about improvements in the delivery of services.  The Croke Park agreement will facilitate the completion of this work primarily through enabling flexible redeployment and easing the introduction of new technology.</P>
        <P>These are changes to the back office functions of the public service.  The Croke Park agreement will also enable new and existing services to be delivered in better ways to the public.  We can expect new technology to be introduced to allow the public to interact with the public services in a more timely fashion.  We can expect delivery of services over an extended working day and at the weekend.  We can expect reconfiguration of services so they are delivered closer to the individual who needs them, obviating the need to navigate through different public offices.  We can expect better performance comparisons and monitoring.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have already been made in performance measurement in the health system in recent years.  The Croke Park agreement notes this must be continued with renewed focus and effort.</P>
      
        <P>A useful example of this is HealthStat, a comparative tool in place in the HSE.  It provides detailed monthly results from 29 teaching, regional and general hospitals and 32 local health offices responsible for providing health and social care services in the community with the results published online at <i>www.hse.ie</i>.  Hospitals and local health offices get marks on three themes: access, integration and resources.  HealthStat measures whether people are receiving <Col N="908"/>outpatient or day care when they should be or where it is suitable, whether people are admitted on the day of their procedure, whether the length of stay for inpatients is as should be expected, and whether patients and their families are informed about their treatment and included in discharge planning.  By measuring performance on these matters, the quality of care being delivered to customers of the health service will improve.</P>
        <P>The redeployment of staff across the public service is vital to ensuring the improved delivery of services.  Some areas in the public service need improved staff resourcing while in other areas the needs are less pressing.  It is important to address these imbalances and redeployment will go some way to doing this.  There are already instances of successful redeployment we can point to.  However, we need to break down the unnecessary distinctions between different types of public servants, through legislation if necessary, and through the use of much more flexible redeployment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The changes being brought forward under the Croke Park agreement are part of a number of transformation initiatives being pursued by the Government.  These are the establishment of the new public service board, which I chair, with a majority of members from outside the public service.  Membership of the board will be announced shortly.  We plan to make senior appointments, including a chief information officer, to bring greater expertise to the leadership of change in the areas of e-Government and shared services; to reconstitute the top level appointments commission with more outside members; and the announcement shortly of the details of the new senior public service.  This initiative is being introduced in recognition by the Government that we need leadership at all levels of our organisations whether at the front line, at middle management or at senior levels.  The new senior public service will centrally manage and deploy top public servants.  This will promote greater mobility at senior levels in the public service and ensure the talent pool for filling leadership vacancies is broadened.</P>
        <P>Under the public service agreement, the position regarding public service pay will be reviewed in spring 2011.  The review will take account of sustainable savings generated from implementation of the agreement.  These savings will have to be independently verified by the implementation body.  The agreement states that in the event of sufficient savings being identified in the spring 2011 review, priority will be given to public servants with pay rates of &euro;35,000 or less in the review of pay.  Ultimately, therefore, it will be to the advantage of public servants that these significant changes and efficiencies are delivered because of the commitment to use savings, in an agreed manner, in the pay reviews.  I recently clarified that measures put in place before the agreement, including the restrictions on the filling of public service vacancies by recruitment or promotion and incentivised early retirement, have achieved savings not attributable to the agreement.  However, additional savings generated from efficiencies and other measures arising from the agreement, including those that facilitate further reductions in public service numbers by not filling future vacancies under the moratorium on recruitment, can be taken into account in the review in spring 2011.</P>
        <P>Much of the focus has been on the need for management to press forward with proposals for change but public servants and their representative unions also have a role.  We will encourage constructive and innovative ideas from all sides so we can maximise the ongoing contribution of the public service to addressing the challenges we face.  I invite public servants and their representatives to come forward with those ideas.  We all know the challenges we face.  It is time for us all to contribute to the plans that will allow us meet and overcome those challenges.</P>
        <P>The majority of public service unions or associations have either voted to accept the Croke Park agreement or decided that they can best represent the interests of their members by working with management on its implementation.  The members and leaders of trade unions <Col N="909"/>understand and accept the responsibility of all concerned to make this agreement work.  Their commitment to delivery under the agreement is very welcome.</P>
        <P>However, it will take more than just statements.  We need to see commitment in deeds as well as words.  Recently, there have been worrying suggestions in the media that it is business as usual in terms of trade unions.  That is not the reality &mdash; the unions have agreed to the transformation agenda by signing up to the agreement.  It is important that managers communicate to their staff about what this means in practice.  Management must move ahead and deliver the change that we all need.</P>
        <P>I want to consider the position of the unions that have chosen to stay outside the agreement and to maintain their opposition to its implementation.  The Government considers that any party that chooses to remain outside the provisions of the agreement or that opposes its implementation cannot expect to benefit from the commitments it gave as part of the agreement.</P>

	<P>The principal commitments given were to no reductions in pay, no compulsory redundancies and an extension of the period within which the January 2010 pay reductions will be disregarded for the purposes of calculating public service pension entitlements to the end of 2011.  I encourage members of unions or associations that have stayed outside the process to consider their position carefully.  Requests for renegotiation of parts of the agreement or the Government&rsquo;s agenda for transformation of the public services will not be entertained but progress can be made, and perhaps some reassurance given, where the practical application of the proposals is worked through between management and unions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The public service has a critical role to play during these difficult times in the process of national recovery and in providing services to our citizens.  It must display flexibility in being able to respond to rapidly changing demands and it must manage to do this with significantly fewer resources.  In the Croke Park agreement, we have a shared view between management and unions of the sorts of changes across the public service that will produce greater efficiency, better services for the public and more satisfactory working conditions for public servants.  The transformation agenda, together with the full implementation of the Croke Park agreement, will ensure that the public service is equipped to be capable of meeting the challenges of the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The debate is overdue because there has been much concern about the implementation of the Croke Park agreement.  There has not been much discussion about how the current budgetary, financial and fiscal situation will have an impact on what was agreed.  The Minister of State referred to the budget, saying it will have an impact on what was agreed in the Croke Park agreement.  That is inevitable.  This is the beginning of a discussion on the Croke Park agreement and the Minister of State will return to the House.  I will put some questions to which, on his return or later today, the Minister of State can respond.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The type of public sector reform we are talking about under the Croke Park agreement is not an optional extra.  It is integral to the future of our country.  It is integral to getting the budget right and delivering services for our citizens.  Budgetary and efficiency issues underlie the agreement.  Ireland has been very slow with public sector reform.  The debate has been dogged by the perception that it is an attack on public servants.  I worked in the front line as a social worker for many years.  I saw at first hand, as many other Members have seen, the key work done by those front-line staff in social welfare and education.  Delivering public services is a tough task.  Many people are leaving teaching and social work and retreating because of how tough it is.  In framing this debate, it is important that public sector reform is not seen as <Col N="910"/>an attack on front-line staff, as it has been seen in the past.  The debate has been dogged by that approach and we must shift from it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt we have a public sector and a public service in dire need of reform.  That is not a reflection on those who work in it but an historical fact.  We are slow to bring about change.  Other countries have dealt with this.  Sweden managed an 11% reduction in costs by taking its proactive, serious approach to public sector reform.  There will be major budgetary gains if we do this properly, without diminishing the service.</P>
        <P>We have a top heavy system that we must change if we are to deliver services properly.  I met a woman the other day who was trying to get a grant for a disabled child.  She was sending in her third lot of forms as the first two had been lost.  That happens to people all the time.  There are incredible delays and inefficiencies in basic services.  That may seem irrelevant to the Croke Park agreement but it is at the heart of it.  I welcome the fact that the Government and public sector unions got together and came up with the agreement but key questions arise in terms of the current state of play.</P>
        <P>I refer to <i>The Irish Times </i>today:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Last July, in a letter to trade union leaders and public service managers, PJ Fitzpatrick, chairman of the body charged with implementing the Croke Park agreement, argued that it was important to deliver &ldquo;quick wins&rdquo; in improved public services and verifiable savings, in order to boost confidence in the deal.  Although the agreement was negotiated early in the year, however, and ratified by the public service unions during the summer, the delay in securing any of the reforms set out has given ammunition to critics of the deal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is true.  In his speech the Minister of State has addressed to some degree the reason for the Departments being late in responding.  They were given a deadline.  Why did they not respond?  What was the reason for the delay?  The Minister of State hinted that some of the reforms might have been considered under any other business, AOB, or that they were sidelined to some extent, although he accepted they are central. I agree with him.  The reforms are absolutely central if we are to get the kind of changes envisaged in terms of better public services which are at the heart of the deal.  That is the reason we have the deal.  We must please the workers, ensure they are getting job satisfaction and are being paid adequately.  One could ask why public servants are employed.  They are there to give a service to the public.  That is the goal of the changes.  The agreement is about efficiency, effectiveness and providing a service.  We must sell the reform envisaged in the Croke Park deal as being about service to the community.  That is what it is about &mdash; service and efficiency.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supported the agreement.  We were eager to see an agreement in place that would protect the well-being of those working in public services to ensure the necessary and long-awaited reforms needed in the delivery of services.  That is critical.  That is what I have been speaking about.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has told the people to brace themselves for cutbacks in pensions and social welfare.  He has said that everything is on the table.  Nothing is sacred.  Nothing is secure.  My question is which parts of the Croke Park deal are on the table?  Is the pay deal on the table again, given that we have had a statement from the Minister to the effect that everything is on the table, nothing is sacred and nothing is secure?  Does the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, have a clear comment to make on the issue or do we need to read between the lines of his speech?  It is important for him to comment in so far as he can address the issue today.  We have a deteriorating economic situation and a budget strategy is needed to deal with that.</P><Col N="911"/>
        <P Just="Left">What is the Government&rsquo;s approach to the Croke Park deal right now?  Where exactly is the implementation plan for the agreement?  Why has progress been so slow in many areas and non-existent in others?  What has been going on?  For example, last week the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, said that if progress was not made on the implementation of the deal soon, it was likely to be scrapped.  For whom was he speaking?  Expressing such opinions in a newspaper column is no way to communicate with the thousands of people in the public sector.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree with me on that.  I have spoken about those working in front-line services.  Those updates should be given in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  That is why we are having the discussion today.  Those are key issues.  The message that type of article gives out is not helpful to the thousands working in the public sector.  I am not sure either that it is helpful to the implementation of the deal.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, has responsibility in this area.  Does he share the views of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan?  How conditional is the Croke Park agreement at the moment?  Is it conditional on progress being made?  Where precisely does progress stand at the moment?  As the Minister of State is aware, there is a get-out clause in the agreement.  Is the comment of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, a warning?  Is it a caveat for the get-out clause?  What would need to happen for the get-out clause to be used?  What level does the economic and budgetary situation have to reach before the get-out clause is used?  Is that something which is on the Government agenda at the moment?</P>
        <P>I refer the Minister of State to article 1.28 of the agreement.  It deals with the unforeseen budgetary deterioration.  That is the reality.  When one reads the agreement there is a lot of good detail but there is an awful lot of idealistic comment as well.  In the health section alone there is reference to getting more community care services into place and more front-line services.  I know and everyone in this House knows that care services at community level are deteriorating dramatically.  The agreement is aspirational in many ways.  That is why we need to begin to discuss &mdash; not today because this is a scene-setting kind of discussion to see where exactly things are at &mdash; the implementation of the agreement Department by Department to see what the reality is compared with the goals that should be reached, albeit that they are idealistic in many ways.</P>
        <P>Article 1.6 of the agreement provides for a review of public service pay next spring.  Could the Minister of State outline the mechanism by which that will take place?  For example, will the savings generated by reforms go back to staff in terms of pay, as was envisaged at one point and, if not, where is it envisaged the money will be used?</P>
        <P>I also wish to inquire of the Minister of State about the flexible redeployment of staff within the public sector as per article 1.7.  Last week the Minister for Finance said there had been little success in that regard.  Could the Minister of State provide the House with an update on the redeployment agenda, perhaps not today but on another occasion?  What has happened in that regard?  Redeployment is a critical part of the deal.</P>
        <P>The deal also refers to voluntary redundancies and incentivised retirement schemes.  We need an update on how much progress has been made on them.  Last month the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told the D&aacute;il there were still no proposals before Government in that regard.  It would seem to be unfair to place all the blame for lack of progress on the employees when the Government itself has been slow to develop proposals for measures agreed in the Croke Park deal.</P>
        <P>The agreement envisaged the production of plans on transforming the delivery of services from each public sector and Department.  Am I correct in saying that only one such action plan has come in or did the Minister of State say they are all in?</P>

	<P>They are all in now but there was a delay.  We have many questions on what has happened since the Croke Park deal was agreed.  Fine Gael is committed to public sector reform.  We believe serious budgetary savings can be made in order that citizens will get a better deal.  Public sector workers will be happier and will have more job satisfaction if we get some of the changes that are envisaged.  It should not be seen as an attack on the public sector but it appears that there is a great deal of work to be done if progress is to be made in any real way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  We have a special responsibility for ensuring the Croke Park agreement is a key part of future Government policy.  As the Taoiseach has said, it was a key agreement in addressing the immediate fiscal and economic challenges facing the Government.  The Government has stated it is committed to implementing the terms of the public service agreement with absolute good faith.  It is now moving ahead with the implementation in a timely and ambitious manner.</P>
        <P>The agreed agenda for change outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, across all sectors of the public service provides a framework for greater efficiency and delivery for citizens which can be secured while providing the basis for confidence about pay levels and security of employment in the public sector.  What we are all seeking is more for less.  As we have been told, that is the motto and agenda of the day.  Intrinsic to the agreement is the need to give an incentive for motivation to those who are working in the public service and also to give certainty to their employment, which is very important.  As we all know, a happy workforce will respond.  If incentives are given and the opportunities for such incentives exist in most cases, there will be a positive outcome.  The Minister of State holds one of the most important portfolios in government because of our current economic circumstances.  Those of us who have been here for some time remember the national understanding brought forward by Charles Haughey and Mr. Michael Mullen on behalf of the Government and trade unions which were on their knees at the time, but that agreement stood us well.  We no longer have strikes involving those in the public service or the private sector, an example to the multinationals of what we can achieve when we work together.  I congratulate all Governments, trade union members, employers, farming organisations and everyone else who had a part to play in the achievement of national understanding.  With the benefit of hindsight, I must ask if benchmarking was a good idea; perhaps it was not after the first tranche.  It is easy to be wise after the event, but we have a national agreement that has stood us well.</P>
        <P>With current global economic prospects, everyone must re-evaluate our work and the return on it, an underlying factor due the emerging economies in China and India.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I travelled to many countries with various Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  It was an eye-opener as a private sector employer and a Member of the Oireachtas.  The greatest challenge is to ensure competitiveness.  If we are not competitive when producing goods, we have no chance in the marketplace.  Many good Irish companies have moved up to 70% of their manufacturing arms abroad, which allows them to keep their brands in the USA, Europe and Asia, and have survived as a result.  If the private sector can do this while facing the serious challenges of the past few years, the public service can also meet the challenge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Croke Park agreement was an outstanding achievement by all those concerned.  It is amazing what decent people will do to the detriment of their own incomes in the national interest.  I do not know many who would not respond to the call to act in the national interest.  We are all proud of our country and what we have achieved in the past 50 years.  It is amazing <Col N="913"/>that 75% of those who finished primary school in 1959 did not go on to second level.  The boys and girls of today have great opportunities which they need because they must meet the challenges of the modern world.  The challenge facing the Minister of State, the Government and Oireachtas Members is to lead and give leadership to the people by showing good example.  That is what Senator Harris has explained on the Order of Business in recent days.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has said he will come back in November and, if possible, before Christmas to let the House know what progress he is making.  He will also make accountable those who must be accountable to him because the Oireachtas is watching to see what progress will be made in the national interest between now and Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and appreciate the work he has done in recent months in this area.  I also thank him for acknowledging the commitment of public servants.  Those who are not part of the Croke Park agreement cannot have pay protection, pension protection and job security.  The Taoiseach said something similar this morning and it is important trade union leaders who are not party to the deal explain this to their members.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with all of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, but it must be more specific.  We want to seek efficiencies, make savings and enhance the public service.  We all know the intellectual investment that has been made in the public service by those who work in it.  I want to see the people blossom and flourish as a reflection of that intellectual investment.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned savings.  He has said, however, that this is not a cost saving exercise, but cost saving must be one of the deal&rsquo;s objectives.  I would like to know how much the Minister of State intends to save and the number of jobs by which the public sector will be reduced.  We should be able to follow the progress made in these areas.  I do not believe the Minister of State will get the support he thinks he should receive in the places that should support him.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister of State to outline the timeframe and the review dates for the agreement.  When he comes back in one month, I will not be hopping up and down, accusing him of missing a date, but I will hop up and down if I cannot measure progress.  I could not stand up next month and do that after listening to him today, as the figures were missing and must be set out.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State reassure me that every Minister and Minister of State has seen, engaged with and fully understood the proposals for reform and transformation in his or her Department or section?  Any Minister who has not done that is not doing his or her job.  Will he further reassure me that every proposal from every Department will have timeframes and key performance indicators attached in order that we will know if we have made progress and what we need to examine, with review dates for each Department?  If these are not in place, we cannot know what is happening.</P>
        <P>The Government supports the agreement, but it must understand that it must become physically involved.  My objective in this regard is simple.  The public and civil services have the intellectual capacity to create a model for all of Europe of best practice in the delivery and running of public services.  I want this to be the objective and will not hold back from it.  From the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments, however, I am not convinced it will occur.  I do not have time to go into more detail now, so I will do so during the coming months.</P>
        <P>Every Senator rises to speak about quangos.  I would like a report from the Minister of State on those quangos.  It should tell us which of the 750 are paying for themselves, which are being paid for by us, which have not met their legislative responsibilities to do this, that or the other and which have not got their accounts or annual reports to the Oireachtas on time.  When I see that report, I will make my first judgment on whether they are efficient and fit for purpose.  We could separate out those that are not meeting their deadlines etc.  I could say more, but my <Col N="914"/>point is that I want measurable benchmarks for quangos instead of a large discussion on getting rid of them all.  To where will the services for which they are responsible be redistributed if they die?  Some quangos could become semi-State companies on their own.  How many of them are tied to the apron strings of their Departments and prevented from being autonomous and doing the jobs they were set up to do?  These are the benchmarks that could be considered by the implementation people.</P>
        <P>I could ask all sorts of questions about the Civil Service, but I am looking at the Minister of State&rsquo;s decent advisers behind him.  In 1981, the Department of Public Service was created and, as far as the world is concerned, shut down some years later when a Fianna F&aacute;il Government entered power.  No one except a few of us insiders knows that the Department still exists on Merrion Street inside the building housing the Department of Finance.  Do we need two Departments?  Is there a need for a Department for the public sector?  I know what the Minister of State&rsquo;s programmed answer is, but I pose this as a challenging question.  Why can the job not be done within an existing Department?  Why is the structure of an additional Department required at line level?  People over there will love my question, but at least it will give them something to discuss.</P>

	<P>I spoke with a senior person in education.  I come from the same background and will touch on it, as I do not want the Minister of State to believe I am keeping away from anything.  A new contract for teachers is to be negotiated, but there has been no meeting yet.  There was an agreement three or four months ago &mdash; the Minister of State should correct me if I am wrong &mdash; and a commitment of an extra hour&rsquo;s work for teachers was given.  There has been no movement in this regard.  The promoted structure within teaching should reflect a new contract involving a workable, transformative and efficient middle management scheme that brings more to education.</P>
        <P>I will conclude on local government.  I spoke with some students this morning.  Cheques for student grants are sent out from 40 places around our small country.  Students do not know what cheques are because they have never seen them.  That is our age.  Cheques issue three times per year to a college, a student proves to that college he is Joe O&rsquo;Toole, for example, another cheque is written and he takes it away and lodges it.  All of this should be done centrally.  We do not need 40 different places handling it or, for example, motor taxation.</P>
        <P>I could go on and on.  Many important actions need to be taken, but I want specificity, timelines, key performance indicators, KPIs, review dates and measurements, since those are real benchmarks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to have a young and dynamic Minister of State working on this matter.  As I have told the House, the political class has been long institutionalised by the public service.  As someone who formerly worked in an active body to protect the public service, my disillusionment set in at the time of Charles Haughey and the politicisation of the Civil Service.  The current public service is not fit for purpose and needs radical reform.</P>
        <P>I am concerned by the defensive tones of some aspects of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  It is not yet properly understood by the political class that the debate that started some years ago was not started by people fomenting trouble between the public and private sectors.  Alone in Europe, Ireland&rsquo;s differential between public and private sector pay is 20%.  It is wasting energy to believe that the productive private sector will put up with this situation indefinitely.</P><Col N="915"/>
        <P>Where the public sector is concerned, I am not referring to the people standing on the iceberg, namely, teachers, firemen and garda&iacute;, people whose work can be seen and measured.  I am referring to the low productivity levels hiding beneath the surface of the ice.  These need to be addressed by a Minister with a jaundiced view.  I am not happy with the general view held by all Ministers, if not particularly the Minister of State, that we are still in the world of social partnership.  We are not.  It is all over, finished.  From now on, there will be a rigid scrutiny of the public sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are not in the era of Whitaker.  We did not get the service from the pure Civil Service for the past 30 years that we deserved.  There is a bolshiness among civil servants.  Senators hear bad stories about Secretaries General not telling their Ministers what productivity measures they propose to introduce.  We hear stories about people who believe they run the Government.  We hear stories about people who believe if they hang around for a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, they will get a cushy number.  They would be mistaken, given the comments of Deputy Bruton or Sherlock or even Deputy Rabbitte, who spoke on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; recently concerning statutory redundancies.</P>
        <P>The part of the public sector that is not producing openly is living on borrowed time where public opinion is concerned.  Any Minister or Government that plays footsie with such people will be in big electoral trouble.  The next general election will be decided by the political party that most honestly commits to reform of the public sector.  Let us get this into our heads &mdash; there will be no more Pollyanna-type stuff.  Ministers will need to learn to stand up to their civil servants.  Politics must dominate.  The Oireachtas must dominate.  The Civil Service cannot continue as a permanent government.  We must revert to the time of Whitaker, who always knew his place was to advise Jack Lynch.  Lynch took or turned down that advice, but it was good advice.  I am not a bit sure about today&rsquo;s advice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the Minister of State&rsquo;s remark about political commentators, I take his point, in that the media like constant change.  Some of those banging on about the public sector now want an end to the Croke Park deal.  Make no mistake about it, though.  The Croke Park deal should not be regarded by the Minister of State or the Government as some type of nice shadow of social partnership.  That is all over.  The Croke Park deal exists because public sector unions found out the hard way that there was no public support for their industrial action.  They would have been crushed by the public.  Any party supporting them would have been crushed as well.  There is no support for public sector unions standing up to the people and justifying their position alone in the EU of being paid 20% more than their private sector counterparts, even taking the income and pension levies into account.  Like any group of people, they will fight for their privileges to the bitter end, but they cannot be allowed to do so at the expense of the people.</P>
        <P>The bankers are being dealt with.  Some are before the courts and the rest are in bits.  They do not have a bob or even a vote.  The public sector must reform itself or it will be reformed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>The division that has opened up between the public and private sectors is of concern, but understandable.  The deal contains a provision to focus savings on public servants earning less than &euro;35,000 per year, but many in the private sector would aspire to that figure.  As an employer and without breaching confidentiality too much, my staff would be happy to get &euro;35,000, but they do not.  They watched much of what occurred within the public sector.  In particular, some of the benchmarking agreements were arrived at with great resentment.  As someone who has worked to build a business and sustain employment in these difficult times, I share that experience of resentment.  The gulf needs to be healed, otherwise we will continue on parallel tracks not understanding one another.</P><Col N="916"/>
        <P>That the Croke Park agreement was voted on by the unions and supported by the majority is a recognition that the twin-track economy of the public and private sectors must come to a close and that the two sectors need to begin aligning.  I will explain what I mean.  The competitiveness of the productive private sector is highly dependent on the wages paid to those who work in the sector who, in turn, are seriously influenced by the agreements arrived at within the public sector.  I am firmly of the view that our competitiveness as a nation was corroded by benchmarking in the boom times.  We simply cannot afford it.  The &euro;19 billion deficit this year is proof positive of this, although there are many other contributory factors.  However, there is no question benchmarking played a significant part.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome much of what is contained in the Croke Park agreement, some of which I never thought would I see.  I hope the implementation body will do what it has to do to ensure every box is ticked in terms of the sectoral implementation plans.  I welcome that the Minister of State spoke of the need for the adoption of a dynamic approach to implementation.  That is needed because we are on shifting sands and it is difficult to know where we should plant our feet to find solid ground from one week to the next.  The country can find its way out of the radical difficulties which we face.  A cross-party approach would be most helpful in the framing of the four-year plan.</P>
        <P>We must take account of what the Croke Park agreement will deliver.  It was conceived in difficult times, albeit not as difficult as those we currently face.  It was conceived when some of the unpalatable but necessary choices about to be made were not on the horizon, when it seemed likely we could reverse the pay erosion that had occurred in the previous period.  I note Mr. Willie Slattery&rsquo;s comment on that proposal that we could not afford it, which is persuasive.</P>
        <P>Implementation is critical.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s demand for a very clear assessment and measurement is timely and appropriate.  He is right to highlight the need for this in the weeks and months ahead as we debate the Croke Park deal and its gradual evolution.</P>
        <P>Regarding the division between those involved in the public service and the productive private sector, the Croke Park deal has the added benefit of feeding competitiveness back into the private sector.  Wage restraint in the public sector leads to wage restraint among employees in the private sector and allows employers to focus on survival and making their businesses more competitive.  Recently I attended a trades council meeting in my home town and spoke on the issue of Northern contractors who mended the roads.  Senator Keaveney will be aware of this being a source of huge frustration for constituents who see it as jobs for people from the North of Ireland and wonder why we do not give the jobs to our own at a time of high unemployment.  I proffered the view that the day I saw our own repairing the roads would be the day I would know the economy had regained competitiveness.  Even on a small island with two separate economies, we are still some distance from achieving that outcome, on which we need to focus.  In so far as the Croke Park deal can contribute to this, it will lead to a recognition within the private sector that the public sector is taking full account of the reality in which we find ourselves.  The Croke Park deal will help to achieve the solidarity required between the public and private sectors if we are to work together and find consensus.  That is subject to its full  and dynamic implementation, taking account of changing circumstances and not becoming fossilised about the failure to meet a particular date or secure a certain signature or set of signatures from April or whenever the agreement was signed.  It is most important that we maintain a flexible approach.  That is not a mealy mouthed way of implying bad faith but simply a recognition of the need to stay grounded in reality, recognising that the benefits will be far reaching and unifying for the economy and the country as a whole.</P>

	<P>There has never been a time, good or bad, when there has not been a debate on the need for reform in the public service.  I do not make this point because I want to diminish the importance of this debate and achieving real reform in the public service.  However, it is interesting to note that it is a constant dynamic in public debate and discussion.  As we approach the budget, people are free to say what they wish, but I hope they will not contribute unwittingly to the re-emergence of a period of paralysis such as we had last year concerning the public and private sectors.  I refer not only to the Government side but to commentators, Members of this House and others, to questions put about what workers in the public sector were getting that workers in the private sector were not, and to all of the other arguments that led to the creation of a toxic atmosphere, especially during the debates which took place this time last year about what needed to be done.  </P>
        <P>I do not wish to diminish the necessity for reform in the public service because, as has been demonstrated, there is a clear need for such reform.  The OECD report in 2008 gave us a lot on which to chew regarding various steps that needed to be taken.  There were a number of positive points made in that report about the public service.  It pointed to the progress that had been made in areas that required reform, dating back to the 1990s, if I am not mistaken.  One of its highlighted conclusions  &mdash; I speak from memory &mdash; was that while many of the reforms were internal and process-led, there was a need to look outwards to allow a much more citizen or customer focused approach, with which I absolutely agree.  No one could disagree with this, as it is essential.  It might mean there would be fewer public servants; it will certainly require more flexibility and transferability across services.  It might require or call for fewer agencies in order that core services might be reintegrated and provided from within the public service.  There are proposed changes that would impact on individual members of the service.  That is the case and it would be wrong for anyone in this House or anywhere else to think public servants are not aware change is needed and coming.</P>
        <P>At the end of his contribution I heard Senator Dearey&rsquo;s speak about solidarity between the public and private sectors.  In going about their daily work in their constituencies and attending meetings politicians meet many from both sectors.  The most discerning &mdash; I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; because that implies one is looking down on others &mdash; and thoughtful people in the public and private sectors can see the value of and necessity for both sectors.  One talks to private sector employers who require services such as public transport, child care and health services for their workers as part of any modern economy.  They recognise the importance of having a vibrant and proper public service.  Equally, workers in the public service will say, &ldquo;We know we are nothing without the private sector.  We cannot self-fund.  Without a dynamic economy and private sector there would be no money to fund the public service.&rdquo;   These points sound basic and are almost truisms, but sometimes we must remind ourselves.  People understand the story and know change is necessary.</P>
        <P>There is a problem.  I refer to what the Minister of State said.  I realise we are having this debate in an atmosphere where people are committed to progressing the issue rather than looking backwards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the advantages of the Croke Park agreement is that we move a step forward from those speeches on the need for reform, and all the stuff about the &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo;.  People say they have no problem with those in the front line, the nurses, garda&iacute;, prison officers etc. that are needed.  However, it is that other block of people that are invoked in their thousands as wasters or for low productivity which is the problem.  I should like to see somewhat more specificity in this.  Who are these people and where are they?  How come Governments of all hues have not been able to find them in 20 or 25 years?  What are they all doing and where have those people on their big salaries who do nothing been hiding?</P><Col N="918"/>
        <P>I believe the Minister of State will agree that it is not as simple as that, to simply shunt those people out because there is deadwood around the place for all these years.  It is not like that at all.  The way people&rsquo;s talents are used or marshalled, the manner in which they are involved in their work and sometimes the fact that people need to be encouraged to work harder are all issues that have to be addressed.  The Minister of State will acknowledge that it is something of a slog really.  One has to ask how we are going to change this office or agency, who is going to work differently next week and how we are going to manage this better.  One has to go through it, almost line by line, office by office, service by service etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If it is a big area and a decision is not needed at all, that is easy to resolve, but I do not believe there are many examples such as that at this stage.  We are down to nitty-gritty stuff in the individual Departments and agencies.  The advantage of the Croke Park agreement is that it opens the possibility for the heavy lifting to be done finally.  Let us move away from the rhetoric about the need for reform, the &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; and low productivity.  Let us have it out now and put it up to everyone involved including the public service unions.  Let us see where and how this can be done in the best interests of the country, public and private.</P>
        <P>Public sector workers are voters as well.  They have an entitlement to be involved in public debate and public discourse.  I disagree respectfully with what Senator Harris said: no election is about who will stand up to the public service or public sector workers.  That is a gross simplification and it is not about that.  No election is, or should be, about that.  It will be about many of the issues he talked about.  There should be issues in the election, but please do not characterise it in terms of who will take on those people who, apparently, are single-handedly holding the country back.  That is no way to look at this.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has resisted today, but on other occasions he has had a crack as regards what position the Labour Party took in relation to the Croke Park agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the House that when the Croke Park agreement was first published, my party leader welcomed and commended those involved in putting it together and said it would be a matter for the members of each of the unions to consider the proposals and vote on them in accordance with their respective democratic procedures.  That was exactly how the Minister of State put it in his speech today, where he said he urged public servants to decide on the agreement on its merits, precisely the view the Labour Party took.</P>
        <P>In relation to public service workers and public sector staff, as a politician and citizen I believe most of them I know really believe in the work they are doing and want to have a stake in the future of the organisations they work for.  Another advantage of the Croke Park agreement is that it invites workers to be part of the process for change.  No change is ever really truly successful if it is imposed.  Everybody understands that at times there is need for a &ldquo;carrot and stick&rdquo; approach, but there cannot be a dynamic of change across a whole sophisticated public service if this is imposed, in some way, or done as a threat.  One must involve and have onside the people who are going to do the work, perhaps in a different and more productive way, or whatever.</P>
        <P>People have a stake in the Government agency, Department or public sector organisation they work in, as well as in their country.  I have to agree, however, with the main burden of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks, as regards my disappointment with today.  As I heard the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech and looked through it very carefully, as I do again, I see it is replete with references to what is now going to happen or what will happen.  The word &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; appears half a dozen times.  I believe the Minister of State, or at least the Government, owes the House <Col N="919"/>an explanation as to why it has taken six months for anything to do with this agreement to happen at all.  I acknowledge that the implementation body was set up, but the individual action plans appear to only have been activated within the last couple of weeks.  In fact, the Minister of State expressed his disappointment that various Departments had missed their deadlines and so on, but had now met them.  It is a very good thing they have so the process may actually start.</P>
        <P>However, why has it taken six months?  If it has taken six months to set up the basic mechanisms for this, are we not entitled to be concerned as regards how much longer it will take for the substance of the agreement to be addressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start where Senator Alex White left off.  This is one area where leadership is key, and not only at Government level.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I believe, made the point that if most people subscribe to a particular roadmap, it is very important to have leadership to advance that right through the different sectors, not leaving it to one or other individual Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, on the work he is doing, because it is key to whether the initiative will be successful.  The national newspapers today are talking up the situation in which Ireland finds itself.  I am on the Council of Europe and last week we had a plenary session.  Many people admire Ireland, including the Cypriots, Greeks, Portuguese and Spanish for the serious efforts they see taking place within the country to try and address the situation speedily.  Even the British delegation commented in the knowledge that Britain, after the general election, had to face up to issues that had long been resolved by Ireland in terms of having solutions implemented.</P>
        <P>I agree that timelines are important as regards when things should happen, and I expect to be criticised for this in a second.  However, timeframes within which progress can be measured are crucial.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald, in her contribution, said that much of the Croke Park agreement was aspirational, and viewed this in a negative light.  However, if one does not have aspirations there is nothing to aspire to.  If the goals are too low, they are too achievable and therefore are not a challenge.  We must have goals as regards what is attainable, but we must have aspirations too.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am endeavouring to put balance into the discussion, because sometimes in topics such as this we can tend to bash one sector or another.  I spoke to the Minister of State on this earlier today.  When disaster strikes there are individual agencies and people that one looks to.  There was a car crash earlier this summer in which there was serious and sad loss of life, and in the event the ambulance and fire services on call as well as the garda&iacute; represented many people giving of their time, along with the voluntary sector working with the health sector, to support the families and community.  In so far as we are talking about reform of the public service, it must be remembered there are very many individuals and agencies within the public sector that are more than willing to take up the cudgels and be part of the solution, as Senator Alex White indicated, to try and progress matters.</P>
     
        <P>We cannot impose solutions on people.  I agree with that point.  A solution must evolve.</P>
        <P>It does disappoint me that even though we have a framework for reform &mdash; perhaps not a roadmap or a timescale, but a framework &mdash; some major union leaders who have, I believe, signed up to the agreement, are still holding public meetings to assert their concerns, as they would put it.  This raises the question of when one should express one&rsquo;s concerns and when one should lead.  It is terribly important, as the Minister of State mentioned, that union leaders who have signed up to the agreement are not talking out of both sides of their mouths.  We all <Col N="920"/>understand the challenges and the hard decisions that must be made in implementing the agreement.  There have already been hard decisions, including cuts in wages.  I agree with Senator Harris in this regard.</P>
        <P>I taught in Derry before I became a Member of the House, and I left quite a low-paid job with a lot of technology at my fingertips.  I arrived here and was given an office in Kildare House with a phone with no answering machine, one computer and one fax machine for the whole floor.  I came here in 1996, which was a technological age, but nothing that should have been there for my role was there.  I am thankful that this has improved.</P>
        <P>In this era of technology, those in business have access to time study reports, and companies are looking to their weakest areas and outsourcing them.  I spoke to members of Business in the Community about this.  If a company is spending too much on recruitment, it hires a recruitment firm to recruit for it.  Companies identify areas that are not their core business and outsource them.  That is the type of thing we have the capacity to do here.  A time study done within all Departments and the different agencies would throw up many obvious difficulties that could be dealt with.</P>
        <P>Human nature rebels against change because we fear it, but much of the change that could be accomplished is not to be feared but something that would make people&rsquo;s lives a little more enjoyable or challenging.  It is important that we try to address this issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made the point that the agreement is a key step in addressing the immediate fiscal and economic challenges facing the country.  European politicians and commentators are watching what we are doing and they are impressed that we are taking on these challenges.  The moratorium on recruitment and so on have posed their own challenges, but we must be careful about treating such things as individual issues, because there is no such thing as a broad-brush solution that can apply to everybody.</P>
        <P>There is much to be said in this regard and I am glad we will have more opportunities as the months go on, to consider issues such as joined-up Government, the one-stop-shop concept and the health service.  It is important not only that we identify the problems but that we have a process to deal with them and implement solutions that have been offered.  None of us wants to see services affected in our hospitals or schools, but we must maximise the potential within this and other agreements to ensure efficiencies and an effective approach.  There is much scope for this and we must lead.</P>

        <P>We are in a desperate place as a nation and as a people.  Thomas L. Friedman wrote an editorial piece in <i>The New York Times</i> in May entitled &ldquo;Root Canal Politics.&rdquo;  He wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Tooth Fairy died last night of complications related to obesity.  Born Jan. 1, 1946, the Tooth Fairy is survived by 400 million children living largely in North America and Western Europe, known collectively as &ldquo;The Baby Boomers.&rdquo;  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll certainly miss the Tooth Fairy,&rdquo; one of them said following her death, which coincided with the 2010 British elections and rioting in Greece.  The Tooth Fairy had only one surviving sibling who will now look after her offspring alone: Mr. Bond Market of Wall Street and the City of London.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister of State on the work he has done to date, to which I will return.  John Boland did this as Minister for the Public Service in the 1980s.  We need to reform our public sector.  I say this as an unashamed public servant who comes from a family whose members have given dedicated service to the public sector.  My brothers and sisters work in the public sector, as did my parents, and so do many of my friends.  We are not fat cats.  Many public servants are struggling.  I regret having had a slagging match yesterday with Senator Harris, whom I respect greatly, but I ask Senators to be careful in our use of language to avoid creating a war between the public and private sectors.  We must bring people with us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reform is necessary.  People are frightened because they do not see leadership or hope.  I commend the unions that brought their members to the ballot box to vote for the Croke Park agreement.  Fine Gael was the first political party in the State to say that the agreement must be passed and we will, to take up Senator Harris&rsquo;s challenge, lead reform in the public sector.  We will not divide people, but we will tell the truth and be honest.  There must be pain and austerity, but the way in which we drive reform will show our leader, Deputy Kenny, as the Taoiseach he can be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has not been enough communication between the Government and the people, and there must be more.  As Senator Alex White rightly said, this deal was passed six or seven months ago.  What has happened since then?  The Minister of State spoke about commitments to reductions in pay and redundancies, but gave no guarantees.  The Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Carey, made a similar comment on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; recently, and the Minister of State himself spoke in an ambiguous manner.  What is the Government telling people?  We must bring people with us.  The Minister of State was correct when he said that it was not today&rsquo;s statements in the House that would achieve reform in the public sector.  We in the House will not drive the budgetary process, but we can help by ensuring that people become involved.</P>
        <P>There is a challenge for all of us in the middle of this economic collapse.  The unions, the ordinary workers, the Government and the political classes &mdash; the Labour Party, Fine Gael or whoever &mdash; have a responsibility to implement change.  It is better to be employed than unemployed, but I ask Members of the House to stop describing sectors as non-productive or productive.  Are they telling us that the ordinary people who work in the Houses of the Oireachtas and in our hospitals are not productive or that services are not being delivered?  In many cases services are being delivered properly.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole was correct in stating that we need milestones to measure progress.  We must set targets.</P>
        <P>Benchmarking was a disaster for this country.  Yes, as a teacher, I benefited from it.  I received X euro per hour to do supervision, which I would have done every day anyway because I wanted to.  I met the students and got to know them, engaging with them in football and hurling training.  We did not need benchmarking.  It added large numbers of staff and wage increases to the public sector, many of which were not necessary or surplus to requirements.</P>
        <P>In acknowledging the need for reform, it is important that we set out the context of the great work that is being done by our public sector workers.  President McAleese made this a central tenet of her remarks at a conference at the Institute of Public Administration.  It is worth noting that at the same conference, Brigid Laffan spoke about the fact that middle management grew by 82% from 1997 to 2009, despite the fact that overall Civil Service numbers fell by 27% in the same period.  As Professor Laffan pointed out, there is a need for a renewal agenda.  This must address the issue of governance in the public sector.  I fully subscribe to the view about the HSE, central government, the Civil Service, local government, semi-States and Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point about the distribution of grants from the VECs.  What is happening is crazy. <Col N="922"/> We must be imaginative and real.  That is how we can drive consensus, not by playing some phoney game about consensus.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The objective for us must be to create best practice in the delivery of services, and I fully agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on that.  We do not achieve that by lampooning and denigrating public sector workers.  They are frightened.  I challenge anyone in this House to meet teachers, doctors, garda&iacute;, nurses and others in jobs that pay less than &euro;35,000 per annum who are doing well.  They are not doing well.  They were asked by their friends in the boom time why they were working in the public sector when they could have been making money elsewhere.  I know past pupils of mine who refused jobs as porters in hospitals or as care assistants because they were working in building and were making a fortune.  Where are they now?  They have emigrated or are unemployed.</P>
        <P>There is a massive amount of work to be done.  The public sector is productive.  The private sector has taken a huge hit.  There are difficulties in the private sector, but we have a duty to bring our people with us to have real reform.  If we want a motivated public sector, then its workers should not be driven away.  They should be given encouragement and hope.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by quoting from Thomas Friedman&rsquo;s article, of which some political parties should take note:</P>
        <P LI="1">After 65 years in which politics in the West was, mostly, about giving things away to voters, it&rsquo;s now going to be, mostly, about taking things away. Goodbye Tooth Fairy politics, hello Root Canal politics.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the choice we face, but we must be honest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  In spite of what everyone says, I see consensus growing all over the place.  Yesterday it was with the CAP agreement and today we have it on the public service.  It is good to have someone young and dynamic like Deputy Calleary in his current position.  I hope he will be inspired by Senator Harris&rsquo;s fearless assessment of the situation as he tries to make change happen.  His assessment was spot on.  He is not afraid, be it for electoral or other reasons, and he went to the core of the problem and how we need to solve it.  I agree we must try not to put the public service and the private sector at odds with each other, but we must face reality.</P>
        <P>I was very interested in Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s contribution today and he also went to the core of the matter.  The agreement is already six months old and we have had a bad experience of those six months.  The Minister of State alluded to it.  Who is in control?  Who is running the show?  Did we sign up to an agreement that was going to get dates and indicators?  The first hurdle was not crossed as these deadlines were not met.  I am sure the Minister of State is not one bit pleased about that.  They have now been reached but what kind of tardiness does that show?  What kind of commitment to change does that show?  The one thing we do not have right now is time.  The other thing we do not have is money.  The absence of those two means we need to get a move on and drive the reforms.</P>
        <P>I noted with interest the comments of Senator Alex White.  He said that for more than 30 years public service reform has been a perennial item on the agenda.  I do not mean to dismiss what he said but we cannot continue along with the wispy words he was using and that manner.  I was a little disappointed when he stated that public servants have votes too.  I found that threatening.  I do not care who does or does not have a vote.  The public service is for the public.  It is for all of them and not the workers.  It must be about what kind of services we can afford for the people.  The world has changed so much in technological terms since our public service was established.  We have to cop on to flexibility, redeployment and all these phrases <Col N="923"/>which appear to be new in the jargon of the public service but are a common practice anywhere else.  That is why I hope this agreement works because it must work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senator Harris pointed out, the public service unions recognise that change will happen, not least because we cannot afford it any other way, and they are ensuring the agreement comes to pass.  At the end of the day, we have to look at affordability.  I am glad to see the Minister of State will be tough on unions that are outside the agreement.  If it is to mean anything, those who signed up to it will get some benefits whereas those who have not are not prepared to get them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Does the Minister of State think we have too many people working in the public service?  We need to safeguard against morale falling.  People are constantly getting kicked in the public service.  We need to provide a much more streamlined service and bring it kicking and screaming up to date.  I do not know if he is brave enough to tell me honestly whether we have too many people in the public service.  How will we streamline it?  If we do this, we need to look at ways of reducing the numbers.  We need to be honest about that because we certainly cannot continue along the route we have set ourselves.  We need to be honest about where we need to make the savings.</P>
        <P>I was aghast when the Minister of State said it was important to emphasise that the Croke Park agreement is not a cost saving plan in itself.  If there is one thing we have to do to implement this agreement, it is to save money.  I accept its practice will bring about changes and economies, but the Minister of State should not be afraid to say that this is about saving money.  That is what it should be about because we need to curtail the cost of our public service.</P>
        <P>Who is in control?  I was inspired by what Senator Harris said about the need for politicians to drive it on.  This is where the decisions are being made.  If politics is to mean anything, then decisions about taxation and so on are political decisions.  We all have to face the electorate at election time and explain the decisions made about who is to be taxed and how they are to be taxed.  That is where we are answerable to the people, and that is only right.  We cannot have other people such as union leaders and so on telling the Government how to tax workers or whoever, or so called rich people, when they will not stand before the public themselves.  The only people who have the right to dictate taxation policy are politicians.  Equally, we should push forward the change agenda for the public service.  I do not think the Minister of State should be one bit afraid of what needs to be done.  It will be the making of him if he really tackles this issue.  He should do the public service and the people a favour and drive the reform that we desperately need.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share time with Senator Doherty.  I welcome the Minister of State.  I am concerned about his words.  They are not strong enough.  If we were running a business and we found we were taking in far less than is going out, we would have to reduce our costs.  We would go to our customers and employees and tell them we could not survive.  Somehow or other we would find a way to convince them to change.  That has been done well with the Croke Park agreement and most of the unions have been willing to come along and offer to do something about it.  Change is never easy and while I am in danger of being accused of denigrating public service employees, I believe a number of them did not understand the gravity of the situation and that we cannot survive otherwise.</P>
        <P>A few years ago it was highlighted that teachers, when they came back in September after taking three months&rsquo; holidays, were and still are unwilling to give up one evening for parent-teacher meetings, which means that workers need to give up a day&rsquo;s pay or part of a day&rsquo;s pay to hear how their children are getting on at school.  There is no understanding among many in the public sector about how the world operates.  The public sector costs approximately &euro;16 billion each year, which we cannot afford and must find savings.  The McCarthy report recom<Col N="924"/>mended 17,000 job cuts in the public sector and changes in a raft of special allowances and other benefits.  There has been no real movement and there have been no job threats.  The Croke Park agreement sought no compulsory redundancies or further pay cuts and promised that job security would continue more or less to be guaranteed.  It is amazing to consider that even with the reforms in the public sector, the pay cuts might be reversed anyway.  Unions such as the Teachers Union of Ireland remain totally opposed to their members working an extra hour a week.  Last year&rsquo;s CSO figures indicate that the public sector average weekly wage was &euro;960 and the private sector wage was &euro;630.  That gives some indication of the disconnection between the two.  People need to be much more patriotic.  There is a need for patriotism at this time and instead of asking where the bailout is, they need to realise they have a job and show they are willing to sacrifice something to help the country at this time.</P>
        <P>Let us consider what happened in Latvia recently where everyone had to take a pay cut of approximately 40% when the IMF arrived.  That could well happen to us; it is no longer a question of crying wolf.  If those men in the black coats arrive in Dublin Airport, we might find ourselves taking steps that are far worse, as Latvia had to do.  Latvia managed to get back very quickly and that is the hope for here.</P>
        <P>It is incredible the public sector pay and pension bill increased by &euro;6 billion, which equates to approximately double the savings we need to find in the next budget.  As Dr. Colm McCarthy recently wrote: &ldquo;[I]f the budgetary correction is ducked the alternative is an IMF/European bailout, which would mean the loss of economic sovereignty and huge reputational damage.&rdquo;  Our economy was in a worse state in the 1980s and we managed to get out of it and did well in the years that followed.  Let us not talk ourselves into saying that we cannot get out of this.  We can get out of it, but it will not be easy and we need to take steps to do so.  The reforms mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole are now in our hands and we need to make them.  It is not just about pay.  It is very much about pay and other reforms in the public sector.

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Quinn as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  Obviously the debate on the Croke Park agreement is also taking place outside this Chamber.  I recently met some of the business leaders and large employers in my constituency.  One of them told me that the minute the Croke Park agreement was signed, sales increased but as soon as there was speculation and Ministers starting to hint about a renegotiation of the Croke Park agreement, sales plummeted.  It is all about confidence and with people not knowing what is happening, it is important that confidence is restored.</P>
        <P>Many people within the trade union movement had reservations about the Croke Park agreement in the first instance.  It would be difficult to argue with the verdict at the time of Jimmy Kelly of UNITE, who said: &ldquo;The agreement seeks to copper fasten this Government&rsquo;s misguided policy of taking money out of the real economy to prop up the very institutions that caused our economic meltdown in the first place.&rdquo;  That is exactly what we have seen take place with the continued pawning of the future of this country to failed banks, failed bankers and the property speculators and gamblers who have brought the country to its knees economically and financially.</P>
        <P>Despite the reservations, the majority of unions ratified the agreement, many with the attitude of better the devil you know, and it was backed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Despite whatever flaws the agreement may contain and that its implementation from the point of view of workers depends to a great extent on the good faith of this or any future Government, it has been given the backing of the majority of organised workers.  As such the Government which drafted the agreement and which exerted considerable pressure on workers to <Col N="925"/>accept it is honour bound, one would think, to ensure its terms are upheld.  Instead we have been hearing persistent reports that it is considering jettisoning the agreement in pursuit of even more draconian measures against workers and their families.  This needs to stop.</P>
        <P>The Government is being encouraged in this by business groups and right-wing economists who believe the solution to the economic crisis is not to deal with its source, which was the criminal and incompetent speculation and mismanagement at the top, but by driving into poverty public sector workers and other workers, including those who have been put on the dole.  That would be bad enough if people were not able to see the contrast between that and the protection and feather-bedding that is still provided to the failed bankers and speculators who cry poverty while still managing to hide large amounts of wealth and enjoy the same sort of lifestyles they enjoyed when they were busy gambling away this country&rsquo;s wealth and future.</P>
        <P>As my party has previously outlined, the manner in which the Government has treated public sector workers and the manner in which it is now being suggested that it abandon the Croke Park agreement proves that social partnership at the end of the day was no more than a convenience to be abandoned when it no longer suited the Government and employers.  The solution to the economic crisis is not to sack tens of thousands of public sector workers or to slash their wages.  They, no more than any of the rest of us, have a moral obligation to foot the bill for Anglo Irish Bank and AIB or the FitzPatricks and Fingletons.  Neither is the solution, as suggested by the business organisations, to abolish the minimum wage and agreed wage rates in different sectors.  Neither is it to destroy the health service, schools, public transport and other areas of public provision in order that we can pay the debts of the Government&rsquo;s friends.</P>
        <P>My party is unique in rejecting the current politics of austerity and in proposing, as we will set out in our detailed budget submission, a positive way out of the crisis that will create jobs and address the financial crisis.  We reject the attempt to place the onus for solving those problems on public service workers or on any other workers and in that spirit we reject any attempt to tear up an agreement with the unions.  It is important to restore confidence and have certainty through strong statements that this agreement will not be torn up or renegotiated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not help but think about the tooth fairy and I would be very interested to see Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s detailed budget submission.  Senator Doherty had some emotional talk about thousands of workers being put out on the dole and a slash and burn attitude.  I do not believe that either the Government or the unions which have signed up to the agreement saw that as the ultimate end of this process.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also commend to the House an article by Kevin Myers in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>.  In dealing with the new buzzword of consensus, he takes to task commentators outside these Houses who seem to be hell-bent on dividing society and constantly focus on how they can divide the public and private sector and create division in what is a growing consensus within these Houses about at least the parameters under which we should proceed in trying to reduce our deficit by 2014.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister of State referred to the national procurement service which continues to leverage the public service&rsquo;s buying power.  Last year, in addition to getting better value for money, total savings of &euro;27 million were achieved and a figure of &euro;40 million is being targeted in 2010.  I am particularly pleased that this is happening and it is being driven by the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, who as Members on all sides of the House will agree is young, dynamic, imaginative and in the right place at the right time.  I wish him well in the efforts he is making to achieve savings in both areas and to push through the elements of the Croke Park agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>In that context, I refer to the British Government&rsquo;s initiative in recent months to bring in from the business sector the head of Topshop.  Essentially, he was brought in to do the job the Minister of State has outlined in the national procurement service.  Some of his detailed analysis in his survey is extraordinary, particularly on the amount of waste in the public service.  I will not take up the time of the House by going into detail other than to say some of it was horrendous.  It echos to a degree many of the conclusions reached not just in this year&rsquo;s report of the Comptroller and Auditor General but those of previous years in that there is still extraordinary wastage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It dates back to the idea of social partnership when the trade unions and the Government of the day embarked on a series of debates which initially, if my memory serves me right, from 1987 onwards were about pay and conditions but by 2002 were about wider Government policy.  Throughout that process the political eunuchs in both Houses were impotent and had no input whatsoever to what was happening.  I understand the frustration of Senator Harris, but I can tell him that if he had been here during that period, particularly on the benchmarking issue, he would have been tearing his hair out because Members of this and the other House &mdash; I am talking about Government and Opposition Members &mdash; had no say.  In fact, persons operating in the voluntary sector were appointed by small cohorts from around the country and given direct access to Government Buildings.  They had their 15 minutes of fame on the evening news standing in front of Government Buildings telling the rest of the nation what they intended doing to make sure their agenda was pursued.  The greatest flaw in the social partnership process was the deliberate exclusion of the elected Members of both Houses.  If there had been a political input &mdash; I am not talking about the Government but elected Deputies and Senators who on a daily basis dealt with real people &mdash; many of the mistakes made during the process, particularly on benchmarking, would not have been made and reached the point of excess.  I will readily admit that during that period I was receiving cheques and that when I gave them to my wife and she asked what they were for, I could not tell her because all that was written on them was the word &ldquo;arrears&rdquo;.  Everything was backdated.  We completely lost the run of ourselves and now the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, and the Government are trying to pick up the pieces.  The Government and the trade unions might have learned a lesson, as we are facing this new reality.  I mention this in passing because we definitely lost the run of ourselves in terms of the priorities set.</P>
        <P>Also, a culture developed within the public service which now has to be addressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that because it was not their money to spend, they could spend it.  The ultimate justification is provided by the fact that the Minister set up a national procurement service.</P>
        <P>I recall the period in which I was a member of the Council of Europe between 2002 and 2007.  The way the system worked &mdash; media commentators should take note &mdash; was that in respect of travel arrangements a contract was given to an outside party, a corporate entity, but there was an office within the political process which handled all of the travel arrangements.  I am aware things have changed to a degree since 2007, but I recall, not just on one occasion, being quoted a price to travel from Dublin to Strasbourg in the order of &euro;800 and &euro;900 for an overnight stay.  When I questioned it, the office got back to the travel agency and a few hours later I would be told it had managed to secure a rerouting.  Instead of flying direct from Paris, I could be routed through Brussels at a cost of &euro;200.  How many such instances of waste were there during the years, as outlined by people working in the journalistic field?  I am particularly pleased that the Minister has taken on this issue in the Croke Park agreement.</P><Col N="927"/>

I have been involved in education for a long time, as a member of a vocational education committee, and the unions which benefited the most from the benchmarking process were the teachers&rsquo; unions because a range of assistant principal posts and other work titles was created.  Not only were the postholders given extra money, the posts were pension linked.  They built that structure and now have the temerity to remain outside an agreement to which the vast majority of public service workers have signed up.  Good on the Minister of State.  If they are not living in the real world, they should be pulled kicking and screaming into it.</P>

	<P>Much has been said about the Croke Park agreement and a lot more will be said about it, but we should accept civil and public servants have taken a significant pay cut in the past 12 months.  Some grades have seen reductions in pay of up to 15%.  If we take into account what has happened in other jurisdictions where they have tried to extend pension age by two years and, essentially, seen those countries grind to a halt, it should be acknowledged that sacrifices have been made by civil and public servants.  We should not demonise them for what they have been prepared to accept to this point.</P>
        <P>The Croke Park deal is about reform and changes in work practices and there is a huge number of players involved, inlcuding the Government, the trade unions and the civil and public servants in the upper echelons of Departments who are expected to enforce the terms of the agreement.  Unfortunately, what we have seen so far is the easy target approach of the Government to pay cuts.  For instance, within the Health Service Executive very little regard has been had to the Croke Park agreement in terms of extended working hours for health care professionals.  I am a general practitioner, yet I am not aware of any significant discussions between the Government and general practitioners to transfer some of the workload from hospitals to general practice.  We are not seeing such engagement and not seeing that work being done by either the Government &mdash; the Minister of State is the driving force in this regard &mdash; or in the upper echelons of each of the Departments.  What we are seeing is the pursuit of easy targets &mdash; cuts in capital spending which will prove detrimental in the long term.  Another easy target is temporary staff who are being laid off.  We are not seeing expenditure on upgrading medical equipment or school equipment.</P>
        <P>There is a need for a process to be put in place to drive this agenda much harder.  The Minister of State may have to walk on egg shells to get the job done, but it must be done because otherwise we will reach a stage where civil and public sector workers will see another reduction in pay, one of the options open to the Government to close the deficit.  However, if there were significant reforms and greater productivity in a wide range of public services provided by the Government, there is the possibility we could avoid the worst of this.  If there are tax increases or fewer benefits, they will affect every person drawing a salary, whether in the public or private sector.  Unless we all face up to the changes required, we will be left with no choice in the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The waste within the health service, the area I know best, is unbelievable.  PPARS was a classic example.  A computer system that cost &euro;240 million was just switched off and forgotten about.  I took my child to a hospital for an outpatient appointment in recent months.  I had not been in an outpatient department in the best part of the ten years since I had left the hospital <Col N="928"/>system and as I sat there waiting to see the consultant, I watched clerical staff as they pulled big trolleys containing paper notes.  If I am working on the on-call, out-of-hours GP service which is now used in this country &mdash; the co-operative type system, which is a radical change &mdash; and I type a consultation into the computer from the patient&rsquo;s bedside, it is sent directly to that patient&rsquo;s doctor.  The idea of not using computers in general practice is considered backward, particularly when dealing with blood results and administrative work.  Not only that, other changes have taken place in the amount of work done by practice nurses and in the area of secretarial work.</P>
        <P>In the past ten years, we have radically reformed how general practice works.  That is public private partnership, not just private industry, in that there is huge input from the HSE and from GPs as independent contractors.  If that sort of radical change took place in hospitals, we would probably not be discussing issues like this.</P>
        <P>These are the issues we must consider.  It is the ethos we must set out for ourselves in the coming years.  Otherwise, the row that takes place here about the divide between the private sector and public sector and about the cost of the public sector and the deficit we are facing will become an endemic problem that will lead to a very simplistic, blunt instrument solution within a year or two.  We must face up to this reality immediately, and I hope this is how the Minister of State will approach it.</P>
        <P>Mr. Gerry Robinson undertook several programmes in regard to change in the HSE in recent years.  When he went to the hospitals, he found he could talk to the hospital managers, consultants and nurses and was able to bring about some change.  However, when he was asked his view on what was the greatest impediment to change, he said it was the upper echelons of management and their refusal to engage, take responsibility or be accountable for billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money that was the major problem in the HSE.  It is probably the same in regard to the wider public service as it is an institutional issue.</P>
        <P>We need to throw out the old ways and become sharper, stop blaming each other and looking for excuses to blame each other and stop pointing the finger.  We need to take a few risks and do things differently.  That is how we will make changes.  I do not want to take advice from people like the man from Topshop.  I accept he can point out changes of which we are all aware, as can politicians and those who work in the service.  That individual sold his company for &euro;1.2 billion.  He is not in the same world as the rest of us, so let us not quote him.  There are more than enough Members in this House who can point out similar changes.  I compliment Senator Harris, who comes out forcefully on these points, and perhaps I can myself be radical and fundamentalist at times.  There are options for change.  There is a need to listen to everybody but, most of all, there is a need to make those changes happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him, acknowledging the challenge he faces.  I know well he is up to it and I wish him well because it is a difficult task.</P>
        <P>I am not a fan of the Croke Park agreement.  I can see the benefit in having consensus and in working with the unions to achieve a transformation in the public service.  However, while the social partnership model which evolved in the late 1980s was an example to many countries, it lost its way in the past decade or so.  Some of the current economic challenges arise as a consequence.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said he intends this agreement should make significant savings, as it must, and it must also improve the delivery of services.  It is difficult to be confident about it, however, and even the Minister of State was critical in some respects.  The implementation has been very slow in getting off the ground.  I do not know whether this betrays a certain reluctance on the part of senior staff or not.  However, the letters coming to the bodies from the Depart<Col N="929"/>ments arrived very late in the day.  I had discussions at a joint committee meeting this morning with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, whose representatives told me it had done nothing as yet in regard to the agreement and that it is waiting on guidance from the Department.  Therein lies a significant problem.  I hope it succeeds but I am far from optimistic.</P>
        <P>If we do not get to a situation where managers at lower levels are empowered, we will get nowhere.  This is being controlled from the top.  From my experience in management, I know that when I wanted to make savings in a company in difficult times, I went to the managers in the different areas and I set them a challenge to identify savings.  They did it, and the really good managers identified themselves by tackling waste and identifying where savings could be made.  Those who were not up to the job also identified themselves by not coming back with anything.  The point is that they knew there would be an audit of their findings, they would be accountable for their suggestions and, where they had not come forward with suggestions which they should easily have identified, there were consequences.  Unfortunately, we do not have a public service where there is that level or, for that matter, any significant level of accountability.</P>
        <P>I want to preface these remarks by noting there are many excellent people in the public service for whom I have tremendous admiration and who would command top jobs in the private sector.  However, there are also many in the public sector who are hiding &mdash; they are punching in time until they get to retirement age and, unfortunately, some of them have decades to go before they get to that stage.  For example, I hear of people in certain segments of the public sector who are playing DVDs to occupy their time simply because they have no work to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not hold them accountable.  Whoever is in charge of such staff should be identified and dispensed with.  It is their responsibility to identify areas where there is such waste and where it is not being tackled.</P>
        <P>I understand why the Croke Park agreement includes an incentive that some of the savings will be repaid to those whose salaries were reduced and who are earning under &euro;35,000.  However, if my memory is correct, that commitment is given to all public servants across the board, even those on high salaries, when eventually the savings accrue to enable that to be done.  In the current economic climate and with the serious fiscal position we are in, where we could well be facing a collapse in our public finances, I ask the Minister of State what is the justification for repaying moneys at this stage, by which I mean next year, to anybody whose salary has been cut.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Also, what proportion of the savings has been committed to for repayment in order to replenish those wages?</P>
        <P>The area which needs to be considered and which identifies itself easily when we look back over the past decade is that of overstaffing.  From 1998 to 2008, the public sector increased from approximately 220,000 on the public service payroll to 370,000, an increase of 150,000.  The cost went from &euro;9 billion to &euro;20 billion, which is absolutely not sustainable.  Using my experience of mathematics from a business perspective, if we do not get back to somewhere in the order of &euro;14 billion to &euro;15 billion, we will not be sustainable going forward.  Obviously, action is needed in that area.</P>
        <P>We are sometimes challenged in regard to levels of pay.  A Dutch report was carried out on the pay of university professors and, while I accept I am singling them out, this could apply across the public service.  The report was based on a purchasing power parity system of eval<Col N="930"/>uating pay across a number of European countries.  In the Netherlands it was &euro;46,000, in Germany it was &euro;34,000, in Belgium it was &euro;38,000, in Switzerland it was &euro;78,000, in Sweden it was &euro;31,000 and in Britain it was &euro;60,000, although in the top universities there it was &euro;82,000.</P>

	<P>I have taken many notes and Members can be sure that I have taken on board all the suggestions and thoughts voiced this morning.  Some general points must be made.</P>
        <P>I have taken the chance again today to outline the Government&rsquo;s position.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, have also done it.  I wish Senator Doherty would change the album a little to reflect the times we are in, for a start in terms of macro policy and also in terms of the commitments that have been given.  The Government is committed to this <Col N="931"/>agreement but it is critical that both sides, management and the unions, deliver on the promise and potential of the agreement.  Significant change must be delivered in the public service to accommodate a reduction in service numbers in a climate of industrial peace.  It is a two-way deal, and everyone must deliver on it.  If one side fails to deliver on the deal, we do not have a deal.</P>
        <P>There was a question about why the plans were late being submitted.  Yes, that is unacceptable.  It is a bad start to the agreement and I have indicated that it is not acceptable for deadlines to be treated as flexible.  They are not.  We do not have time on this issue.  I noted Senator Twomey&rsquo;s and Senator Walsh&rsquo;s point about their interactions with bodies of the civil and public service that have not been informed about the plan.  I will refer that to the implementation body.  Every section of the civil and public service, regardless of what agency it is, must start implementing this without any further delay.</P>
        <P>Implementation plans are one thing but much work is already under way across the service in terms of change.  Senator Twomey touched on an issue with regard to PPARS.  Due to the way the PPARS project progressed, there is a fear in some places about venturing into information technology projects in particular.  We must get rid of that fear.  For that reason the Government is committed to two appointments, a chief information officer for the country and a shared services person to drive forward IT.  The aim is to use IT better to deliver services more effectively and more cheaply.  Let there be no doubt that the Croke Park agreement is a cost-cutting measure as well as a reform measure.  We must reduce our costs and there should be no doubt about my commitment and that of the Government to it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Some civil servants need to know it is about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the savings and the assessment of the savings, that is the role of the implementation body.  That body is now looking through the activation plans and when I return to the Seanad in four or five weeks I will give a better sense and model of how we will implement that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Buttimer raised the need for clear objectives and performance indicators.  I agree with them.  A number of Senators asked where the implementation plans could be seen.  They will be published on-line and will be available for people to see.  The implementation body is engaging in a process of dialogue with Departments about querying the plans and, as will be inevitable in some cases, asking for better plans and information.  That process will not be hidden.  We will use the technology Senator O&rsquo;Malley mentioned to involve this House and the public in sharing that process.</P>
        <P>It is good to have Senator Harris back at full throttle to the benefit of the House.  He is correct that this agreement is very different from those that preceded it.  Senator Mooney, Senator Walsh and others referred to the culture of agreements that preceded this one.  This is not social partnership but an agreement between us as an employer and those who work for us.  It is about us giving guarantees that if those who work for us change the way they do things and make savings, we will consider giving some of those savings back to them.  It is the same way that private companies across the world operate.  We are asking for very significant changes in practices that should have been changed a long time ago.  In this country we set out a way of doing things but we are very bad at deciding later to stop doing them that way.  We need to have more sunset clauses, as they are called, across the sector.</P>

	<P>A number of Senators raised the issue of non-productive public servants and the number of such people who are hiding in the system.  There are undoubtedly many poor public servants and we have been incredibly restricted to date as to how we deal with that and poor performance.  Every person one speaks to has had a bad interaction with one, two or three public servants.  Equally, however, there are many good people as well.  Senator Keaveney made that point.  I was in Inishowen a week after that tragic accident occurred.  Public servants were the first people at the crash scene.  They brought patients and the dead to the hospitals in Letterkenny.  It was public servants who had the job of telling a parent their child was dead.  Can any of us put ourselves in that situation?  It is public servants who continue to deal with it.  The media and everyone else has moved on to the next headline but the public servants are on the ground dealing with those families and with such unimaginable scenes.  That is replicated throughout this country.  It is important to realise that we place public servants in situations which we ourselves would not tackle or wish to tackle.  With regard to those who let the public servant down, however, their days are numbered.  We cannot allow poor performance to hide behind the good reputation of our service.  We must make changes there and I agree with Senators in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn raised the issue of unions that oppose the deal.  I have been clear on that.  If one is opposing the implementation of change in the public service, one does not have the benefit of the protection in the deal.  I reiterate to the unions that oppose the implementation of this deal that these are not hollow words.  I am determined to see that through.  It is unfair to christen all the teaching unions as Senator Mooney might have done inadvertently.  The INTO has taken this agreement and run with it from the start.  It cannot have been easy with the other two unions, although, in fairness, the ASTI has come on board.  The general secretary of the INTO, Ms Sheila Nunan, serves on the implementation body.  The INTO has taken the ball and run with it and I believe it is committed to seeing this process through.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of procurement.  We are a doing a great deal of work on that.  Procurement is very important in a number of areas.  While we must get more value for money, something to which I am committed, equally however, spending that amount of money in public procurement is a way to create jobs.  This summer we eased some of the regulations to allow smaller companies to access Government contracts and to remove the paperwork burden that cripples that process so those companies can sustain employment and create new jobs.  It is important to do that.</P>
        <P>Senators asked if there were too many public servants.  That is a very broad issue and we might have that discussion on another occasion.  However, the OECD, which does not necessarily hold back when it thinks there is a problem, said in its report that we are not over-staffed in comparison with our European neighbours.  It should also be borne in mind that we reduced the number by approximately 11,000 in 18 months.  There will be further reductions.  On the next occasion I visit the House we can get into further discussion and detail about that.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Senator Twomey referred to some of the changes required such as technical changes in the health service in particular.  I am sure the House will join with me in wishing Cathal Magee every success as he takes over as chief executive officer of the HSE.  He has identified the need for large-scale IT projects and this will happen in a different environment with the appointment of our chief information officer and our shared services officer.  This is an area about which I knew very little when I began this job but I have taken some time over the summer to look into shared services and IT generally.  As Senator O&rsquo;Malley said, there is significant potential in this area and it is an area to which I have a particular commitment.</P><Col N="933"/>
        <P>I thank the House and the Senators and I thank the Acting Chairman for her good wishes.  I have a personal commitment to this area.  I share all of the frustrations that are being expressed about this House and the other House and the manner in which politics in general has lost much of its power and role over the past number of years.  We are the people who are answerable for what happens.  To those who think this agenda may change under different management I say &ldquo;Dream on&rdquo;.  A different management will have to make the same decisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Organisational Review Programme: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome this opportunity to share views with Members on the organisational review programme.  I will focus on the second report, which was published by the Taoiseach on 4 October, and more widely on the role of the organisational review programme in the agenda of transformational change across the public service.  It will be helpful to Senators if I were first to give a brief status report on progress to date.</P>
        <P>The first report of the organisational review programme, published in November 2008, related to three Departments &ndash; the Departments of Transport; Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, now Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  Copies were sent to all Members of the Oireachtas on publication and may be accessed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The second report of the organisational review programme includes the findings of the reviews of a further four organisations and follow-up action plans prepared by the management of each of them.  The organisations were the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Statistics Office and the Property Registration Authority.  Regarding the third round, work is well advanced at this stage.  Reviews are being undertaken of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>By way of background to the organisational review programme process, the Taoiseach asked the implementation group of Secretaries General in 2006 to develop proposals on new initiatives for the next phase of modernisation of the public service.  The group&rsquo;s proposals included a major external review of the public service which became the OECD review &ndash; a major benchmarking exercise of the public service published in the report Ireland: Towards an Integrated Public Service.  The proposals also included an initiative on organisational health checks, <Col N="934"/>which became the organisational review programme.  The OECD and organisational review programme reviews complement one another.</P>
        <P>When announcing the organisational review programme reviews, the Taoiseach suggested they should examine the &ldquo;structures, capacities, procedures and leadership capabilities&rdquo; within individual Government organisations.  Thus, the reviews involve undertaking full 360&deg; assessments.  It is planned that all Departments and major offices will have been reviewed by the end of 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key purpose of the reviews is to assess how fit for purpose organisations are in light of the tasks set for them by Government and the challenges ahead.  In that context, the reviews are designed to do the following: promote greater synergies across the various functions, programmes and services of an organisation; target practical support and advice on areas of particular concern for the future; examine the implications of an organisation&rsquo;s existing business strategies in terms of its capacity to deliver on them, including by reference to their procedures, processes and systems; assess the implications of externally imposed requirements, including obligations arising from changes in EU or national legislation; and assess the extent to which the various plans of an organisation are aligned, and if they are supported corporately so as to achieve the goals set out in the programme for Government and other national frameworks.  In short, the organisational review programme reviews are designed to provide a check against an organisation&rsquo;s capability to do what it says it is doing or plans to do.</P>
        <P>The organisational review programme reviews are carried out by a team comprising civil servants, not consultants.  This provides significant added value.  As civil servants, the team members have a good understanding of public service organisations, their cultures and their practices and, in that way, support and buy-in to the process by management and staff is promoted and strengthened.</P>
        <P>The organisational review programme team is led by the Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr. Dermot McCarthy, and assistant secretary, Mr. Philip Kelly.  The team also comprises three principals seconded from parent Departments or offices.  Typically, each principal leads on the conduct of just one review, obviously without any involvement in the review of his or her parent Department or office.  The team also includes three support staff from the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>At the outset it is important to make clear that the organisational review programme reviews do not make any recommendations about the statutory remit of organisations.  This is a matter more appropriately dealt with at political level.  Equally, the reviews are undertaken on a resource neutral basis, recognising that Departments and offices rarely have all the resources they believe necessary to fulfil their mandates.  However, identification of areas where there are significant issues between commitments and available resources are not precluded.</P>
        <P>At the heart of an organisational review programme review is an assessment of the capacities of organisations, using a common template covering three broad areas: strategy, delivery of customer service, and performance evaluation.  Within each of these areas, ten attributes of organisational practice and behaviour are comprehensively explored.  These include, for example, an examination of the capacity of leadership, internally and externally, whether a commitment to continuous improvement and innovation permeates the organisation, how well resources like HR and ICT are managed, and if performance is monitored and measured.</P>
        <P>In reaching findings on issues, the team uses a research methodology that is both extensive and thorough.  A broad review of secondary data is undertaken, including all major policy reports and legislation, HR strategies, customer charters and action plans, ICT programmes and operations, financial and audit reports, and value for money studies.  The review also includes <Col N="935"/>organisational-specific plans and strategies that involve cross-institutional collaboration with other agencies to deliver core objectives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, on-line, web-based questionnaires are administered to all staff.  In the interests of confidentiality and participant trust, the questionnaires are issued and analysed by independent consultants.  No individual replies are seen by anyone except the consultants and aggregate results only are produced for the team.  Third, there is extensive fieldwork, involving meetings, workshops and other forms of engagement with Ministers, Oireachtas committees, the management and staff of the organisation under review, its stakeholders, both public and private, and at EU and international level where particularly appropriate.  In that regard, over 340 meetings and workshops were held in the course of the second round of organisational review programme reviews covering four Government organisations.</P>
        <P>When the information gathering stage has been completed, the organisational review programme team analyses the evidence collected from all the meetings, workshops and surveys.  It produces findings on each of the attributes covering the broad areas of strategy, managing delivery and performance evaluation.  A core aim is to identify a small number of key issues which, if acted upon, would make a substantive improvement to the way the Department or office conducts its business.  Each organisation then draws up an action plan to address the key findings of the organisational review programme team.  Both the findings and the action plan are published in a composite report.  I turn specifically to the second report of the organisational review programme which deals with system-wide implications.  The report highlights significant progress made in a number of important areas.  For example, a strong commitment to quality customer service is firmly embedded in many of the organisations reviewed.  There are a number of excellent examples of the effective use of information and communications technology, involving innovative approaches and strong project management.  The organisational review programme team has included in its report a chapter on information and communications technology best practice guidelines drawing from the research to date.  Permeating the guidelines is the imperative that management at all levels in an organisation regard information and communications technology as a potentially powerful business tool that would enable, for example, the provision of management information systems, on-line customer service delivery and automated back-end processing.</P>
        <P>The report highlights areas in which there are significant capacity challenges which will require transformational change and development.  For example, there is considerable scope for improvement in the management of people, particularly the flexible allocation and redeployment of staff, the management of performance and the introduction of innovative work practices.  In these challenging times Departments and offices need consciously to make more effective use of resources, both people and technology, to enhance productivity levels.  The report highlights that there is significant potential for new efficiencies to be gained.  It is clear, too, from the research that Civil Service organisations are still struggling to put in place effective performance measurement systems, especially to tackle under-performance and measure outcomes.  All these issues require both organisational level and system-wide responses.</P>
        <P>In a special commentary in the second report by Professor John Murray, head of the school of business, Trinity College, who sadly passed away recently, he drew attention to a number of key challenges facing public sector organisations individually and collectively.  He suggested a stronger emphasis on public service productivity was needed, especially given a future of scarce resources and higher service demands.  He indicated focused actions were required to change aspects of HR management at organisational and public service-wide levels.  There is a need to improve the measurement of performance, especially with regard to outcomes and also with reference to international benchmark indicators of high performance.  Overall, there is a need <Col N="936"/>to explore the possibility for radical transformational change in the public service, as well as pursuing incremental change programmes.  In progressing the salient and insightful points made by the late Professor Murray, it is vital that the challenging programme of reform set out by Government in the report of the task force on transforming public services and reflected more recently in the public service agreement 2010 to 2014 is fully implemented.</P>
        <P>Separate statements on this topic were made in the House this morning and I do not propose to revisit them.  However, it is clear that these times of exceptional economic and social challenge are driving an urgent need for greater cost effectiveness, efficiency and innovation in many areas of all organisations across the entire public service.  The Government is committed to far-reaching and effective public sector reform.  The organisational review programme is a real illustration of its desire to examine honestly the public sector, acknowledge best practice in order that others may benefit, show areas for improvement and make concrete recommendations for action and change.</P>
        <P>Regarding the findings on individual organisations in the second report, they relate to reviews of three processing entities and one policy organisation, the Department of Health and Children.  The review of the Department provides a challenging critique in a number of areas, notably, the management of crises, role demarcation with the HSE and the Department&rsquo;s other 30 agencies, the performance and governance of agencies, and the internal deployment of resources, especially staff.  The Department&rsquo;s action plan demonstrates an evident willingness to address these issues.  It is particularly encouraging that each action is time-bound and targeted at a specific outcome.</P>
        <P>The review of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners revealed significant strengths, especially in the development and application of information and communications technology-based solutions to meet business needs and improve customer services.  However, as with other public sector organisations, Revenue will need to work on human resources management, especially with regard to the deployment of resources, the management of under-performance, as well as dealing with the significant challenge of replacing the organisational memory and expertise which has been lost in the recent past.  The key challenge will be to maintain a culture of excellence.</P>
        <P>The review of the Central Statistics Office shows an organisation with many satisfied customers.  However, despite fully meeting increasing EU statistical requirements, it is not as effective as it might be, especially in moving from a reliance on surveys to the re-use of administrative data held by other Government bodies.  Such a transition is necessary to achieve a tangible reduction in the survey burden on businesses and the citizen.  It will require substantial engagement and investment in data management by many organisations across government.</P>
        <P>The fourth review, relating to the Property Registration Authority, portrays an organisation which has a very satisfied customer base, gone through significant technological change and managed that change in a highly competent manner.  Overall, it has a clear sense of direction and a strong capacity to meet forthcoming challenges.</P>
        <P>Generally, the organisational review programme reviews have surfaced some issues that are particular to an individual organisation and others which are common to the Civil Service and the wider public service.  Both kinds of issues featured prominently in the negotiations that culminated in the Croke Park agreement.  There is a particular focus in the agreement on achieving efficiencies through changes in work practices and the flexible redeployment of staff.  Such measures will be central to addressing the kinds of weaknesses and limitations in Government organisations that have surfaced in the organisational review programme process.</P><Col N="937"/>
        <P>Regarding follow-up on the findings of the organisational review programme team, every Department and office reviewed must produce a follow-up action plan.  It is clear that a plan&rsquo;s value is in the thoroughness of its implementation.  While the efforts of the organisational review programme team are focused on undertaking the reviews and planning for the next rounds, there is also a need for a process to ensure the specific commitments made by organisations in their organisational review programme action plans are fully delivered.  In that regard, the new public service board being established under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, will advise on the design of a robust look-back process in respect of the organisational review programme reviews.  The board will assess progress on public service transformation generally and advise on future directions.</P>
        <P>All Departments and major offices will have been reviewed as part of the organisational review programme by the end of 2012.  Individually and collectively, the organisational review programme reviews provide strong evidentiary platforms for sustainable transformational change across the public service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, and the opportunity to have a discussion on the organisational review programme.  As it is not something that is within my area of expertise, I have spent recent days investigating the activities of the programme and reading the second report.  I have considered the issues to which the Minister of State referred.</P>
        <P>A couple of points struck me from the outset and the Minister of State clarified some of them.  One of my concerns is that the organisational review programme of the various Departments and agencies in the public sector was being, in effect, administered by their comrades in other parts of the public service.  However, the Minister of State has outlined the fact that much of the information gathered was processed by independent consultants and that it fed into a process administered by civil servants from other Departments.  I am someone who has been critical of the overuse by the Government and local authorities of consultants, but in this case I welcome as a good idea the process and system used.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not as convinced as the Minister of State was about the debate we had in the House earlier on the Croke Park agreement and the necessary efforts in which the Government engaged with the social partners in recent months to reach the agreement which was all about securing agreement on public sector pay in return for significant reform of how public services were delivered.  Neither am I convinced the Government has pursued the reform agenda with any vigour in the time since.  I accept it has faced significant economic and banking issues in the intervening period, but we have been promised consistently in this House and other places for many years, long before the Croke Park agreement came into being, significant reform of how the public service operates.  The reality is that we are approaching the junction where there will have to be these major reforms, whether the Government has the necessary appetite or willingness to pursue them.  Perhaps that is a matter for debate on another occasion.  There is not much I disagree with in the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments about the different agencies and Departments that have been reviewed in the second report.  It is quite complimentary of the efforts in the Revenue Commissioners, an organisation that is in good condition according to the report.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said, however, that as a result of the ban on recruitment, a significant number of people have left Revenue in the last 18 to 24 months, which may present difficulties in the future.  The functions and role of the Revenue Commissioners are specific and everyone would hate to see a situation similar to what happened in the last recession, where significant effort was made by large numbers of people who were earning a lot of money to hide those earnings from Revenue, offshore in many cases.  The job of the Revenue Commissioners is such <Col N="938"/>that a strong individual case can be made for that organisation to retain its staff numbers to counteract such activity, even in these times when there is an embargo on public service recruitment.  The Revenue Commissioners must be well resourced to perform their function in these difficult economic times.</P>
        <P>Equally, when it came to the Property Registration Office, the review was largely positive.  That is not surprising in that it only came into existence after the enactment of legislation in 2006.  There were mixed comments on the Central Statistics Office but largely it was fulfilling its function well.</P>
        <P>The main meat of the report centred on the review of the Department of Health and Children.  It was scathing in some of its comments on the operation of the Department.  It is remarkable that six years after the foundation of the HSE, this report must spell out grey areas that exist between the role and function of the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  It focused on allocation of human resources, finding that some officials in the Department are grossly overworked while some are grossly underworked.  It is not something just the Opposition has raised, there is anecdotal evidence about activities within the Department and the output level from it.  This report, however, is blunt in stating there are significant difficulties in the Department in the allocation of resources and staff across different sections.</P>
        <P>I cannot get my head around the fact that we are still criticising the lack of demarcation between the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  The Department deals with many agencies, but six years after the foundation of the HSE, there is still no clear delineation between the Department and the executive and that is not acceptable.  If that happened in the private sector, it would not be entertained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report is welcome.  It contains mostly good news, with the obvious exception of the difficulties in the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  It is important that we discuss the second biggest spending Department in government when we are formulating a budget that will require huge cutbacks.  That Department will face significant cuts which will lead to grave issues for all of those involved in politics.  It is unfortunate that when we are trying to protect investment in front-line services in the HSE this report would heavily criticise the operation of the Department of Health and Children.  I hope the remedies outlined in the report will be implemented and that we will ultimately see the complete transformation envisaged in the Croke Park agreement of how public services are operated.</P>
        <P>At the start of the report, Mr. McCarthy outlined that there have been significant improvements in how agencies deal with the public.  I welcome the fact that those Departments and agencies have transformed themselves over the last few years.  There are significant issues, however, particularly in the Department of Health and Children, that have not been rectified.  A job remains to be done there and I hope the Government has the bottle to do it over the next few months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this worthwhile debate on the organisational review programme and its second report.</P>
        <P>The advances in technology in recent years have transformed how business is done.  The private sector has embraced those advances and enhanced them, becoming more efficient in the process.  They have even allowed for our wages to be paid automatically into our accounts in the financial institutions.  A transformation has taken place and it is the job of Government to see the same happen in the public sector.  At a time of major economic and social challenges, it is more important than ever that Government Departments and agencies assess their capacity to meet the challenges of the future in the broad areas of strategy, delivery of customer service and performance evaluation.  In particular, there is a need for good organisational vision and <Col N="939"/>leadership, as well as the effective deployment of people, innovation, better customer service and increased productivity.</P>
        <P>The rapid deterioration in the public finances we have experienced in recent years has brought greater urgency to the need to improve the way in which services are provided by the public service.  A more efficient and productive public service can play a key role in putting the public finances on a more sustainable footing.  That is in all our interests.</P>
        <P>The scale of the public finance problem cannot be overstated.  In monetary terms, the Government has to borrow around &euro;20 billion this year alone to bridge the gap between its income and expenditure.  A substantial part of this expenditure relates to public sector employment, so it is incumbent upon us to enhance efficiency within the sector.  Labour market data published earlier this week indicate some stabilisation and while this is to be welcomed, we must be under no illusion as to the extent of the labour market problem.  There are also signs from our main export markets that the competitiveness of our economy has improved.  Indeed, our export figures are staggering relative to what is occurring in the world economy.  Our competitiveness will help to underpin the improvement in our exports in the months and years ahead.</P>
        <P>Despite these improvements, there is a real level of uncertainty.  Even with projected economic recovery over the next few years, a significant hole will still remain in the public finances.  The Government recognises that an efficient, high-performing public service is essential to economic recovery.  It is true that the necessity to transform our public services has never been greater, but it is also true that this process has been under way for some time.  Successive Governments, in particular ones led by Fianna F&aacute;il, have recognised the need to examine the way the public service operates.  As a result, we have had initiatives such as the strategic management initiative, SMI, and Delivering Better Government.  These delivered tangible results across a range of headings and provided the building blocks for the work now under way.  For example, SMI brought a new focus on customer service with the advent of customer charters and customer service action plans, a theme taken up by both the OECD review of the public service and the task force on the public service.  The area of human resource management saw the introduction of performance management systems and greater use of open recruitment.</P>
        <P>The Government is also mindful of the need to test the work being undertaken and to subject it to external evaluation.  For this reason, it asked the OECD to conduct a whole-of-public service review, the first time the OECD had undertaken such a review.  This review was completed and reported on in 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first report of the organisational review programme, published in November 2008, focused on three Departments - Transport, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, now the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The OECD gave a generally positive assessment of the public service and the role it played in our national development.  It recognised that Ireland had continually sought to modernise and reform its public service systems and practices to ensure they can continue to meet the needs and expectations of Government and citizens.</P>
        <P>The OECD also recognised that Ireland was looking for new avenues in which to further its agenda of public service modernisation in order that it would continue to deliver improved outcomes for our people and the country, respond to changing and complex social needs and support business in gaining a competitive advantage, thereby contributing to economic growth.  The organisations also recognised that there was much more to be done.  According to the OECD, there is a need for a more integrated public service and a greater performance focus, with more information being gathered on outputs and outcomes and what has actually been achieved.</P><Col N="940"/>
        <P>With this in mind, the OECD recommended that the requirement to produce output statements, introduced under SMI but largely confined to Departments and Government offices, should be extended to every State body.  Thus, the second report of the organisational review programme under discussion today includes the findings of the reviews of a further four Departments and follow-up action plans prepared by each of their managements.  The Departments and offices in question are the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Statistics Office and the Property Registration Authority.</P>
        <P>I note from the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, that a third round is well advanced and that reviews are being undertaken of the Departments of Education and Skills, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  Clearly, the Government attaches the highest priority to the transformation agenda, as reflected in the arrangements in place for its implementation.  The Taoiseach chairs a Cabinet committee which includes the Ministers for Finance, Education and Skills, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children and Justice and Law Reform.  A steering group of Secretaries General meets regularly to prepare the work of the Cabinet committee.</P>
        <P>There have been important developments in the way we approach our business as a result of the transformation agenda and progress has already been made under a number of headings.  In terms of human resources, measures have been put in place that continue to contribute to the implementation of expenditure savings.  These include the incentivised scheme of early retirement in the public service, the special Civil Service career break scheme and the shorter working year scheme, together with restrictions on the filling of public service vacancies by recruitment or promotion.</P>
        <P>Without a doubt, a more integrated public service that is leaner, more effective and more focused on the needs of the people it serves is required if it is to contribute to the process of returning Ireland to economic growth and prosperity.  I agree 100% with the Minister of State, according to whom it is these times of exceptional economic and social challenge that are driving the urgent need for greater cost effectiveness and efficiency in many areas of the public service.  It is clear that the Government is sincere in its desire to examine honestly the public sector, to acknowledge best practice in order that others may benefit and to identify key areas for improvement.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and this opportunity to do some thinking on the new organisational review programme.  I also welcome the review, although I was not familiar with it until it was put on the agenda and I began reading about it.</P>
        <P>This discussion is timely.  Given the major national economic and social challenges, it is more important than ever for Departments and Government offices to strengthen their capacities and consider how their performance should be rated.  Leadership and customer service are the key areas in any organisation.  They must also consider how to modernise the public service.  While there is undoubtedly a culture of excellence within the Civil Service, a laziness has set in among us all during the past ten years.  There was so much money in our country that could be thrown at a problem instead of examining the fundamental changes to be made that the ethos of excellence slipped.</P>
        <P>I must give the Civil Service ten out of ten.  It is an excellent body of people.  The brains of the country are in the civil and public service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>That said, public servants must be challenged.  They know that any reform must come from within.  In all walks of life, they are well able to examine how best to make changes to develop the country&rsquo;s future, to get more effective use out of information and communications technology, to improve the way in which management does its business and to make effective use of resources and technology.  Transforming the public service is what is at stake.  That is a key concern.  It is about doing more for less, the advice I give to all.  It is not always about money but about better outcomes, managing our resources and dealing with customers, personnel and projects.  It is about pushing ourselves to our limits, something we have not been doing, and I am first to take the blame because I became lazy.  There are times when we all decide to get somebody else in to do a job for us rather than do the thinking ourselves.  We must start again in this regard.  Ireland is one of the best countries in the European Union.  Its people rose to the challenge when they had to and will rise again.  We must start at the core with the transformation of the public service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report publishes findings on the following bodies: the Department of Health and Children, the Central Statistics Office, the Revenue Commissioners and the Property Registration Authority.  There is a weakness in the operation of the HSE, to which the Minister of State referred.  The report concludes that the Department of Health and Children had not succeeded in clarifying its roles and responsibilities in this area.  The HSE was established in 2005, but the transformation to the new concept from the original health boards took time.  I am not convinced that the HSE marks the way forward, but we cannot return to the health boards.  The concept behind the HSE may have to be looked at again and the adoption of a regional focus might be the way forward.  There are too many pitfalls in the HSE, as constituted.  Even though the executive was established in 2005, the Department of Health and Children still has a staff complement of 433, most of whom have no clear picture of what their role is or who their customer is.  It is not that they do not want to work.  They are fine and terrific people with great brain power who face great challenges.  However, too many of them are doing the same jobs and the organisation of work has not been streamlined.  That must be examined and the impetus must come from within.  In that regard, I ask each Department to look at itself and provide an action plan in order that each produces changes by examining work practices, seeking efficiencies and having an overall vision.  That is the only way forward and I have no doubt it would greatly improve morale.</P>
        <P>The report makes it clear that a substantial change such as the establishment of the HSE cannot happen overnight.  I agree.  It is a journey which requires many changes within an organisation.  People had fixed minds heretofore regarding work practices, but things must change for the future.  Society has changed drastically in the past three years.  We are going back to community orientation, having primary care services and dealing with local issues.  There is decentralisation, although it may not be decentralisation as we understand the term.  There is a lack of leadership at middle management level, but change is happening.  I am glad the Government is committed to the process but I am concerned about the timespan involved.  Given the methodology used, how long does it take to conduct interviews and surveys and produce an action plan suggesting improvements for the future?</P>
        <P>I wish all organisations and Departments well in the transformation of the public service.  More than anything else, we need excellence in the civil and public service.  The workers are the ones who will make this happen and make Ireland the best country in the European Union.  That is the way forward and I wish all concerned every success.</P>

	<P>We had a good debate earlier on reform in the public service and, as the Minister of State acknowledged, statements were made on the overarching policy and wider political issues that arise in seeking such reform.  I will not repeat what I said.  However, the <Col N="942"/>debate was interesting and might be continued at that level.  I am not sure what this debate is intended to achieve.</P>

	<P>There is a clear necessity for a rigorous analysis of the public service.  I have no difficulty with this and welcome the initiative that led to the production of the ORP reports.  While I have not read them in detail, I can see their analysis of the problems and recommendations arising therefrom.  </P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State will not take it as a personal criticism because he knows me well enough, but he did little more than tell us what had occurred in the organisational review programme and the reasons for it.  There is nothing wrong with what he said about these issues, nothing I can criticise.  He gave the House an account of the two tranches of the published reports and told us what the programme was to promote.  He also treated the research methodology employed in the reports.  No criticism can be made of what he said about any of these matters, as there must be a methodology and with my untutored eye I can see nothing wrong with the one employed.  I reiterate that I do not offer this as a personal criticism of the Minister of State, but only towards the end of his contribution did he mention the report that has been exercising most people since its publication recently.  It deals with the areas mentioned by Senator Ormonde, in particular the Department of Health and Children.  There is a need for us to be frank about what is happening, as Senator Ormonde was.  She might even have gone further, but the Minister of State did not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This is Dublin South camaraderie.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fine thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe so.  From a cursory glance of the report, the issues that emerged and were reported on in the press were much more serious for the Department of Health and Children than the Minister of State was prepared to acknowledge.  Senator Ormonde got closer to what was stated in the report.  The first thing we must do in all debates is be frank and put our finger on the problems.  I thought that was one of the reasons the ORP reports were compiled.  We can have a debate and argument in this Chamber about what to do, but we must all share the data and description of the problem and understand its nature.  </P>
        <P>The report provides a challenging critique in many areas but goes to the heart of the problem in the Department of Health and Children which is, if I may describe it as such, in an existential crisis in regard to its role.  This is not surprising.  Every day of the week Members on both sides stand up in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il to vent their frustration and highlight the difficulties people have with various aspects of the HSE.  This points to a continuing problem in terms of democratic accountability in the provision of health services.</P>
        <P>Some of the public relations concerned with the setting up of the HSE related to the fact that many meetings were held throughout the country to which people travelled and for which they claimed expenses, that it was all too local with too much so-called backyard stuff and so <Col N="943"/>on, and that the service needed to be professionalised and put on a proper footing, as had been done in other countries.  While I do not want to express a view on whether there were abuses in local health boards, we have thrown away an amazing amount of potential democratic accountability of our health services, given that the HSE has become such an enormous monster.  I hear this being said daily by colleagues on both sides of the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Two years ago the then head of the HSE was invited in to answer questions from Deputies and Senators, an exercise which I do not believe has been repeated.  I described this as a spectacle because elected public representatives were vying, with their hands up, to ask questions of the head of the HSE about particular concerns they had in their respective constituencies.  That is no way to manage health, which is still the biggest voted expenditure in the public service.  Reducing public representatives to people vying to get their &ldquo;spake&rdquo; in, as it were, at this public meeting told a big story, namely, that we have a genuine and serious problem in dealing with our health service and matching the need for democratic input, involvement and argument with the provision of health services</P>
        <P>It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the ORP discovered five years on that the people working in the Department of Health and Children had yet to come to grips with managing the HSE.  I know Senator Ormonde said that things do not happen overnight, but there are many nights in five years.  If they have not got to grips with it yet, when will they?</P>
        <P>Even if we park the partisan aspect for a moment, there is a genuine problem we must address, and that is what is coming out in this report.  It is quite damning of the Department of Health and Children and goes much further than the Minister of State is prepared to go in what it has to say about the allocation of staff being uneven, the issue of staff morale, the confusion among staff about the role of the Department, the lack of clarity around who the Department&rsquo;s customers are, coupled with the feeling of being constantly under fire politically and in the media, and so on.  It does not surprise me that this issue exists with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>That brings me to the second point I want to make and to which I have referred.  The real story is what we are going to do with all these reports.  I am not resiling from saying the reports are important, but what happens next?  I would expect this debate to be about what happens next.  That is why I am mildly critical of the speech because there was virtually nothing about what happens next other than in the last couple of sentences which referred to the look back process the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, is to initiate.   If we are going to have a serious debate, by all means distribute the report.  We can read the report, look at the back and see the methodology.  We can find out all these things, but then we want the Minister to say what the Government will do in these matters.  Sadly, we have been told very little today about what will occur as a result of these reports.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I am not sufficiently well-informed about the Department of Health and Children to know whether it has produced the action plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>It has.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been published.  I thank the Minister of State because I was not aware of that.  A better focus for today&rsquo;s debate in that case would be to table the action plan of the Department of Health and Children to let us see what the Minister of State and the Department intend to do about all these issues.</P>
        <P>It is important we have these debates and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  While the reports are important, they are only the starting point.  They should not be the full debate, merely what facilitates it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="944"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The second report of the organisational review programme is interesting in terms of the four agencies it has chosen.  I refer to them in an order different from the report and will refrain from alluding to the elephant in the room until last.  We should start in a positive sense.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, highlight best practice in the area.  We should recognise the improvements made in both organisations in recent years and put them forward as models for how other areas of the public service can be improved.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, I believe the CSO, which is based in Cork, is the only positive example of the relocation programme.  I have always had difficulty in describing it as &ldquo;decentralisation&rdquo; since in essence this is not a matter of moving from Dublin to another part of the country but rather about distributing the services.  The CSO, however, was the only national organisation that could be moved to an out-of Dublin location and could still perform the same functions, as it has continued to do excellently.  If any lesson is to be learned from such office relocation it is that it has been the wrong type of decentralisation.  Having an office in Sligo and one in Longford for social welfare while maintaining centralised activities is not decentralisation.  I hope future ORP reports will investigate how we might have offices throughout the country dealing with the local regions in the areas of social welfare as well as, perhaps, health and education.</P>
        <P>The decision announced yesterday by the T&aacute;naiste concerning the VECs is welcome.  I am not sure whether a reduction from 33 to 16 is sufficient in review terms but it points things in the right direction.  I hope the lesson that was not learned from the amalgamation of the health boards into the HSE, whereby everyone was reallocated to new positions, is not repeated with the VECs.  It is an important lesson we cannot afford to overlook.</P>
        <P>The report referred to the Property Registration Office which, in a sense, is somewhat in abeyance as it is subject to reviews elsewhere.  It might be reviewed differently, perhaps, from the Land Registry and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  The report is useful in highlighting what the office does well and could do better in a more expanded, streamlined structure.</P>
        <P>The essential elements we need to learn from the ORP are where the critical mass lies and where economies of scale may be achieved.  That is where we come to the sore thumb, as it were, in this particular report.  It is no great joy to describe the Department of Health and Children in such a way.  I believe several Departments are not fit for purpose, not solely because of structure but also because of culture.  There is a mindset prevalent among many decent, well-meaning, well-serving civil servants to the effect that change needs to be slowed down and challenged.  We have suffered from this in the past.  The Department of Health and Children is one of the Departments that have been too slow to recognise the need for change.  I hope the organisational review programme and the need to put its own action plan together will overcome many of the anomalies in the future.</P>
        <P>One of the main difficulties has been that it is still well-served in terms of personnel.  Several hundred people work in the Department of Health and Children for the sole purpose of producing policy.  This has very little linkage with the actual delivery of health services.  That is the role of the Health Service Executive, which many of us in public life have come to believe has failed in its reorganisation.  Questions need to be asked about the best way of reorganising, whether it is to set up a new structure or reintegrate with the Department of Health and Children.  Given the personnel within the Department of Health and Children, I would argue there is a better fit in bringing the health service back into central government and making use of personnel there rather than reinventing the wheel and creating new health boards.</P>
        <P>That said, there are two levels in which the health services need to be provided.  Community and primary care are best provided within local areas.  Where health boards were successful was in delivering such requisite services.  Economies of scale are needed, however, in terms of <Col N="945"/>large facilities and the specialist policies that have been put in place for cancer care and other forms of specialised delivery.  That would embrace the role of bodies such as Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in terms of how hospitals are built, their location and the type of services they provide.</P>
       
        <P>Our organisation of the health service, instead of trying to lump everything into the HSE, should be in two different directions.  We should absorb some aspects of the health service back into the Department of Health and Children, have a national body solely concerned with large-scale health facilities, and re-allocate to various forms of local government the delivery of primary and community care in this country.  Once we come up with that formula, we will have overcome many of the difficulties we have in the delivery of services.  This will increase accountability and the involvement of public representatives, which will result in increased public confidence in the system.  I hope the net result of this review will be that this lesson is learned.  I look forward to the next reports and action arising therefrom.  Any changes in our health service can also be applied in the delivery of social welfare, education and many other public services.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">There is a major mismatch between personnel and positions at the moment, with many able public servants in the wrong places, doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons.  The spending of vast sums of public money is not being done correctly.  Based on the report we are discussing, as well as others such as the McCarthy report and the White Paper on local government, I hope we will get the answers we need in the coming years which will enable us to fill in the gaps.  After 90 years of the State&rsquo;s history, there are too many gaps.  Perhaps the greatest mistake we made was in failing to change a Civil Service that was largely colonial in its make-up and never adapted to Irish conditions, even though the country itself has gone through several changes in its administration and form of government.  I hope the debate in this House will be informed by these lessons, and I know many Members will express impatience for action on reports such as this.</P></Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is funny that today we seem to be speaking about the same topics, in which I have an interest.  The publication of the organisational review programme is welcome, particularly in the context of our discussion this morning on the Croke Park agreement.  I mirror the comment of Senator White that the important thing is where we go from here.  This is probably a greater challenge than identifying the issues.  If one speaks to two or three people in any group, they can all tell one what are the problems.  It is much more difficult to obtain a consensus on how achieve a solution.</P>
        <P>Like any other report, this one acknowledges what has and has not been done well and, on the whole, the organisations and Departments involved in the exercise are credited with embracing technology in running their operations.  IT is constantly involving and, therefore, it is of the utmost importance that investment in the latest technologies is supported and encouraged.  I mentioned that when I first came to the House I had come from a school environment with every technological advance at my fingertips, but there was little here, although that has changed since.</P>
        <P>Access to public services is the cornerstone of any democracy, but access for younger generations can be technologically led, particularly in comparison to decades past.  Clearly, substantial strides have been made in this regard.  However, much remains to be done in realising the full potential of IT within Departments and various agencies of the State.  One of the issues that is always raised is that of duplication.  Even though one Department has put all of the information into its system, it cannot be transferred from one computer to another.  For example, if a person who is working in Northern Ireland but living in Donegal becomes pregnant and wishes to apply for maternity benefit, the relevant information must be obtained from <Col N="946"/>the UK, and is then put on the system in Donegal.  However, if she tries to apply for maternity benefit again in the future, she will have to go back to square one, even though the information is close by.  The logic of linking IT systems is obvious.</P>
        <P>While it is imperative to grasp all that technology has to offer, I am conscious that for many people technology is a totally alien concept.  Therefore, a balance must be struck between embracing technology and ensuring that all clients have adequate access to services.  While the report today credits the agencies as generally having a good record of customer service, we must ensure no one feels alienated or restricted in accessing information.  I refer in particular to older people who through no fault of their own do not have sufficient IT skills to interact with many of the online services currently being offered.  Also, in some cases broadband services are not as available as they should be.</P>
        <P>I must also mention people with a disability who wish to work or access services.  I have a new intern who will not, I think, be embarrassed if I mention that he has a sight impairment, and it was in working with him that I realised the importance of the technology that is available.  His ability is much greater than his disability, and the difference made by technology, for both employees and service users, has highlighted its importance, even over the last day or two.</P>
        <P>It is crucial to ensure that all sections of society have the ability to access the same level of services through traditional means.  This means there should be face-to-face contact or the possibility of picking up the phone and talking to a real person rather than an automated system.  This is still as relevant as it was a decade ago.  When it comes to making cuts in budgets in the future, spending on customer service must be protected as much as possible.  This cannot be forgotten about.  My great fear is that because a service is available online or through some gadget, the human touch will be removed as the box is ticked.</P>
        <P>The reforms we all crave in the public service need to be customer-centred and not purely an accounting exercise.  It is my firm belief that savings can be found while protecting the public&rsquo;s access to services.  We could follow the example of the UK, where the doors of centres for public services have been opened on Saturday mornings and certain evenings.  This could instantly improve access for all as well as reducing lengthy waiting lists across the board.  To allow it to happen, however, there must be co-operation among all agencies and their personnel.  The discussion this morning on the Croke Park agreement is relevant here.  Such co-operation will not be easily obtained; however, it is required.  The current systems within the public service are not performing adequately for the personnel involved or for the public.</P>
        <P>When reading the report this morning, I was not surprised to learn that morale is low among public servants in some of the agencies.  This is a well-documented fact.  The question is whether we are going to do anything to tackle it.  The majority of people agree that the way to introduce reforms is with a motivated workforce, as was mentioned earlier, although the report clearly states this is not currently the case.  There is a vicious circle in this regard.  In my region, there was a problem last week when the county council sent out a notification that people were three months late in paying their second home tax.  People were charged &euro;20 per month, that is &euro;60 extra, for being late.  Of course, an avalanche of people then complained that they had not realised the due date was July because they had paid the tax in October of last year.  Had the notification come out three weeks before the closing date, rather then three months afterwards with a penalty of &euro;60, the avalanche of criticism would not have occurred.  The people within the system must work within the system that is there, while the public complains about the lack of service.</P>
        <P>I can understand that public servants are frustrated by the constraints put on them by systems.  They are at the coalface every day and they have an insight we can only dream of. <Col N="947"/> The lack of motivation in these agencies is bound to become steadily worse if resources become scarcer.  Resources are important at the moment, but money is also tight.  Therefore, we need to interact differently with public servants if we want to see an increase in motivation and thus productivity.  This is a goal we must all desire to achieve as soon as possible.  The necessary policies and frameworks need to be put in place to make sure this is recognised.  Again, I refer to the debate on the Croke Park agreement.  One realistic and simple step to improve spirits within the service would be to foster and develop the relationship between people at management level and those below.  This report seems to identify the gulf that exists between the two elements, which is undoubtedly contributing to the chronic lack of morale.  The responsibility for this falls at the door of management.  Managing personnel is a basic role of any manager.  The report suggests managers and agencies are failing in this duty to a certain extent.  Therefore, the question needs to be asked if enough pressure is being exerted on managers to perform the function.  That brings me back to the main point I made this morning.  There is a need for leaders to lead in as charismatic a fashion as possible.  Is there a chance managers at the very top have been included in the Croke Park deal but have failed to feed its provisions down the chain to the lower ranks?  Managers voted on the agreement and must sign up to it, but have people at the top forgotten their duty to continuously sell the message to those at the grassroots?</P>
        <P>I welcome the report.  I would like to add further comments, but as time is short, I wish the Government well with other reports in the same vein.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very grateful for all of the contributions made.  I have a couple of specific points to make in conclusion.  It is interesting that we have had this debate today in conjunction with that on the Croke Park agreement.  Perhaps the Seanad could have decided the preferred order.  Having listened to some of the contributions, we know that if we do not change the way we do things, we know what the outcomes will be.  If we continue to deliver programmes in exactly the same way and have inputs without change, we will have the same outputs.  This programme provides the basis on which change can occur.  Everyone agrees that we must have change and this is the research that facilitates some of it.  In that respect, the debates today are timely because there is a common theme.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White said that in my opening contribution I was not specific enough on the second report.  That is a fair point, but the statements are on the programme, as well as the second report.  That is important because the second report is only one specific element.  Four organisations are reviewed in the report, but the programme will review every Department between now and 2012.  Yes, it comes up with reviews, action plans and proposals, but it is preferable in this respect that there is a wider debate.  This is not just a snapshot but a programme and a process over an extended period, covering all Departments, as part of which they will be reviewed individually and there will be specific action plans, the implementation of which will be measured.  That is important.  I am glad, therefore, that the debate is about a little more than just the second report.</P>
        <P>Senator Phelan spoke about the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, an organisation for which I have a lot of appreciation, especially since my time as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, when I got to understand its workings.  The Senator spoke about the risk attached to foreign investments and things that had happened in the past.  I have noticed that the Revenue Commissioners have improved their practices in risk profiling and random audits and that the challenge is not to do more of the same but to keep pace with what is happening.  The Senator makes an interesting point about the challenges posed to the organisation, given the fact that key staff have moved on.  It is not peculiar to the Revenue Commissioners but is <Col N="948"/>occurring right across the private and public sectors, when people acquire certain skills which are lost to an organisation when they move.  As a result of the review, the Revenue Commissioners are putting in place a programme aimed at greater internal mobility, offering greater skills to a greater number of staff in order that the level of dependence on one key person will not be as great.  The Department of Health and Children which is also the focus of the second report is bringing forward a similar mobility plan for its staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many comments were made about the Department of Health and Children.  Particular concern was expressed about governance procedures and so on.  The Department has an action plan and undertakes to strengthen governance of directly funded agencies.  I indicated there were about 30 agencies involved, between the HSE and other agencies.  This will include the early development of a memorandum of understanding between the Department and the HSE to give greater clarity to their respective roles.  I understand this is to be agreed by the end of the year.  The action plan is time-bound and specific outcomes have been targeted.  It was not just a review to identify the issues, the identification of issues was to be followed by an action plan.  It is a pity Senator Alex White is not here to hear me say this.  The action plan for the Department is time-bound and the next phase is to monitor its implementation.</P>
        <P>The core objective of the programme is to assess the capacity of organisations and, based on these assessments, to bring about improvements, where necessary, and champion best practice.  The team conducting the reviews has been struck by the commitment of staff at all levels to the process.  In every Department and Office reviewed to date the willingness of management and staff to participate in interviews and workshops has been exemplary.  This has been the case with all stakeholders and customers.  There were over 340 engagements in the second round reviews.  In addition, the response rates to the staff surveys are well ahead of what one might expect in such surveys. For example, the response rates to the second round surveys ranged from 67% to 74% across the four organisations reviewed.  That is a clear indication of the willingness of staff to participate in identifying improvements and best practice and engage in the process.  The figures demonstrate clearly that the staff and customers of Departments and major Offices are eager to see improvements and appreciate their views being sought.  The key lesson is that change and innovation should be regarded as inclusive processes.  The deeper the consultation, the more sustainable the change process will be.</P>
        <P>My second main point is about sharing information on best practice.   Across all of the organisations reviewed to date the ORP team has found examples.  In my statement I referred to the chapter in the second report on ICT best practice guidelines.  The Property Registration Authority and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners were found to be leaders in the development and application of ICT-based solutions.  A core reason for this is that management at all levels in these organisations understands the capacity of ICT as a powerful business tool.  That mindset opens up opportunities, be it in management information systems, on-line customer service delivery or automated back-end processing.  The ORP team also surfaced high quality customer services.  For example, there is good consultation in the Central Statistics Office when major changes to statistical outputs are being planned.  The names and contact details of staff are printed on all statistical releases and staff are available to speak to users after press conferences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A third key point relates to human resource management.  The ORP reviews show there is considerable scope for improvement in the management of people in Departments and Offices.  In particular, the flexible allocation and redeployment of staff and the better management of performance are seen as especially challenging.  Change in these areas will require focused actions at organisational and public service wide levels.</P><Col N="949"/>
        <P>I would like to refer briefly to the measurement of performance.  This can be especially challenging in some public sector organisations, especially policy-making Departments.  Nonetheless, it is important that senior management leads an invigorated effort to improve the measurement of performance.  This should be done with reference to outcomes, as well as international benchmarks of best practice.</P>
        <P>There was a very valuable debate earlier today on the Croke Park agreement, in which the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, heard Senators&rsquo; views.  The agreement presents many challenges to the public service and will require concerted and effective responses.  By enhancing the capacity of Departments and Offices, we can ensure greater levels of productivity and the more efficient use of resources.  For these reasons, the organisational review programme has an important enabling role to play in facilitating transformational change in the public service.  I do not believe one goes into a Department or an agency and introduce change.  It has to be founded on research.  The research findings identified in the ORP report form the basis for change by developing best practice and through the greater use of ICT.</P>
        <P>I again thank Senators for their valuable contributions to both debates.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann welcomes the announcement that a new National Advocacy Service for people with disabilities is to be set up to provide independent, representative advocacy services for people with disabilities from January 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  This is a very important step forward for people with disabilities and I welcome its announcement.  As Members may be aware, there had been a recommendation to establish such a service for people with disabilities, which led to approximately 46 pilot schemes being operated throughout the country.  Following a review of those pilot schemes recommendations were made, a number of which have been taken on board by the Minister in his announcement.  Significantly, the pilot scheme demonstrated that where advocates were put in place it was possible for them to gain an understanding of services for people with disabilities, to support those people to understand their entitlements, to draw together the range of services they need to support them in moving from institutional living into the community and to support them in their interactions with their families.  In other words there was an opportunity for people with disabilities for the first time to have access to somebody who was completely on their side, who was only there for them, and whose only motivation and interest was the well-being of the person with whom they were working, which is very significant.  Despite the very tough economic times, it is very welcome for the Minister to be able to announce that it is still intended to proceed in January 2011 with establishing this national service.</P>
        <P>We are all very aware &mdash; none more so than the Members of this House &mdash; that people with disabilities can get left behind or forgotten about.  The establishment of a national advocacy service will help to counteract this.  A number of points were made in the review of the 46 pilot schemes, including comments about geographical services and organisational structure, and I have no doubt the Minister intends to take them on board.  However, I was particularly struck by the comments in the report regarding the way complex cases could be dealt with.  One of the issues that highlights is that, at the time, it had not been possible to implement one of the <Col N="950"/>original recommendations, namely, the establishment of a personal advocacy service which would seek to work with individuals who would have either a complex case or complex needs.  I note in the Minister&rsquo;s announcement and in details we have been able to glean so far that the Minister is indicating that it is intended that aspects of this personal advocacy service will be incorporated.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the form that will take and the way we might see it come into action when replying.</P>
        <P>One of the original recommendations would have pointed to a programme of community visitors for people in residential settings with cognitive intellectual disabilities.  These are a particularly vulnerable group of people.  I welcome the role that the national advocacy service will have the potential to play for those people.  We all know of individuals who are living either in community group home settings or in institutional settings who perhaps do not have any visitors from one end of the year to another.  I refer to visitors who are specific to them and who come in to say &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; to them and see how they are doing.  That applies as much to community group homes as it does to institutional settings.</P>
        <P>Originally, when we moved towards de-institutionalisation and established community group homes we spoke about community group homes as if they were the panacea to everything.  We know they are not.  In many cases, even with the best intentions, they have ended up becoming mini-institutions in the community where people do not necessarily know their neighbours or interact with their community.</P>
        <P>One of the dangers of that, particularly for people with intellectual disabilities, is the isolation.  One can be in the heart of the community and still be isolated.  Having a situation where advocates can be appointed and can visit, and whose sole interest is the person with an intellectual disability, is a powerful protection.</P>
        <P>In the past number of years, because of the number of sad, traumatic and profoundly disturbing cases of abuse across the board that have come to our attention, we must be aware that people with intellectual disabilities are particularly vulnerable.  The role of an advocate is an added protection measure.  Having somebody who is not part of the system come in and out of a place changes the dynamic and increases the protection available.  I note that we are able to do this within existing resources because of the way we will organise it and that points to something that is very important.</P>
        <P>Sometimes the work we need to undertake in the area of disabilities is not all about money.  There is much work that needs to be done, particularly if we are to see the purpose of this through to its end.  This is only the starting point.  If we want an advocacy service to work as effectively as we intend it to, we must address a number of other issues.  I do not have time to go into them now but there are two in particular that I ask the Minister to raise with his colleagues.</P>
        <P>The first is the need for the Mental Capacity and Guardianship Bill to come before the House.  Without that Bill, any advocate who is acting in good faith on behalf of somebody with a disability, particularly with an intellectual disability, will come up against barriers on occasions that they do not need to come up against.  There are certain basic rights the Minister and I take for granted that people with intellectual disabilities cannot access currently because of our outdated laws regarding their status in our society.</P>
        <P>On the day the Minister made this announcement he made a striking comment.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The new National Advocacy Service will give a voice to people with disabilities who are isolated in the community or who are living in residential institutions and who cannot rep<Col N="951"/>resent themselves.  The Service will protect their rights, help them gain their entitlements, obtain a fair hearing and make positive changes in their quality of life.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is an important statement but if we want to deliver on that, the Mental Capacity and Guardianship Bill must follow this measure.  It is such important legislation it must come before us in sufficient time to allow us consider it and debate it.  It will have to link in with many other existing pieces of legislation.  It will be extraordinarily complex but it is necessary if we are serious about people with disabilities taking their equal role as citizens in our society.</P>
        <P>The second issue that must be addressed is the supports we put in place for vulnerable adults within the criminal justice system.  In terms of wanting an advocate to come in and play their role, and particularly in complex cases, if it is a case that there is something untoward or if a vulnerable adult has been exposed to either a criminal act or to an act that has done them wrong and we want to take it further, there are no supports currently within the criminal justice system to do that.  An advocate can go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on behalf of a vulnerable adult and I guarantee that in 99 cases out of 100, it will stand still because we have not put the measures in place within the system that will support people with disabilities either to be witnesses, to give evidence or even to have their story taken credibly.  I am aware that we cannot put those supports in place without having the Mental Capacity and Guardianship Bill in place but these are important protections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a life-changing juncture we brought in extensive, realistic and practical supports that allowed children who were victims of abuse engage and interact with the criminal justice system.  It gave them the support they needed to give their statements to the Garda and to give testimony within the courts system.  We must be doing something similar with vulnerable adults because currently they fall between the two stools.  With that will come all the other additional supports and training that garda&iacute;, for example, will need to have to allow them take their statements.</P>
        <P>In seeking to ensure that the most fundamental and basic of rights are afforded to somebody with disabilities so they can take their place as an equal citizen within our society, it is not all about money.  There are actions we could be taking currently within the political system that could have a profound and real impact on people&rsquo;s day to day quality of life.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on the announcement.  I see it as an important step forward but to ensure it achieves its potential we must follow up on what happens to the advocates afterwards.  When replying I would appreciate if the Minister could provide some additional details on the points I mentioned earlier.</P>

        <P LI="2">condemns the Government for:</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />failing to put the National Standards for the inspection of disability residential services, published by HIQA in May 2009, on a statutory footing;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />slashing budgets to voluntary organisations providing vital services for people with disabilities under the guise of &lsquo;efficiency savings&rsquo; and HSE cost saving measures; and</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is1p4- ?><?oasys _ix ?>calls on the Government to prioritise the interests of people with disabilities and to publish their priorities for the implementation of the National Disability Strategy.&rsquo;&rsquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  In moving this amendment I say, with a touch of irony, that the Government is establishing a national advocacy service for people with disabilities when, under all current legislation, it has failed to recognise the basic rights and entitlements of people with a disability.  While this new national advocacy service will provide independent and representative advocacy for people with a disability, it will have few, if any, statutory powers with regard to resource allocation, effecting change at governmental policy level or at the implementation of policy at the Health Service Executive level.</P>
        <P>I listened to Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s contribution and noted her words but again we see Government attempting to introduce measures for the most vulnerable and marginalised in society on the cheap.  That is the reality.  I say that as somebody who comes to this debate with a strong family involvement in disability organisations and who is personally involved as a member.</P>
        <P>The fundamental task for all of us is to uphold the rights of all of our citizens but for value for money purposes this new service will be unfurled in 2011 under current resources.  It means there will be little to go around.  The Federation of Voluntary Bodies talks about the rights of adults with disability and families with children to direct their own supports and have access to resources to run their own lives.  It is disappointing, when we talk about equal citizenship and the task force in 2007, that we have lost sight of the needs of a group in our society.  If we look at the history, this was first promised in 2004 under the Comhairle Act and subsequently under the Citizens Information Act 2007.  We were told it would be delivered in 2008 but we must now wait until 2011.</P>
        <P>It is important we would welcome the eventual roll-out of the service as it will offer freedom and choice to people with disabilities.  There are almost 400,000 people with disabilities in Ireland, 24% of whom are unable to carry out everyday activities and are dependent on full-time care.  There is a large young population with intellectual disability, and it is important to stress that such people are living longer and, therefore, demands are increasing on organisations and families while resources are limited.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have neglected the most important sectors of our society.  The Irish saying, duine le Dia, is a great one.  At a time of boom, we did not eliminate the barriers which existed.  It is important we allow people with disabilities to access services and allow them to have under<Col N="953"/>standing, proper resources, enhanced public transport, information and knowledge, many of which have not been addressed properly by Government over the years.  Will this be addressed in a meaningful way by the establishment of this service?</P>
        <P>If we are so committed, why do we need a national advocacy service in the first place?  I am sure the Minister in his reply will refer to the substantial investment by Government in the resourcing of different issues and areas of service.  There has been a denial of rights and entitlements over the years by Government.  We have not explained and communicated in proper language what people are entitled to.  Many of our schemes are very bureaucratic and people are intimidated and afraid.  Regardless of whether we like it, that is the reality.  We have not listened to people when they have spoken up and been a voice.  We have forced people to go to court to get their basic rights and entitlements.</P>
        <P>In 2008, Deirdre Carroll of Inclusion Ireland said, &ldquo;it is a great disappointment that the Government has decided to cut back the public advocacy service&rdquo;, this at a time when we had boom and bloom.  She continued: &ldquo;It is a pity that one of Minister Hanafin&rsquo;s first acts in her new Ministerial role was to cut a vital service for people with a disability.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>It is about trust.  The Government has failed people with disabilities.  There are many issues we must address in terms of the models of service delivery in the context of mainstreaming, professionalism, specialisation, models of service, partnership and best practice innovation.  Is the current proposal too broad?  We have a crisis of massive proportions in the disability sector.  The Minister should listen to the groups we meet regularly, the parents and carers who are present today and the Disability Federation of Ireland, which will be in the Houses tomorrow.  There are a plethora of issues regarding whether there are enough training places for vocational post-leaving certificate students.  The students and their parents will argue there are not.  Service placement does not seem to be evolving in a meaningful way and there is a constant battle to get residential places for respite care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Parents are asked to go to the nth degree for their loved ones &mdash; their sons, daughters and family members &mdash; yet we are putting barriers in their way.  I know of a woman in her 70s whose husband weighs more than 20 stone but she got nothing from the State by way of home help or care except a commode.  All Members could tell stories of people who have been left behind and neglected.  If we are advocating independent living, let us have real independent living provision, supports and structures in place.  Let us have a proper home care package of which people can avail.  Let us examine the issue of dental provision for people with disability, for example, in Cork, where people are unable to access dental care under anaesthetic.  Let us deal with the waiting lists for LTOT and psychology services.</P>
        <P>We have many vibrant people with disabilities who want to live an independent life.  They do not want to be condemned to a life of handicap but want to live a full, open, active and equal life of citizenship.  We as a State are not letting them do so.  We are reducing budgets.  It should not be all about money.  It must be about people and about doing our best for those who need us the most &mdash; the marginalised and the vulnerable.  I remind the Minister and his colleagues that it was their slogan in 1987 that cutbacks hurt the old, the poor and the handicapped.  It is ironic that today, in 2010, we are back to that again.  We seem to have learned nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I welcome the Minister.  I listened with interest to the words of Senator Corrigan, who is always very helpful in the area of disability.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the issue of disability as being broader than simply the need for a personal advocacy service.  I concur with Senator Buttimer to some extent that the need for a personal <Col N="954"/>advocacy service will tell us how dependent people with disabilities are, although I fully accept the service is intended to ensure they can be given an even break and to level the playing field in order that they become independent.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities are a highly differentiated population with varying ranges of abilities and disabilities and a vast range of needs.  One fact that is glaring is that 90% of people with disabilities are unemployed, so they are a group which is always at high risk of poverty.  This struck me strongly three or four years ago during the boom when a deaf girl came to me looking to get work.  Even though there was high employment, she, among others, was very much at risk.</P>
        <P>The experience I encounter in my constituency office is a cycle of depression, anxiety and disability resulting in a feeling of helplessness, although not necessarily in that order.  The reliance on service provision is huge and this impacts on the individual user and his or her family.  In an environment of budgetary cuts, people with disabilities have less capacity to recover from cuts.  Life has severely stalled for them in many cases and, by definition, people with disability are excluded from mainstream participation in life &mdash; from employment, in some cases from transport, from housing and from education.  I will elaborate shortly with regard to education.  Progress has been made for people with disabilities, which I have noticed and acknowledge.  Access to public buildings has improved, building regulations are more cognisant of people&rsquo;s needs, there are taxis for the disabled and even the kerbs have been improved to allow people to access footpaths.  That said, places such as Mervue in Galway city still do not have the kerbs to make footpaths more easily accessible for people in wheelchairs.</P>
        <P>Generally, the level of service progress and speed of delivery has been worse than anticipated.  In the first decade of this century there was a massive debate about rights-based legislation for people with disabilities.  Customer experience is not consistent throughout the country.  For example, people with disabilities in Galway city cannot use all the buses.  The public advocacy service was due to be delivered in 2008 but it is now due in 2011.  Three years is a considerable period of time.  The national disability strategy is driven by individual service user needs, and satisfaction will depend on the complexity of their needs and how those needs are met.  A person with a physical disability who is incapable of independent living could need many personal assistant hours but, with current resourcing, this person is unlikely to get the hours he or she requires.  His or her disability becomes more embedded as a result.</P>
        <P>The main point that must be made is that service providers are under extraordinary levels of stress to maintain services.  The Minister will be aware of this from Enable Ireland Galway and the Brothers of Charity in Galway.  When budgetary cuts occur, funding must first go to paying wages.  This might be of least apparent benefit to the person with a disability.  It might be the personal assistant service that will be cut first, and that might have been the single element of support that most enhanced the life of the person with a disability.</P>
        <P>I broadly welcome the public advocacy service.  I have had recent experience of seeing an advocate advocating on behalf of a person who was very unhappy in her residential home in Galway.  The advocate was very independent and worked for the person with disability but despite the advocate&rsquo;s best work, the person still remains unhappy.  The main thing is that the service is available.  I support that work.  Will the Minister clarify what aspects of the public advocacy service will definitely be implemented in 2011?  Has funding been set aside in the budget for it?  Is it dependent on such funding?  Will staff be appointed given the embargo on public service recruitment?  I note the number of staff that are needed in various geographical regions of the country.</P><Col N="955"/>
        <P>Very little of the national disability strategy which was announced in 2004 has been realised.  What has this meant in reality?  I have been speaking to the Brothers of Charity and they would say the disability strategy is dead in the water.  It is still policy but it is not backed up by funding.  The main thrust of the strategy was to provide resources to meet people&rsquo;s needs and to move to seamless service provision, be it in housing, transport or health.  This costs money.  The strategy is great in theory but has led to disappointment among many users.</P>
        <P>I will elaborate in more detail on the deferral of the implementation of the Education for People with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act which applies to children and young adults, and the failure to publish a costed, multi-annual plan for its implementation.  I spoke to the then Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and to subsequent Ministers about this.  The Act still has not been fully implemented.  This is a great disservice to and crime against children and young people with disabilities.  Children are not getting adequate access to supports, such as the psychological supports required to provide assessments, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  Most of the school age services provided by the Brothers of Charity are for children in mainstream schools.  The striking fact is that, at present, 200 children are not getting an adequate level of service to meet their needs because the EPSEN Act has not been implemented.  As a result, there is an increase in the number of applications to special needs schools.  This is not Government policy but can one blame the parents for seeking appropriate education when the supports do not exist in mainstream education?  I certainly do not blame them.  It is the Government&rsquo;s fault that parents are now applying to special needs schools.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by referring to the individual education plans, IEPs.  They are not fully in place in law.  There is something similar in place at present but it is not in accordance with the terms set out in the EPSEN Act.  This is according to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, this morning.  Schools are using the IEP guidelines as set out by the NCSE.  They are just guidelines, however, and are not on a statutory footing under the EPSEN Act.  As long as this is the case, children with disabilities will continue to get a raw deal in education.  I have much personal experience of this.  I look forward to hearing that the Minister will address the EPSEN Act and the IEPs.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; as ucht an deis c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoin &aacute;bhar seo sa Seanad.  I hate confrontational politics for the sake of it, but at times it is important to spell out some basic facts.  There is a total contradiction in a party leader saying they would take &euro;3 billion from current spending instead of &euro;1 billion from the capital budget and &euro;2 billion from current spending, as was discussed previously, while the party&rsquo;s members incessantly seek in the House extra current expenditure.  When I was going to school there were fairly simple rules in mathematics.  While I might not be a genius in many things, I studied mathematics in university and no matter how far I went, the basic laws of mathematics applied.  One cannot take away &euro;3 billion and suddenly have a heap of money in one&rsquo;s pocket.  We would all love to add to services; I know no one in politics who would not like to provide better services.  It is time for those who say they wish to add to every service to show us in the Estimates where they would make the alternative cuts to raise the money to do that.  In the case of the Senator&rsquo;s party, it told us not to cut the capital budget, which means an extra &euro;1 billion on the current expenditure side.  If the Senator&rsquo;s party does not show us the alternative cuts, it is not being up-front about what it is trying to do.</P>
        <P>With regard to the HSE, the Senator is aware we had a meeting in Galway.  HSE west has a statutory duty to run the services.  I organised for all Members of the Oireachtas in Galway and Roscommon to meet representatives of the HSE.  Despite that meeting and many others, I still do not have a clear direction from those Members of the Oireachtas on their budget alternatives.</P>

	<P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in was there too.  As Senator Healy Eames knows, because I was very clear about it on the day we met them, I believe there is an obligation, and I will continue fighting for this both publicly and privately, that we be given a clear outline of the choices.  I believe, and I am sure the Senator will concur because the Fine Gael Party previously had a major policy on savings in the public service, there are ways of cutting costs without cutting front-line services.  Our first duty as politicians is to examine how we can cut costs without affecting such services.  We found ways of doing it in other sectors.  It involves analysing everything and considering whether it is now best practice in the 2010 context.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue we are discussing today, there was a pilot scheme.  As Minister, I believed it was my first duty not to have an interregnum or uncertainty, during which doubts were created in people&rsquo;s minds, between the end of the pilot scheme and the start of a permanent dispensation and provision.  I received two letters from people saying they were beginning to be worried as to whether I was going to take action.  I had already put everything in place, more or less, before I received those two letters.  I was pleased that we were able to create certainty following on from uncertainty.  A budget has been made available and the service will commence in January 2011.  It is about nine weeks to Christmas and most people take a week off over the Christmas period.  One arrangement ceases at that time and we will move seamlessly on to the new arrangement and in my view that is a satisfactory arrangement in this regard.</P>

        <P>The Department is very supportive of the Citizens Information Board and increased the funding for the agency quite considerably, paying out &euro;46 million to the agency in 2010.  This is testament to the importance attached by the Department to providing information to people.</P>
        <P>The Senator rightly pointed out the importance of advocates.  People sometimes question why politicians act as advocates.  When the well educated and well-off ask me, I have a very simple answer.  I remind them if they were planning to go to court they would engage a solicitor even though they themselves are smart and well-educated; that they would hire an accountant to complete their tax returns.  These professional people are, in effect, acting as advocates on a person&rsquo;s behalf and using expert knowledge to make the best case.  The Department tries to provide resources for those who do not have such resources, using the resources of the State.  I do not expect anyone to be apologetic about getting the support of people with expertise in whatever field is required.</P>
        <P>Under the Comhairle Act 2000, the Citizens Information Board was given responsibility for supporting the provision of information, advice and advocacy services to assist individuals, in particular those with disabilities, in identifying and understanding their entitlements to social and public services.  The importance of information provision and advice cannot be overstated.  As a Minister and public representative, I am very aware that people&rsquo;s rights and entitlements are often dependent on access to good independent advice.  This is particularly relevant to <Col N="957"/>those who are marginalised or who need somebody else to advocate on their behalf.  Under the Citizens Information Act 2007, the CIB received a remit to provide advocacy services to people with disabilities.  The Act defines disability as meaning a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State, by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.  It is important we are all clear about what is meant by advocacy in this regard.  In the context of its legislation, the Citizens Information Board defines advocacy as a means of empowering people by supporting them to assert their views and claim their entitlement and where necessary, representing and negotiating on their behalf.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many people are able to do this to some degree, either for themselves or for friends or family members but in many situations the issues of independence and competence will arise.  Therefore, it is important the advocate is well informed, is knowledgeable about regulations and precedents and is able to act on the wishes or in the best interests of the person with a disability without any tie to a service provider or any conflict of interest.  This independence is crucial and it is the reason the advocacy functions for people with disabilities were devolved to the Citizens Information Board.  The advocacy guidelines 2007 state, &ldquo;delivering a professional advocacy service means providing a trained person who, on the basis of an understanding of a client&rsquo;s needs and wishes, will advise and support that client to make a decision or claim an entitlement and who will, if appropriate, go on to negotiate or make a case for him or her&rdquo;.  This person-centred approach is considered essential by international best practice.  While some level of advocacy support has always been provided by the Citizens Information Board services, additional measures were required to ensure those with a disability are given the advocacy help they need.</P>
        <P>In preparation for the proposed legislation, the CIB commissioned research from Goodbody Economic Consultants.  The report, Developing an Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities, was launched in 2004 by Deputy Mary Coughlan, then Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  The report proposed a three-strand approach: the establishment of a personal advocacy service to deal with critical and complex issues only, to be provided by the CIB in line with the new Act; a programme of support for community and voluntary sector advocacy; and a community visitor programme to focus on people with cognitive disability in residential institutions.  Following the report it was agreed to concentrate on the implementation of the first and second strands.  Arising from the national disability strategy and the Disability Act 2005, the Citizens Information Board was given responsibility to provide advocacy services to people with disabilities under the Citizens Information Act 2007.  The primary purpose of the Act was to establish a personal advocacy service to be delivered directly by the CIB.  Implementation of the Act was deferred by the Government in 2008 due to budgetary constraints.  However, following the publication of the Goodbody report in 2004, the Citizens Information Board began the process of engaging with the community and voluntary sector in order to develop advocacy provision at local level for people with disabilities.  This was in line with the national disability strategy and the proposed citizen information legislation.  By the end of 2009, 46 pilot projects had provided advocacy to more than 5,000 service users.</P>
        <P>In order to measure the effectiveness of the community and voluntary sector advocacy programmes, CIB carried out a major evaluation and case analysis in January 2009.  The evaluation focused on two areas, a case review and analysis and a structural review and analysis.  Before outlining the recommendations of the evaluation report, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the important work by those working in the advocacy projects and all those people on the various advocacy steering committees and on the boards of the Citizens Information Board, who gave their time over the past number of years to help to build up the service.</P><Col N="958"/>
        <P>Part of the process in conducting the evaluation involved meeting with the stakeholders from eight selected projects, facilitating focus groups with more extensive project participation, examining a random selection of case files and tracking 20 live cases.  I also wish to thank those people who were involved in this part of the evaluation and I acknowledge their valuable contribution to the report.</P>
        <P>The finding of the evaluation of the 46 projects identified the significantly positive impact of the programme on people with disabilities and the number of people who benefited from the services provided to date.  The evaluation report also identified a number of weaknesses in the existing service, such as the geographical gaps in the delivery of the service and the fact that some projects were working in isolation.  There was no dedicated management structure and the ability to escalate or deal with complex cases was impaired.  There were no senior advocates within the service.  These issues were addressed in the recommendations of the evaluation report which also set out the future role of advocacy in the community and voluntary sector.  The report recommended a new service that would enhance and protect the independence of the advocate to represent people&rsquo;s disabilities; improve the quality, capacity and level of advocacy response to a point where the service is capable of developing and sustaining itself and is not limited by structural arrangements; demonstrate and communicate the worth and value generated for the money invested and the time given by all involved in the provision of advocacy; and maximise the collaboration and partnership between all stakeholders which is central to the success of the advocates&rsquo; work with service users.  The report recommended increasing the level of diversity among those advising on or working to improve the situation for people with disabilities who use the advocacy service.  This has a direct impact on the quality of the solutions found.  It also recommended building capacity and confidence that the most vulnerable are being reached.  We must ensure the voice of the service user is at the centre, informing the ongoing design of the advocacy service.  The review noted the benefit of having advisory groups with representatives from service providers and service users.  I want this to continue in the new service.</P>
        <P>Regarding the proposed introduction of a personal advocacy service, the report notes that the evaluators found a small number of cases that would have qualified under the personal advocacy service and where the presence of statutory power could have been crucial.  The report also notes that cases pertinent to the personal advocacy service are being dealt with but can be time-consuming owing to the complexity of the issues presented.  It is important we continue to improve the services we deliver.  The evaluation report acknowledges that taking it to the next level and delivering increased value with fewer resources will require change.  A new model of representative advocacy, informed by collaboration and partnership, is required.</P>
        <P>In light of this, with particular emphasis on independence, the report suggests a new structure for the roll-out of advocacy services in the community and voluntary sector.  It recommends bringing together the experience and learning of all stakeholders into a single service, with the ability to provide improved advocacy services to people who need them regardless of location, disability type or level of vulnerability.  The new structure will provide the independent representative advocacy service for people with disabilities that is needed as we move into more challenging times in 2011 and beyond.  It will be regionally structured, with five regional teams replacing the existing pilot projects.  The five regional teams will be managed by the citizens information service in Dublin, Westmeath, Offaly, Waterford and Leitrim but there will be 100% coverage of the territory of the State.</P>
        <P>Some people will not arrive at the citizens information centre seeking assistance so, importantly, the new service will seek out those most vulnerable people with disabilities who cannot self-refer, who are isolated in the community or who are living in residential settings. <Col N="959"/> It will offer an independent advocacy service, which will protect their rights, help them gain their entitlements, obtain a fair hearing and make positive changes to their quality of life.  The new service will help to meet the commitments made in the national disability strategy, in my Department&rsquo;s disability sectoral plans and in the Citizens Information Act 2007, to support and provide direct advocacy services to individuals, in particular those with a disability.</P>
        <P>The new model will see 46 individual pilot projects replaced by five regional teams based within an established citizens information service.  The five teams will work to a national strategy in a co-ordinated way, working closely with the Citizens Information Board and supported by national and local advisory groups made up of key stakeholders.  The new service will be undertaken within current resources and is in accordance with Government policy to provide a more integrated service and give value for money in how services are delivered.  The new service is committed not only to identifying those in need but also building networks locally to ensure all services provided &mdash; governmental, community and voluntary &mdash; are made available to those who require them.  I note that one of the positive outcomes of the review of the pilot project was the benefit of having advisory groups with representatives from several service providers such as my Department, the HSE and local authorities, as well as local representatives of disability groups, such as the Disability Federation of Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, centres for independent living, the National Disability Authority and others.  I want this to continue in the new service.  I welcome the positive response from these stakeholders to the new service and the feedback and commitment given to the Citizens Information Board as it continues to engage with the stakeholders.  In addition, advocacy support workers will be recruited to support the provision of an enhanced mainstream service so that more people with disabilities can access and use the general citizens information services, while the national advocacy service will seek out and respond to more vulnerable people with disabilities.  Along with the new national advocacy service, the provision of these support workers will be undertaken within current resources and will provide a more integrated service while achieving better value for money.  There is much work to be done between now and January 2011 and in the years ahead.  The Citizens Information Board has shown it can meet the challenges, however, and continues to have my support and the support of my Department in achieving these objectives.</P>
        <P>I thank those involved in advocacy pilot projects over recent years, providing assistance to more than 5,000 people.  I am confident a new advocacy service will provide a more professional, independent, mainstream, representative advocacy service and will give a voice to people with disabilities who are isolated in the community or living in residential institutions and cannot represent themselves.  The service will protect their rights, help them gain their entitlements and obtain a fair hearing, and make positive changes in their lives.</P>
        <P>Education was referred to.  Staff resources will be made available and there is no issue with embargoes.  The funding is available and we will get on with the job.  There will be senior advocates and advocates working under them.  It will be well structured.</P>
        <P>Ensuring those with disabilities have access to employment opportunities is dear to my heart.  Many people would prefer to be at work than be idle.  I assure the House I am working hard on that issue.  I have been in contact with groups who represent people with disabilities, especially people who work with others to provide employment.  I hope to bring forward practical ways to enhance access to work for those with disabilities.  This is a basic entitlement.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  T&aacute; an t-&aacute;bhar at&aacute; idir l&aacute;mha againn sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach agus fairsing.  Ba mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar ghn&eacute; amh&aacute;in de leas&uacute; Fhine Gael &mdash; an giota a dh&eacute;anann d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an Acht EPSEN.  I want to focus on that issue.  Members are aware I have raised this on many occasions.  I welcome the <Col N="960"/>Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, who is well aware of the views I shared with her on many occasions.  As a teacher, when the EPSEN Act was published, I thought it was as close as I could have dreamed to the ideal response to special needs education.  I might have written the words in the Act differently but in terms of what it sought to do, I was part of it.  It is not rights-based but is as close to being rights-based as is practical.  The Act suggests that as long as the State can deal with it, it should deal with it in a particular way.</P>
        <P>I received commitments from Ministers about this.  A number of amendments that were important to me were accepted as the Bill was passed.  I thought it was so important that I set up meetings throughout the country and produced information and training documents about the Act so that teachers could understand what it was about, how they should use it and its importance.  That took place in 2005 and it is appalling the Act was never commenced.  The Government has now decided not to commence it for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>This is important because the advocacy issues raised in the motion before the House become less important if the EPSEN Act is in place.  It is important people recognise what is in this.  Parents, a class teacher, a principal or a medical person might identify a special need or a learning problem in a child.  This could then be confirmed by a school principal or class teacher.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Following this was a legal requirement that the child be assessed within a number of months, following which a full assessment had to be presented to the school and the class teacher, if appropriate.  It was also available to the parents and appealable by them if they considered it was incorrect or that there were things wrong with it.  The assessment identified the resources and support the child would need in a learning environment.  It was a requirement for a wide-ranging team of professionals to meet, including psychologists, psychiatrists and various therapists, including speech and language therapists, among others.  They would determine how the child&rsquo;s needs would be dealt with in a school setting.  They brought forward a learning plan referred to by Senator Healy Eames as an individual education plan, IEP.  In essence, it was an <i>ad hoc</i> programme designed to help the individual child to cope with his or her learning difficulties.  It was then determined how the plan would be implemented.  The hope was it would generally be implemented by the class teacher and done over the course of a year, at the end of which the class teacher, the principal teacher and any others whom it was considered necessary would assess whether the child had improved and if the plan had had a positive impact in helping him or her.  If that was not the case, they would rewrite the programme.  If it was considered the school did not have the capacity to deal with the particular needs of the child in putting a programme together, an appeal could be made to one of committees of the National Council for Special Education and it would put a programme together.  At every single stage of the process the parents were involved and an appeals option was built in.  An appeal could be made by the parents, the school authorities or various other named persons.</P>
        <P>There was no need for advocacy in such a system.  Children were brought through it and it fell into place to support them.  It was not particularly expensive because much of it was school based and involved harnessing the skills, professional ability, knowledge and experience of the stated professions.  It was a perfect resource.  It was a case of a child with special needs learning with his or her peers within a school.  I do not wish to use any of the terms used to describe this because they all cause difficulty.  Language deteriorates at an extraordinary rate in the field of special education.  Words in use five years ago are no longer acceptable.  I remember all of them because I am that old and do not use them anymore.  I describe what it is I want to say.  I am talking about children learning with others in their peer group.</P>
        <P>If the Government was to give a commitment to indicating a date for the commencement of the various sections of the EPSEN Act, it would do more for children with special needs than <Col N="961"/>anything else.  I give credit to it for one thing; the one aspect of the Act it has progressed three quarters of the way is the appointment and employment of educational psychologists.  The appropriate number has not been reached, but the Government has gone a long way towards reaching it.  That is useful.  However, the problem is that until the number reaches the level required, the educational psychologists employed will spend all of their time assessing when they can visit schools, classes and support programmes, offer a view and engage with the class teacher, principal teacher and parents, as required.  In that way there is team support working through the system.  I accept an educational psychologist will only visit a school once every couple of weeks, but one must have the numbers required for this to work.</P>
        <P>I deliberately picked out that one aspect and it is a shame that to which I have referred has not been done.  At least, the Government might consider giving a commitment to considering how it might be done.  I will not get into an argument about economies.  The legislation has been in place since 2005 before we got into difficulty.  It might be acceptable for the Minister to argue about economies if the Act had been passed last year, but it has been in place since 2005.  The National Council for Special Education which is subject to many complaints and criticism was given the job by the Government of outlining an action plan for implementation of the Act.  The exercise it carried out could act as a role model in terms of best practice.  It outlined and costed every action point and timeline.  We could well have had the money in 2005, 2006 or 2007, but the Government decided to walk away, which was a shame.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, and I am delighted she is present for this important debate.  I also welcome the national advocacy service which will be introduced in January 2011.  It is important to recognise that it will be a step forward, but nevertheless we should not get carried away.  It is no more than a step in the right direction.  It will not solve all of the problems for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>We have had an interesting debate about adopting a rights-based approach, individual education plans and needs-based assessments.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is correct; there is not a Member in the House who does not wish to move towards the system outlined.  The EPSEN Act is something for which I fought and I welcome the comments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  It is crucial.</P>
        <P>As someone who has been involved in dealing with people with autism, I have seen how early intervention works.  The way individual education plans are produced is far from perfect but early intervention works.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct; it would be progress if we were to obviate the need for advocacy by ensuring people were able to advocate for themselves from an early age by providing a proper speech therapy service or whatever other service is required, as the lack of such services could prevent them advocating for themselves at a later stage.  That said, it is clear there are many people with disabilities who need an advocate.  I presume that is the reason an advocacy service is being provided.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome what the Minister said about ensuring a regional balance.  That is important.  However, I urge him to assess the situation because there is always a great difficulty in providing a service in all parts of the country.  One often finds that geographical realities bite.  I refer to people living on the Aran Islands or in County Donegal, for example.  If a service in County Leitrim was the closest in terms of advocacy, this could present a difficulty, whereas if there was a cluster of advocates in Dublin, the situation would be enhanced.  Therefore, we need to assess the effectiveness of the service that will be introduced in 2011 from the point of view of geographic considerations.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s call for the fast-tracking of the Mental Capacity and Guardianship Bill.  That is important and the Bill should be introduced as soon as possible.</P><Col N="962"/>
        <P>The advocacy service is due to be introduced in January.  We will need to carefully monitor how it is working.</P>
        <P>The point was made to me today that we must look at legislative power to enforce the rights of the advocates.  The rights are centred on the individual with a disability.  I would hate to see a situation where an advocate is refused access to a meeting under any guise.  Advocates must have the same powers under legislation as the person himself or herself.  It is crucial we ensure advocates have proper access to all necessary facilities.</P>
        <P>My party supports the primary care model, where we do all we can within the community.  It is the right way forward in health care and works in other countries.  There must, however, be proper linkage between the primary care teams and the advocates.  Advocacy is not all a matter of health, some of it is a matter of rights, campaigning for those cannot campaign for themselves for basic services.</P>
        <P>It is important we move to a rights-based approach to health.  The Minister spoke about the funding-based approach and we cannot have a system that is not robust when there is a recession.  We must look at the necessary services and it is then a question for Government to ensure those systems are delivered.  If we must cut services because of funding instead of looking at different ways of delivering those services, we will find that services will be put in place and then removed, something no one wants to see.</P>
        <P>We must look at this from the service user&rsquo;s point of view, from a person-centred approach and the rights-based approach.  That does not necessarily mean a person has a right to a huge level of expenditure but that he or she has a right to a service being put in place.  Those are not quite the same, although I accept that funding is always necessary to provide services.</P>
        <P>We should not get carried away with negativity in the disability arena.  We should be positive about people&rsquo;s abilities and about the fact that a new service is being put in place in January 2011.  We should seek to make that work no matter who is in Government in the future.  We should build on what is being achieved in January 2011.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the chance to contribute to this debate.  Everyone has the right to the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health.  I take issue with the Minister, however, when he talks about studying mathematics at university and taking money from the economy.  Services were not improved when the State was awash with money.  I have been involved in politics for 17 years and there are many people whose needs were not met.  Some areas were improved and I welcome that there have been modest improvements.  More needs to be done, however, in children&rsquo;s mental health services and within the education system.</P>
        <P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act was mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I agree with his remarks on it.  We must also deal with the justice and care systems.  Access to health rights and equality of access to care are very important.</P>
        <P>Advocacy is defined as taking action to enable people to express what they want, to secure their rights, represent their interests and obtain services they need.  It is an uphill battle for some.  The Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the national advocacy service is important but we must remind people of the context and the way services for people with disabilities are developing.  The national disability strategy that was launched in 2004 included a commitment to introduce legislation establishing the personal advocacy service.  There was controversy about the legislative components of the strategy, especially the limited recourse to the courts in the Disability Act and the introduction of the personal advocacy services.  There was a need to examine the Act in depth.</P><Col N="963"/>
        <P>In the current climate the focus is on cuts to front-line disability services rather than the rights of the individual to receive services and have a say on how services are delivered to them and planned for them, which is how those who best know their own needs have an input.  For those who cannot speak for themselves, there should be advocacy to deal with those issues for them.  The failure to introduce personal advocacy, with the introduction of a system where State-appointed advocates who can support people with disabilities to challenge inappropriate or inadequate service provision or the lack of consultation in decisions made that affect them, should be a matter of concern.  We are paying lip service to something we do not really understand.  It was a priority in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, which Ireland is yet to ratify, particularly Article 12 on equal recognition before the law and Article 13 on access to justice.</P>
        <P>Instead of introducing the personal advocacy service, a pilot project of 46 community and voluntary sector advocacy projects was introduced in 2006.  These projects have been hosted throughout the country, with some targeting specific areas and others trying to serve particular populations.  The projects were hosted by local groups, Citizens Information Board services and other community bodies, with one staff member in place working on complex cases with the most vulnerable populations.  I have met people in that situation and some areas did not have an advocate owing to the lack of a project to host the service.  Some groups put together excellent proposals to host the service and were disadvantaged in other areas because their case was so good.  Only a few residential services had access to advocacy services and no community visitor programme was introduced as proposed by the Citizens Information Board which had statutory responsibility for advocacy.</P>
        <P>The evaluation of the pilot programmes was published in June and recommended statutory independent advocacy being put in place with regional teams of advocates hosting five regional services, hosted by the Citizens Information Board services.  This evaluation was independently conducted and met many people who have assessed the advocacy services and they tell the real story of people&rsquo;s situations.</P>
        <P>I have permission to outline one case that involved a man living in residential care who had multiple sclerosis, which left him paralysed from the neck down, along with some cognitive difficulties.  He was separated and had two children who lived in another European jurisdiction with his former partner.  He had not seen his children for two years.  He was looked after by a member of this family but when he entered residential care, she could no longer care for him.  He was very unhappy in care.  The facilitator in the home referred Patrick to the advocate.  His issues included access to finance, planning for independent living, access to his children and seeking the medical support required.  His family was not in favour of him travelling to see his children, but the advocate worked on his behalf and secured a trip to Europe for him.  Organising support and planning for the trip required protracted negotiations with the management of the residential home, but he visited his children and plans to do so again.</P>
        <P>A pilot service, the Tipperary advocacy service, provided a personal advocacy service for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  As the project involved only one advocate, it was unable to provide a service for every people with a disability, including many in the county with an intellectual disability and mental health difficulties.  As such, there is no independent advocacy service for such persons in the county or elsewhere in the State.  What assurance can the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, give that the national advocacy service will be able to meet the needs of all vulnerable adults with disabilities in, for example, County Tipperary?  No additional posts are being created and there will be no further funding.  The service in Munster will be managed by Waterford Citizens Information Services, with eight or nine advocates covering the entire region and the different client groups.</P><Col N="964"/>
        <P>Recently I met a constituent who was wheelchair-bound and listened to what she had to say.  She expressed great frustration because she had reached the limits of her ability to get around.  She had problems egressing her house.  She also told me how previously dished footpaths had not been returned to their original state after being interfered with by the local authority while it was laying new pipes or lines.  There was no joined-up thinking where access to taxis was concerned and the bus system did not meet her needs.  That shops on the main street did not allow her wheelchair access was ludicrous.

	<P>Will workers in the service have the powers of enforcement promised in the Citizens Information Act 2007?  The evaluation of projects in the community and voluntary sector highlighted the difficulties experienced by many advocates in representing clients, with service providers and others refusing to recognise the advocates, to allow them to attend meetings or reply to letters on behalf of disabled people.  The personal advocacy service was seen as important when the Disability Act was passed in 2005, yet it has not been commissioned.  The new service presents a good opportunity to ensure new advocates will be given the powers envisaged for the personal advocacy service at no extra cost to the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>It is my pleasure to welcome the Minister of State.  This represents a great move to promote the human rights of people of all ages with a disability, be it intellectual or physical.  As the Minister said, people with money are well able to get advocates to represent them.  As politicians, we regularly advocate for persons who cannot break through the bureaucracy.  The new national advocacy service will empower people with a disability by supporting them in asserting their views and claiming their entitlements and, where necessary, will negotiate on their behalf.</P>
        <P>I have personal experience of an injustice done to a good friend, Mr. Martin McBride of Portsalon, County Donegal.  It was an invidious and unpleasant experience of the stigma attached to epilepsy.  Martin worked in a clerical position in the late 1970s and 1980s in a public sector organisation in County Donegal.  He had temporal lobe surgery in Beaumont Hospital in 1991 and his employers were intolerant of his condition.  They prevaricated and procrastinated regarding his period of probation.  His elderly mother, Mrs. Susan McBride, received letters and belligerent telephone calls, but her sole concern was that her son would live and get well.</P>
        <P>Martin&rsquo;s consultant in the hospital&rsquo;s neurology department was world renowned for his expertise and knew the history of his condition better than anyone.  However, the consultant&rsquo;s advice was contemptuously ignored and Martin was requested by the public service organisation in County Donegal to attend a doctor in Altnagelvin hospital for an independent medical review.  That doctor carried out a perfunctory examination &mdash; his blood pressure and temperature were checked, etc. &mdash; but performed no brain scans, CAT scans or EEGs.  Such scans are <Col N="965"/>considered orthodox in hospital examinations for persons with epilepsy, as they provide guidance on prognosis and medication to be provided.</P>
        <P>Martin received a letter from a senior official in the public service organisation.  According to it, the doctor in Derry had stated that, following the examination, it was his view that Martin was unlikely to offer a worthwhile service to the organisation ever again.  The doctor recommended that Martin be offered early retirement on medical grounds.  He considered this callous.  Caring and empathetic employers would have offered a career break for a few years, for example.</P>
        <P>In Martin&rsquo;s experience, people are not open and frank in talking about epilepsy.  Some will not even use the word.  As with mental illness, epilepsy is regarded as being inscrutable, enigmatic and a source of shame.  There is a stigma attached.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, is travelling around the country to try to do away with the stigma attached to mental illness, which is a worthwhile crusade.</P>
        <P>People were patronising towards Martin; they glanced in his direction and there were furtive whispers.  Stigma can manifest in low self-esteem, no self-confidence, withdrawal, isolation, depression and, in extreme circumstances, suicide.  Martin could have offered his former employers a worthwhile service following recuperation had he been allowed to do so.  He lives alone in his house.  Modern medication, regular check-ups by consultants at Beaumont Hospital&rsquo;s excellent neurology department, research and technology enable a person with epilepsy to lead a normal life, as Martin does, despite being let go from his job.  He was top of the poll at the Donegal Local Development Company and serves on many boards of management, on which he gives of his intelligence, opinions and observations.  He is fully active, despite his epilepsy, but the conservative, ignorant and unjust approach adopted by his former employer demanded that he retire.</P>
        <P>People might find it interesting to note that having epilepsy did not affect the contribution to society of people like Napoleon Bonaparte, Handel, Vincent van Gogh, Elton John, Agatha Christie, Leonardo da Vinci and Richard Burton.  Few may know that these personalities had or have epilepsy.  However, most are aware of their immense contribution to society.  That is as it should be, with no stigma attached to divert attention from their intelligence, dignity and rights.</P>
        <P>Martin spoke at a recent meeting in County Donegal.  He quoted Dr. Martin Luther King, who said, &ldquo;Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>This is a great day for all those who have a disability, are not top shots in society and cannot pay barristers and solicitors to advocate for them.   We see those who can day in, day out because they have the money to get themselves out of various situations.  Please God, this will be a great day for Ireland and those who suffer injustice and are not able to go to work, which is a fundamental right.</P>
        <P>Martin&rsquo;s story shows the ugly conservativeness of those who did not have the guts to make a decision and judge whether he was able to do the job in question.</P>

	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  In a non-patronising way, I congratulate Senator Mary White for her contribution and advocacy in that <Col N="966"/>individual case which had a traumatic quality.  There was ignorance in the way in which the person concerned had been dealt with.  I commend the Senator.</P>
        <P>It is no harm to remember there are 400,000 people with a disability in this country, of whom 24% are unable to cope with day-to-day activity and ordinary living.  There is a risk in an economic downturn that the people concerned would become victims.  We have to have sound values and core principles and beliefs dictating public policy.  A society predicated on proper Christian principles and values should value and cherish people with disabilities who in no way should become victims and dupes for years of incompetence, hubris and greed.  They should never be victimised.  This important principle needs to be restated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the establishment of the national advocacy service and have no problem with it.  My party and I, because it is our job to so do, rightly condemn the tardiness of its introduction and the way in which there has been a type of west Clare railway approach to it.  However, it has been born eventually and we are happy with this.</P>
        <P>I refer to the EPSEN Act.  It is a great tragedy, wrong and a mistake that the Act has not been fully implemented.  Its practical implementation would bring about an educational plan for students with specific disabilities which would extend over the year, be the subject of review and ensure the availability of language therapy and psychological services and proper assistance for a child.  It would give him or her the right to a plan specific to his or her needs and specific supports.  It is a great indictment of the Government that it has not implemented the Act.   It is an indictment of its value system, of both Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, both of which should stand condemned on the issue.  It is necessary to implement the Act and cast in stone the rights of children and schools.  The IEPs, individual education plans, currently in place are not the same and do not have the same legislative effect or rights base.</P>
        <P>I am interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on and see her further pursuit of the use of quotas in local authorities, health boards and public bodies to provide work for people with disabilities.  From my experience of dealing with such issues, what is happening in all of these bodies is that people within them who have accidents and develop disabilities are meeting the quota and kept on.  I am not sure the quota system is being implemented properly.  I would like to know if there are quotas in place and what is being done about them.  We should employ people with disabilities as of right through a quota system in health boards, local authorities and public bodies.</P>
        <P>It is a pity the carer strategy has not been implemented.  I refer to the carers who attended the Houses today to lobby.  They do great work.  Whatever about the social and lifestyle benefits they offer, the effect of the economic benefits they offer has never fully dawned on us.  The savings in institutional care achieved by carers are enormous and should be applauded.</P>
        <P>I shall finish in deference to my colleague who is very experienced in these matters and to the Acting Chairman who wishes to move the debate along.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  I was in my office and became outraged when I heard the proposal.  I am angry because my learned colleague on the opposite side has always spoken about rolling out the policy, A Vision for Change.  I seethe with rage because the Government is clapping itself on the back about introducing the national advocacy service when it is cutting services left, right and centre.  A Vision for Change was about the closure of draconian institutions, but we have not implemented any part of it.  Instead there are cuts across the board.  I accept we are living in very challenging times, but I do not think the Government should clap itself on the back for piloting the advocacy service.  Advocacy is fine and good, but it only applies when services are in place and up and running.  Human rights issues are at the kernel of the issue, as people are being discrimi<Col N="967"/>nated against.  They do not have opportunities to avail of basic services such as speech therapy or occupational health services, yet the Government claps itself on the back for rolling out the advocacy service.  It is a disgrace and should not be done.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>A number of weeks ago 14-year old children were accommodated in the adult psychiatric service of Waterford Regional Hospital.  That is an outrage.  Advocacy is fine if there are services in place, but we should go one step further, especially in institutions and the services with which Senator Corrigan is all too familiar.  There should be human rights based committees staffed by ordinary people who could represent those in need of representation.  There might be a solicitor, parents and others on such a human rights committee which would embrace the service.  That is the way to proceed.  The Government should implement such a policy rather than have tokenism, or what I would call glossy tokenism.  It should feel ashamed for clapping itself on the back in this instance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very reluctant to engage with my colleague on the other side of the House on what is essentially a political charge.  No Senator on this side spoke about the Government clapping itself on the back.  Mr. Tony McQuinn, chief executive of the Citizens Information Board, who is neither a Minister nor speaking on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il stated: </P>
        <P LI="1">This is a very good day for people with disabilities in Ireland as a national advocacy service is introduced.  I would like to thank the 46 organisations who generously provided the opportunity to run a pilot advocacy service over the past five years.  The pilot service demonstrated the importance of advocacy for people with disabilities in having their voices heard and the choices respected.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I suggest Senator McFadden engage with Mr. McQuinn and perhaps make the same political charge, telling him that it is about the optics and a waste of time, and see what he has to say about it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in any way undermining the bona fides of Senator McFadden, but I will say this.  I am the parent of a special needs child and believe I have particular experience of dealing with State agencies and others; therefore, I become somewhat sensitive from time to time.  I know there are inadequacies in the system and that there are very serious difficulties and deficiencies.  I am also aware of all the statistics for successive Governments dating back to the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Most recently, this was starkly illustrated by those involved in mental health services when it was shown that the actual percentage of State expenditure had decreased in the last 35 to 40 years.  All Governments stand indicted for this.  However, this is a particular initiative which I would have thought would be welcomed, at least, as a step forward.  As my friend and colleague, Senator Corrigan, said, it is only an initial step.  </P>
        <P>I was about to raise the issue with the Minister of State of whether State agencies will respond to the setting up of citizens&rsquo; advice bureaux for people with disabilities.  Have they been mandated to put their house in order as regards how one should deal with people with disabilities because I believe there is no obligation on State Departments to respond to the needs of such persons on an individual basis?  I hope the advocate who will be put in place as a result of this initiative will be able to challenge Government agencies dealing with the mentally and physically disabled.</P>
        <P>I want to quote from a paper issued by Ms Anne McGuire, MP, Minister for Disabled People in the United Kingdom, which was sent to Government Departments in which she makes the point:</P>
        <P LI="1">If our customers are not aware of the service, the criteria needed to qualify for it, and how it can benefit them, we will fail the very people we seek to benefit.  We cannot provide responsive services unless people have a bigger say in what they receive and the places where they live...</P>
        <P LI="1">No public body serious about its role in delivering services to people can hope to meet their wider strategic objectives without first thinking explicitly about the impact upon disabled people.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Disability Equality Duty (DED) ... requires all public bodies to look at the impact on disabled people of everything they do.  Such an approach will benefit the service provider as well as the customer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">She makes a further point which, in the context of what we are debating, I address too at Government Departments:</P>
        <P LI="1">You should seek to gain an understanding of how disabled people need and use services.  Like all people, different groups of disabled people may require different information to others.  A person with a severe learning disability may require a very different approach to someone who is visually impaired.  A disabled person who does not speak English as their first language may have particular needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In our increasingly multicultural society that last sentence adds another dimension.  People with a disability often need support in standing up for themselves, putting forward their views and <Col N="969"/>gaining control over their lives.  The empowerment advocacy can bring to the lives of disadvantaged and vulnerable persons is considerable.  In particular, advocacy services can support people with disabilities in gaining access to quality social services and ensuring fair and dignified treatment by service providers.  Advocacy should not be confused with the giving of information, the offering of advice or social work.  While the purpose of social work is to resolve issues and find solutions, advocates strive to make a case for someone or support him or her in making a case.</P>
        <P>People with learning disabilities, disabled persons and those with mental health problems are among the least powerful in our society.  Senator McFadden and I demonstrate empathy in that regard.  Advocacy can provide those concerned with the support necessary to make their own decisions and choices.  It can enable them to have more control over their lives.  Even the provision of information and education on the options available and their advantages and disadvantages is enormously empowering for the disabled in the sense that it might give them the self-confidence to act on their own.  The empowerment advocacy brings supports the other three principles &mdash; autonomy, inclusion and citizenship.  Autonomy, however, should not be confused with independence.  Where people with learning disabilities have to depend on others for some level of support in their everyday living, it is still possible for them to determine their own lives by being autonomous.  Advocacy supports a person&rsquo;s right to voice his or her views, opinions and preferences in forums in which others are making decisions which impact directly on his or her life.  It plays a key role in enabling people to make informed choices about and remain in control of their own lives.</P>
        <P>The most vulnerable in society are often isolated from social groupings and communities because of inequalities in access and opportunities.  These can occur at many levels, from the physical, where access to transport and other public facilities may not be user-friendly, to the emotional, where people with learning disabilities are not treated as independent thinking individuals in their own right.  Having an advocate to communicate with and work alongside can help to increase all levels of access, thus offering greater opportunities within the community to everyone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although it is slightly tangential to what we are discussing, I would like to commend an autism service being provided by HSE West, impacting on people in the Sligo-Leitrim and west Cavan areas.  I commend, in particular, Ms Mary Durcan, the autism service manager, and Ms Regina Bohan, the autism therapist.  In the mission statement it is stated they set out to deliver an exemplary service to individuals with autism spectrum disorder, their families and those who work with and support them.  They say they do this by fostering a spirt of mutual respect and support, with a commitment to enable individuals with autism to live life in a way that maximises their independence and happiness.  They are involved with individuals &ldquo;in a multidisciplinary meeting&rdquo; and say they &ldquo;act as a referral agent, contribute to the assessment review process, liaise with multidisciplinary teams in relation to the needs of the child and convene regular multidisciplinary team reviews&rdquo;.  They provide support and advice and engage in consultation in the support of young adults in their new adult placements.  This is one of the good things going on within the HSE.  I commend, in particular, the people I have mentioned and understand this is a unique pilot project.  I passed on the details to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, in recent weeks following a PowerPoint presentation by Ms Bohan and Ms Durcan at a meeting I attended in Country Leitrim.</P>
        <P>I have no wish to denigrate or reduce the emotional impact of what Senator McFadden said.  We are all very emotional about the issue of people with disabilities, both physical and mental, and I believe this debate will, at least, go some way towards contributing to an improvement <Col N="970"/>in the services being inadequately provided.  I agree with the Senator in that regard.  However, there is a good heart on this as on the other side of the House in trying to improve the lot of those who are physically and mentally disabled.  I, therefore, welcome the new initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on Senator Corrigan to conclude the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to what has been a very informed debate in the last couple of hours.  Senator McFadden and I are frequently in agreement and share many of the same thoughts, beliefs, hopes and aspirations.  I can understand where she is coming from in the points she has made, but I regret that she did not, perhaps, have an opportunity to hear the earlier part of the debate when we made it very clear that while we welcomed the announcement today as a great step forward for people with disabilities, this could only be the starting point.  If we do not get the mental capacity and guardianship Bill before us in sufficient time to be able to consider and amend it and if we do not take steps to support particularly vulnerable adults within the criminal justice system in engaging with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the courts, this advocacy service will never reach its full potential.  I understand the point the Senator is making but, far from clapping ourselves on the back, we have acknowledged it in the announcement of the service and its commencement in January 2011.  Members have made the point that it has been slow to commence and that we will lose out because of the pilot projects, but that is not the case, as the pilot projects will finish at the end of December and the service will start at the beginning of January.  The fact that there will be no hiatus between the two is to be welcomed.  The announcement of the service today is a step forward.  By itself, it will not be sufficient for what all Senators want to achieve, but it is an important step and must not be underestimated.  I hope it will bring us further down the road.  The fact that the service is to begin in January 2011, despite the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, sends a powerful message to people with disabilities: that we will try, as far as possible, to ensure they are somewhat protected from the impact of the economic climate.  </P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the fact that he personally had an interest in supporting access to employment for those with disabilities.  We can see the impact of the economic circumstances on people with disabilities.  Everyone in our society needs the economy to recover, particularly those with disabilities.  It is not only that the development of their services depends on our being able to establish an economy that will generate funding; in addition, when the economy is doing well, there are more employment opportunities.  People with disabilities are the first to be hit in an economic downturn.  The great thing about the boom years was that we had such a shortage of labour that people with disabilities were supported in training and taking up positions and had access to employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>In moving forward with the advocacy service, which I welcome &mdash; I urge all colleagues in the House to support the motion &mdash; we do face challenges.  The service will face challenges in the context of the relationships and situations in which people with disabilities find themselves and in which the service will become involved.  These could be anything from issues regarding bank accounts, access to welfare entitlements and the spending of money based on the needs of the person with a disability to his or her happiness with a placement, whether it is a day service, a supported employment placement, a training opportunity or a residential placement.  These are the challenges we will all have to face as the result of the establishment of the service, the only intent of which is to meet the needs of the person concerned.  That will be its only motivation.  It will be a challenge for all of us in society to accept that an advocate&rsquo;s only <Col N="971"/>agenda is to tell us whether a person with a disability is happy with his or her situation and ask us what we will do about it.  That will certainly put it up to us.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The second challenge we will face is in the legislation.  I mentioned earlier that establishing services for people with disabilities and ensuring we put in place mechanisms and supports to enable people with disabilities to take their full place in society as equal citizens were not just matters of money.  The required legislation, including the Mental Capacity Bill, must be brought before us in sufficient time for us to consider it because it has enormous implications for all aspects of life.  We must also establish supports for vulnerable adults within the criminal justice system.  If we do not do this, those advocating on behalf of people with disabilities will be limited in how they can deal with situations.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I thank my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for their presence.  I believe we are further down the road, but we are not there yet and still have a long way to go.  However, the establishment of the national advocacy service is an important step forward.  I, therefore, ask all Members to support the motion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  It is opportune that he is here, given that he knows as well as I do how devastating the flooding has been in south Roscommon and south Westmeath.  I raise this matter out of sheer frustration because nothing has happened since the devastating floods last winter.  Water levels were extremely high during September, when the Callows around Clonown in the Minister of State&rsquo;s area and Golden Island flooded.  Farmers are frustrated at having their land flooded which results in their not being able to use it for grazing from as early as September.  I have been to Meelick, a place dear to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s heart, and have seen where the river has not been cleared or cleaned.  The OPW gave an undertaking that it would spend time maintaining it, but this has not happened.  I was pleased to see, however, that the gates were open.</P>
        <P>The report referred to the fact that the ESB had not been informed of or involved in making emergency plans.  Having read the committee&rsquo;s report, it seems matters are as haphazard as they were this time last year.  The report contained much that commended, which I thought was ridiculous considering the devastation caused.  I had hoped the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, might grace us with his presence, even though he did not grace the committee with his presence.  He needs to take the lead.  I understand the OPW is the lead organisation.  However, I do not expect agencies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the ESB and Waterways Ireland to bow to its authority.  A Cabinet Minister needs to take the lead.  Rivers, including the tributaries through Ballinasloe, etc., need to be maintained in order that water can flow freely and sluice gates can be opened in a timely manner if water levels are rising.  If the forecast is bad, we need someone to be able to give instructions to allow urgent action to be taken to avoid a recurrence of the devastation caused last winter.</P>
        <P>I am very disappointed that there were no hard conclusions in the report and there has been no reply from either Minister.  All I can see are endless references to what is happening in County Cork.  People living in the midlands and River Shannon region were affected just as much as people living in County Cork were.  While I have no axe to grind with people living in County Cork, we must not be left on the hind tit.  We must be looked after, unlike the last time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  </P>
        <P>The role of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government during a severe weather event is to ensure local authorities are prepared to respond properly to ameliorate the worst effects of those aspects for which they have direct responsibility.  Local authorities are required to act as the lead agency to co-ordinate the activities of the other principal response agencies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive, using the major emergency management framework, as appropriate, with the voluntary agencies and the Defence Forces to limit the effects on individuals who may be at risk.  When effective emer<Col N="973"/>gency plans are in place, management of the response falls to the local authorities, working with the other response agencies.</P>
        <P>The framework for major emergency management provides for its co-ordination structures and arrangements to be used, regardless of whether a major emergency is declared.  It is important to note that these arrangements were implemented at local and regional level as required by local circumstances.  It has been widely recognised that the local authorities, working with the other agencies, discharged their functions in a most commendable manner last winter.  I am satisfied that there was an active and sustained response to the severe weather conditions, not just by the local authorities and the other principal response agencies at local level but also at national level, with the support of the Defence Forces and other statutory and voluntary bodies.</P>
        <P>The national steering group which oversaw the development and roll-out of the framework for major emergency management carried out a review of the response to the severe weather event.  It established that the arrangements set out in the framework were fit for purpose and operated satisfactorily.  As the recent report of the joint committee illustrates, the response to a severe weather event is a cross-departmental responsibility.  Consequently, the review of responses by Departments to these events is being overseen by the Government task force on emergency planning.  Implementation of one of the issues identified in the review relating to the national steering group is being led by my Department.  This approach also includes external consideration of the reviews undertaken by Departments to validate the reviews for completeness against best international practice and suggest a standard template to assist Departments in undertaking future reviews.  This external examination will have regard to the committee&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>As suggested in the committee&rsquo;s report, the Minister has asked the Department to complete its review of the severe weather emergencies before the end of October.  The review will have the benefit of being able to consider the committee&rsquo;s recommendations in areas that fall within my areas of responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has outlined what is stated in the report.  I commend all of the agencies involved for the way they responded.  However, will a Shannon Basin committee be established, as recommended by the committee?  Who will take responsibility as the lead agency to ensure this will never happen again, that the sluice gates will be opened on command and that rivers will be maintained to enable water to flow freely from one end of the country to the other?  A Shannon Basin committee would solve the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Having regard to where I come from, I fully appreciate the point made by the Senator.  The question was put to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which has a responsibility towards local authorities to co-ordinate their responses.  The other issues relate to the OPW which is the lead agency and has allocated substantial funds for the carrying out of surveys and works, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have contacted the OPW and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, but I am not getting anywhere; neither is the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>In the last paragraph I outlined clearly the situation regarding the Department.  In response to the committee&rsquo;s report, the Minister has asked the Department to complete its review of the severe weather emergencies before the end of October and this review will have the benefit of the input of the committee.  This is important from a local authority perspective.  Irrespective of what works are undertaken, when there is severe weather leading to flooding, somebody has to be involved.  The bodies involved are the local authorities <Col N="974"/>and the national committee.  Other issues such as maintenance work, etc. are obviously the responsibility of the Office of Public Works working in consultation with the local authorities.  The Senator must appreciate that I am responding to the question as to what the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is doing.  Further answers may be available from other Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked the OPW and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, the exact same question.  The source of my frustration is that I am going from Billy to Jack.  There is no lead agency taking responsibility, which means the same thing will happen again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would come to the House and respond to the flooding report published in July by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It did not ask any other questions.  That is the response, with all due respect to the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>But the Minister knows where I am coming from.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly understand the Senator&rsquo;s intention.</P>

    <Title>Archaeological Heritage</Title>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>In mid-2007 a developer working on a site in Athenry where it was recommended to him that he construct a roundabout discovered the remains of part of the old Athenry town wall.  The developer, being careful not to disturb the remains, immediately sought the advice of the archaeologist from the monuments section of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The advice of the archaeologist given at the time was that the remains should be preserved in a concrete sarcophagus and that the roundabout would continue to be constructed over that concrete sarcophagus.</P>
        <P>On the advice of that archaeologist from the Minister&rsquo;s Department, the developer lodged an application on 24 September 2007 for a licence to carry out the work required.  We have now passed the third anniversary of the submission of that application for a licence and to date we have had no response from the Minister&rsquo;s office as to whether he will grant it.</P>
        <P>During that three year period the Minister has sought the advice of Galway County Council, which confirmed to him that the original advice given by his own archaeologist was the correct advice.  Not happy with that advice he went on to seek the advice of the National Roads Authority, which again confirmed that the original advice was sound.  Finally, not happy with that advice, the Minister sought the advice of the Department of Transport, which again confirmed that the original advice given was the correct advice.</P>
        <P>This location, Lorro Gate, is effectively the gateway from the new M6 motorway into the heart of Athenry town, a beautiful heritage town.  It is also the location of Galway county GAA&rsquo;s hurling pitch where all of our major hurling matches, county semi-finals and county finals take place.  It is also near a new, busy commercial development.  It is easily the most trafficked junction in all of Athenry town and for three years, while the Minister makes up his mind, we have had a building site left in limbo and not allowed continue to completion because the Minister has refused to make a decision.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, has some good news for us on this issue, although I am not very hopeful.</P><Col N="975"/>
        <P>On 9 November 2007, having made some inquiries, I received a response from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stating the application for ministerial consent for works was being processed as expeditiously as possible.  In June 2008, I received a letter from the Minister stating that he must now proceed with making a decision, and on 22 April 2009 I received an e-mail from the Minister&rsquo;s office stating that he had asked his officials to conclude their examination of the various issues as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister rightly refers every now and again, as we all do, to the need for reform within the public service and to create a new, efficient and streamlined public service.  I would argue that the first place he should direct that reform might be within his own office because I cannot understand the reason it takes three years to make a decision on a licence application or to act on sound advice that was given to him three years ago by an official and an archaeologist with much expertise in this area.</P>
        <P>This matter should not be allowed drag on any longer.  It is a major road safety hazard.  It is a horrendously ugly vista to present to people visiting Athenry for the first time.  I genuinely hope we get some closure on this issue once and for all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I appreciate that it has been under examination in my Department for some time and I am pleased to be in a position to confirm that a decision has now been arrived at.</P>
        <P>To recap for the benefit of the House, the background to the case is that during archaeological monitoring of a nearby housing development, part of the remains of the medieval Lorro Gate to the town of Athenry was discovered.  The discovery was made under the site of a new road roundabout that the housing developer is obliged to put in place as part of his planning permission.  The objective of the roundabout is to ensure the safety of vehicles entering and exiting the new development and also to service other traffic to and from the town.</P>
        <P>The town defences of Athenry are an important national monument within the meaning of the National Monuments Acts.  Part of the town wall is already protected by a preservation order.  Public safety is also a very important consideration.  The need to balance these two factors has meant that every option has had to be carefully examined with a view to arriving at a solution that facilitates effective traffic management and, at the same time, seeks to preserve an important monument for the benefit of future generations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposal put forward by the developer for ministerial consent under the National Monuments Acts was for the archaeological remains to be preserved <i>in situ </i>under the proposed roundabout.  Given the archaeological, historical and local significance of the site, reports were subsequently produced by a number of relevant bodies to assist in the examination of the proposal.  These included my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service, Galway County Council&rsquo;s roads and transportation department assisted by the National Roads Authority, and the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>Having carefully considered the application for consent, and the related reports in relation to the monument, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has now decided to approve the preservation of the archaeological remains <i>in situ </i>under the roundabout as the most reasonable approach, taking all relevant factors into account.  The approval will be subject to a number of conditions.  Apart from standard archaeological requirements, the main objective will be to ensure that the roundabout is constructed to a high aesthetic standard, appropriate to its location, and that the discovery itself is suitably recorded and marked on site.  The formal notice of consent will issue from my Department within the next few days.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that a conclusion has now been reached in this case.  I hope the finished project will appeal to everyone who has taken an interest in it and, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, I thank them for their advice and assistance in this matter.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting Services</Title>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise again the issue of television services.  We are familiar with the concept of the move from analogue to digital broadcasting but I reiterate that there is a concern in the north west on the part of some people who cannot get RTE.  I am aware that a memorandum of mutual understanding was signed between the two jurisdictions on the island to work to maximise on the transfer from an analogue to digital service in that RTE would become available to those who want it in the North yet we have people in Donegal who cannot get RTE.</P>
        <P>Two issues arise.  The first is to do with the work going on at North-South Ministerial Council level to ensure the work taking place in the Northern stations will improve the position not only for the Six Counties but for the nine counties of Ulster.  The related issue that arises is that recently a number of people are having great difficulty with the BBC, UTV and Channel 4 service, but particularly BBC.  That is not something they have had a difficulty with until now.  I have been in touch with the authorities in the North and they say that any work they are doing on their stations has not impacted on signals and that it is not their issue.  I have been in touch with RTE also and they say they have no responsibility for BBC, therefore, they could not have been doing anything either.</P>
        <P>We are in a difficult position because we are not sure why this is happening.  We know there is no snow outside &mdash; I got sunburn in Buncrana on Monday &mdash; but we are definitely getting a snowy image on our television screens and coming into the winter, we want to reverse that trend and get rid of the snow, so to speak.</P>
        <P>It is very simple.  There is a transfer of the service.  A number of people are very anxious about this issue.  A number of people have spent a good deal of money trying to find alternative solutions for the preservation of all stations.  We are ecumenical in the north west.  We tend to watch RTE as well as BBC and UTV.  We want to maintain the capacity and facility to do that.  There are many questions about what will happen.  We see the demise of some stations whereas we do not see the advent of the stations for which we are paying the licence fee in many parts of the county.  There is no information whether if one buys a box at this time it will cover the position when the changeover takes place or whether a person should pay for a satellite service or some other interim solution.  There is no sense that we will know, until the switchover takes place later this year, the exact scale of either the success or demise of the television service in my county.</P>
        <P>I tabled this matter on the Adjournment because the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has had a number of interactions at the North-South Ministerial Council.  I have raised this issue in the Seanad and although I did so specifically about Inishowen, since then people from Milford and other areas outside Letterkenny have asked to be included because they are in the same situation.  It is important, if we are having interactions at North-South level to improve the quality of television coverage for those in the North, that we deal with those who are even further north than the North and ensure they are accommodated as well.</P>
        <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would outline any information that has become available at North-South level.  I would also appreciate receiving, if it is available, an information note outlining the current situation, the timeframe in which the changeover will take place, the system under which the service operates and how the new system will impact.  There is much uncertainty and it is very unfair to let that uncertainty remain.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should be working with the service providers <Col N="977"/>and with its counterpart in the North, given there is a North-South dimension and the signal knows no border inasmuch as we do not know much of a border either.  A little information would ease minds.  Whatever about people fiddling with remote controls and trying their best to hang off the satellite as it were, others are not in a position to do that which is unfair on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter and affording me an opportunity to speak on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  The Government&rsquo;s stated policy objective is to achieve the closure of Ireland&rsquo;s analogue terrestrial television network by the fourth quarter of 2012.  The closure of the analogue television network is occurring worldwide.  The worldwide deadline is mid-2015 and Europe has set 2012 as the European-wide deadline.  The closure of the analogue television network frees up spectrum which can be used to develop new business initiatives.  It is anticipated that the release of this spectrum could be worth in excess of &euro;2 billion to Ireland over 15 years, and in these chastened economic times the Government wishes to ensure Ireland reaps the rewards of this spectrum at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The analogue television network is operated and owned by RTE Network Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of RTE which transmits the television channels RTE ONE, RTE TWO, TV3 and TG4 for reception in households via rooftop or set-top aerial.  This network is nearing obsolescence and is being replaced by a digital television network.  The new RTE digital television service will provide space for the four national channels and additional public service channels.  In the event of spare capacity, it can be used by RTE on a commercial basis to offer carriage to other commercial television channels.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources signed legislation requiring RTE to launch its digital television service to approximately 90% of the population by 31 October 2010.  RTE has advised the Minister that it will achieve 92% population coverage from 24 sites throughout the country by then and that this service will initially include the existing four Irish channels.  RTE has informed the Minister that it expects the full national digital television network to be in place by the end of 2011.</P>
        <P>In the period from 31 October 2010 to the end of 2012, both digital and analogue TV services will operate together.  This simulcast period, as it is called, of two years gives television households adequate time to upgrade to a digital television service while ensuring the cost of operating the two services is kept to a minimum.  The analogue television services in Northern Ireland are also due to be switched off at the end of 2012 so, in parallel with these developments, the memorandum of understanding, MoU, signed earlier this year between then UK Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Mr. Ben Bradshaw MP, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will facilitate co-ordination with Northern Ireland of the roll-out of digital terrestrial television, DTT, and the analogue switch-off.  The Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews Agreement recognise the importance of the unique cultural and linguistic diversities that exist on the island of Ireland, and this MoU helps to promote and protect those diversities.</P>
        <P>This MoU marked the culmination of a very successful period of co-operation on broadcasting issues between the Governments of Ireland and the UK and its benefits will be manifold.  It provides for co-operation between the Irish and UK Governments to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, North-South co-ordination in the digital switchover public information campaign.  This will help to minimise confusion in Border areas as the analogue switch-off date approaches.  The MoU also provides for the carriage of TG4 on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s DTT platform and facilitates the possibility of RTE being transmitted over DTT in the North and for BBC to be carried in the South.</P><Col N="978"/>
        <P>While many viewers in Ireland and Northern Ireland watch the other country&rsquo;s free-to-air TV channels through overspill, perhaps most significantly the MoU allows the possibility of broadcasting RTE on an all-island basis for the first time in the history of the State.  While the BBC has not engaged in the process for the delivery of free-to-air BBC services throughout Ireland and has no legislative remit to offer a service to the island of Ireland, both RTE and TG4 are fully engaged.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the communications regulators in Ireland and the UK, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, RTE, RTE Network Limited, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office have been meeting over recent months to agree arrangements for the carriage of RTE and TG4 in Northern Ireland.  These meetings have mainly concentrated on technical issues, spectrum planning issues, regulatory matters and the cost of carriage for TG4 and RTE on the Northern Ireland digital television network.  These discussions are ongoing but much progress has been made and there is significant buy-in from all relevant stakeholders, including RTE, RTENL, Arqiva, which owns the television transmitter sites in Northern Ireland, and the UK regulatory body, Ofcom.</P>
        <P>In regard to analogue switch-off in the fourth quarter of 2012, as the Senator can appreciate, the technical and spectrum planning aspects of the analogue switch-off require in-depth discussion and technical considerations of transmission, both North and South.  These discussions are ongoing but all parties are keenly aware of the timelines and are working together to ensure a co-ordinated analogue switchover process which will provide a clear roadmap to secure a smooth analogue switch-off process for Irish citizens in Border counties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Much work is being done, which I welcome.  My two questions remain.  When we talk about an all-island RTE service, are we doing anything to minimise the 8% of the population that is accepted as not being covered?  We can broadcast to all the Six Counties but we cannot cover Donegal, even though people there pay the licence fee in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>My second question relates to an issue on which I need advice.  I assume we are receiving the BBC on the overspill from the Six Counties.  When there are discussions about technical North-South matters, is there any way this issue can be raised to find out why the reception of the other stations has disimproved since the RTE signal has improved in our area?  I assume it has not disimproved in the Six Counties.  The Minister of State will not have the answers to my questions, as these are technical matters.  However, I hope the Department can refer back to me on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will pass a note to the office of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on the questions the Senator has raised and ask that a response be issued to her.</P>
