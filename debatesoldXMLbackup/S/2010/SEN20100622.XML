	<P>I have received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to provide an updated report on the purchase of a site and construction of a new school for Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de, Oranmore, County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to make a statement on staffing levels at Scoil Barra Naofa Cail&iacute;n&iacute;, Beaumont, Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to clarify that either the suspension of commercial draft net salmon fishing on the River Foyle has been lifted or that compensation will be paid to the ten draft net licence holders involved.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Post-Release (Restrictions on Certain Activities) Order Scheme 2010, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the tributes to the late Senator Peter Callanan; No. 2, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta (Amendment) Bill 2010 &mdash; All Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, on which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House; and No. 3, statements on innovation and job creation, to be taken at 6.15 p.m. and to conclude within two hours, on which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House.  The Minister shall be called upon ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and take questions from leaders or spokespersons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>No doubt we will discuss the impact of some of the changes in the British budget on the Irish economy at a later stage, including the changes in VAT rates.  I note in passing the comment by the Chancellor that he was trying to introduce a budget that was tough but also fair.  He also noted the coalition government had inherited the largest budget deficit of any European economy except Ireland.  It is interesting to note there is a &pound;2 billion levy being put on the banks in the UK.</P>
        <P>To return to more domestic matters, we have heard much about the intentions of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, with regard to a directly elected mayor of Dublin.  The Minister stated that it is his intention to have this mayor elected by the end of the year and a number of questions arise with regard to this.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader or the Deputy Leader inform the House of the position on this legislation?  As Members of the House know, the four Dublin local authorities are in the process of electing their mayors this week and next.  It is important that the people of Dublin know in what context these elections will take place.  It would be very helpful if light could be shone on this.  When will the legislation come before the House?  Will it be prior to the recess?  Will all Stages of the legislation be passed prior to the summer?  When will the election take place?  Is there agreement between the Government parties on the timing of the election?  The local government (Dublin mayor and regional authority) Bill was not on the list of Bills circulated.  Was this a mistake or is it an indication that the Bill will not be introduced until next year?  This needs to be cleared up because there is quite a degree of confusion and uncertainty about it.  The people of Dublin deserve to know and we need proper time to debate the legislation if the election is to go ahead this year.</P>
        <P>It is also important that the Minister for Social Protection come to the House to discuss issues with regard to social welfare payments.  I am conscious that the detailed social welfare legislation will be before the House next week.  We hear comments on the social welfare fund and money not being available.  It is important that we have an opportunity to discuss the broad issues that arise with regard to social welfare.  The Minister commented on pensions being cut and we ought to have a debate in the House prior to discussing the details of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s points on the local government (Dublin mayor and regional authority) Bill.  I have significant interest in that legislation because it is also the intention to deal with the name of a small town in west Kerry in which I have a deep and abiding interest.  Last month, I asked my esteemed colleague Senator Boyle about it and he assured me it was in play.  I take his word on that and I look forward to seeing it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Fitzgerald touched on the matter of today&rsquo;s UK budget, which has two points of significance.  The VAT rate has been raised from 17.5% to 20%, which should be good for businesses on the Southern side of the Border.  The other issue is that a levy was placed on the banks and I want to raise an issue related to this which I ask my colleagues to take very seriously.  Last week, the Minister for Finance said, conceded, admitted or told the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that the costs of the new central bank regulatory system would be borne significantly by the taxpayer.  This flies in the face of what is happening in regulation throughout the world.  Recently, people on both sides of the House spoke up about the cost to local radio stations of paying for their own regulation.  We saw it was necessary, we conceded certain points on it but we had strong words to say on it.  In the regulation of accountancy, and I am a member of the board of the Irish Audit and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, the accountancy bodies pay more than half of the costs.  The entire cost of the Personal Assessment Injuries Board is borne by the insurance industry or the applicant.  The Government now proposes that the taxpayer should once again be asked to go to the well to pay for the cost of regulating banks.  It is grossly and utterly unacceptable that we should be <Col N="429"/>asked to do this and I ask my colleagues on the other side of the House to raise the matter within their parties.  It is not included in the Central Bank Reform Bill which I have gone through with a fine-tooth comb.  I am not sure how it is covered, but at this stage the banks should pay their own regulatory costs.  Last year the cost of regulation to the taxpayer was &euro;39 million.  An additional 50 or so people will be appointed and one can add another &euro;50 million this year.  In the scheme of things, when we are talking about billions of euro, one might say &euro;50 million is only a drop in the ocean, but these are the drops in the ocean that concern people in terms of the way we are doing our business.  I ask the Minister for Finance to come before the House or to send somebody else to explain to us why this is happening this way, why it cannot be changed, what is the rational behind it and why the taxpayer has to pay to regulate the individuals who got us into this mess in the first place.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On the legislation dealing with the election of the Dublin mayor, I remind the House that there are only three sitting weeks remaining in the D&aacute;il and I understand this House.  Perhaps there will be another week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will sit for another week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful that the Leader has confirmed that the House will sit for an extra week.  I presume that the Bill will go before the D&aacute;il first, if it is to appear before the summer.  That leaves a period of only two weeks during which it can appear before the D&aacute;il because I do not believe it is on the D&aacute;il Order Paper to be taken this week.  Is there any possibility that it will appear before the summer recess?  Without extending the argument and in order that there will be clarity, will the Leader or Deputy Leader do us all a favour and confirm that it will not happen before the summer recess, that it is not proposed to take the Bill until the autumn?  There is no reason this cannot be confirmed.  Why can it not be confirmed without further ado that it will not happen until the autumn?</P>
        <P>On the banks, the finance spokespersons are meeting the Minister for Finance this week to discuss the form the banking inquiry will take.  I ask the Leader to give us an undertaking that he will report to the House once there is clarity on the precise form the proposed inquiry will take in order that we can debate the issue.  It is all very well for the other House to have the matter before it and have the various spokespersons dealing with it, as is proper, but we should provide for the maximum involvement of the Members of this House who have shown a careful interest in the issue which we have debated many times.  Given the expertise available in this House, we should be involved at the highest and deepest possible levels.  I ask the Leader to confirm that that will occur in order that we will have a timetable in debating the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>On the legislation dealing with the election of the Dublin mayor, the Bill will be published within a matter of weeks and it is hoped parliamentary time will be made available in both Houses to allow it to be properly processed.  I am confident it will be published and that parliamentary time will be provided.  I do not know whether there will be sufficient time to allow it to be fully processed before the House goes into recess, that will depend on when the debate occurs in both Houses.</P>
        <P>On the Central Bank Reform Bill which is to be brought before the House, I understand it allows for a mechanism of levies, but Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct that it does not specify what the levies will be and how they will be applied, a legitimate matter for debate in the House.</P>
        <P>In regard to the banking inquiry, it is my understanding that the terms of reference of the commission of inquiry will be discussed by the members of the Joint Committee on Finance <Col N="430"/>and the Public Service which includes Members of this House with the Minister for Finance today.  The terms under which the committee should investigate other aspects of the two banking reports will be brought before both Houses when Members will have an opportunity to discuss the issues raised.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on mental health services, outside the need for additional resources or implementation of A Vision for Change which centres on the culture of mental health and psychiatric care services.  During the weekend I visited a psychiatric facility in which I saw two young people, a 29 year old man and a 26 year old woman.  The man had been in the facility for four years.  He has a four year old child whom he has only seen on one occasion since he entered this facility.  The 26 year old woman has been in it for five years.  One of the reasons for her continued detention is some person medically defined her as being in danger of becoming promiscuous if she ever lived in the outside world.  When our cultural values inform our system of psychiatric care in such a way, we need to consider the issues of resources and institutions in a wider context than the bread and butter arguments we tend to have in this House.  We must ask whether we are making the correct decisions about people who are being kept on the outskirts of our society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>The second HIQA report on Loughloe House was published at noon today.  Of the 37 actions required on foot of the initial inspection, 30 have been taken.  I ask the Leader and my colleagues across the floor whether they want to close our public facilities for the elderly.  That is what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, intends to do in regard to Ofalia House in Tullamore, Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon, St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward in Waterford hospital and the facility in Carlow.  The HIQA report on Loughloe House found that the standard of hygiene had improved significantly, the centre was more comfortable and patients were really happy and receiving care in an unrushed manner.</P>
        <P>When we debated the fair deal scheme in the House, were we aware that all public facilities for the elderly were going to be closed?  Yesterday a newspaper reported on the scandalous closure or downgrading of a Dublin care centre for Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients.  I do not accept that, as a caring community, we want to close public facilities for the elderly.  Of course, people should be allowed to choose between public and private care services and, under the fair deal scheme, to opt for their preferred centre, but I fervently believe public facilities will always be needed for the elderly.  I will not give up on this issue because public facilities for the elderly offer a better standard of care than some private facilities.  In the light of publication of the aforementioned report, I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for the elderly be invited to the House to discuss the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently received a poignant letter from a gentleman who was anxious to see greater activity on the issue of missing persons.  He writes about his sister, Ellen, who went missing nearly ten years ago and describes how his life ended and the torture he endures as a result of this event.  He wants to raise the level of our awareness of families who are living in hell because loved ones have gone missing.  I raised this issue almost ten years ago and have raised it on several occasions since.  I am certain there have been improvements, but if one walks through any town or city, one will see flyers that families have posted on lamp posts in the hope of jogging somebody&rsquo;s memory of a young boy or girl who has gone missing.  My correspondent has asked that the issue of establishing an international designated telephone service, currently operating in only 11 countries, be taken up by Senators and Deputies in order to make the service available in Ireland.  Other Senators who received the same letter will share <Col N="431"/>my view that the correspondent was not seeking something for himself &mdash; he has lost hope of seeing his sister again &mdash; but was making a case on behalf of other people in a similar position, of whom there are hundreds, if not thousands.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the appropriate Minister to enable Senators to respond to the gentleman in question and offer him some consolation that, having gone to the trouble of corresponding with us, he has not been ignored and the House pursued the matter to the best of its ability. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am about to repeat myself by raising an issue I have frequently discussed in the past.  Today, we will have approximately one minute less daylight than yesterday, the longest day of the year.  A campaign was launched in the British House of Commons yesterday to urge the British Government to adopt UK summertime throughout the year.  I note the group in question does not suggest joining central European time.  The arguments in favour of such a move are sufficiently strong to have won the acceptance of the Tories and the Labour Party.  I believe Britain will switch to central European time and I hope Ireland will not find itself unprepared for such an eventuality. </P>
        <P>Ireland and Britain joined central European time in 1968 and until 1971 both countries enjoyed an extra hour of daylight throughout the year.  Adopting central European time would deliver fuel savings, a reduction in carbon emissions, business and tourism benefits and fewer road traffic accidents.  There is no question, therefore, that we should proceed with my proposal.  We did not do so in the past because the British were unlikely to join central European time at the same time.  As I have argued previously, we should be willing to leave the nursery, even if nanny does not come with us, although I accept we would have to coax Northern Ireland to join us in switching time zones.  We could achieve this outcome.</P>
        <P>I urge the Leader to draw to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the possibility of Britain joining central European time in the near future.  Let us ensure that Ireland is ready for any such announcement and enjoys the benefit of an extra hour of daylight throughout the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s position, having been in the House long enough to know that joining central European time was one of the first initiatives he proposed in the Seanad.  I hope the Leader will have something positive to say on the issue.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister of Foreign Affairs to come before the House in the early part of the autumn-winter term to discuss the Irish diaspora.  I raise this issue for two reasons.  First, as one of the legislative Chambers of the Republic of Ireland, the Seanad should devote at least one hour of our time each year to discussing the diaspora.  To do so would give an indication of the Government&rsquo;s initiative in this area and show the wisdom of Senators on all sides and their personal experience in reaching out to the diaspora in its various forms.</P>
        <P>Second, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that as a result of an initiative debated last autumn at the Farmleigh forum, plans are afoot to initiate a process that will result in a certificate of nationality being extended to as many as 70 million people worldwide who claim to be of Irish descent.  It would be available to those who, for one reason or another, do not automatically qualify for Irish citizenship.  This wonderful initiative is one of a number of such measures to have emerged from the forum.</P>
        <P>The Farmleigh meeting, a wonderful initiative taken by David McWilliams and on which the Government quickly acted, was wrongly derided by some elements of the press.  We are beginning to see some of the fruits of this gathering of the great and good from around the world who gave of their own time to attend.  The forum brought together individuals from the corporate, social and political worlds to act in the best interests of the country.  We need all the friends we can get in the current economic climate.</P><Col N="432"/>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss the Irish diaspora and Government initiatives and give both sides an opportunity to make a contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the debate on the Health Service Executive held in the House last week.</P>
      <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have never witnessed such blatant tactics by the Government side, engaging in time wasting, going over time, talking about smoothies and nothing to do with the HSE bearing in mind the kind of crises and scandals we have witnessed in recent times and not so recent times where the Government needs legislation to access files, where we have had misdiagnoses of miscarriages and secret committees advising the HSE in the background about reconfiguration, where we have had misdiagnoses of breast cancer and letters not being opened in hospitals.  In that debate I called on the Minister to take responsibility for the HSE.  She appears to be on the run.  She was not available for the quarterly meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children; that debate has been deferred.  She did not answer any questions last week and the Government side went over time and deliberately wasted time so that the Minister did not have to be accountable.  It is a matter of urgency for the Minister to come back in here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless I am mistaken I believe the Minister indicated she is coming back in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on cycling.  In view of the fine weather it is important to look at what is going on around us.  I come from the university city of Galway.  Unfortunately, although many people are cycling at the moment, the facilities in the city do not match the desire of people to cycle, which I believe is the case across the country.  Most of the European cities that people visit on holidays have fantastic cycling facilities, whereas the culture of cycling here is really not up to scratch.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the question of Central European Time.  I ask him to remember the west of Ireland where we would have darkness just after lunchtime if we were to have Central European Time during the middle of the winter.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> carries a very serious report about the return of third level fees in the Colin Hunt report.  Senators will remember that the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, appointed Dr. Colin Hunt to carry out a long-term strategy report on third level education.  Last week I again asked the Leader for a debate on the future of third level education.  What is our vision for third level education?  What do we want as a nation?  How do we want third level education funded?  Is it fair that the students &mdash; <Col N="433"/>or rather their families &mdash; must now foot the bill of &euro;2 billion, which is the cost of third level education here?  Would it not be far fairer to introduce the Fine Gael plan of a graduate contribution once the graduates take up employment?  I would like to hear the Green Party response.  That party has renegotiated the programme for Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;so that fees would not return in the lifetime of the Government.  Let us get a grip.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should read the programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No interruption now.  We are taking questions to the Leader on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, a Cathaoirleach.  <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that Dr. Colin Hunt sees no alternative to the return of fees.  It is time that we, as public representatives, represented the public view on third level education in this House.  We need an urgent debate on the matter.  There is a chance that our views might form part of his proposal if we have the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in seeking a debate on bank regulation and banking generally.  As I have said before, we need to constantly dip into and out of this issue given events outside the House.  I welcome the recent report by the regulator about the intention to introduce more stringent controls.  It will certainly make life potentially difficult for people.  It is an awful shame that those kinds of controls were not in place earlier, but it is appropriate to introduce them at this stage.  I wholeheartedly agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that the sector should finance the cost of regulating that industry.  It is the norm throughout the world throughout other sectors and we should do it here.  I ask the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister for Finance and I will do so myself.</P>
        <P>Is it possible for the House to have an update on the progress of the expert group chaired by Mr. Hugh Cooney on the issue of mortgage arrears and personal debt?  As Members are aware, the group I co-founded, the prevention of family home repossessions group, is most anxious to see some tangible actions which will give protection to primary family residences.  This is not to pay mortgages or a NAMA for the people but rather legislation to provide people with the dignity to pay their own bills and innovative ways and time in which to do so.  The expert group has had adequate time to consider all these issues and it is now the time for action.  I would appreciate an update on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to transmit to the Government congratulations on the very welcome fact that Ireland has been given a major European award in recognition that road deaths have been reduced by 41% since 2001, which is remarkable.  It is a very good news story and we should pay tribute to the signal, determined and consistent efforts of Mr. Gay Byrne, who took on the job of being in control of this and was derided in this House and in some of the newspapers.  We should welcome this award and the lives that have been saved.</P>
        <P>We should also congratulate a remarkable human being who has just won a significant victory in the Irish courts.  I am talking about Dr. Lydia Foy, who 13 years ago took action to establish the rights of transgendered people to have their newly assigned gender reflected on passports.  She was eventually successful in the High Court some years ago in getting a declaration under the 2003 Act passed by these Houses incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights, as the existing Civil Registration Act was incompatible with the convention.</P><Col N="434"/>
        <P>It was a very significant ruling as it was the first made under this legislation.  It took enormous courage for somebody coming from a spectrum many people would think rather bizarre to take the action.  She was courageous, dignified and tenacious in her action.  In light of this, when will the Government address the issue by introducing new legislation?</P>
        <P>We are in a position where transgendered people can have existing marriages annulled but this does nothing for the rights of the remaining spouses and the children, who are merely facts on the ground.  We should urge the Government to follow the United Kingdom example, which recognises the rights of transgendered people and also recognises the rights of spouses from previous relationships.  It is humane.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Norris in congratulating all involved in the successful efforts to reduce carnage on our roads.  I applaud in particular Mr. Gay Byrne of the Road Safety Authority and the industry which has produced vivid television adverts which have had an impact.  I congratulate those involved on the success of all the campaigns carried out.</P>
        <P>We will have a debate on job creation today and I support Senator Prendergast in her calls for a debate on health.  Today we will receive the HSE annual report.  Does the Leader intend to give time to the House to debate this report and the financial statistics?  Is it possible for the Leader to present, either on a monthly or quarterly basis, reports made for the various Departments?  The job creation debate today will be important but I understand a Government report is forthcoming on the financial difficulties that some of the small and medium enterprises are experiencing.  An expert group has identified a number of measures that would greatly assist SMEs in the current, difficult economic climate, particularly in the context of obtaining payment in respect of goods sold.  There are some that are not meeting the 15-day deadline that has been established in this regard.</P>
        <P>It would be of assistance if Members were made aware of the contents of these reports, particularly if they are relevant to debates such as that relating to job creation which is due to take place later today.  I ask the Leader to put in place a mechanism to allow Members to keep abreast of the reports that have been commissioned and their current status.</P>

	<P>I share Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s concerns with regard to banking, which has experienced the worst type of nightmare.  As Mr. Andrew Healy, president of the Institute of Bankers in Ireland, has stated, the sector is on its knees and has never been weaker.  He also stated, &ldquo;Trust has been broken with customers, shareholders, regulators and with the State&rdquo;.  He further stated that without State aid, meltdown would have been inevitable and that rebuilding people&rsquo;s trust will be a slow and painstaking process that will take many years to complete.  Everyone accepts that a fundamental change in culture must happen if we are to have any hope of restoring our economy to the position in which we would like it to be.  Re-establishing integrity and professionalism is essential in the context of restoring reputation.</P>
        <P>How can we restore the banking sector if those who steered the ship on to the rocks are, in a number of instances, still on the bridge?  The Government has made some valiant efforts in the context of the State aid it has provided and has appointed several superb public interest directors.  Sadly, however, a number of people, at both board and senior management level, remain in place and that is not right.</P>

	<P>Individual Members, Governments and parties come and go from the Houses.  States and unions also come and go.  Last week several Members objected to the churches speaking out on matters in respect of which they have competency and in which they have an interest.  Not only do the churches have a right to speak out on such matters, they also <Col N="435"/>have a duty to do so.  The issue on which the churches commented last week was the Civil Partnership Bill.</P>
        <P>It is widely recognised that the economy is improving and that there is likely to be stronger growth this year than was originally expected and that there will be growth of 3% in 2011 and possibly 4% in 2012.  In light of the fact that we are close to achieving the major goal we set out to achieve two years ago, it is time to give recognition to the public service and ask that those within it &mdash; who have achieved such marvellous results and who, like others, have shouldered such a heavy burden &mdash; hold their nerve.  These individuals should not be forgotten when the good times return.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Members in requesting a debate on banking.  The people are weary of those within the banking fraternity, particularly those at the highest levels who make the decisions.  What the people want is accountability.  They want the banks to pay the cost relating to what has happened and to assist ordinary citizens and business interests to get their affairs back in order.  We have to stop bailing out the banks.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, last year the cost to the taxpayer in respect of regulation was &euro;39 billion.  This year the cost will be &euro;50 million.  Where will it end?  Ordinary people have paid enough.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate on the State Examinations Commission?  Yesterday we witnessed the embarrassing debacle of an examination paper being incomplete.  Who was responsible for this error?  It is unacceptable that the State examination paper for leaving certificate accounting, or any other subject for that matter, should contain a blemish.</P>

	<P>It is unacceptable.  There is no accountability in this country any more.  I request a debate on the role and functions of the State Examinations Commission and in regard to who is responsible for these errors.  The last thing we need is a lack of confidence in the integrity of the examination system.  Yesterday was yet another poor day for our examinations system.  I do not know who is responsible for what happened.  I ask that the Leader provide time for a debate on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Boyle&rsquo;s call for a debate on mental health, concentrating in particular on the area of detention.  Senator Boyle&rsquo;s story of a 26 year old girl who has been in a mental institution for the past five years because a person believes if she is not so confined she will be promiscuous beggars belief.</P>
        <P>I recall the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, saying last week during the debate on the Health Service Executive that mental health is no longer the Cinderella of the health service.  Unlike Senator Prendergast, I thought that debate was excellent.  The Minister spoke for 20 minutes and was commended and congratulated by all sides of the House on her wonderful presentation.  I do not recall if the Leader was in the House for the end of that debate but the following information may assist him when replying.  The Minister had to leave the House ten minutes earlier than planned and, with the permission of the House, took detailed notes of the questions raised in regard to which she undertook to reply to Senators when next in the House.  The manner in which the Minister was spoken of on today&rsquo;s Order of Business is unfair.  It would perhaps have been better had the Senator concerned raised his issue during the final stages of the debate.   Perhaps the Leader will clarify that debate will continue on another day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues with the Leader.  When is it proposed to hold a debate on care of the elderly, which debate has been sought for some time?  The <Col N="436"/>Leader has indicated he is amenable to having such a debate.  Would it be possible to have it before the Houses rises for the summer?  Senator McFadden, other Senators and I have raised in this House the issue of the Health Information and Quality Authority standards for nursing homes, which standards are being imposed on supported care homes, which are not and were never intended or designed to be nursing homes.  This is a serious issue on which I believe we should have a discussion.  There are a number of these homes throughout the country, several of which are located in my constituency.  These homes are drawing up budgets with a view to keeping their doors open and need as soon as possible a decision in regard to the imposition of nursing home standards on supported care homes, which are not full time nursing care homes and as such these standards should never have been applied.</P>
        <P>I ask also that the Leader provide time for a further discussion on health before the Houses rises for the summer, in particular the provision of public health services across the regions.  The Government has decided not to publish the recently completed report in relation to the realignment of services in the south east.  Despite this, it announced two weeks ago, through the HSE, that Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital in County Kilkenny is to have its budget halved and the number of joint replacement operations, the hospital&rsquo;s main function, are to be halved between now and the end of the year.  Also, the number of beds at the hospital are to be cut from 51 to 31 between now and the end of the year.  It is believed &mdash; this too is my belief &mdash; that this is the thin end of the wedge for Kilcreene hospital, which is a shocking statement in respect of a facility that provides much needed public health services for the south-eastern region and is a shining light in terms of how our medical services should be run into the future.  Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital has been a huge success in terms of the work it undertakes.  I would like to see that hospital continue in operation into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to ask about progress on the Civil Partnership Bill 2010 which it is expected will come before this House prior to the summer recess.  The delay in bringing the Bill before the Oireachtas is not welcome.  It must be introduced as soon as possible.  Things are happening outside the Houses which are not helpful to the passing of legislation.  Last week, the bishops called for a free vote on the Bill.  I respect their views and they are entitled to have them.  However, this cuts both ways.  The bishops want to speak on this issue but remain silent on issues of abuse, where they have to be hauled over the coals to persuade them to express their opinion and reflect on their position on what is happening.  They do not seem to have a problem speaking out on issues such as gay partnership, which they clearly do not agree with, but it is another thing when it comes to children&rsquo;s rights and respecting children, when they are silent and their views have to be dragged from them.  I criticise what the bishops said last week.  On the other hand, I respect them for saying it.  They need to be less hypocritical and more forthcoming in general terms if they feel their opinions are required on all temporal matters.  We must either have separation of Church and State or not.  If not, they should be made to speak on all matters.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point about the State Examinations Commission is valid.  We should have a debate on this issue.  We also need to examine the issue of Irish not being compulsory at leaving certificate standard.  Lately, I have witnessed many young chaps who are struggling with Irish and are under huge pressure coming up to examinations</P>

	<P>It is irrelevant which party proposes this policy.  Young people are suffering because Irish is compulsory.  I know there are many gaeilgeoir&iacute; in the Houses but we are doing Irish no favours.  I did well in Irish in school but I believe more people would do <Col N="437"/>well if it was not compulsory.  We also need to look at how we teach civics in schools.  Conversational Irish might be brought into a civics type programme so that people can respect and understand where we come from.</P>

	<P>I welcome today&rsquo;s debate on innovation and job creation.   There is good news today of the opening of the Waterford Crystal visitor centre in the new Waterford Crystal House.  I have a personal interest in the matter as my grandfather re-opened the Waterford glass factory in the 1940s and I was sorry I could not go to the opening today.  The staff there kindly invited me and I wish them all the best for the venture.  Many of us will hope to visit it.  I certainly intend to do so in August when I will be in Waterford.  It is a really welcome innovation for job creation, tourism and selling Ireland abroad.  It is a positive development and I wish them well.</P>
        <P>I renew my call for a debate on prison overcrowding and sentencing reform.  The figures published yesterday in <i>The Irish Times </i>, showing our jail population has hit a record level, must be a real cause of concern for many of us.  For the first time, we now have more than 5,000 prisoners in the State, with nearly 1,000 on temporary release because of overcrowding.  This raises the question of how many of them should have been sent to prison in the first place.  It is pointless to send people to prison for minor offences if they are to be granted temporary release within a day and sometimes before they have served even 24 hours.  We need to review this practice.  I am glad to see the Fines Bill going through the Houses.  It is a welcome step.  However, we need to look at other forms of sentencing reform to ensure we are not sending people to jail unnecessarily and causing horrendous overcrowding.</P>
        <P>I echo Senator Norris&rsquo;s words in welcoming the announcement that the State will withdraw its appeal in the Lydia Foy case and I commend Lydia Foy on her bravery in taking the case.  I hope we will see legislation before too long recognising, in law and properly, the rights of transsexuals.</P>

	<P>In all of last week&rsquo;s manoeuvrings and shenanigans, the passing of the Croke Park agreement went unnoticed and undiscussed.  I encourage the Leader to have a debate on this and on the role and importance of the public sector and the function it performs, before the Seanad rises for the summer.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opening of the new emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  The media and newspaper campaign in recent months often prided itself on having public and private sector workers on opposite sides in television and radio studios and on the centre pages which led to a societal divide.  I hope the passing of the Croke Park deal will allow us to move on to a new level of public sector reform and agreement leading to improvements and enhancements.  It is especially important to have the new Minister of State with responsibility for public sector reform, Deputy Dara Calleary, one of the youngest Members of the D&aacute;il, appear in the House before it rises for the summer.  I welcome the passing of the Croke Park deal and pay tribute to the public sector workers who passed it and hope those who did not support it will see the light in the coming months and years following the transformation which will occur.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, MacSharry, Coghlan and Buttimer all outlined their concerns about the Bill dealing with the election of the Dublin mayor.  I understand it is at an advanced stage and if it is ordered to be taken in the D&aacute;il, we will process it as soon as possible after it has been passed.</P><Col N="438"/>
        <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be before the House before the summer recess.  It is one of the most important Bills of the year and will be included in the Order Paper to be taken in the next two or three weeks.</P>
        <P>The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced in the budget in the United Kingdom increases in VAT, made provisions on bank levies and stipulated that banks will pay the cost of regulation.  Strong views have been expressed here about the &euro;40 million it cost last year, with a possible &euro;50 million cost this year.  Most fair-minded people would say this sector, like all others, should have to pay the cost of its regulation.  It is good practice and I support the call made by many colleagues today.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle and Feeney asked for a debate on mental health services.  I also compliment the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, on the great work he is doing.  He secured a budget allocation in difficult times and I support him in all possible ways.  I will have no difficulty in asking him to update the House on the progress he is making.  Great strides are being made.  I welcome the new 105 bed unit at St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in Mullingar where the Minister of State laid the foundation stone.  I fully agree with the Deputy Leader and Senator Feeney and we will do whatever can to support the Minister of State in the great work the Government is doing.

        <P>Senators Quinn, Mooney and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in asked about the retention of central European time.  This is very worthwhile, especially coming from Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in.  We all know the sun sets in the west where there is always a longer daylight timeframe.  The proposal is very much worth our consideration and if the UK goes down this road it is correct that we should follow suit.</P><Col N="439"/>
        <P>Regarding the Irish diaspora Senator Mooney called for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House, particularly in regard to the Farmleigh convention.  All of us who were at Farmleigh must compliment every Irish man and woman who came from all over the world and hold every kind of senior position in their various countries to the motherland convention at Farmleigh.  They gave of their time and expertise to make their views known at such an important event.  The eye-opener for many colleagues who attended from the Oireachtas was the importance of the Irish diaspora and everything to do with our culture, proud tradition and heritage.  I will ask the Minister to come and debate this subject in the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senators Prendergast, Feeney and Phelan called for a debate on the HSE and everything to do with it.  All of us who were present in the House for the entire contribution of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, noted her outstanding contribution on her portfolio.  For approximately 25 minutes she gave an up to date detailed report on every area of that portfolio without having to consult any of the minutes or scripts provided for her.

        <P>Senator MacSharry spoke about the Hugh Cooney report and the group charged with the responsibility of bringing before the Houses of the Oireachtas an up to date account on the MacSharry report and the various other proposals that were before the House for this group&rsquo;s consideration.  I will make inquiries about this.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for a debate on cycling.  This is wonderful weather for anybody to get out and there is no excuse except to enjoy the proposal the Senator made to the House.  I have no difficulty in our discussing this at a future date.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris complimented the Road Safety Authority.  As Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Coghlan and many other colleagues who sat on the committee for enterprise, trade and small business know, when we worked on the insurance inquiry under my chairmanship, we started to take seriously what could be done in the matter of road deaths.  We now have the Road Safety <Col N="440"/>Authority whose chief executive and chairman can take credit for what was done but the real foundation stone on which road safety was built was that committee&rsquo;s insurance inquiry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At that time there were 550 Garda personnel in the dedicated traffic corps.  That committee got a commitment from the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, to increase the number over a four year period to 1,200, as it stands today.  It was that committee which proposed that random breath testing be introduced.  All other committees shirked that responsibility over many years.  In fairness to the former Minister, Martin Cullen, within two weeks he had that proposal through the Cabinet sub-committee and it became legislation.  That is the cornerstone and foundation of road safety as it is today.  I am very proud to be Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and be able to say I was a former chairman of that committee because 41 fewer lives have been lost in this country in recent years.  The committee never got the credit for this and I surely did not get it when I went to the polls in County Westmeath at the last general election.  Be that as it may, however, it was the right thing to do and right and courageous decisions were made by that committee at that time.  I am proud to say I was the Chairman and the colleagues who served with me on that committee also deserve great credit.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke of the announcement about Dr. Lydia Foy and everything to do with the hard fight and courageous fight she took on over many years.  I shall make inquiries about when this legislation may be taken.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for reports to be made available to colleagues in the Oireachtas when we debate very serious issues.  As I said in the House last week, I understand these reports are made available in the Library on the day they are published.  There are 33 colleagues in the library who are there to assist us in every way we need when we are preparing submissions for both Houses.  I acknowledge again on the Order of Business the great contribution they have made in recent years.  I shall update my information and make inquiries after this Order of Business.  My understanding is that all these services are available to Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to help them formulate information and get up to date reports for the debates that take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin spoke about church leaders and the Civil Partnership Bill.  Church leaders have a responsibility to look after the faithful and their flock.  I fully agree with the Senator&rsquo;s sentiments.  He spoke about growth and the forecast for the coming year, the public service and the immense contribution it is making by way of a big hit in salary, for which it is to be commended.  As Senator Carroll noted, the Croke Park agreement was possibly the most significant announcement we have seen in the lifetime of this Seanad and the 30th D&aacute;il.  I will allow time at the earliest opportunity so that we can review the findings of the agreement and see how we can enhance them, with the Minister present.</P>
        <P>Senator Phelan called for a debate on care for the elderly which I fully support.  Many colleagues made a contribution when the Minister for Health and Children was present and the subject might be included when she returns to the House over the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald asked about the timing of the Civil Partnership Bill.  I understand the Bill will be in the D&aacute;il soon and on its conclusion in that House will be introduced to the Seanad.  We will order it to be taken at the earliest opportunity, as we always do when a Bill is concluded in the D&aacute;il.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>With a deep sense of sadness I rise to pay tribute on the passing of a friend and colleague, former Senator Peter Callanan.  Peter was someone for whom I had great respect and admiration.  He was a highly intelligent and articulate Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and was a truly excellent public representative.  He was a hardworking and capable individual who was interested in getting on with things and having things done.  Born in Castlefreke, west of Clonakilty, he lived and farmed all his married life in Ballymountain, Innishannon.  He married Sheila Harrington and the couple had four sons, Gerard, Liam, David and Denis and two daughters, Deirdre and Fionnuala.  From his first election to Cork County Council in 1979 Peter served the people of Cork with tremendous dedication, perseverance and commitment.  He was re-elected at every local election until 2004 when he had to step down under the dual mandate rule which prevents Members of the Oireachtas serving on local authorities.  He was well regarded throughout his local community for his hard work, enthusiasm and warm personality.  The pipe and his smile were his trademarks, with the pioneer pin he proudly wore all his life.  He will be remembered for his unwavering courtesy and old-fashioned good manners which he displayed to those who met him.  He treated everyone with equal respect and consideration.  It was his courtesy and respectful manner that endeared him to all who knew him.</P>
        <P>Peter was elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1997 on the Agricultural Panel and subsequently re-elected in 2002.  However, his greatest electoral performance in was the 2007 Seanad election, following the reduction in the number of seats on the Fianna F&aacute;il side in the previous local elections.</P>
        <P>As a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann on three occasions, Peter was a strong champion of farmers&rsquo; rights and used his membership of the joint committees to raise matters of concern, particularly relating to agriculture, food and fisheries.  He was an excellent orator and commanded attention whenever he spoke.  He was often involved in heated discussions on matters close to his heart, both in the Seanad Chamber and at parliamentary party meetings.  He was an extremely shrewd and astute politician who worked resolutely on behalf of the people he served.  His contribution, both in public and behind the scenes, helped to raise awareness of many agricultural issues.  His only aim was to make life better for the members of his community, particularly in Cork and rural Ireland in general.  He was not afraid to be controversial or take an unpopular stand if he believed it to be the right thing to do.  Once he got his teeth into an issue, he was not a man to let go until he had taken it to the highest possible level.</P>
        <P>Peter was very honourable and a loyal public servant who served at local and national level for more than 30 years.  He was immensely popular.  I know his loss will be widely felt among his friends and colleagues.  We on his side of the House knew him to be a great servant of Fianna F&aacute;il, the party of which he was so proud.  He was a staunch defender and a great upholder of the traditional values of Fianna F&aacute;il and will be sorely missed.</P>
        <P>On a personal note, I was privileged to have served as Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann during Peter&rsquo;s tenure as a Senator.  I owe him a great deal of gratitude for the loyalty he showed and service he provided me as Leader of the House.  As an old friend said to me: &ldquo;People who are near and dear never die.&rdquo;</P><Col N="442"/>
        <P>I extend my deepest sympathy, as Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and leader of Fianna F&aacute;il Party in this House, to his wife, Sheila; his four sons, Gerald, Liam, David and Denis; his two daughters, Deirdre and Fionnuala, and extended family and friends who have come here in large numbers all the way from Cork, France and other places.  They are with us today to pay tribute to this great Irish man, a great parliamentarian, father and husband.  Go nd&eacute;ana Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam.</P>

	<P>I, too, offer my condolences to Patrick and John, Sheila and family, and all of Peter&rsquo;s friends not only from Inishannon but from across west Cork and the rest of the country.  For a youngish Fine Gaeler, I would have described Peter as  old-style Fianna F&aacute;il.  He was decent, very fair and always good company from the first day I met him in the House.  His family is well aware that I would have known a great deal about Peter on my election to the House.  My mum had great regard for him.  Peter grew up in Kilkern in Castlefreke.  Sheila grew up in Galley Head.  The light from the same lighthouse shone into my bedroom when I was growing up in west Cork all those years ago.  Therefore, we know more than enough, as the saying goes, about Peter and his family.  He was a really decent individual, for whom my family had great respect.  </P>
        <P>There were only a few years in age between Peter and my late father and they grew up only a few miles apart.  Many of the characteristics and personal traits to be found in Peter were also to be found in my dad.  During the few years I knew Peter in the House I found him to be great company.  He was a solid individual who had a wicked sense of humour.  Certainly politics never got in the way of personal friendships that he developed during the yeas.  He will be sorely missed in the House.</P>
        <P>Peter was very amused when I told him the oldest piece of political memorabilia I had was an election poster dating from 1981 with a picture of Charlie Haughey on the front and Joe Walsh and Peter Callanan, MCC, as the names of the candidates running in the election.  His response was: &ldquo;What went wrong with me after that?&rdquo;  I  was given the poster by a member of my mum&rsquo;s family who, as everybody knows, were very strong supporters of Peter Callanan, Joe Walsh and Fianna F&aacute;il in west Cork.</P>
        <P>I miss Peter.  He was a great guy.  He is missed by Members on both sides of the House of every political persuasion.  I offer my condolences to all members of his family.  I know they have suffered a huge loss.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The House is all the poorer for the absence of the late Peter Callanan whom I got to know when he came here for the first time because he asked to see me.  However, he was disappointed.  I had been speaking about a farmers&rsquo; issue on behalf of consumers and might have degraded farmers a little more than I had intended.  Peter took me to the Members&rsquo; bar &mdash; although he was a pioneer &mdash; and made sure I knew his views, but he did it in such a manner that we became good friends to the extent that he was disappointed once again when he discovered that I had travelled to Cork with my wife and not met him.  I told him my wife suffered from a very severe illness called golf and that we had gone to play golf in Kinsale and stayed in Inchydoney.  He said I could not have got there without passing through Inishannon, unless I had got lost along the way.  l told him that I had missed him, but he insisted that if I ever travelled down again I would not miss him.</P>
        <P>Peter was very proud of his locality.  He was also very proud to be be a Member of this House.  He was very proud of the work he had done for his locality, region and Fianna F&aacute;il.  There was no time when he was not willing to argue the case forcefully and strongly, but he always did so with wonderful humour.  He was the sort of man one looked forward to bumping <Col N="443"/>into in the corridors of the Houses because he always had a smile on his face.  Even though he felt very strongly about an issue, he argued the point with good humour and passion.</P>
        <P>When we talked about children, Peter talked about the fact that he had one more child.  He was very proud of his four boys and two girls.  It is such a pleasure to have so many of them present today.  He talked about how they had travelled the world, how much they had seen and how home was always home because Sheila had made it so.</P>
        <P>The week before Christmas 12 months ago Peter told me he was due to go into hospital Christmas week for a procedure.  I was concerned about him and when I telephoned a few days later, he was back home after having had the procedure.  Sheila answered the telephone and was obviously delighted that he had come out of the local hospital with a smile on his face.</P>
        <P>Peter was the sort of man one loved to meet.  He would be very proud of what is happening here today.  An American short story writer, O. Henry, wrote a story about an older lady.  The invitation to her funeral had been issued and all of her friends who had not seen her for many years came to her home only for her to meet them at the front door.  They thought it was her funeral, but she said she would not miss it for anything because she wanted to hear what they would say about her.  It is a lovely story which reminds me of Peter because I am sure he is looking down on us.  I am sure also that he is looking at his friends and family and smiling to himself.  He is smiling at the thought of the stories that will be told here today.</P>
        <P>The wonderful tribute paid to him at his funeral in Innishannon by Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; brought tears to our eyes, but it also brought smiles to our faces because he knew Peter so well.  He expressed pride in Peter, as many of us wished to do.  Peter Callanan joined this House, was re-elected and re-elected again.  He was a committed participant in the work of this House.  We were very proud of him.  He was very proud of being a Member of this House, but he was even more proud of being a member of the family that he and Sheila developed.</P>
        <P>Looking down on us today, I am sure he misses this place, but I am also sure that he is in a better place.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

	<P>I join with others who have spoken in remembering Senator Peter Callanan, a most valued colleague in this House.  I remember him with great affection, as a party leader and as an ordinary Member coming in here for the first time three years ago.  He was most welcoming, most interested in our backgrounds and solicitous for our welfare.  He had a great sense of humour and was an interesting man to have chat with about the vagaries of what goes on in the corridors of power.  I enjoyed his company on the few occasions when I had an opportunity to chat with him.</P>
        <P>Others have pointed out that he gave considerable service to the people of his locality and the people of County Cork from 1979, when he went into local politics.  I am sure he will be remembered for many years because of that.  His loss has been felt most by his family, and it is very moving to see so many of them here today for these tributes.  I assure them Peter is remembered here with great affection, but also as somebody who contributed hugely to the work of this House, and whose loss is very strongly felt.</P>
        <P>I was not aware that he hailed originally from Castlefreke in County Cork.  I do not have any connections with that area, but I know it having been there a few times in recent years.  It is a most beautiful part of the country and I am sure that he treasured his connections with that place.</P>
        <P>I join with other colleagues in expressing my sadness and the sympathies of the Labour Party to his family on his untimely death last year, and to the leader of the House and to Members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on their loss.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I first became aware of Peter Callanan as a long-standing member of Cork County Council, many years before I became involved in public life, when I used to read his name and see his photograph in what was then known as the <i>Cork Examiner</i>.  When I was subsequently elected to Cork City Council, there would have been joint meetings of the city and county council.  While Peter Callanan represented and celebrated much of what was rural life and sought to retain that, Innishannon itself is only 14 miles outside of Cork city.  He protected a rural community with a fast burgeoning suburban area on its doorstep.</P>
        <P>It was an area in which we had a strong common cause.  He was a man with an independent mind and he was particularly concerned about a proposal for hundreds of houses to be built in his local area, something that never came to pass.  While the temptation is to go along with a proposal for houses that leads to development and jobs, he had a sense that this proposal would irreversibly change the character of the area and the community in which he lived.  He also had a good sense of its geography, as the proposed development was in a flood plain.  Given the subsequent incidents of flooding along the River Bandon, which also flows through Innishannon, he seemed to have a better sense of that than many people with degrees in engineering, planning or public administration.</P>
        <P>He believed in who he was, where he lived, what he acquired and a sense of courage and confidence that comes from living such a life.  To have done so with such good humour meant that he was well thought of by those who interacted with him in public life, be they members of all political parties or members of the public with whom he had such great affinity.  It is only right and fitting that we in this House should mark that career, especially in its latter stages when he was re-elected twice at an age when many of us are often considering whether we should still be involved in public life.  That he continued to be a Member of this House with such verve, enthusiasm and pride exemplified a quality of public life to which many of us should aspire.

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start by quoting the great and famous poet, Thackeray, to commemorate Peter&rsquo;s passing:</P>
        <P LI="1">We are atoms that float down the river of years,</P>
        <?oasys _mv-3- ?><P LI="1" el="0">On our way to the ultimate sea,</P>

        <?oasys _mv-3- ?><P LI="1" el="0">We are friends in the far reaching past.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I stand here today to celebrate Peter&rsquo;s life out of joy rather than sadness and to acknowledge his great contribution.  He was a family man first and foremost and I extend my sympathies to his wife Sheila, his sons Gerard, Liam, David and Denis, his daughters Deirdre and Fionnuala, his brothers John and Paddy and his 18 grandchildren.  The greatest epitaph to Senator Callanan is the fact that all his family are here today with us to pay tribute to him and celebrate his life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Peter came from the parish of Ardfield.  He played football in his younger days with a club called St. James&rsquo;s.  He was keenly involved with the old NFA, which was subsequently the IFA.  His nominating body to the Senate was ICOS.  He was a spokesman on agriculture in this <Col N="445"/>House and a close confidant of the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, the former Deputy Joe Walsh.  He was a household name in the town of Bandon.  Peter was first elected to Cork County Council in 1979 and he increased his vote every time he stood for the council after that, and got close to 3,500 first preferences at one stage.</P>
        <P>Apart from being a great family man, he was a dedicated Christian and a great believer in Padre Pio.  The oration given by Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; at the church in Innishannon on the day of his funeral does much greater justice to his life than anything I can say here today.   He loved his pipe.  He was a life-long member of the Pioneer Association.  Many people might not know that he was a very capable dancer.  Somebody referred to him in the church in Innishannon as &ldquo;Tippy Toes&rdquo;.  For a big man, he was very light on his feet.  We should remember the fond things about Peter.</P>
        <P>I met him for the first time in 1969 as a gars&uacute;n at a convention in Cork South-West.  I got to know him better at the first European elections in 1974.  I met him in Schull at a Comhairle Cheantar meeting and we became friends.  There were times when Peter was with Joe Walsh during elections in that side of the constituency, but we never fell out over it.  When the election was over, we were always friends and always had a chat.</P>
        <P>He was elected here in 1997 on his second attempt.  He lost out in 1993 by a fraction of a vote on the agricultural panel.</P>
      
        <P>Peter came to me some months later, having signed up for his salary here and told me he had received a letter telling him he needed a PPS number and asked me what it was.  I said that surely he had a PPS number.  He told me that he struggled in farming all his life and had never paid tax.  He said that if anything he was owed money for raising a family on a mountainy farm in west Cork.  At first I thought he was joking, but he did not have a PPS number until he came here.  He was very annoyed that having been elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann he was dragged into the tax net.</P>
        <P>I was elected chairman of Cork County Council on 13 July 1989 and Peter Callanan was very ill at the time.  Peter was in the Mercy Hospital and could not attend a party meeting held a few days prior to 13 July.  He attended on 13 July to vote and he was elected vice chairman.  Some years later he told me he had been on his uppers at the time and fighting for his life &mdash; he was seriously ill &mdash; but that because he was vice chairman he had to attend functions that I could not attend in Ireland and abroad, which gave him great impetus to go forward.  He was brilliant at it.</P>
        <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Peter will be remembered for how he contributed in a quiet way.  He had a great knowledge of agriculture, rural life and issues such as rural planning and he fought for them.  Peter would wander quietly around the streets of Bandon, perhaps calling up to the convent for a cup of tea and attending the local church.  That was how he held his clinics.  I do not think Peter held a formal clinic in the Munster Arms or in Innishannon.  He moved among the people and that was reflected in the fantastic vote he received.  Peter eventually entered the Seanad in 1997 and was re-elected in 2002.  As the Leader stated, his greatest political battle was to get re-elected from a very strong field in the election of 2007.  That campaign was extremely difficult for all of us who went through it but Peter had an uncanny knack of getting votes.  It was like the flying column in west Cork in the old days &mdash; and Peter was very republican &mdash; as he poked out votes in most unusual places.  I did an intense canvass, not for the first time as I did the Seanad trail three times, and Peter rang me on an almost daily basis.  On one occasion, halfway through the campaign, I told him that I had good news as I thought he would be elected.  He told me he was very worried so I explained that I had been with X, Y and Z in the previous week and that I could not understand how he was <Col N="446"/>picking up votes.  These votes were not all Fianna F&aacute;il votes as we know from how the votes panned out.  He achieved this against the grain and this is a proud moment.</P>
        <P>I feel no sorrow today; the sorrow is behind me.  I feel joy for what Peter Callanan gave us as a person, a county councillor and a Senator.  I have no doubt he is smiling down on us doing the spadework while he is relaxed, smoking a pipe with a wry smile in his eye.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>I want to be associated with the tributes paid to the late great Peter Callanan.  I got to know Peter quite well during my first Seanad campaign in 2002.  Everywhere I went, Peter seemed to be there before me and I had to wait outside the door for quite a length of time on some occasions.  I got to know him particularly well during the 2002 to 2007 Seanad and became very close to him during this Seanad, as I am Whip.  Peter and I had many meetings at which he made apologies for not being able to attend but he was always available when he could be.</P>
        <P>I express my deep sympathy to his wife Sheila and to his family, of which he was very proud.  No matter when you were summoned to his office, the door would be locked and for some reason there was a smell of smoke although it is banned in the building.  Invariably, every conversation would end up with him speaking about one member of his family or another.  He was very proud of his family and I am delighted to see them here today.  I know they miss him terribly.  We in this House also miss him for his good wit and good humour.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim comhbhr&oacute;n le baintreach Peter Callanan, Sheila agus a chlann as ucht a bh&aacute;is.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; an-chairdi&uacute;il leis le fada an l&aacute;.  I express my sincere sympathy to the Callanan family: Peter&rsquo;s wife, Sheila; his brothers John and Patrick; his sons Gerard, Liam, David and Denis; his daughters Deirdre and Fionnuala; and his extended family.  I had many things in common with Peter as we both entered public life in 1979 when he was elected to Cork County Council and I was elected to Westmeath County Council and Mullingar Town Council, and we were both elected to the Seanad in 1997.</P>
        <P>Peter had many unique qualities and one that stands out was something to which Senator Wilson referred.  When you entered his office the television would be turned up high and Peter would be on the nebuliser.  After a few minutes he would take it off, stand up and say he had to go for medicine, which meant he was going out to smoke his pipe.  He was a phenomenal vote getter.  In 1999 he received well in excess of 3,400 votes, which was a huge mandate for anyone to receive.</P>
        <P>Peter Callanan had many strong aspects to his character including, as has been referred to, his dedication to his wife and family.  There is no question but that they were always on the tip of his tongue.  He also had a great love of farming and Senator Quinn referred to the earwigging he received from Peter after making a certain comment.  Peter was very defensive about the farming community but at the same time he was positive about its shortcomings because he was a very fair man.</P>
        <P>When Peter said, &ldquo;come here, I want you&rdquo; in his best west Cork accent and with an impish smile you could be sure he had a sc&eacute;al to tell.  He would tell it and then ask you what you thought.  If you responded, he would tell you that was not quite how he took it, so you never knew what he was thinking in such circumstances.</P>
        <P>Peter was a Whip&rsquo;s dream.  Every morning, when the bell rang to call the House together, the usual arrivals were Peter Callanan, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, our recently departed friend, Kieran Phelan and Senator Larry Butler.  Peter and Kieran would sit side by side and <Col N="447"/>joke and I hope they are joking today and thinking of us all down here.  Peter was a phenomenal orator and had a great command of the English language.  He had great delivery and there was great content in what he had to say.</P>
        <P>I knew much about Peter&rsquo;s health because on many occasions he came to me about it, not that I was a doctor but from my previous occupation he thought I knew a little.  Quite often, when he contacted me by phone he told me that he did not think he would make the game today or next week, which meant he was in hospital.  Nevertheless, he carried his illness with great dignity and fortitude.  At the end, he would phone to say he did not think he could make it for the Order of Business but that he was here if he was really needed.</P>
        <P>Much has been said about Peter and to say it now would be to repeat it.  This House is all the poorer for his passing, as is public life.  The big losers are public life, all of us in the House and his wife and family whom he loved dearly.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>Like other Senators, I join in the tributes to our late friend and colleague, Peter Callanan.  We shared certain things in common, not least the fact we were both elected to our respective county councils on the same day.  As Senator Glynn said, I remember subsequently looking up some of the votes which people received and saw the huge support Peter received and continued to receive throughout his time there.  That was a testament to his popularity and hard work in the area.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, I got to know Peter while attending conferences, where he was always an articulate and intelligent contributor, but more so when we ended up on the same panel in the 1997 Seanad election.  It is fair to say he was a formidable competitor.  When I listened to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan reminding us of the comments at mass that he was referred to as &ldquo;Tippy Toes&rdquo; because of his dancing skills, it would be fair to say that for those of us in his slipstream going to councillors &mdash; Peter had been there before us &mdash; the councillors we were visiting were as impressed with him as his dancing partners were with his dancing abilities.  All his dancing partners were women.</P>
        <P>In 2005 Senator Norris tabled the Civil Partnership Bill.  I was the spokesperson on justice.  Suffice to say, Peter was not at all impressed when he felt we might support the Bill.  He came to me and subsequently it was agreed that we would leave it to rest on the Order Paper and that there would no vote one way or the other.  I and some of my colleagues will miss him and his contributions to that debate in the next month or so.</P>
        <P>As anyone who visited him knew, Peter was a man who had great pride in his family, as every Member here has testified.  He also had great loyalty to his party and locality.  Anybody who visited him could not but come away with an awareness of his breadth of knowledge on the history of the area, his republican ethos and his strong family and Christian values.  In many ways he was an example to us and t&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte go bhfuil s&eacute; i measc na n-aingeal agus na naomh ar neamh.</P>

	<P>I rise to join with colleagues in paying tribute to the late Senator Peter Callanan.  I knew him before I became a Member of the D&aacute;il or of this House and I always had long conversations with him.  His knowledge of agriculture, especially tillage, was phenomenal.  He excelled in it and contributed widely to that debate.  When I became a Member of the D&aacute;il I was on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, on which he served.  I was the Whip and he was a pleasure to work with.  His contributions were many and varied.  He took on all the vested interests which appeared before the committee and if they thought <Col N="448"/>they were going to have an easy time at the expense of the farming community by the time they were leaving they knew a lot different.</P>
        <P>Any time he passed through my native village of Knock he always called.  He was never in a hurry.  My wife Kathleen also enjoyed his company.  He regaled us with stories of what went on down in Cork and what was going on.  Kathleen and I knew city hall better than he knew it himself.  He told us of the different people he had to go to meet and how he had to spend a day in it.  It is a massive building.  One could see he was working for the people and that they respected him for it.  One could see why he got such a vote in the local elections.</P>
        <P>I knew about his dancing prowess because a man from Union Hall &mdash; we have a lot of friends in west Cork &mdash; and I were talking about Peter one night.  He asked if I knew Peter was a great dancer.  I looked at him because Peter would not strike one as a great dancer as he had a fair amount of weight on him.  He said he would turn on a sixpence.  The next time I met him I accosted him with that.  He said, &ldquo;Who the hell told you that?&rdquo;.  That was Peter.  He was great company, a great Member of this House and a good companion.  To his wife Sheila, his family, Gerard, Liam, David, Denis, Deirdre and Fionnuala, and his brother and sisters, I offer my sincere sympathy.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>I join in the many tributes which have been paid to the late Peter Callanan.  To his wife Sheila, his four sons and two daughters and other members of his family I offer my sincere sympathy.  Peter had great qualities.  First, he was a great farmer.  I do not want to repeat too much of what has been said, but he had a wonderful knowledge of farming and other matters far beyond farming.  Peter was a very fluid speaker.  He could always stand up in the Seanad and at the agriculture debates in Agriculture House and was to the fore putting forward the farmers&rsquo; point of view and standing by it.</P>
        <P>Everybody is telling little jokes about Peter, but I have no serious jokes to tell, other than he and I being on the Agricultural Panel.  Like Senators Ellis and Carty we were spinning yarns.  Peter was getting votes from one councillor and I was getting votes from another.  That was all good fun.  Peter and I were great friends and always enjoyed meeting in this House, on the Seanad campaign, conferences and other places.</P>
        <P>It is very strange.  The year 1979 must have been wonderful for newcomers to the councils.  I was elected in 1979 to Monaghan County Council as well.  Peter Callanan, God rest him, was elected that year.  Peter Callanan was a great friend to us all and once again to his wife Sheila and his family I offer my sincere sympathy.  May he rest in peace.</P>

T&aacute; taith&iacute; againn go l&eacute;ir go pearsanta gur sheas s&eacute; an f&oacute;d nuair a bh&iacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; leis agus gur thug s&eacute; an deashampla.  Ba dhuine &eacute; a raibh prionsabal i gc&oacute;na&iacute; i gceist aige in aon chomhr&aacute; n&oacute; aon d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sa Teach seo agus sin ceann de na c&uacute;iseanna go raibh mise chomh m&oacute;r&aacute;lach as an Chorca&iacute;och sin.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that this opportunity has arisen to give us the time to pay tribute to a very special gentleman.  I am pleased that Sheila and all the Callanan family are here to hear those tributes.  It is not necessary because they will be well aware of the great respect which Peter had in his native Cork.  One need only look at the huge crowds which turned up to his funeral, <Col N="449"/>which by its very nature had to be sad.  However, I do not think anyone left without being aware of how lucky we were to have a man of that calibre as a colleague in this House.</P>
        <P>A number of speakers referred to his agricultural background.  There is no doubt that Peter was of the soil.  The land was everything for him in so far as identity was concerned and he took advantage of every opportunity to ensure those who loved and cultivated the land were well represented.</P>
        <P>I had the opportunity to deliver an oration at his funeral.  I made a point on that day which has been running through my mind ever since.  In many ways, Peter Callanan was an antidote to the negative and contrived image which is sometimes used to describe public representatives.  We all feel personally hurt and, often, helpless when we see the profession being denigrated.  However, Peter Callanan never felt helpless or vulnerable.</P>
        <P>Like others, I was summoned to his office on numerous occasions to discuss issues that had arisen in the House or were reported in the newspaper.  In debating these issues, he was always anxious to be clear on where he stood and to ascertain my views.  The cut and thrust of debate must be maintained wherever one serves in a public capacity because the exercise of democracy requires it by its very nature.  At the same time, however, we hope and pray we do not deliberately offend others when we express our views.  I ask my colleagues to think about the contributions that Peter Callanan made in this House.  In every way, he epitomised these qualities.  I never saw him deliberately personalise an issue to the point where he became insulting.  He expressed his views with a strength which came from his background.</P>
        <P>One word which has not yet been used to describe Peter Callanan is &ldquo;republican&rdquo;.  He was republican to the core.  He believed in everything we stand for in terms of building our own Republic, controlling our own destiny and ensuring the defence of our sovereignty.  These issues made up 90% of the discussions I had with Peter Callanan.  They were not peripheral to Peter; they were the basis for everything he believed this nation and State stand for.</P>
        <P>I hope and pray that Sheila and the rest of the Callanan family will understand that Peter was held in the highest esteem by his colleagues in this House, the D&aacute;il and the local authorities for one special reason, namely, what he said, he believed, and what he believed, he said.  What more can we ask of any man?</P>
        <P>I sat near him for more than ten years and can genuinely say he was an iconic figure in every sense of the word.  I would like to think that Sheila and all the family will have happy memories of and good friends in this House.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

	<P>I did not work with Peter in this House for as long as previous speakers but I had the pleasure of knowing him when I was a county councillor and he was a Seanad candidate.  For all that he was a Cork man, which he could not help, he was extremely popular in County Kerry.  Along with Joe Walsh, he was a great friend of my late cousin and former Deputy and Senator, Kit Ahern.</P>
        <P>Our offices shared a corridor and shortly after I arrived he entered my office to tell me he was still learning even though he was in his third term in the Seanad.  He offered to cut my learning short by guiding me through the system.  He acted as my mentor for my first couple of months in the House and, after three or four months, he looked me in the eye and asked me how I was getting on.  When I told him I was getting on fairly well, he said that, as my mentor, he would tell me if he saw me going wrong or off the rails.  That was a wake up call at a time when I was perhaps celebrating too much my late arrival to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Peter was also a desperate rogue.  I met several members of his family and I do not think he left it after him.  He used to visit the smoking area of the Members&rsquo; bar.  He was a lifelong pioneer but some of us drank stuff that did not contain caffeine.  He did not need alcohol <Col N="450"/>because there was a twinkle in his eye when he spun his yarns about the old times.  He was a great man and I miss him.  It must be a proud day for his family to hear the wonderful tributes from Senators who knew him much better than I.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the many tributes being paid to Peter Callanan.  Peter was elected in 1997 and, for his first several months in the Seanad, shared an office with me and the late Tony Kett.  This experience consolidated my friendship with Peter.  Whenever I had a problem, I would go to Peter because he had a way of assessing situations and judging characters.  As I found out on numerous occasions, he was never wrong.</P>
        <P>Peter loved his family.  I used to get a weekly commentary about one or other member of his family and whatever the issue, I would hear about it.  I got to know Sheila and the rest of the family very well.</P>
        <P>I greatly admired Peter&rsquo;s community spirit.  He loved his area and being involved in local issues.  He was able to raise these issues on a national stage because of his intimate knowledge of agriculture and the land.  He did not need to read the books because he was able to assess the situation from the ground.  He took a practical approach to what I felt were real politics.  This ability was demonstrated by the votes he won as a county councillor.  He would never have lost that seat if he had been allowed to keep a dual mandate.</P>
        <P>He was very popular in his own area.  That says it all about politics.  His was the kind of old school Fianna F&aacute;il politics that I love and miss.  He will always be in my heart and he loved being in this House.  Even when he was ill, he would nonetheless make the journey to Leinster House.  We do not often find the likes of Peter anymore.  I miss him terribly and will always remember him as a good politician and a loyal friend.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

	<P>I ask to be associated with the vote of sympathy to Sheila and the rest of the Callanan family on the death of Peter Callanan.  Peter occupied the office across the corridor from mine.  As we all know, he had the windows of his office sealed shut either to keep out the cold or to keep in the smoke.  He was a perfect gentleman although he would not put a tooth in it when he told us whether he agreed with the comments we made in the House.  People appreciated that.  To his wife and family, I extend my sympathy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>While this is a difficult occasion for Senators on all sides, I hope, as many speakers have stated, it will bring some comfort to Sheila and the extended family of the late Peter Callanan.  I am in a unique position, having known Peter since I was elected as a young man to the committee of 15 of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party national executive when he was the constituency delegate from Cork South-West.  I find myself back in the Seanad as a result of a by-election which was caused by Peter&rsquo;s death.  I now sit on the panel on which he sat.  Therefore, I have mixed feelings today as we pay genuine and deserved tributes to Peter in the presence of his extended family.</P>
        <P>Many Members had certain things in common with Peter.  My wife, like Peter&rsquo;s, is called Sheila and comes from west Cork, from where Peter came.  We often talked about this.  I was always told to clear my diary for the first week in August to attend the regatta in Castletownbere.  I used to take the opportunity of our visit to the regatta to meet Peter in Bandon.</P>
        <P>Senators are correct that Peter had a twinkle in his eye and an immense capacity to identify and cut through issues.  He often conveyed great strength both inside and outside the House when speaking on issues about which he felt strongly.</P><Col N="451"/>
        <P>I used to admire the timbre in Peter&rsquo;s voice.  I told him on more than one occasion that if he had not had the calling of agriculture and the Seanad, he would have made a brilliant broadcaster because he commanded a presence when he rose to speak and his words were always full of substance.</P>
        <P>I extend my deepest sympathies to Peter&rsquo;s family on their awful loss.  The gap he leaves behind will never be filled, particularly for Sheila who knew him first and all his extended family.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senators in paying tribute to the late Peter Callanan who was a great friend to me when I entered the House as a relatively young Senator in 2002.  The first thing I learned about Peter was that he was not a member of any clique.  We have all observed various cliques around the Houses during the years.  The best tribute I can pay is one which previous speakers noted, namely, that Peter had a personal relationship with everybody and a kind word and good advice for everyone.  He taught me how to listen by using both ears and one mouth proportionately when taking account of any situation.</P>
        <P>I will not be repetitive and instead will simply extend to Sheila, Gerard, Liam, David, Denis, Deirdre and Fionnuala my sincerest and deepest sympathy.  It was a pleasure to know Peter.  As the Leader correctly stated, those who are near and dear shall never die.  I will be forever grateful for some of the tricks of the trade Peter generously shared with me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I was fortunate to have known the late Peter Callanan for 24 years.  When I first arrived in the Innishannon area in 1986, I rang home and excitedly told my family I had met a local councillor.  My father quickly responded that he had known Peter Callanan for much longer than I had and was good friends with him, although I believe he was waiting for me to make that call.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to have known Peter as a good friend.  While we admire many of those who speak in Irish in the House with a beautiful blas, cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa, not only was Peter fluent in agriculture but he was also fluent in politics.  When he spoke on a subject politically and at one to one level, his words had an undertone, a modulation and an insight.  Anyone listening to the conversation could pick up items of benefit to them.  They were like jewels which Peter freely passed on.</P>
        <P>Peter also passed on friendship freely, for which I was grateful.  We often had a coffee and a chat and when I wanted to speak to him personally he was always available.  I miss Peter and extend my sympathy to Sheila and all the Callanan family.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I got to know Peter in 1991 when he was canvassing with his son, Denis.  I still remember him coming into my home, taking a seat and producing a pipe.  He struck me as a person who was there to entertain me.  He was not in any hurry and when my wife produced a cake, he had a large slice of it.  When she told him the cake came from a previous canvasser &mdash; the person in question has also passed away since &mdash; Peter said it was lovely and asked if he could take some with him to give to someone else.</P>
        <P>Peter was a man of great warmth who had a tremendous heart.  He often said he loved his work in the Seanad and described it as his life.  If he started to tell a story, one had to be prepared to listen for at least half an hour.  He would talk about the hospitals he visited and what he told the doctors to look for when they could not find anything, and he was right.  That was Peter.</P>
        <P>Peter loved his native county and often spoke about it.  He was also a man of tremendous faith who loved his family, about whom he often spoke, and people in general.  He was a genuine person and once told me not to demean anyone.  I would sum up his attitude by saying <Col N="452"/>he never looked down on anybody.  The only time he would look down on one was to help to pick one up.  That is the type of person he was.</P>
        <P>Peter loved the camaraderie and competitiveness in the House and made lasting friendships here.  I will tell one funny story about him.  One night he and Senator Francis O&rsquo;Brien were in a local hostelry.  Although Peter did not drink, he hung on and drank a lemonade or something similar.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien also hung on and I asked myself which of the two would stick out the evening the longest.  Peter finally decided to go to bed, at which point Francis asked me if he could have the vote back.</P>
        <P>One day, when Peter read a little poem which hangs in my office &mdash; I got it from a priest &mdash; he asked if he could have a copy.  It reads something like this:</P>
        <P LI="1">Green leaves may wither,</P>
       <?oasys _mv-3- ?><P LI="1" el="0">Fond hearts may die,</P>
        <?oasys _mv-3- ?><P LI="1" el="0">Friends may forget you,</P>
        <?oasys _mv-3- ?><P LI="1" el="0">But never will I.</P>
        <?oasys _mv-3- ?><P LI="1" el="0">When the Angelus bells are ringing</P>
        <?oasys _mv-3- ?><P LI="1" el="0">And calling me to pray,</P>
        <?oasys _mv-3- ?><P LI="1" el="0">I will always think of you,</P>
        <?oasys _mv-3- ?><P LI="1" el="0">Although I may be miles and miles away.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I hope Peter has that poem and expect he is probably reading it now.  The best thing one can say about anybody can be put in three words.  To sum up Peter, he was &ldquo;a sound man&rdquo;.  I extend my deepest sympathy to his family on their sad loss.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, extend my sympathy to the family of Peter Callanan on his sad passing.  As a Cork man and Kerry man, respectively, Peter and I had much rivalry and when Kerry inevitably beat Cork, he always had a kind word.  I will always remember his ferocious handshake.  Being greeted by him was like gripping iron.  When Peter spoke about his illness, it was hard to imagine that a man with such a vice-like grip would pass on to the other side.  Like my colleagues, I miss Peter.  People will recognise the chair in which he always sat as they will have seen him seated here on television broadcasts.  Today, Peter is smiling down on us as we speak fondly of him.  He was one of life&rsquo;s true gentlemen. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my sympathy to Sheila, Peter&rsquo;s wife, and the other members of his family.  Peter was a wonderful friend and made many friends in the House.  He brought great honour to his family and the local authorities on which he served for a long time.  He also showed great enthusiasm for his native County Cork.</P>
        <P>Peter had the ideal job and regarded serving in the Seanad as an important means of doing things for his local area.  He also served the farming community extremely well in this House.  As previous speakers have verified this, I will not dwell on it.  I express my sympathy to the Callanan family on their great loss.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the late Peter Callanan, whom I knew for approximately 25 years of our shared political lives.  I listened with interest to all the very genuine tributes that have been paid from all sides of the House.  I thank the Chathaoirleach for giving me time for more than a few sentences, but If I had to sum up the character of Peter Callanan in one sentence, I would say his soul, be it mortal or political, was never for sale.  He was a man of deep principle which, sadly, is very rare in political life.  He often spoke to me about the difficulties he had in his own political party during the course <Col N="453"/>of one Administration, the pressure under which he came and the attempts made to get him to change his mind from time to time.  However, he always held firm because he was of such firm conviction and sincerity that he could not be purchased.  I remember him very much for this.</P>
        <P>We had numerous conversations during our time on Cork County Council, in particular its committee on agriculture and then during our times here together in Leinster House.  Many speakers mentioned that he did not drink, yet for a man who did not drink he spent an extraordinary amount of time in the D&aacute;il bar.  When we had finished there, we would adjourn to the alternative D&aacute;il bar, the former Power&rsquo;s Hotel.  His interest in agriculture, rural and community affairs, and political life in the broadest sense always came to the fore.  One would always have very interesting and charming conversations with Peter.</P>
        <P>While Peter very much enjoyed his role a Member of the Oireachtas and contributed very deeply to the work of this House and the various committees on which he served, above all he loved being a county councillor.  He was a premier league-supreme county councillor.  Unfortunately, he was never chairman of Cork County Council; he was vice chairman on a number of occasions.  However, he chaired council meetings and offered profound and advanced views on local authorities and how they should develop and grow.  While I have very positive memories of his life and career here in the Oireachtas, above all I remark on his skill as a councillor and someone who had a genuine vision of how the local authorities could ensure Ireland and rural areas in particular would grow.</P>
        <P>Peter persevered through enormous problems with illness.  I recall as vividly as if it happened yesterday the day in the summer of 1989 when he opened the Mallow international folk festival.  Some of his family members might have been with me on that day.  At that stage he was very seriously ill.  I walked from the venue of the opening ceremony to the Central Hotel in Mallow with him.  While it must have been a distance of no more than 200 yards, it took us approximately an hour because the man was in extremely serious pain and suffering from grave illness.  That night I thought I would never see him again.  It is an extraordinary testimony to his courage, hope, belief and religious faith that not only did we see him again, but he also battled back and had the ultimate political achievement of winning a seat in this House.  That is something from which we can all learn.  No matter how high the fence or how long the odds, if a person believes and genuinely hopes, things can improve.  Many inside and outside this House took great consolation from hearing stories about Peter overcoming his illness.</P>
        <P>I have nothing but the happiest memories of Peter.  May he rest in peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in extending my sympathy to Mrs. Callanan and the family.  I had the pleasure of knowing the late Peter Callanan before I became a Member of this House.  He was a very genuine, sincere and caring man who was full of humour and very fair.  He had the great ability to put things very succinctly.  There was many a day when I was giving the Government side a hard time and he would call me at the corner going out of the door and say: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go too far the next day or you mightn&rsquo;t be here the day after; you might be suspended.&rdquo;  There was many a cup of tea I had with him when he calmed me down on occasions when I got a little excited.  He was very proud of his family and the role they played in his life.  He was very proud of the involvement of his sons and daughter in Valley Rovers in playing hurling and camogie.</P>
        <P>One of his lasting legacies to me was to convert me to buying a different model in car.  We had the distinction of driving the same make of car, a Renault.  On one of the last times I talked to him he said: &ldquo;Would you ever change to the Laguna because you&rsquo;ll be killed some day, the way you drive.&rdquo;  I will always be indebted to him for this.  He was a man who had great faith.  As someone who had been in a seminary, he could never understand how I had ever been <Col N="454"/>ordained, given my performances here.  He always left me with a great sense of religion.  In one of my last discussions with him he said: &ldquo;If we haven&rsquo;t got faith and we haven&rsquo;t got prayer, we&rsquo;ve nothing.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I express my deepest sympathies to the Callanan family.  Peter had a great smile.  He was a rogue, but a nice one and a good Cork man.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my sympathy to Mrs. Callanan and her family on the death of Peter.  I met Peter on the very first day I came to this House.  I came here in tremendous sadness after a very sad experience in my life.  He was very sweet and decent to me.  I will never forget him for as long as I live.  I went on to tell him that my wedding reception had been in Innishannon which bound me to him forever.  We also stayed in Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel where I would meet him every morning.  He would always impart some wise word of wisdom to me.  I miss him very much from this House and he will always be remembered fondly.  God bless all his family.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to reminisce about Peter.  He had a tremendous impact on my formative years in this House.  I became a Member eight years ago.  Like Peter, I was elected on the Agricultural Panel and came from a very strong farming background.  He represented a generation of Irish people who are becoming scarce.  Two years ago my father who would have been approximately the same age as Peter passed away.  Peter was a particular source of comfort to me afterwards and we had many discussions about it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On several occasions he tried his best to get me off the cigarettes.  A few moments ago I had to leave to meet a group outside and I found myself in the car park, which is where I often met Peter.  Most Senators would meet him in the ante-room outside here or in the car park, where he would be smoking his pipe and he would have a word of wisdom.  He used to look at me over the glasses and say, &ldquo;Come here, young man, I want to have a chat with you about something.&rdquo;  We exchanged many words in this House.  He had a strong interest in tillage and, in particular, sugar beet production.  When I was newly elected, the sugar factory in Carlow closed and Peter toed the Government line.  I know that he believed in many of the sentiments I expressed in that argument.</P>
        <P>I had the pleasure of meeting Peter during the last Seanad election campaign.  From time to time we all meet on the road while travelling the country.  I met Peter in Hayes Hotel on the square in Thurles, a famous place.  We had dinner together in the middle of the day.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed the upcoming Seanad election, in which we were on the same panel.  In the most unusual of elections one does not really compete with individuals from other parties but with individuals within one&rsquo;s own party.  Peter was worried, as we all are at election time.  The next time I saw him was at the count with his daughter who I believe is in the Visitors Gallery.  I cannot remember her name, but there was a sense of relief.  Senator Bradford, Peter and I were elected after the one count as Nos. 7, 8 and 9.  His family had a sense of satisfaction on his re-election.  I also felt satisfaction on his election because I had followed the advice he had given to me and there was as good a scratch as any Fianna F&aacute;il member had ever received from me.  In a Seanad election every vote counts.</P>
        <P>I am not surprised that Senators spoke about dancing because Peter was always light on his feet and tipped his toes as he went along.  I remember having a deep discussion with him one day about ploughing.  I have two older brothers who are farmers.  My father and older brothers would never let me near a plough for fear I might do damage, but Peter decided to tell me <Col N="455"/>about some of the intricacies.  I am only sorry he did not tell me about some of the intricacies of dancing, as it might have been of more benefit to me.  I could certainly do with some advice on the matter.</P>

I had driven through Innishannon but decided to go back up the hill to the church.  I parked my car, but as there was no one there, I did not really know where I was going.  I went to the new part of the cemetery and found his grave.  I had a little chat with him.</P>
        <P>I extend sincere sympathy to Peter&rsquo;s wife, Sheila, and his children.  I know he has siblings because there is a man in the front row of the Visitors Gallery who, as we say in south Kilkenny, has the head of him.  I imagine it is Peter&rsquo;s brother.  I extend sincere sympathy to all of them on Peter&rsquo;s passing.</P>

We all felt close to him.  I came into the House with him in 1997.  He used to tell me about what happened at party headquarters and I probably had an affinity with him.  We were always able to identify with one another on such matters.  He certainly loved the land and everybody who earned their living from it.  He was always a great champion of agricultural causes and the advancement of agriculture.  We loved the glint in his eye, the roguery and all the yarns he told.

        <P>I wondered why the Cathaoirleach had asked Members on the Agricultural Panel to speak at the beginning, as Peter was always giving out, about Francie in particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Peter bore his illness with great strength.  When I asked him how he was feeling, he replied that he had told his doctors to double the dose, as this would either kill or cure him.  That <Col N="456"/>was the way he operated.  He was an inspiration to anybody with the same illness and full of encouragement.</P>
        <P>I was a member of the same panel as Peter and we had the same nominating body in the Irish co-operative movement or ICOS.  We used to trade secrets.</P>

	<P>He would meet all councillors on the way in to the conference.  I have no doubt that is one of the reasons he was so friendly with many councillors and got such a great number of votes.  </P>
        <P>As Senator Bradford noted, Peter was not afraid to speak out or take a different view than his party members.  He was not afraid to put Ministers on the rack when they came into the House.  At the same time, I have no doubt that he was a very good dancer because he definitely tip-toed around a number of issues with the greatest of ease.  I extend sympathy to his wife, Sheila, and the members of his large family who are present.</P>

	<P>As the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Burke, mentioned and having listened to the contributions, it seems the Agricultural Panel is the premier league.  I first met Peter in 1979 or 1980 on what was an unusual national committee, the sheep dipping committee.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to the late Peter Callanan who was a Member of this House from 1997.  As a nominee of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, he successfully contested three Seanad elections on the Agricultural Panel.  He worked for many years as a member of Cork County Council, on which he served the people of Cork with great commitment and dedication and demonstrated his expertise and knowledge on issues relating to agriculture, which were also greatly valued by his colleagues in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Peter made a significant contribution to political life and the Houses of the Oireachtas in his role as a Senator.  He was reliable, good humoured and totally committed to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  He will be greatly missed by his many friends in the Oireachtas and his native county of Cork.  He is particularly missed by his wife, Sheila; sons, Gerard, Liam, David and Denis, and daughters, Deirdre and Fionnuala, all of whom are with us today.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Moltar sa staid&eacute;ar cuimsitheach teangeola&iacute;och ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht 2007 gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh b&eacute;im an pholasa&iacute; teanga sa Ghaeltacht ar thaca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do ghl&uacute;nta tuismitheoir&iacute; &oacute;ga Gaeltachta amach anseo agus ar a gcumas a gcuid leana&iacute; a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge.  Dearbha&iacute;onn an staid&eacute;ar ach go h&aacute;irithe an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis an m&eacute;id cainteoir&iacute; gn&iacute;omhacha Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a chaomhn&uacute; agus cur leis an l&iacute;on sin.

T&aacute; s&eacute; molta sa dr&eacute;acht-strait&eacute;is go dtabharfa&iacute; aitheantas nua do cheantair a dtugtar &ldquo;Gaeltacht gr&eacute;as&aacute;in&rdquo; orthu.  Tabharfaidh an chatag&oacute;ir nua seo deis do thionscnaimh phlean&aacute;la teanga forbairt a dh&eacute;anamh ar phobail n&oacute; ghr&eacute;as&aacute;in teanga nua lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht i bpobail uirbeacha, a bhfuil mais chritici&uacute;il iontu maidir le taca&iacute;ocht an phobail agus an St&aacute;it don Ghaeilge.  Bainfaidh na crit&eacute;ir don chatag&oacute;ir sin le dearcadh an phobail, le cumas teanga, le sol&aacute;thar oideachais tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge agus le toil an phobail a bheith rannph&aacute;irteach go gn&iacute;omhach i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Tabharfaidh an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Comhionannais agus Gaeltachta agus an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s taca&iacute;ocht do na pleananna teanga sin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is fi&uacute; tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh freisin do chuid de na c&uacute;raim&iacute; a shamhla&iacute;tear a bheidh ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeilge chun gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta&iacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a spreagadh ar bhonn n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist go mbun&oacute;fa&iacute; sraith tionscnamh le fiontra&iacute;ocht agus gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ocht eacnama&iacute;ochta a spreagadh i measc an phobail a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge ar bhonn cuideachta, earn&aacute;la n&oacute; &aacute;iti&uacute;il.  Beidh an cur chuige le cur i bhfeidhm, mar shampla, tr&iacute; spreagadh agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don gheilleagar teanga at&aacute; in ann na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; riachtanacha a shol&aacute;thar don St&aacute;t agus don Aontas Eorpach i r&eacute;ims&iacute; ar n&oacute;s aistri&uacute;, ateangaireacht, m&uacute;ineadh teangacha, foilsi&uacute;ch&aacute;n, comhairle teanga agus bainisti&uacute; tionscadail.

Dh&eacute;anfadh s&eacute; tuiscint a choth&uacute; i measc an phobail gn&oacute; faoin nasc at&aacute; idir an teanga agus forbairt eacnama&iacute;ochta, agus faoi na <Col N="461"/>bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; gn&oacute; a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge.

        <P>Mar achoimre, t&aacute; leasuithe maidir le cumhachta&iacute;, feidhmeanna agus strucht&uacute;r &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta &aacute; mheas faoi l&aacute;thair i gcomhth&eacute;acs na molta&iacute; at&aacute; sa dr&eacute;acht-strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  N&iacute;l aon gh&aacute; leis an mBille seo, n&aacute; le toghch&aacute;in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta a chur ar athl&oacute; agus cearta daonlathacha na ndaoine a mhoilli&uacute; ag an am c&eacute;anna.  D&rsquo;&eacute;ist m&eacute; l&rsquo;&oacute;r&aacute;id an Aire.  Chuala m&eacute; gach focal a d&uacute;irt s&eacute;, agus n&aacute;r d&uacute;irt s&eacute;.  Is g&aacute; go mbeadh toghch&aacute;in ann, ionas go gcuirfear le strucht&uacute;r an bhoird agus go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; ceannaireacht a shol&aacute;thar do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  I listened to what the Minister had to say.  As I stated, there is a need to hold elections, enhance the structures of the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltahcta and provide the people of the Gaeltacht with leadership.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; le baill an bhoird.  Molaim mo chuid chomhghleacaithe &oacute; Fhine Gael &mdash; Ian Mac Aindri&uacute;, M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Scanaill, S&eacute;amus Cosa&iacute; Mac Gearailt agus P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Dochartaigh &mdash; as ucht an m&eacute;id oibre at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh acu ar son muintir na Gaeltachta.  In praising the Fine Gael members of the board, I ask why are the elections being postponed.  T&aacute; an str&aacute;it&eacute;is idir cham&aacute;in againn le tamall anuas.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;tear roimhe mar go bhfuil g&eacute;argh&aacute; leis.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an Rialtas ag saothr&uacute; go diongbh&aacute;ilte chun leas ceart na str&aacute;it&eacute;ise a bhaint amach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the publication of strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don ghaeilge, in which Fine Gael has been involved.  I compliment the work done by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Deputy McGinley through the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Gabhann f&eacute;ini&uacute;lacht leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus, mar sin, gabhann f&eacute;ini&uacute;lacht leis an mbord ina theannta sin.  B&rsquo;fhearr sa ch&aacute;s seo go nd&iacute;reodh an Bille ar na stucht&uacute;ir, na comhlachta&iacute; agus na d&eacute;ant&uacute;is.  The Minister is correct that the Bill is important.  However, it should have examined the structures, powers and composition of the board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is &eacute; at&aacute; le foghlaim as seo do mhuintir na Gaeltachta n&aacute; go bhfuil an Rialtas ag c&uacute;l&uacute; siar &oacute;s na toghch&aacute;in ch&eacute;anna.  T&aacute; m&iacute;-&uacute;s&aacute;id &aacute; bhaint ag an Rialtas as an leithsc&eacute;al go bhfuilimid i mbun eagr&uacute;ch&aacute;in don str&aacute;it&eacute;is 20 bliain agus na toghch&aacute;in &aacute; chur siar acu.  Ba ch&oacute;ir don Rialtas an d&aacute; thr&aacute; seo a fhreastal agus na toghch&aacute;in a gcur ar si&uacute;l ag an am c&eacute;anna.  The message we send to the people of the Gaeltacht, despite what Members on the Government side will say, is that the Government is afraid to hold elections.  There is no need to postpone them.  The preparation of the 20-year programme for the Irish language is important; it can be done in tandem with the elections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">N&iacute; g&aacute; an t&eacute;arma a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; n&oacute; sos toghch&aacute;in a bheith ann.  Is &eacute; at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il n&aacute; ionada&iacute;ocht, rud at&aacute; r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; muintir na Gaeltachta ar a gcosa ag imp&iacute; ar an Rialtas beart&uacute; agus gn&iacute;omh a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; ag titim anuas orthu: d&iacute;-fhosta&iacute;ocht; an imirce; easpa leathanbhanda; agus meath ar an tionscnamh turasa&iacute;ochta.  There <Col N="462"/>are real problems in the Gaeltacht &mdash; unemployment, emigration, the lack of broadband services and the decline in tourism &mdash; that need to be tackled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach bhfuilimid ag f&eacute;achaint ar mhoilli&uacute; chumhachta&iacute; an bhoird.  Creidim f&eacute;in agus creideann Fine Gael gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh cruth&uacute; poist, forbairt tionscla&iacute;ochta, r&oacute;l n&iacute;os l&aacute;irn&iacute; i gcursa&iacute; oideachais agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge faoi ch&uacute;ram &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>We will oppose the Bill reluctantly because we do not believe there is a need to postpone the elections.  Cos&uacute;il leis an Rialtas, t&aacute; s&eacute; mar pholasa&iacute; ag Fine Gael &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge a mh&eacute;ad&uacute;.  We fully support the use of the Irish language.  However, we see a fear of holding the elections.  It would be wrong to postpone the expression of the democratic wishes of the people, no matter what they are.  We will oppose the Bill, even though it is an-ghairid.  There is no need to postpone democratic elections.  The postponement of the local elections in the 1990s showed that postponing elections did not work.  People have a right to their say.  There are problems in several Gaeltacht regions.  Postponing the elections will not solve them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that the 20-year strategy is completed successfully.  Our party supports this.  However, the Bill is a wrong move.  It is designed to buy time for the Government.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnall would much rather see the elections, as well as the Donegal South-West by-election, held soon.  For that reason, I hope he will support Fine Gael in opposing the Bill.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim leithsc&eacute;al ach beidh m&eacute; ag caint as B&eacute;arla san diosp&oacute;ireacht seo.  Given that my father was a native speaker and that my mother did her &Aacute;rdteistim&eacute;aracht as Gaeilge, I do not even use the excuse that I was born in the United States to explain my continuing lack of confidence in using the Irish language.  Like most people in this country, after an education for 13 years I can understand Irish in reading and hearing what others say, but the vital element of confidence in speaking in a debate such as this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator needs Fine Gael policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is something towards which I am working.  I very much admire Senator Alex White for the contribution he made, something to which I can only aspire at this stage.  I hope I will be able to add mine in future debates in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given my background &mdash; I have a parent who comes from a Gaeltacht area &mdash; I record my acknowledgment of the role &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has played since the 1970s.  It is a form of local government which tries to combine recognising and enhancing the separate identity of Gaeltacht communities with its operations as a development authority for these communities.  The extent to which it has been successful ought to be the subject of a wider debate in the House.  It has been largely successful, but there have been times when its own standards have not been reached.  I remember such an occasion when I was a member of the Commitee of <Col N="465"/>Public Accounts when there was a question mark against sums of money being used in Galway areas directly outside the boundaries of the Gaeltacht community.  The committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General addressed the matter at the time and one hopes this led to improved governance in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have seen some improvements.  There has been an increase in the number of elected members to 17 which amounts to a majority.  The fact that the number of seats in constituencies varies from one, two or three makes it difficult to ensure political representation is as wide as possible.  The worst electoral performance of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, was in the last &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta election in the Rath Cairn constituency in which our candidate received five votes.  That was before we entered government.  However, we should try to improve the position and hold elections to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as a body.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reason for the Bill is to provide for a two-year gap.  My hope is that this will be a once-off act that will fit in with the Irish language strategy and that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as a body will be better prepared to deal with the matter.  That said, the purpose of the Bill, in its current form, is very narrow and only mentions the two-year extension of the electoral mandate.  Perhaps the Minister of State might talk about the role of the three appointed members and whether they are considered to be elected members and open for reappointment.  If that is the case and given the two-year extended period, it might be an opportunity for the Minister of State to ensure new blood goes in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s in the crossover period between mandates.  I urge him to give this strong consideration.</P>
        <P>Although there is a reluctance not to use the whip, there is an understanding, at least on this side of the House, that the strategy will have both cultural and economic benefits for Gaeltacht communities.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta should be encouraged to achieve this as a body.  On these grounds I support the Bill.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Buna&iacute;odh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta sa bhliain 1980.  T&aacute; an ghn&iacute;omhaireacht St&aacute;it seo freagrach as forbairt eacnama&iacute;ochta, s&oacute;isialta agus cult&uacute;rtha na Gaeltachta.  Is &eacute; caomhn&uacute; agus l&aacute;idri&uacute; na Gaeilge mar theanga bheo, le cois &iacute; a thabhairt mar oidhreacht don ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile, an bunchusp&oacute;ir at&aacute; le polasa&iacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  D&eacute;anann bord rialaithe ar a bhfuil 20 comhalta, 17 acu tofa go daonlathach ag muintir na Gaeltachta, agus foireann 113 duine, sainch&uacute;ram forbartha na gn&iacute;omhaireachta a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
        <P>I join Members in welcoming the Minister in seeing all Stages of this short Bill through the House.  Its primary purpose is to extend the term of the intervals of the election of the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta from five years and six months to seven years and six months.  It also affords us an opportunity to reflect on the work done by the body in the Gaeltacht areas and the crucial role it continues to play in developing the economic and social life of the Gaeltacht.</P><Col N="469"/>
        <P>The Bill forms part of the wider review by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs of the powers and functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltacha  which was initiated in 2006.  The functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are broadly divided into the economic and the socio-cultural.  In the economic area, there can be no doubting the enormous contribution made to the life of the Gaeltacht.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is deservedly given much credit for the economic improvement of the Gaeltacht in recent years.  There is an appreciation of the link between this employment and the reduction of work related emigration and maintaining viable communities in many Gaeltacht areas.  It is evident overall from the analysis that the public is happy with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as far as this aspect of its duties is concerned.</P>
        <P>In general, a positive view of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta emerges from the 67 submissions.  The occasional submission is extremely negative, but any criticism is aimed at improving the organisation.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is currently seen as the most central organisation to Gaeltacht life.  It is given credit for the part it played in the economic development of the Gaeltacht and greatly enhancing the standard of living and the social life of the Gaeltacht in the past 25 years.  It is true to say the public is not entirely satisfied with the efforts of the &uacute;dar&aacute;s to preserve the Irish language and promote it as a community language in the Gaeltacht.  However, it is evident that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is hampered by statutory restrictions in regard to taking effective action in this area.</P>
        <P>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has little influence in certain areas that are fundamental to the passing on of the language from generation to generation, for example, through education.  It is evident that the public sees the development of the Gaeltacht as a multifaceted process, with economic, social, cultural and linguistic life interwoven and, therefore, it must be undertaken in an integrated manner.  Members of the public are aware that there are many organisations operating in the Gaeltacht that are not fulfilling their statutory obligations in regard to the Gaeltacht.  Confidence is being placed in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and it is hoped it will be given the powers and resources to enable it to undertake the development of the Gaeltacht in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.</P>
        <P>There is a dichotomy between the economic functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta which are carried out to the satisfaction of the wider public and are considered pivotal to the economic life of the Gaeltacht regions and what I have termed the socio-cultural aspects of the brief of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  According to its publicity material, all of the organisation&rsquo;s activities have the preservation and promotion of the Irish language at their core.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta collaborates with individuals, community groups and companies which embrace Irish and provide the everyday settings in which the language flourishes.</P>
        <P>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta also works in close partnership with community groups to administer social employment schemes, manage youth clubs and preschool groups and enhance the social infrastructure through activities such as the provision of assistance for the elderly and the disadvantaged.  In continuing the good work of his predecessor, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the Minister might look at the impact that social employment schemes have made in various villages, towns and cities.  The Minister is conscious of the need for the Government to focus on job creation in general and all Ministers involved in this area are focusing their activities to try to reduce significantly the unacceptable level of unemployment.</P>
        <P>I make a plea for the social employment schemes.  As &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is a sponsor of such schemes, I hope the Minister can convince the Minister for Finance to provide the necessary funding, because it is far better that people who are being paid to do nothing are given a bit of dignity to get up in the morning and do something.  Any initiatives in this area could be budget neutral and not create further financial impositions on an already shaky public purse.</P><Col N="470"/>
        <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to congratulate members of the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on the good work they continue to do on behalf of the people of the Gaeltacht regions.  Although I come from a non-Gaeltacht region, I have a deep love and affection for the Irish language.  I wish that I could speak it better.  I live in County Leitrim and I am closely involved with my colleagues in County Donegal and very aware of the good work they are doing, especially Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and Senator Doherty.</P>
        <P>The level of satisfaction with the work of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta can be seen from the analysis of submissions from the public relating to the review of powers and functions of the body.  I wish the Minister well in this context and in his wider brief as a Minister coming into a very exciting and innovative Department.</P>

It is, however, necessary to confer on the Minister powers to dissolve the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.

        <P Just="Left">Aonta&iacute;m leis an Aire go bhfuil seans iontach maith ann go mbeidh strucht&uacute;r &uacute;r ann roimh dheireadh an d&aacute; bhliain.  C&eacute;n dochar a dh&eacute;anfadh s&eacute; glacadh leis an leas&uacute; seo?  N&iacute; bheadh dochar ar bith i gceist.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; seo maith go leor.  Is &eacute; sin mo thuairim pearsanta agus tuairim mo phairt&iacute;.  T&aacute; an Seanad&oacute;ir Alex White ceart &mdash; baineann s&eacute; seo le ceist an daonlathais.  D&aacute; mbeadh an leas&uacute; seo d&eacute;anta, ar a laghad bheadh a fhios againn laistigh de c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad ama at&aacute; an Rialtas ag s&uacute;il len &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh.  Iarraim ar an Aire &eacute; sin a mheas.</P>
        <P>B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go gcreideann go leor daoine go bhfuil &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta bainteach leis an Ghaeltacht amh&aacute;in.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh an rud c&eacute;anna a bheith againn anseo sa Seanad.  A draft strategy is being used to postpone elections.  The Minister may shake his head but he stated that there is a need for continuity on the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta while the draft strategy and the changes proposed within it are implemented.  I do not believe he disputes that fact.  There have been 13 reports on Seanad reform.  Imagine what would have happened if the Government that was in power when the first of those reports was submitted had stated that on foot of the recommendations it contained, and the all-party agreement in respect of them, that the Seanad elections should be delayed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Imagine what would have happened if successive Governments had stated this in respect of each of the 13 reports to which I refer.  It would be a suspension of democracy and that is what is happening in this instance.  The draft strategy is of no more weight and has no more substance than any of the reports on Seanad reform.  The most recent report on Seanad reform was far more likely to be implemented because, when it was introduced it was the subject of cross-party approval in the House.</P>
        <P>The draft strategy was brought forward by the Government and no other party has yet signed up to it because the process has not been properly completed.  If a similar approach were taken <Col N="479"/>in respect of the Seanad, there would be outrage because it would represent a suspension of democracy.  The latter is exactly what is happening in respect of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>

	<P>Aonta&iacute;m go huile agus go hioml&aacute;n leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Murch&uacute; go bhfuil an comhoibri&uacute; sin de dh&iacute;th agus, c&eacute; go bhfuilimid ag pl&eacute; ceist &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, agus ag pl&eacute; daonlathais agus toghch&aacute;in, n&iacute; ceist &eacute; seo maidir leis an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.  Mura <Col N="480"/>bhfaighimid l&aacute;n-taca&iacute;ocht &oacute; na p&aacute;irtithe uile, n&iacute; bheimid in ann an strait&eacute;is, agus na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; istigh inti, a bhaint amach.  Caithfidh an comhoibri&uacute; sin a tharl&uacute;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">D&uacute;irt an tAire nach bhfuil s&eacute; ag iarraidh na ceiste a chur chuig coist&iacute; anseo agus ansi&uacute;d.  Chuala mise an tAire, an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, ag r&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna.  Nuair a th&aacute;inig an strait&eacute;is amach, d&uacute;irt s&eacute; go nd&eacute;anfar gach rud taobh istigh de mh&iacute; roimh dheireadh mh&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir.  N&iacute; raibh pr&oacute;iseas comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n le bheith ann, agus m&aacute; t&aacute; daoine ag iarraidh tuairim&iacute; a nochtadh, gur ceart iad a chur chuig Baill Oireachtais.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta gur ghlac cathaoirleach an chomhchoiste cinneadh pr&oacute;iseas comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in a chur ar bun, dul chuig an Ghaeltacht le labhairt le gr&uacute;pa&iacute; ar n&oacute;s TG4 agus &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus gr&uacute;pa&iacute; ar fud an oile&aacute;in faoin strait&eacute;is seo.  D&uacute;irt an tAire f&eacute;in gur maith an rud &eacute; sin.  N&iacute; h&eacute; sin an plean a bh&iacute; ag an Aire ag an am sin.  M&aacute; ghlactar le cuid de na molta&iacute; ar a laghad, beidh plean i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr ann.</P>
        <P Just="Left">D&uacute;irt an tAire go bhfuil an Rialtas ag iarraidh an phlean seo a chur i bhfeidhm.  Fadhb sa phlean n&aacute; an ch&eacute;ad d&aacute; bhliain ann, t&aacute; s&eacute; beartaithe an plean a dh&iacute;ol don phobal, to sell the plan and to get people to buy into it.  N&iacute; bhaineann sin le hathruithe ar an ch&oacute;ras oideachais n&oacute; le hathruithe don Ghaeltacht taobh istigh den am sin, ach taca&iacute;ocht a fh&aacute;il &oacute;n phobal.  T&aacute; cuid mh&oacute;r de sin d&eacute;anta ag an gcomhchoiste sa phr&oacute;iseas chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in ach t&aacute; c&uacute;ig bliana ann anois &oacute; bh&iacute; toghch&aacute;n don &uacute;dar&aacute;s ann.  T&aacute; tr&iacute; bliana ann &oacute; cuireadh an staid&eacute;ar teangeola&iacute;ochta ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge os comhair an Rialtais agus cheadaigh an Rialtas an staid&eacute;ar sin c&uacute;ig bliana &oacute; shin.  T&aacute; blianta fada ann go bhfuil a fhios ag an Rialtas go bhfuil g&aacute; le hathstruct&uacute;r&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P Just="Left">N&iacute; faoi na daoine at&aacute; ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille seo nach bhfuil an r&eacute;amhobair d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas le strucht&uacute;r &uacute;r a thabhairt isteach.  N&iacute; raibh g&aacute; leis seo a bheith mar ph&aacute;irt den strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.  D&aacute; mbeadh an strucht&uacute;r &uacute;r sin le tabhairt isteach dh&aacute; bhlian &oacute; shin, bh&iacute; a fhios againn go raibh an ghearrth&eacute;arma ag teacht an&iacute;os agus bh&iacute; an tAire ag an am ag insint do na baill go mbeadh toghch&aacute;n ann i m&iacute; Dheireadh F&oacute;mhair.  N&iacute; cheart don Aire an locht a chur ar an Fhreas&uacute;ra cionn is nach bhfuilimid s&aacute;sta taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do Rialtas at&aacute; ag iarraidh daonlathais a chur siar.  Bh&iacute; go leor ama ag an Rialtas strucht&uacute;r &uacute;r a bhun&uacute; agus n&iacute; raibh g&aacute; go mbeadh an strucht&uacute;r sin mar ph&aacute;irt den strait&eacute;is.  Seans go bhfuil s&eacute; n&iacute;os fearr anois go bhfuil s&eacute; mar ph&aacute;irt den strait&eacute;is mar t&aacute; s&iacute; ann ach bh&iacute; go leor ama againn sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Billy Kelleher.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, who, because of changes to the Seanad schedule, is unable to make the opening address.  However, I am delighted to be back in the Seanad to discuss the issues that will be raised in this debate and thank Senators for making time available to discuss innovation and job creation. </P>
        <P>As a Minister of State for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, I am acutely aware of the distress the economic downturn is having on individuals, families and businesses.   The negative consequences of the downturn, particularly where jobs are lost, cannot be overstated and our priority has been and will continue to be to respond to these challenging and difficult problems.  I am glad to have this opportunity to outline to the House the decisive action being taken by the Government to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s recovery and future economic growth.  As recognised by the OECD and other international bodies, significant progress is being made in addressing the challenges facing this country.  We are committed to ensuring that Ireland will emerge in a strong position and be prepared for the next phase of global economic growth.</P>
        <P>I believe the Irish economy has turned the corner.  As long ago as his Budget Statement last year, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to the fact that the most chal<Col N="482"/>lenging period was behind us although difficult times still lay ahead.  He stated at the time that Ireland was on the road to recovery.  Being a small open economy, we all know our future economic growth will have to be driven by exports of goods and services.  Improving our competitiveness will also help us attract more foreign direct investment.  We already see a recovery in cost competitiveness with lower business costs, particularly wages and energy.  We introduced an extensive package of measures to contain energy costs last summer and this is reflected in a much improved position relative to competitors.  Data released recently show that electricity and gas prices fell for all types of energy consumers in the second half of 2009 and have moved closer to the EU average for most business users.  We are reducing the administrative burden by driving better regulation.  Local authority charges remain a great concern of the business sector and we are conducting an efficiency review of the whole local authority system at present to identify savings which will reduce pressure on small businesses.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base can take some pride in the incredible resilience it has shown in the last two years.  Although global exports in goods fell by around a third in the first quarter of 2009, Irish goods showed an increase of 1% for the same period.  It is very significant that we acknowledge how Irish businesses and exports have responded in the prevailing challenging times in the global economy.  When we look at major international exporters such as Germany, or other countries which had significant reductions in their exports, we see there is certain inherent resilience in the Irish economy.  That should be applauded, acknowledged, fostered and encouraged in the longer term.</P>
        <P>Commentary is also very important.  When people speak and raise issues we must also acknowledge that these are significantly challenging times and there is a great deal of pressure on families and individuals.  There has been a marked increase in unemployment and the labour market has shrunk significantly to approximately 1.85 million people but in the general context it is equally important we balance that with the fact we have become more competitive <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> our global competitors.  Irish exports have held up and as a country we are very much open for business.  If one sentiment is to emanate from this House in this debate it should be that Ireland is open for business, both in the context of bringing in foreign direct investment and, equally important, in the way our exporters are finding and retaining market share, being innovative, getting out there and responding to the very challenging times we face.  That should be continually acknowledged.  Negative sentiment can have a broader impact on the economy.  It can also deflate the confidence of exporters and small and medium-sized businesses which are trying to establish themselves, access credit and create employment and opportunities.  Continual negative commentary undermines the basic instinct of confidence.  Confidence is about making sure people have a belief that we can get through these challenging times.  I am sure Senators will acknowledge and highlight the difficulties facing businesses and will be balanced in their approach having regard to where Ireland is positioned globally in terms of innovation and job creation.  While global services exports fell by approximately 20% over<?oasys _jy ?>the same timeframe, Irish services declined by just over 2%, which is another significant statistic.</P>
        <P>My goal is to maintain and enhance the policy environment that has facilitated this resilient performance and that will drive export growth.  We know export-led growth can create the jobs required to reduce unemployment, fund public services and manage the national debt.  We estimate that every 100 export jobs in Ireland support at least another 70 jobs in the Irish economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Looking to the future, we are striving to diversify our export profile, exploit our talents and opportunities and guard against over-dependence on any specific markets.  Our track record on this is strong and is exemplified by the Asia strategy.  That strategy is nearing the end of its <Col N="483"/>shelf life and we are currently drafting a new trade strategy that will assist, encourage and promote Irish goods and services in markets throughout the world.  As an open global trading economy, strong emphasis must be placed on finding markets that are amenable to our products and that are also accessible.  The new trade strategy that is to be published will be of significance.  With the co-operation of various Departments in promoting Ireland Inc., and its exports, products and services abroad, we can target those markets in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>In 2005, we set specific targets to be achieved through concerted effort by the relevant Departments and agencies to develop links with eight key economies in that region.  The success of the Asia strategy has been striking.  Exports to the eight countries have risen from &euro;4 billion in 1999 to &euro;9.6 billion in 2009, well ahead of the target of &euro;9 billion set at the time of drafting the strategy.  The number of Irish companies with a presence in these countries has risen fivefold, from 54 to 272, well ahead of the 215 companies targeted at start of the period covered by the strategy.</P>
        <P>In addition, growth has been achieved on other targets relating to tourism, specialist food exports, developing inward student numbers, academic partnerships and a range of other links and developments.  These outcomes, together with progress in wider awareness-raising, have been greatly assisted by focused high level visits.  During the past five years, Taoiseach-led trade missions have been organised to China, India and Japan and other ministerial-led trade missions have taken place to China, India, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs has expanded its network of embassies and consulates in the region.</P>
        <P>An example of our success is that Ireland now has a trade surplus with China, a dramatic turnaround from the position only three years ago when we had a trade deficit of &euro;2.9 billion with that country.  The Government is committed to developing and expanding this engagement, as the key Asian economies represent an exciting and continuously developing market for Irish goods and services.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is both reviewing the achievements of the Asia strategy as well as working with other relevant<?oasys _jy ?>Departments and the development agencies to prepare a new trade, tourism and investment strategy.</P>
        <P>The new strategy will be broader in reach than the Asia strategy, focusing on key high growth emerging markets such as China, India, Japan, the Gulf states and Brazil, as well as on our existing key trading partners.  The strategy will boost our exports, tourism and investment performance and bring further focus and coherence to Ireland&rsquo;s single-minded pursuit of our international economic and commercial interests.</P>
        <P>Our recent export performance has been impressive in the context of the size of our economy compared to others and we will continue to incentivise enterprise to invest further in high value research and development to increase exports and create new employment opportunities in communities across the country.</P>
        <P>We have seen in this recession that the companies that have invested in research and development and ensured their products or services have a competitive edge are the same companies that have held or grown market share and held or grown employment.  This has reinforced our belief that our research and development strategy is the right one.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continued investment in research and development has been clearly articulated and demonstrated.  The Department is determined that incentives for business to undertake research and development are strong and that Ireland continues to invest in building our reputation as a leading knowledge economy.  A renewed focus is correctly being placed on stronger commercial outputs and the efficiency of investment.</P><Col N="484"/>
        <P>The decision to create a single funding stream for the STI will greatly enhance the efficiency of the spend and the State&rsquo;s ability to reprioritise as economic circumstances change as the economy recovers.  The Government is supporting companies with direct funding for research and development and through the recently enhanced research and development tax credit.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA support companies ranging from innovation vouchers to large-scale research programmes.</P>
        <P>We are funding collaborative research partnerships between companies and partnering companies with the strong science base we have built through PRTLI and Science Foundation Ireland.  Science Foundation Ireland funded researchers now work with more than 300 companies.  There are many more innovative companies being created and grown.  Some 73 new high potential start-up companies, supported by Enterprise Ireland in 2009, are poised to create 900 jobs over the next three years and no doubt many more in the future.</P>
        <P>Our wide range of enterprise supports are aimed at improving productivity, market knowledge, competitiveness and leadership and management capabilities so firms can compete successfully in international markets and grow their exports.  To survive and thrive companies have to be lean, flexible and innovative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enterprise Ireland supported companies currently employ more than 133,000 people.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s objective is to create a further 40,000 new jobs over the next five years.  Through the multiplier effect, this will lead to an additional 28,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy.  In the last six months alone, Enterprise Ireland has announced 700 jobs in innovative companies such as Abtran, VoxPro and Sysnet.  Up to 10,000 new jobs could also be created in one year as a result of the Government&rsquo;s new employer job PRSI incentive scheme.  This new scheme is a direct stimulus for the real economy by saving employers money and shifting the balance in favour of job creation.  In addition, the Finance Act 2010 provided for the start-up company exemption to be extended into 2010 encouraging both entrepreneurship and economic activity.</P>
        <P>We are also working hard to sustain existing jobs through this difficult period.  Companies supported under the employment subsidy scheme and the enterprise stabilisation fund have committed to maintaining more than 100,000 jobs to the end of November 2010.  This is significant information for Senators.  When people ask if there is a jobs strategy in place or what the Government has done to retain jobs, it is critical that we acknowledge introduction of the employment subsidy scheme and the enterprise stabilisation fund.  They have maintained jobs in those sectors in these challenging times.</P>
        <P>The Government is also proactively supporting the development of the green economy through grants and other incentives and supports.  Irish companies engaged in renewable energy, energy efficiency, water, waste, green building and related services have significant opportunities to grow and create stronger export businesses.  Maximising the potential for Irish business and for job creation in the green enterprise sectors will be a key focus of current and future enterprise policy.  Enterprise Ireland has a range of measures primarily targeted at the small and medium-sized enterprise market to aid the greening of businesses in that sector.</P>
        <P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is promoting improved energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources resulting in substantial savings for individuals and businesses, both small and large.  The IDA has formed a dedicated clean technology division specifically to entice foreign direct investment flows into this sector.  Across a range of sectors, international investment will continue to be a key driver of employment, exports and growth.</P>
        <P>The issue of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate of 12.5% is constantly raised.  The Minister for Finance emphasised this issue in his budget speech last December when he clearly and categori<Col N="485"/>cally stated that the corporation tax rate of 12.5% was here to stay, was a central plank of Government policies and was fundamental to attracting direct investment into this country and supporting and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s global position as a competitor.</P>
      <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There were a few red herrings on this issue during debate on the Lisbon treaty, to which the people responded by endorsing the treaty.  Ireland is competitive for many reasons, of which a corporation tax rate of 12.5% is only one.  There are many other reasons companies look to Ireland as a place in which to locate.  We have a very intelligent, highly educated and flexible workforce.  There is also major investment in research and development, while we continuously have quality graduates coming out of our colleges.  The critical mass of multinationals already located in Ireland gives us a competitive advantage that we should exploit to the maximum.  Foreign companies directly provide 140,000 jobs and indirectly 240,000 jobs in total in this country.  They account for 50% of the corporation tax take, 70% of national exports and 73% of all business research and development and innovation undertaken.  They spend &euro;19 billion in the economy, &euro;7 billion alone on payroll costs.  Many multinational companies are restructuring their global operations, leading to global rationalisation, which makes it particularly important that we work to retain current investment levels, stimulate expansion and secure new projects.</P>
        <P>We will continue to market Ireland as a location of choice for newcomer and existing investors and this strategy is working.  Despite the difficult global economic climate, last year Ireland won 125 foreign investment projects, half of which were in the areas of research, development and innovation, reflecting Ireland&rsquo;s strengths and attractiveness as a location for cutting edge activities.  Around 4,500 new jobs were created, while the value of exports from IDA client companies increased to &euro;110 billion in 2009.  The links between foreign direct investment, research and development and innovation, industry and our colleges and universities represent a critically important factor in promoting Ireland as a location for research and development.  In the last few days we have become aware that a bionic arm is being developed in the Tyndall National Institute in Cork.  This is an example of collaboration between industry and a university in research and development for high end technology.  This is very significant and attracts interest from elsewhere around the world.  In the last six months the IDA has secured investments with the potential to create almost 1,000 high quality jobs in companies such as eBay, IBM, Hertz and Pay Pal.  The pipeline towards job creation in the rest of 2010 remains strong.  The new IDA jobs strategy sets new targets for foreign investment to be achieved up to 2014.  We are aiming to create 105,000 new jobs &mdash; 62,000 direct and 43,000 spin-off jobs &mdash; through 640 new foreign investment projects,  50% of which will be outside Dublin and Cork.  We aim to see an annual client investment of more than &euro;1.7 billion in research, development and innovation by 2014.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s focus is on building a solid foundation for future economic growth.  Job creation is at the heart of Government policy.  We are taking action to stimulate the economy and invest in our long-term prosperity and quality of life.  This year we will invest &euro;6.5 billion in capital projects.  This public investment programme is expected to support approximately 70,000 jobs.  A view has been promoted that there has been no capital investment by the Government.  We will be spending about &euro;5 billion on capital investment programmes which will have a knock-on effect in the economy.  This has been acknowledged all over the world, yet people are critical of the fact that funding under the national development plan, under which we were spending &euro;8 billion to &euro;9 billion for many years, has been reduced.  However, because of the reduction in construction costs, we are now getting strong value for money in our capital projects.  The recent announcement on links between the Luas lines is another significant development in the heart of the capital.  We also saw the roll-out of motorway projects across the country, investment in wastewater treatment plants, research and develop<Col N="486"/>ment at third level, the roll-out of broadband and so on.  These are very significant in trying to build a modern economy, competing for foreign direct investment and allowing our exporting companies to become competitive.  We are encouraging the business sector to invest, grow and create new jobs.  We are investing in skills and training programmes for the workforce.  We are developing the green economy to create new, quality jobs thousands of workers.  Implementation of the recommendations of the innovation task force will also create the environment for more jobs to be created in new, innovative sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>The courage and decisiveness the Government has shown in taking the necessary measures to stabilise the public finances and fix the banking system send a strong, clear message to the international community that Ireland will not hide from the challenges it faces and that we are making the right decisions to position ourselves for future growth.  This debate is about innovation and job creation.  We have had a simplistic discussion about impaired banks and the support provided for them.  The two reports by Professor Honohan and Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson on the banking crisis highlight the deficiencies and inadequacies in the areas of oversight and governance and explain how a bubble developed in the property market.  At the same time, we have spent huge sums of money in developing our infrastructure and rolling out a capital investment programme that has ensured efficiencies in the economy about which we could only dream 20 years ago.  The only reason the Government is supporting the banks is that a systemic failure of Anglo Irish Bank would have a knock-on effect on the other two major banks which could have catastrophic consequences for the banking system and also the broader economy.  As highlighted in the reports, it could have major implications for society also.  The main focus of the Government&rsquo;s support package for the banks is not on the banks but clearly on job creation and innovation.  Whether we love or despise the banks, we have to have a functioning banking system to make sure we get credit flowing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The directors of the banks must now realise that there is a new relationship between the banks and the people, who through the Government guarantee and through the recapitalisation programmes stand foursquare with them.  It is obligatory on the banks to make sure there is liquidity in the market and that there is a flow to small and medium-sized business and that the current credit squeeze is brought to an end.   I have read the Mazars reports from cover to cover on several occasions.  We have heard commentary from the banks that they are open for business and that they are willing to make sure credit flows to small and medium-sized businesses.  However, we still have major concerns that they are not functioning in the way we want them to work to make sure they analyse and assess a business plan and lend according to the needs of a business.</P>
        <P>The banks must acknowledge they have not been playing their full part in supporting the small and medium sized business sector, which is of huge significance to the Irish economy.  It is the backbone of driving exports and domestic job creation.  For all these reasons, it is important that Senators highlight any inadequacies they feel exist with regard to the banking system making credit available to the small and medium sized business sector.  Our two major banks have a role to play in this.  The credit review group under the stewardship of Mr. Trethowan has received a number of queries and complaints from people refused credit.  It is fundamentally critical that the banks realise they must impair their balance sheets through whatever banking and accounting systems they put in place.  Equally they have an obligation to make credit available to viable but struggling small and medium sized businesses to try to get them through the recession.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the debate.  I was in the House a number of months ago for a broader debate on the economy.  I apologise if I strayed slightly into the broader issue but it is inextricably linked to this subject matter.  Without the availability of credit, competitiveness and all <Col N="487"/>other parts of the Government&rsquo;s policy, job creation and innovation would be lethargic.  For all of the policies we pursue, we acknowledge we must stay focused on ensuring we are competitive and invest in the areas we are good at, which are entrepreneurship and high quality graduates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another important factor is that we brand Ireland internationally.  There is a huge well of acceptance that we are a creative, innovative and flexible people.  This is internationally recognised and sometimes we do not acknowledge this at home.  We should promote it because if we promote positive views of Ireland internationally it will be easier to attract foreign direct investment.  In my speech I referred to the spin-off jobs created directly and indirectly through foreign direct investment and they are very significant.  They build up a critical mass of expertise.  Throughout Ireland, multinational companies came and stayed for a number of years.  Perhaps they have scaled down and are now involved in research and development only.  The embryonic spin-off from these companies is that high quality graduates and people with expertise in those fields have gone out and spawned small and medium-sized businesses.  There is a continual churning of jobs through foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>With regard to domestic consumption, Irish companies are in an international whirlwind.  We must get right all the underlying costs that affect our competitiveness.  If we continuously talk down the positive aspects of what our exporters achieve it deflates their confidence in going out to find markets in the broad international world.  We are very committed to supporting small and medium sized businesses stepping off the island and trying to find markets elsewhere.  Perhaps for a time we were going for the low-hanging fruit at home.  That is something we must address in the context of future growth in the economy.  We must keep focused, regardless of our domestic economy, on ensuring that Irish companies are fit for purpose, internationally competitive and in all the markets worth pursuing, such as Russia, India, Brazil, China and the Gulf states.  The devaluation of the euro gives us an added advantage at this juncture and we should seize these opportunities.</P>
        <P>Ireland is going through a very difficult time as are its people.  The reports outlined by the Governor of the Central Bank and by Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson highlighted inadequacies in governance, oversight and regulation throughout all sections of Ireland and in some policies that were pursued.  However, a little rewriting of history is taking place with regard to policies that were pursued.  Many of the policies generated large tax revenues which were invested in health, education, infrastructure and throughout the broad ambit of what was required by the Irish people at the time.</P>
        <P>We must remember that more than 2 million people worked in Ireland in 2007.  That is hugely significant.  It was a milestone that was crossed when we look at where we came from historically.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to get back to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been many major achievements in that context and we would not want to throw out and whitewash all that we achieved for short-term political gain.  We acknowledge the difficulties, but at the same time many opportunities exist because of our competitiveness.  I accept that some of the competitiveness is painful because when we speak about labour unit costs we mean salary and wage reductions.  That is slightly pernicious and has an impact on individuals&rsquo; lives.  However, it is an area in which we are beginning to follow the kilter in the context of our competitors.</P>
        <P>The area of energy is also being addressed through clean and green energies and we must put more emphasis on this.  This is another commitment made by the Government in recent times, particularly on promoting the green agenda, which is of huge significance.  This is not only because of the present hue of the Government; it is of huge economic importance as well <Col N="488"/>as being important for the sustainability of the environment.  It is about ensuring we are not dependant of fossil fuels and that we diversify and find a competitive economy based on sustainability in many of its facets.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, sends his apologies but due to the change in the timetable he was unable to make it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, in place of the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  It is a pity the debate did not get started until late in the evening.  Many items in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech are very admirable.  Perhaps the Minister of State did not mean to say it the way he did but one of his closing remarks was on how the banks could return to profitability by changing their accounting systems.  Part of the reason the banks got into difficulty in the first place is because they introduced some very lax accounting systems so I am sure he meant something completely different.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that much of what is contained in his comments is good news and should be acknowledged as such.  There is a danger that we talk down the economy too much.  However, if we had a euro for every time a Minister or Government Member states the economy has turned a corner at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>We would not have a deficit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>We certainly would not have a deficit.  Almost a year ago, the Minister for Finance told us we had turned a corner and we are still turning it.  We must be dizzy turning corners at this stage.  Perhaps another metaphor could be found by whoever writes speeches.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the performance of Irish exporters and the Minister of State is quite right to place emphasis on it.  I also acknowledge the words he spoke on the Government&rsquo;s efforts on the fiscal crisis as opposed to the banking crisis.  I agree with him on that but I do not see much action by the Government in this regard.  Virtually all of the Government&rsquo;s actions have been on banking and we still have not approached solving that problem, whether we like it or not.  I have commended in this House certain actions taken by the Minister for Finance on reducing public expenditure, which had to happen.  I do not agree with the manner in which some of it was introduced but reductions had to be made.  However, there does not seem to be any attempt or concerted effort by the Government to realise the way we will get ourselves out of this situation is by creating more jobs.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that there are certain areas where we are doing quite well.  I do not have the statistics to which the Minister of State referred regarding how well we are doing in Asia.  It is to be highly commended but if we are doing well in Asia we could do equally well in other areas.  That during these difficult circumstances and times, we can do so well in Asian markets begs the question as to why we are not doing better in some of the other markets.  It may be an area on which there can be a focus.  It is interesting that the Minister of State mentioned that we are exporting more in terms of value to China than we are importing.  It is a very important statistic but we should aim to do that in other places.  We should try to replicate whatever has happened in the Asian office of Enterprise Ireland or whatever different agencies are involved in ensuring that we have such success in that area.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken a few measures recently.  A year after the Fine Gael proposal, it adopted the idea of a PRSI break for employers taking on unemployed people, which is good.  We had a long discussion today at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade <Col N="489"/>and Employment on competitiveness.  There are several specific areas still creating difficulties for our economy.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business the issue of difficulties with regard to the leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations was raised.  There are still difficulties in terms of attracting students to mathematics and science subjects.  If we are serious about innovation, research and development that is an area which has to be significantly addressed.  Education is key to improving our unemployment figures.</P>
        <P>There are also difficulties with regard to languages.  The Minister of State spoke about the Asian success.  There has obviously been a concerted effort with regard to overcoming language difficulties but we are not attracting enough young people to study foreign languages.  It is an issue I often think about.  I studied German in school.  It is an important language.  We have substantial commercial relations with Germany but we need to extend and expand the range of languages which are on offer to people in education.  Germany is a relatively small market in the overall global context.</P>
        <P>I will pick up a on couple of points made by the Minister.  I mentioned success in Asia and how we should try to use whatever successes we have had in that area and replicate them in other regions throughout the world.  I acknowledged at the time of the budget that the Minister&rsquo;s changes to the research and development tax credit were to be welcomed, a decision with which I agree.  I am a little puzzled by the comments of the Minister of State on Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s objective over the next five years to create 40,000 jobs.  He said it had done such a good job it created 700 jobs in the past six months.  That is nowhere near creating 40,000 jobs in the next five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>There are start ups.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know we have to start someplace and the current time is difficult but it seems that objective will be exceedingly difficult to achieve.  Nonetheless, we have to set objectives.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The stabilisation fund the Government introduced has had some success and was a good development, from the Government&rsquo;s point of view.  I was interested at the time we had the last discussion in this House to note that Senators on the Opposition side raised a number of strategies.  The Minister of State referred to the corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  It would be a controversial proposal to suggest it could be reduced further but at this juncture every item should be up for discussion.  We have seen in the past how significant reductions, such as the halving of capital gains tax, led to greater tax returns.  There may be a case to be made to our fellow members of the European Union, some of whom have much lower corporation tax rates, that we should examine that figure.  A reduction in it might attract more investment into the economy.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the level of investment made by foreign companies in Ireland and referred to &euro;7 billion in payroll and &euro;19 billion overall.  The figures are significant and cannot be ignored.  However, at times I get a sense of unreality from the Government&rsquo;s statistics and figures.  The Minister of State referred to the IDA and its efforts to attract investment into the country but even the most optimistic of forecasters do not suggest that we will see significant decreases in unemployment over the next 12 months, yet the Minister of State did not seem to acknowledge that anywhere in his contribution today.  I do not believe for a moment that job creation is at the heart of Government policy and I have not seen any evidence of where it is at the heart of Government policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his concluding remarks the Minster of State spoke about how the Government had taken measures to stabilise the public finances, which it has.  Could it also have fixed the banking <Col N="490"/>system?  It has not done so.  The Minister of State referred to the importance of banking and we have had those debates in the House.  I spoke about it on my local radio station recently and I still meet people in my constituency who cannot get access to credit.  All the while we spend billions of euros on Anglo Irish Bank which the Government now acknowledges will never be a proper bank again.  It is very difficult and there should be some level of acknowledgement that the strategy drawn up at the time by Deputy Richard Bruton, while difficult to explain and understand, was a strategy which explained the merits of the good bank and bad bank policy.  It is clear that what he said at the time in regard to the establishment of a good bank was what the Government should have done.  I hope we will not live to regret that his advice was ignored at that crucial juncture.</P>
        <P>There also needs to be some immediate action by Government on unemployment.  Unemployment is a personal disaster for every individual and family where unemployment has occurred.  There is a serious danger that we will have another lost generation of Irish people who have to leave the country because of economic circumstances.  After the Celtic tiger we should not have arrived at this juncture, where we have to export people again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not get a sense of a medium-term plan from the Government in regard to investment in infrastructure, broadband and other areas mentioned today at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Investment in education, access to training and the fact that so many people who want to get back into education and improve their skills are having difficulty in getting the basic information on their entitlements are important matters.  I am sure the Minister of State deals with this on a regular basis.  Some 90,000 people under the age of 25 are unemployed.  One third of all men under the age of 25 who are of employment age are not working.  Something must be done immediately by the Government to improve their job prospects.  Deputy Leo Varadkar recently produced a document for Fine Gael on youth unemployment.  I do not get a sense from Government that this issue is being taken seriously.</P>
        <P>Our unemployment rate increased at a greater rate than the European average in the last quarter.  We are now third behind Spain and Slovakia in terms of our unemployment rate which is reaching almost 14%, which is nearly as bad as it was at the height of the doom and gloom of the 1980s here.  It is something most people thought they had left behind.  It is coupled with the fact that there is huge emigration, not just of Irish people but of people who came here in the good times to work and are now returning home or going to other places to work.  The figures, while stark and shocking, are being distorted by the fact that so many people are leaving.  The figures are much worse than the CSO statistics suggest.  We should hold regular debates on employment strategies, perhaps on a weekly basis, not only between now and the summer recess but also when we return in the autumn.  This is the single biggest issue the country faces and we have to put our heads together to find ways of getting people back to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his wide ranging and helpful contribution and commend him on his ability while appearing on television to explain in a common sense way what is happening in the economy and how we are doing our best to thwart unemployment and restore the economy.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Irish Exporters Association I urge him to put in place a new international trade and investment strategy to assist small and medium sized enterprises which are currently focused on the declining domestic market.  The chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, John Whelan, has stated: &ldquo;We will continue to bleed the job losses seen over the past 18 months, unless a new dynamic international trade and investment strategy is put into place by <Col N="491"/>Government to help us trade our way out of the continued downward job spiral&rdquo;.  As a nation, it is imperative we commit to selling our way out of this recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Along with Connie Doody I set up Lir Chocolates, a company which now employs 200 people.  For 16 years, we worked on a 24-seven basis.  Unless a company achieves sales, it will go out of business.  Small and medium-sized Irish companies need urgent assistance if they are to begin to export.  They need stimulus measures that can be implemented immediately.  The drive to develop the smart economy is, of course, important but businesses will be empowered by an international trade and investment strategy.  I learned the hard way that the home market is too small but if one invests the effort and the shoe leather, it can be done.  The Irish Exporters Association proposes an export outreach programme as a core part of its strategy.</P>
        <P>At a recent forum in Farmleigh House, Dorene Mallon, who is a participant in Bord Bia&rsquo;s prestigious fellowship programme, made several points regarding the future of the Irish food industry.  The food and drink industry in Ireland employs 150,000 people, manufactures two thirds of our indigenous products and comprises almost one tenth of the Irish economy.  This bears witness to the capacity of the industry to meet the challenges we face.</P>
        <P>Crudely put, Ireland has enviable agricultural advantages for which almost every other country would kill.  It has abundant fertile land, lots of water and miles of coastline, all situated in close proximity to 400 million affluent people.  We are one of Europe&rsquo;s largest dairy and beef exporters and home to several world class firms and hundreds of food artisans.  Global demand for food is projected to increase by 70% over the next 40 years.  Despite all the factors in our favour, most Irish food exports are sold as commodities or on a business-to-business basis as food ingredients or for private labels.  Irish firms have limited contact with end consumers in foreign markets.  This means we are selling our raw ingredients to branded global companies which through their packaging, branding and marketing activities triple the price of our products by the time they reach retail markets.  Why are we not investing in the development of Ireland as a high quality food island rather than selling our products at cheap prices to multinational companies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish food and drink companies need to move away from being middle men or suppliers to focus on branding our own products.</P>
        <P>An interesting article in the farming supplement to today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> reports:</P>
        <P LI="1">UCD&rsquo;s associate professor of public health, Paddy Wall, said Irish dairy products needed to be differentiated on a global level.</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;All milk is not equal and it does not have the same nutritional profile,&rdquo; Prof Wall said.</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;The family farm setup cannot be compared with the intensive system they have abroad&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;We have the imagery and yet we don&rsquo;t market it.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">One cannot even compare the quality of our milk with that produced under intensive farming in the United States.  We should differentiate ourselves from other producers so people realise Ireland is a special location for quality food and drink products.  We must brand ourselves as the ideal place for nutritious food produced in a sustainable rural farming environment.</P><Col N="492"/>
        <P>Instead of competing in commodities markets, we should develop branded products along the lines of Actimel and, perhaps, Red Bull.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>God forbid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no reason why we cannot come up with new products through intensive research and development.  Lir Chocolates, of which I am still a board member, has to develop 30 new products annually to hold and grow our market position.  We are in an ideal situation because we know there will be major increases in the demand for food.</P>
        <P>I concur with the Minister of State&rsquo;s endorsement of multinational companies but we must also develop indigenous industries by supporting high class and branded products rather than commodities and ingredients for pizzas and grated cheese.  I commend him on his passionate speech.  It was a pleasure to listen to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Every time the House discusses unemployment and job creation, it must reflect on the context in which it is debating these issues.  As time passes, we tend to make monthly comparisons of the unemployment rate.  These show only minor trends such as slight increases or decreases in the unemployment rate and do not give a true indication of the position.  For this reason, I do not make any apology for reflecting on the extent of unemployment before proceeding to address other issues. </P>
        <P>As of the end of May, there were 437,922 people on the live register, an increase of 283,912 or 184% since the end of May 2007 when the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government was elected.  In Swords in my constituency, which includes Donabate and Portrane, unemployment has increased by 245% since the general election, while Balbriggan has experienced a massive increase in unemployment of 253% in the same period.  The towns in question have been hit hard and are relative unemployment blackspots.  It is unacceptable that in both locations only limited signing on services are available and people must trek into Dublin city centre for routine signing.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the live register figures for May make clear that we have not yet hit bottom and defy the claims by the Government that we have turned the corner.  I concur with Senator John Paul Phelan in this regard.  In addition to increased unemployment, tens of thousands of people have been forced to emigrate, while tens of thousands more have remained in or returned to education for the same reason.</P>
        <P>Tackling the jobs crisis is critical to securing an economic recovery that will help close the budget deficit and reduce the need for future tax increases.  The knock-on effect of endless job losses on the public finances is enormous, with every additional person on the dole costing the State approximately &euro;20,000 a year between lost tax revenue and extra welfare payments.</P>
        <P>What is the social impact of these developments?  There are 85,620 people under the age of 25 years on the live register, an increase of 180% from 30,561 at the end of May 2007, the month in which the Government came to power.  Youth unemployment is a social time bomb.  If young people are condemned to a pattern of long-term unemployment in their teens and early 20s, it will be very difficult for them to emerge from the current recession unscathed.  Young people without skills or qualifications are especially at risk.  During the boom years, many young people left school early to enter the workforce.  Unless the Government ensures significant investment in the further education and training of these young people, they face a future of long-term unemployment and are in danger of losing self-esteem.  The difficulty they experience in making a successful transition from school to work will potentially place them at <Col N="493"/>life-long disadvantage.  A life of unemployment, with lower wages and greater unhappiness, will lead to poor health for many in later life.</P>
        <P>While unemployment is bad for the economy, it is also bad for society as it will inevitably result in increased social costs.  Crime will rise and widespread social unrest and devastation of lower income neighbourhoods can be expected.  For this reason, joblessness must be given the priority it deserves.  What should the Government do?  It must place people before banks and private profit.  Unfortunately, getting people back to work appears to be low on the list of Government priorities.  The Government does not have a strategy for getting people back to work, retaining jobs or creating serious alternatives to life on the dole for the many people, particularly young people, who long to secure appropriate training.</P>
        <P>The Government should act on the call from ICTU, IBEC and a number of other organisations for continued investment in infrastructure to return people to work.  The Labour Party has, over the past year, consistently made the same call.  Mr. Danny McCoy of IBEC stated yesterday:</P>
        <P LI="1">Since 2007, more than 140,000 construction jobs have been lost, with employment in the sector dropping from 270,000 to 130,000.  Government has a huge role to play in halting this process.  With construction prices having fallen by 30%, now is an ideal time for Government to put in place specific investment plans representing good value for money to protect jobs and generate a return for the economy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While I do not always agree with IBEC, the accuracy of Mr. McCoy&rsquo;s analysis is blindingly obvious.  Domestic demand will only improve with investment.  In the current climate of banking crisis, investment must be led by the Government.  When we have ICTU and IBEC singing off the same hymn sheet it is significant and due notice should be taken of the hymn they are singing together.  Unfortunately, not only is the Government not on the same hymn sheet, it is not even in the same church.</P>
        <P>The ISME bank watch survey, which revealed that more than half of the companies that applied for credit in the past three months had been turned down, is extremely worrying.  It is a damning reflection of the failure of the Government to deliver on promises to make banks provide badly needed credit.  The banks have been denying for months that credit is not available.  The ISME survey confirms, however, what first-hand reports received by all public representatives in their constituencies show, namely, that viable companies are being choked to death by the failure to secure credit.  Jobs are being lost as a result and people who want to work are being condemned to a life on the dole.</P>
        <P>Despite ploughing substantial amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money into the banks, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party have failed to honour commitments the Government made that the banks would be required to free up credit in return.  This reinforces the case for the establishment of a strategic investment bank, as proposed by the Labour Party.  What we need is a new, green field bank with a clear mission to support investment in SMEs and innovative firms and assist in the funding of infrastructural investment.  The Labour Party has always argued that the action required to deal with the banking crisis and budget deficit must be accompanied by a strategy for jobs.  Creating jobs is the key to getting Ireland moving again.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has proposed a series of job creation initiatives, including the establishment of a strategic investment bank which would use &euro;2 billion &mdash; less than 10% of the total &mdash; of the National Pension Reserve Fund to support commercial investments of up to &euro;20 billion in critical infrastructure projects, innovative start-ups and the small and medium size enterprise sector; an SME working capital guarantee scheme, which would ensure that viable small and family businesses are able to secure the loans they need; a &euro;1.15 billion jobs fund to <Col N="494"/>support training schemes and labour intensive capital investment; a PRSI holiday for employers who take the long-term unemployed off the dole; and a graduate and apprentice programme which would guarantee relevant work based training and an opportunity to obtain new qualifications for all young people out of work.</P>
        <P>Just a few months ago, the Government voted down a Labour Party Bill which would have scrapped upward only rent reviews in the retail sector.  The legislation, if enacted, would have reduced costs in the sector, saved countless businesses and safeguarded thousands of jobs but was rejected by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  My party&rsquo;s policy document on tourism, Extending the Welcome, which was prepared by Deputy Mary Upton and is the subject of Private Member&rsquo;s time in the D&aacute;il tonight, contains well thought out proposals to sustain and develop the tourism industry.  It would result in the creation and retention of valuable jobs in the sector.  In addition, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock is completing a policy paper on the food and agri sector.</P>
        <P>Sector by sector, the Labour Party is addressing the crisis that has been allowed to develop by the Government.  In contrast, we discovered in recent weeks that five months after it was announced in the budget, the Government has made virtually no progress on its PRSI incentive scheme for employers, which was supposed to facilitate the creation of some 12,000 new jobs and reduce the numbers on the dole queues.  It is high time the Taoiseach and his ministerial colleagues gave unemployment the priority it deserves.  Creating and retaining jobs is the key to getting our economy moving again.  We need a much more proactive approach by the Government, one that is in line with that proposed by the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>On third level education and education places, third level applications have risen but not enough places are available.  Why does the Government believe it is better to have young people on the dole than in college?  Its plan to penalise those who do not take up training that is sometimes unsuitable and fruitless is not the way to proceed.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank the Leader for arranging this extremely important debate in such an expeditious manner.  I was surprised by the rhetoric of the previous speaker as I wanted to have a debate on job creation rather than unemployment statistics. </P>
        <P>The Labour Party has been the subject of considerable criticism recently for failing to produce policies.  This criticism has not been levelled at the Fine Gael Party to the same extent.  It appears from the previous speaker&rsquo;s contribution that the Labour Party&rsquo;s plan to create new jobs is to re-inflate the building boom by investing in infrastructure and creating a new bank.  I am startled by this proposal, which would not create any sustainable jobs and would be retrograde in terms of the direction of the economy.</P>
        <P>I was taken, however, by Senator Mary White&rsquo;s contribution in which she spoke of a high quality food island.  This is a genuine suggestion.  I worked in the dairy industry for many years and the Senator is correct that Ireland produces a large quantity of food ingredients.  Many food companies and co-operatives are based here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in does not look like a dairy farmer. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I assure the Senator that I worked for many good companies in the dairy industry for a number of years.  In many cases dairy companies produce food ingredients which are shipped abroad.  There is great potential to achieve added value.  The vision of high quality food production is a good one and one we need to prioritise.  The Green New Deal, the Smart Economy, the Green Economy and NewEra are the titles of vision documents <Col N="495"/>proposed by various parties.  The Smart Economy and the Green Economy are Government documents.  However, all of the documents have much in common.  They suggest a way forward and a vision as to how we can create a large number of jobs.  There are debates about how many can be created in the green economy or the smart economy.  The programme for Government suggests there will be approximately 127,000 jobs in the green economy in the next ten years.  I have heard Deputy Kenny on many occasions talk about a similar proposal and he has suggested a figure of 100,000 new jobs.  We can argue the toss about the number.  It does not really matter whether it is 100,000 or 127,000 new jobs; the reality is that the potential for job creation is enormous.</P>
        <P>In the energy sector we import approximately &euro;6 billion worth of fossil fuel energy supplies.  In the past two years of the Government we have moved from a figure of 7% to 15% in the use of renewable sources of energy, a significant achievement that is not often highlighted.  The green and smart economies have the potential to replace that figure of &euro;6 billion and keep the money in this country, in the process creating many jobs which will generate even more money.  The Minister of State said that for every 100 jobs created in export industry, 70 indigenous jobs were created.  The more we can export the better for the economy.</P>
        <P>I refer to a comment made by Senator Quinn in a previous discussion.  He suggested we did not need the Government to create many jobs itself, but to create the right environment in which jobs could be created.  It is not the job of the Government or the banks to create jobs.  However, it is the job of these institutions to create the right environment for entrepreneurs to create jobs.  The only jobs the Government can create are in the public service and at this time it is not realistic to expect many new public service jobs to be created.</P>
        <P>I refer to what I call sustainable energy zones.  To foster entrepreneurship, it is important to allow the right business environment to be created.  There are many blockages in the energy sector.  I cite the example of a gentleman who tried to set up a wind farm in Galway.  He received planning permission that lasted for a period of five years.  Throughout that time he tried to secure a grid connection from the ESB.  It took him seven years to secure it, at which point the planning permission had expired and he had to reapply.  In the meantime the land had been redesignated partly as an SAC and he found he could not obtain planning permission again.  At this stage he had secured a grid connection and invested a considerable amount of money but was unable to set up a wind farm.  That is not acceptable.  This point has been put to various Ministers and the Government is making amendments to the Planning and Development Act to prevent this problem occurring in the future; it is allowing for extensions.  Considerable work is being done to ensure the time taken to approve grid connections is greatly reduced.</P>
        <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is a gap.  There is a sustainable energy zone in Dundalk that has been extremely successful.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult for Irish businessmen to set up decent small green businesses, which is hampering job creation in this viable sector.  It is easy to suggest setting up a business in the green energy sector.  However, it takes considerable investment and many years to do so, with many blockages in the way.  The Minister should work with the local authorities on renewable energy zones in order that Government and local authority policies work in tandem to remove all the blockages in the way of businessmen who want to start businesses in the renewable energy sector and the green economy.  It is important that small businesses are prioritised in order that we do not see them closing because of cash flow problems, which, unfortunately, is the case.  We need to address this issue.  We also need to deal with the issue of local authority rates.  It is not acceptable for local authorities to raise rates at such a time.  We need to ensure they reduce rates to allow small businesses to become viable.</P><Col N="496"/>
        <P Just="Left">There are great opportunities in horticulture, a very important sector on a regional basis.  The Government has introduced a policy to increase the figure for forestry from 11% to 17% by 2030.  Throughout the country there are great opportunities in the sector.  We have not tapped into the potential to produce biogas.  There are blockages in that respect in that the issue crosses three Departments.  Biogass accounts for some 40% of Germany&rsquo;s renewable energy supply, while in Ireland the figure is zero.  There is great money to be made in its production and it would also help the farming industry.  The supply of biogas is not intermittent in the way that it is in the case of wind power and biogas can be used to supplement renewable energy supplies in particular areas.</P>
        <P>We should not forget that we have some of the best water supplies in the world.  We also need to consider the great potential of tourism.  We have a very good tourism industry but need to ensure measures are taken in order that when we face difficulties such as those caused by the recent volcanic eruptions, the industry will not fall apart if there is a sustained problem with air travel.  We need to look at many measures.  We need to be innovative and come up with suggestions on how we can stimulate business and create the right environment for entrepreneurs to flourish.  We need to be positive; we should not look negatively at unemployment figures, while indicating how appalling the Government is.  The reality is that it is doing its best.  Fine Gael is also making positive suggestions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and would be delighted if he would listen to what I have to say and, above all, take it on board.  I was impressed by what Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in had to say.  For one moment I thought he was not a member of one of the Government parties or perhaps his views were not getting through to the Government.  Much of what he said made considerable sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator saying the Government does not make sense?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am.  If the Government listened to some of what the Senator had to say, it would make a difference because it dovetails with some of what I have to say.</P>
        <P>I come to this debate as an employer in the past for five years, between the time when I was teaching and the time when I was elected to the Seanad.  I have some knowledge, therefore, of what it takes to create jobs.  I created six jobs, the importance of which is not to be minimised.  Just over one year ago, with two others, I set up Job Creation Initiative Oranmore.  Each month we hold a panel session to provide support.  We provide expertise that could cost an individual up to &euro;2,500.  We have undertaken various initiatives.  For example, our most recent conference was on the opportunities available in the green energy sector.</P>
      
        <P>I will discuss generally what the State can do and entrepreneurs should do, as well as how to support entrepreneurs.  The State cannot create jobs except for those in the public sector, and these are not multiplier jobs.  Entrepreneurs can create jobs whereas the State creates posts or positions, many of which are necessary and worthy but by definition incur a net economic cost to the nation.</P>
        <P>We must consider all the jobs created by the State and be honest about the proportion which is useful as against those which are wasteful and unnecessary.  As Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern created many wasteful and unnecessary jobs.  The proportion which is wasteful and unnecessary in the public sector now is up to 30% but if we had a slim and motivated public sector we would save up to &euro;7 billion per annum, or a third of the public sector pay bill.</P>
        <P>The State can only create jobs by allowing the risk takers in the real world to create jobs.  It should do this in two ways.  It must create the sectors with the most job creation potential and <Col N="497"/>support them through modest tax concessions and grants.  It should  remove as many bureaucratic barriers as possible for the entrepreneur prepared to take risks.  A friend of mine argues that if the gate is opened and we stand back, the multiplier will be let through.  These people are able to create the wealth and hire people in a process that will ultimately solve the mess we are in.  We need entrepreneurs who will create jobs and pay taxes that will fund our public services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to target sectors such as renewable energy for domestic use and export, maintain existing high-end foreign direct investment and promote Ireland as an educator.  Ireland has significant potential in international education; we currently make &euro;500 million from Ireland as a provider of the English language whereas the UK makes &euro;10 billion and Australia and New Zealand are the other providers.  Why do we not make more?  Our justice system and visa regulation in particular are not tied into education.  We are losers in that respect and I have spoken about this on many occasions on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>Ireland can also be an entertainer and leisure destination.  Culture means business and people love us as entertainers and for our culture.  We should build on this and bring about multipliers in this way.  The Government relied on Ireland as builder, which is all but over, and it has all but snuffed out other more sustainable sectors.</P>
        <P>On top of this are bureaucratic barriers, including the planning process.  Did the Minister of State hear what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government came out with this morning about the planning process?  I spoke to a man recently who has a quarry that is fully compliant but because the Minister has come up with a new regulation for quarries, the man will incur up to &euro;40,000 in costs.  The Minister should go after quarries which are non-compliant first.  He will choke up the planning process and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as well as the courts.  That is how ridiculous the Minister is.</P>
        <P>There is endless unnecessary and unquestioned paperwork and associated fees for many employers, an unreasonable delay in issuing licensing permits and slow payment by public bodies.  There is unspoken hostility from some in the public service, including the unions, to those who they perceive as doing better on the outside.  Those who were doing better on the outside in the past are no longer doing as well, and they have been our employers.</P>
        <P>I will give an example through a case study.  The current joint labour committees, JLCs, have had a frozen rate of pay for the past year and a half.  The Government has decided to increase the rates to a level which is much higher than that agreed by unions and employees at the JLCs.  The unions and employers are happy with the current rates because they facilitate the maintenance of jobs to some degree.  An increase in the JLC rates will force employers to lay off people as they cannot afford to pay such wages.  It is a death wish designed to drive more people on to the live register.</P>
        <P>I know a large supermarket owner employing 120 people and because the JLC rate will be increased in the autumn he will close on a Sunday and must lose 10% of his staff.  The Minister of State is part of the Government that has collective responsibility to address the issue before it worsens.  Does the Minister of State want his Government&rsquo;s job creation policy to put people on the live register?</P>
        <P>The State is currently close to being an enemy of the people as outsiders are seen as a nuisance and a threat.  For example, an assistant director of IT in the HSE &mdash; the Minister of State will recollect the PPARS computer system &mdash; is an insider while an old lady on a trolley is an outsider.  The hard political challenge is to intelligently cut away the fat and leave a much trimmer body of principal State employees who are motivated and proud to serve.  It can never be perfect but it could be done over ten years with the right leadership and support for an <Col N="498"/>informed and included public which is screaming for an answer and a plan.  It is a significant task but it must be done.</P>
        <P>Senators in this House have heard me say many times that the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, should make a state of the nation address laying down a plan for the next ten years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>He should place a vision before the people and enlist their support in getting Ireland back to work.  He must help our employers and entrepreneurs be the people they want to be.  We can then get taxes from them to pay for our public services.</P>
        <P>We can imagine getting to a point where the &euro;7 billion I outlined would be available for productive economic and social use and there would be a re-engineered business plan for Ireland, explained clearly and passionately by leaders of standing and trust.  That will bring the people on board for a different ten years of pain; this is preferable to ten years of propping up banks and other vested interests while withdrawing education, health and social services wholesale, with our brightest and youngest leaving the country while a bureaucracy stays in place.  The Government should eliminate the unnecessary bureaucracy because otherwise we will be doomed.</P>
        <P>The Government should act constructively to eliminate the bureaucracy.  The Minister of State should ask the Taoiseach to lay a plan before the people to bring us with the Government.  I say this as a member of the Opposition committed to the country before my party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, on a very comprehensive speech.  It was positive rather than negative and we should take the central message from it.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, made clear in a recent speech that the thrust of Government policy on the restoration of fiscal stability and a properly functioning banking system is to create the conditions in which economic growth will recommence and jobs will be created.</P>
        <P>It is clear the decisive action taken to date is bearing fruit.  The latest Exchequer returns show tax figures are on target for the period to end of April, indicating that this Government&rsquo;s firm action to correct fiscal imbalances has taken effect.  The evident determination of the Government to take the necessary actions, however unpopular, to tackle this problem and our equally determined actions in the banking sector have significantly restored international confidence in Ireland, as evidenced by recent announcements of further investment in Ireland by IDA clients.</P>
        <P>At every level of Government activity, jobs are at the heart of our strategy.  The public capital investment programme for 2010 is expected to support almost 70,000 jobs in the economy and non-Exchequer capital investment for 2010 will be &euro;3.4 billion, which is expected to support a further 30,000 jobs.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Government to exert pressure on the NRA to build new roads, particularly to the west.  I accept that I am being parochial in this matter.  County Mayo has some stretches of well-developed primary roads, namely, the part of the N17 that runs from the Galway boundary to the Sligo boundary, which is newly constructed and magnificent, and the part which runs from Castlebar to the Roscommon boundary.  However, the N5, which runs through Roscommon and into Longford, is a disgrace.  Money devoted to developing the N5 would be well spent.  It would enable County Mayo and other western countries to attract industry. <Col N="499"/> Building the road would create employment.  More importantly, it would assist in enhancing the activities of existing industries and provide them with access to larger markets.</P>
        <P>Ballina, Westport and Castlebar are home to large industries that depend on exports.  Due to the state of the roads, however, these towns are at a serious disadvantage.  The recent decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to uphold objections to upgrading of the N26 was wrong and has placed Ballina at a serious disadvantage in the context of its ability to attract industry.  Mayo needs industry and has several assets at its disposal with regard to attracting it.  The first of these is Ireland West Airport, Knock.  It is hoped that an industrial park will be put in place there and plans are proceeding in this regard.  I congratulate the relevant bodies and Departments providing assistance in this regard.</P>
        <P>I hope IDA Ireland will endeavour to bring employment to peripheral areas, particularly those on the west coast.  It is vital that employment should be created in the regions to ensure that communities can grow and sustain their existing populations.  Despite claims in recent years to the effect that the Government misspent the money that accrued to the Exchequer during the period of the Celtic tiger, it is clear that many good things were done.  Child care facilities were provided, community centres were built, sporting facilities were either provided or upgraded and new schools were constructed.  This was all done for the benefit of young people.  However, all this work will have gone to waste if there is no one around to use these facilities.  In such circumstances, employment must be created and existing populations sustained so that communities might survive.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is targeting the creation of 40,000 new jobs in the next five years.  Through the multiplier effect, this is expected to lead to the creation of an additional 28,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy.  The report of the high-level action group on green enterprise, published in November 2009, identified the potential to create approximately 80,000 new jobs in the coming years.  Implementation of the recommendations of the innovation task force will create the environment for even more jobs to be created in innovative sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken decisive action to get credit flowing again to business, particularly the small and medium enterprises that are the main source of employment here.  Undertakings required of the main banks in the recent recapitalisation exercise will ensure that they will repay the debt they owe to the taxpayers by restoring the flow of credit to enable business to exploit the opportunities offered by recovery in global markets.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has met representatives of the banks and will continue to closely monitor the activities of these institutions to ensure that they fully honour the commitments given in respect of the matter to which I refer.</P>
        <P>If employment is to be created, it is vital that small businesses have access to money.  Having been so well catered for by the Government and the State, the banks must open their coffers and give money to small businesses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>We heard about Ministers meeting representatives of the banks on previous occasions.  Did it make a difference?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="500"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Senator listened to what was said previously.</P>
        <P>The actions taken by the Government will ensure that the economy will be well placed to take advantage of the international recovery.  They will also assist in restoring growth in the areas of economic activity and employment, which is vital.  I was delighted to read a report in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers with regard to a Chinese consortium establishing an international trade centre to the east of Athlone.  If such a development comes to pass, the employment, and so on, to which it will give rise will also benefit the region in which I reside, not far from Athlone.  However, we must ensure that the proper road infrastructure is put in place in order that people might travel to and from this centre.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, refer to the Asian markets.  The work done by people from Ireland who went on trade missions to China is beginning to pay dividends.  A few years ago, Ireland had a trade deficit with China.  Now, however, it has a trade surplus of &euro;2.9 billion with that country.  I acknowledge what Senator Healy Eames said with regard to education and the teaching of English.  I was glad that following his most recent trip to China, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, stated that he would take action in respect of this matter and indicated that Chinese would be placed on the junior and leaving certificate curricula.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I was referring to the visa system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I agree that the position regarding the visa system must be examined.  However, it would be a positive development if Chinese were placed on the junior and leaving certificate curricula.  This must happen and I am delighted the Minister has taken suggestions in this regard on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tAire St&aacute;it.  Senator Carty was going well until the end of his contribution.  However, what he said earlier was correct.  The banks must play a significant role in job creation and in assisting innovation and enterprise.  On today&rsquo;s Order of Business, Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated that the cost of regulating the banks last year was &euro;39 million and that the figure will increase to &euro;50 million this year.  This is another enormous amount of money the people are being obliged to pay out.  The practice of bailing out the banks &mdash; with no apparent dividend for the people at the end of the process &mdash; must be brought to an end.</P>
        <P>We may all have different perspectives on economy recovery and job creation.  Ultimately, however, we all want to see people across all sectors of society in employment.  Hope, vision and a plan for job creation must be provided but none of these has been forthcoming from the Government.  Government Members can point to the fact that they are putting the banking system in order and that they have cut spending, reduced the amount of money allocated to Departments, and so on.  However, the report of the innovation task force states, &ldquo;In order to achieve this vision and secure Ireland&rsquo;s economic future we need to significantly increase our current rate of job creation and new company start-ups.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames is correct that the Government does not necessarily create jobs, except, perhaps, in the public sector.  In that context let us consider the budget, which contains a commitment to reduce corporation tax over a period, introduced in the UK earlier today.  This will have significant implications for Ireland, particularly in the context of the new Dublin-Belfast access route, which is a welcome development but which could have a profound affect on the west and the south.  Aer Lingus has indicated that there will be no flights out of Shannon to America in the autumn.</P>
	<Col N="501"/><P>Our competitiveness is being eroded.  Ireland has been referred to as the builder and creator of jobs in the construction industry but what about Ireland the employer?  It is stated day after day that the cost of doing business in this country is not being addressed.  A Martian who landed in Ireland in 2005 and returned in 2010 would find it difficult to conceive the programme for Government and Government policies that have got us where we are today.  Some 439,1000 of our fellow citizens are unemployed.  One can blame Lehman Brothers and the euro but the bottom line according to the two reports on the banking sector was internal factors.  Sadly, I lay the blame fundamentally and squarely at the door of former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, and the ideology of the former Progressive Democrats.  The biggest mistake made by Fianna F&aacute;il was to pretend at Inchydoney that it was, like the emperor, adopting a new set of clothes and was going to be a socially caring Government.  It did not do so and so let the people down.</P>
        <P>When the Opposition parties promote ideas such as NewERA or any type of jobs creation policy a litany of Ministers appear on the plinth and elsewhere criticising them.  Fine Gael has never been afraid of making the right decisions.  We supported the initial bank recapitalisation schemes, made decisions in regard to the budget and put forward an alternative programme in terms of the budgetary situation in which we find ourselves.  I would like to be a little parochial at this point.  Senator Carty referred earlier to the capital programme of expenditure.  There is a need to offer stimulus and hope for employment.  The model for this is the eastern gateway bridge in Cork which would have kick started the docklands and created jobs.  Linked to this is the development of P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh.  I congratulate the Cork city councillors who voted for the redevelopment of P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh and supported the sale by Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael of land in the show grounds for the creation of a new corridor in Cork.  It is hoped we will have a new convention centre attached to P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the most important events that took place this year was the acceptance of the Croke Park agreement.  My colleagues in the Labour Party opted to abstain from giving its opinion in this regard while the Government and Fine Gael were united in stating it should be accepted.  It was difficult for the public sector workers to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  As a public sector worker for many years, I congratulate and salute them for doing so because it was the right thing to do and it put Ireland, job creation and job retention first.  I agree with SIPTU that the momentum behind the Croke Park agreement must be maintained.  As stated by Senator Healy Eames, public sector reform is necessary and must be followed through.</P>
        <P>We need a more competitive Ireland.  We should follow the best practice of other countries and ensure key infrastructural spending on energy, telecoms and water is put in place, thus creating jobs.  A generation of Irish men and women require from Government the political leadership which sadly has been lacking.  It is hoped that tonight we will see a relaunch of Ireland at work.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  This is an important subject relating to the future of Ireland and how we go about getting our economy back on track.  I believe every party is at one in this regard.  We all want to see jobs created.</P>
        <P>While I was heartened by the speech given earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, having read it again I am unhappy with some aspects of it.  I believe the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech is simply putting words on paper.  The Minister of State stated that the Government is reducing the administrative burden by driving better regulation, that local authority charges remain a great concern of the business sector and that it is conducting an efficiency review of the local authority system to identify savings which will reduce pressure on small businesses.  It is a pity the Minister of State did not explain what he meant in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, will do so when replying.</P><Col N="502"/>
        <P>I attended a meeting yesterday of Mayo County Council, the county manager and director of services of which is obliged to meet with Oireachtas Members.  One of the biggest burdens on local authorities is the 30% local contribution they must come up with in relation to the creation of new waste water treatment and facilities.  Most local authorities do not have the rate base to do so.  The local authority business sector is lumbered with finding this 30% contribution.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, will spell out in detail how this will be done given the statement earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, that the Government is seeking to take the pressure off small businesses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the many burdens on small businesses as I am involved in that sector.  The only burden on councils in respect of small business is that of rates.  The vast majority of local authorities have not increased rates for the past year or two.  There have been huge increases in the cost of waste disposal &mdash; it is an ever-increasing cost &mdash; and huge increases in the cost of insurance.  The development charges in respect of new business, which are expensive, have driven up the cost of business.  Perhaps this is at what the Minister of State was hinting.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred also to driving better regulation.  This country has run amok in terms of regulation.</P>

	<P>What members heard yesterday from the county manager is frightening.  I would like to know if the Government will revisit the provisions introduced under section 80 of the 2005 Act.  The vast majority of staff within local authorities must under health and safety legislation be retrained or at the very least trained to do the job they are doing.  If not, they will be at risk.  I heard on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme today that Army personnel are not allowed to cut lawns owing to health and safety regulations and that this task is being farmed out.  We expect Army personnel to drive and use tanks but will not allow them to use a lawn mower, which is ridiculous.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will say if the Minister intends to revisit the legislation concerned.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, stated earlier that the Government is reducing the administrative burden by driving better regulation.  Does this mean the introduction of more regulation or the abolition of existing regulation?  The Minister of State did not state clearly what he intends to do.  Under law one is innocent until proven guilty.  However, under health and safety regulations one is guilty until proven innocent.  Health and safety officials have been bragging &mdash; I do not know if this is contained in its annual report &mdash; about convicting local authority personnel and holding them accountable.  We need health and safety measures but regulations have become ridiculous and are placing a huge burden in terms of administrative costs on small businesses.  We must look at this issue.  Health and safety regulations add as much as 25% to the cost of a local authority project.  The cost of a job projected to cost &euro;1 million will increase by &euro;250,000 because of health and safety requirements.  A whole new industry has been created by bureaucrats.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This burden needs to be lifted from local authorities and small businesses.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks were ambiguous, but I hope this is what he meant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Statements on job creation and innovation are hugely important.  This debate should be seen as an opportunity to do more than simply knock the Government, although we all like to do this from time to time.  The Government deserves to be knocked for its failure to create jobs.  However, we should also use the opportunity to look at and focus on solutions.  It is easy to point out where the Government strategy has gone wrong and there is no doubt it is going wrong.  It has been announced today that 40 jobs will be created in my townland.  However, this time last year we were losing 40 jobs a day in the same county and we are still haemorrhaging jobs in County Donegal, in which the unemployment rate is 21%.  The total workforce in the county is just above 60,000, but there are 21,000 on the live register which accounts for over one third of the workforce.  This rate of unemployment is not replicated anywhere on the island of Ireland.  The unemployment rate in County Donegal has always been above the national average.  When there was full employment, we had an unemployment rate of 12%, according to the household index surveys.</P>
        <P>We need to look at solutions.  We need a different and radical approach.  The public tends to focus on what Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael offer.  What they offer is very similar.  I listened to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd speak last week during the Deputy Enda Kenny and Deputy Richard Bruton battle.  He talked about how different Fine Gael was from the Government.  He said Fine Gael would not cut &euro;1 billion from the capital budget but would take it entirely from the current spending budget and that the Government cuts were not tough enough.  A report on third level fees will be published in the next few days.  How will the Fine Gael proposal on third level fees help to create jobs in counties such as mine?  In Border counties it is very easy for people to get an education in the Six Counties and the proposed graduation tax will place third level institutions in Letterkenny, Sligo and Dundalk at risk.</P>
        <P>We need to look at the solutions being brought forward by other parties.  I have helped to draft policies to tackle youth unemployment which Fianna F&aacute;il supported and stated were sensible.  Why do we not invest in job creation?  We hear much about the 80,000 people under 25 years who are unemployed.  Why do we not instruct F&Aacute;S to develop a long-term career path for every one of them?  If a person under 25 years remains unemployed for a period of time, it will be difficult for him or her to get back into the jobs market.  We know jobs are not available and that people need reskilling and retraining.  Going to a local F&Aacute;S office and being told this or that course is available is no good.  Everyone is unique and has different skills and abilities.  We need a pathway for each and every unemployed young person.  Why do we not recruit career guidance teachers who would be available between now and September to provide such a service for the under 25s during the summer months?  Why do we not look at a job creation strategy to invest State money in getting people back to work instead of having them on the dole?  That would require a radical shift from the policies of the two major parties which want to cut, cut, cut, instead of invest, invest, invest.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate which is hugely important.  It is also important that we recognise that the worst is over, that we have turned the corner and, in the fabled words of the Minister for Finance when presenting the budget last December, that we have marked a different line and are on the cusp of economic  recovery.  All of the <Col N="504"/>evidence available to the Government and the agencies which work with it is that recovery is under way.</P>

	<P>It is forecast that the growth rate will be positive at the back end of the year, which is not too far away.  We come to the close of the parliamentary session with the tantalising prospect of economic recovery beginning at the latter end of year and continuing into 2011.  That is good news for all Members of the House and all those outside who look to the Houses for guidance and leadership and the light at the end of the tunnel that recovery represents for many who have lost their jobs or are in employment which is vulnerable.  </P>
        <P>We have taken and delivered hard medicine to the economy and the spending profile of the Government and public services.  These tough decisions were not taken with any relish, but we have taken the decisions that will restore the cost competitiveness of the economy and the country.  It is not only the Government who is saying this.  Virtually every independent economic commentator at international level commends, with awe and envy, what Ireland has done in the past two years.  The Government has been involved in a fire-fight during the economic crisis.  It may be that we have not communicated our aims, ambitions and goals clearly.  However, if a small restaurateur has a fire in the kitchen, it is very difficult to provide good customer service while the fire is raging in the kitchen.</P>

	<P>We have had a fire raging in the kitchen of the economy for the last two years, but we have turned the corner.  There is now the prospect of recovery.  We have done a crash course in competitiveness which is the envy of other countries.  No other country in Europe could have withstood socially the reductions we saw in public service wages and salaries.  There were were huge reductions of between 12% and 35%.  Interestingly, the average reduction of 12% reduction is equal to what the best economists say was the differential between public and private sector workers.</P>

	<P>We have bridged the gap.  Many economists complained about the partnership process because it had conferred a salaries and wage benefit on those in public service employment of the order of 12% over comparable grades in the private sector.  That has been pushed back, which is good both for competitiveness and equality.  Public and private sector workers are now on a level playing pitch in salaries and wages.  That is why the Croke Park deal undertakes not to cut public service wages further.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note with interest and gratitude the thanks the Senator so clearly gave me.  Some elements of my speech must have been addressing her concerns if she was noble enough to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;.  I thank her for that.</P>
        <P>There are some key statistics about the economy of our country which are interesting.  We are the fourth most open economy in the world and the second most entrepreneurial country in Europe.  Eighty per cent of what we physically produce in this country is for export, 76% of those exports are generated from the multinational sector and 5% of our GDP, twice the European average, is spent on our public capital programme.  We are maintaining that through the worst recession the country has seen since the 1920s.</P>
        <P>There are a few talismanic figures and statistics which show that Ireland remains intensely competitive and globalised, up there and competing with the best countries in the world.  It is no accident that 50% of the inward investment gains and wins we have made in the past two years are in the area of innovation, research and development and science and technology.  These valuable investments of those two years show the competitive strength of the intellectual capital we have built in this country through our universities and institutes of technology.  Ireland is now a good place for people to invest if they wish to locate a research and development activity here.  That is the message I get when I make visits to the United States and elsewhere.  Basically, in a great many cases, the competition boils down to us and Switzerland when we pitch for investments on the research and development side or for shared services activities, whether in the IFSC or elsewhere among the corporations that have established a presence in Ireland.  That is good news.  We are up there with the best and are still competing and winning the high-end jobs that will represent the future here.</P>
        <P>I heard Senators say &mdash; it is almost a ritual now &mdash; that the Government has no recovery plan.  We took the opportunity through the Taoiseach to launch our recovery plan by means of the smart economy framework.  That is a very strong document which very few people in either House appear to have read.  That is the Government&rsquo;s recovery plan and is one that would have had to be enunciated publicly in any event, even if we were not going through the severe downturn we went through in recent years.  We would have had to move up the proverbial value chain into a higher end of manufacture and services.  We are doing that as we must have done even if there was not an international recession.  The clear evidence from before the period of recession is that many jobs of a lower order of manufacture and service provision were moving or drifting away to other locations &mdash; to central or eastern Europe, the Far East, etc.  We have executed this particular move, therefore, in a time of great difficulty but have managed and moved it.  Again the evidence is present about the recovery being under way.  If one talks to Enterprise Ireland, it is very clear that a recovery is happening in this economy.  If one talks to international people involved in freight forwarding, one hears the containers are filling up again.  International trade is becoming more robust as the weeks and months turn.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, the most recent survey by the NCB purchasing managing index shows that manufacturing expanded for three months in a row.  The most recent figures from that index are very interesting because they show that not only is manufacturing expanding, but the employment associated with manufacture also expanded in the most recent three month period of which I speak.  That is very interesting because, generally speaking, it is typical that manufacturing employment lags as does the actual expansion of manufacturing.  In other words, employers take the opportunity to move to newer forms of technology and higher productivity which does not involve adding extra jobs.  Now, however, we are in a very good place.  Manufacturing is expanding as is the associated employment.  That is really good news and bears out a great many things that were said to me by leading international bankers, financiers and economists when I was in New York some months ago.  They said they believe Ireland will come out of recession perhaps more quickly than even the United States, precisely because we are a nimble, <Col N="507"/>agile, globalised economy, the fourth most open economy in the world, and that we will emerge much faster with the onset of international recovery.</P>
        <P>The smart economy, with its emphasis on science, technology and innovation is at the heart of where we want to be, as a country in the future with high quality jobs, whether in green tech, the food sector, ICT or bio-pharma.  A figure not often quoted in public is the fact that more than 40% of our GDP is generated from the pharma, chemicals, bio-tech and bio-pharma sectors.  This is an enormous amount of our GDP.  One of the key challenges for us as our economy moves forward is how we achieve convergence, as between some of the major investments which have been made in Ireland in the bio-pharma and bio-tech sectors and in ICT.  If we can achieve a level of convergence between these different industries, we will create thousands of extra jobs in this economy.   There are good prospects for our economy.</P>
        <P>This debate has been very good because people should always remember that we must stop running ourselves down in this country.  I do not say the Opposition, this week at any rate, has been so negative with regard to the Government.  It is very important, whether one is in Opposition or in positions that command public air time, to stop running down this country.  Other countries with bigger economies than ours have had many more difficulties.  France and Germany have had 35% drops in their exports.  In recent years we have experienced a decrease of only in the order of 6% which is very low compared to those big trading economies.  When one hears what the commentary is like in France, Germany or the UK, one notes that people do not go around advertising their difficulties.  Bigger countries do not use their national media as some sort of therapy to give out about things or to run themselves down.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State is very welcome to the House.  I wish to raise the situation of Scoil Barra Naofa Cail&iacute;n&iacute;, Beaumont in Cork and paint a picture for the Minister of State regarding staffing and pupil numbers.  I hope the Minister of State will have good news because this is a progressive and modern school which has tried to get the right balance between class sizes and teachers.  It has a difficulty with allocations.</P>
        <P>In the school year 2009-10, there were three teachers for the 70 children in fifth and sixth classes.  Children in those classes require individual attention, a specific lesson plan and a teacher who is proactive with them.  Can the Minister of State imagine having three teachers for 70 children, mixing fifth and sixth classes?  The school must make two junior infants classes for 2010-11 which will leave only one teacher for 39 children in sixth class.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, spoke about the importance of education when replying to the previous debate, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, when introducing the debate.  I have heard the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, also speak of the importance of it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, mentioned the smart economy.  Having 39 pupils in sixth class, is 14 above the recommended size of 25 for a mixed class.  The recommended size for an unmixed class is 30.  Therefore, a class of 39 is above both those recommended maximum sizes.</P>
        <P>I am not sure when the Minister of State was last in a classroom but I taught in a classroom a few years ago.  Connecting with children of that young age is not about being a babysitter or placating them, rather it is about education, integration and having a child-centred approach, about which Piaget spoke so eloquently.  To combine children in different age bands in a big class is not educationally sound or workable.</P>
        <P>I hope this school will be able to reappoint and retain its tenth teacher for the next school year.  If we are serious about the importance of education, we must consider what the school principals are doing now.  As they approach the end of this school year, they are juggling numbers, assigning teachers to classes and planning ahead.  They require flexibility.  There needs to be willingness in the Department to be a little flexible in allowing what is best for children, not for the mandarins in Department of Finance nor for the bureaucrats, but for the children for the sake of education and for what is important for young people at second level.</P>
        <P>I have been in classrooms where students through no fault of theirs or of their teacher have fallen behind in reading, writing and mathematics because of the class size, the lack of individual attention and the failure to have an individual lesson plan because the primary school class was too big.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that Scoil Barra Naofa Cailin&iacute; in Beaumont is able to maintain its teaching cohort of ten teachers and that it will have adequate resources to retain its tenth teacher to provide for what is best for the children, which is what we are seeking to achieve.  If our last debate meant anything, the answer to this matter should be positive.  I thank the Cathaoireach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan. </P>
        <P>The staffing schedule impacts on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining.  In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by the Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September.  The enrolment is applied to a staffing schedule which issues annually from the Department.  While the staffing schedule at primary level allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils, each school decides on how to arrange its classes.  Combined classes are a feature of the majority of primary schools and this arrangement has no adverse implications for the quality of the education children receive.</P>
        <P>From an educational perspective it is important to note that numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor &mdash; far and above anything else &mdash; in improving educational outcomes for children.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be aware that the renewed programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of the Government.  It also provides for 500 teaching posts to be provided between primary and second levels over the next three years over and above additional posts that will arise due to demographic increases.  Following consultation with the education partners clear and transparent criteria have been agreed for the allocation of these posts in both sectors.</P>
        <P>One hundred of these posts have been allocated to each sector, primary and post-primary in the current school year.  At primary level the posts have been allocated to schools that had increased enrolment in the current school year and which, as a result of last year&rsquo;s pupil-teacher ratio change, lost out on a teaching post in this year by either one, two or three pupils.</P>
        <P>For the coming school year the additional posts have also enabled some improvement to be made to the staffing schedule at primary level.  These improvements are targeted at medium-to-larger schools which are typically under the greatest pressure in class sizes.</P>
        <P>The level of teaching resources allocated to individual schools for special needs and language support will be determined following completion of the allocation processes for these posts during the spring and summer period.  It is only when all the various allocation processes, including the appeals mechanisms, are fully completed that the final staffing position for individual schools will be fully determined.  It is important for all schools to ensure that whatever teaching resources the Government can afford in these unprecedented economic times are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for children.</P>
        <P>It is open to any board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0021/2010 and Circular 0015/2009 &mdash; Meeting the needs of pupils learning English as an Additional Language.  Both circulars are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The school referred to by the Senator submitted an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeal Board which was considered by the board at its meeting on 21 June 2010.  The board decided that a departure from the staffing schedule was not warranted in this case and the school has been notified in this regard.  The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  I thank the Senator again for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, the last paragraph of which was disappointing.  It illustrates that the Department does not show flexibility or willingness to <Col N="510"/>allow students to flourish and to let their light shine.

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the predicament facing a group of fishermen that has emerged in recent days in the Lough Foyle area, which is administered by the Loughs Agency.  A number of drift net fishermen, commercial salmon fishermen, fish in this river but there are also ten draft net salmon fishermen who fish in the river who have been in touch with me about letters they have received, dated 4 June, from the chief executive officer of the Loughs Agency in Derry, which is a North-South body.  The letter refers to the fact that the Loughs Agency was preparing the Foyle Area (Control of Fishing) Regulations 2010.  These regulations were subsequently made on 2 June 2010 and will come into force ahead of the commercial salmon fishing season, which would have commenced already, now that we are past the 15 June deadline.  The rationale behind the decision, according to the letter that has been sent to the draft net fishermen, is that the River Finn, which feeds into the Foyle system, has not achieved the conservation limit for salmon in two of the past five years.  The agency therefore outlined that it is required to suspend the killing of salmon returning to the river until such time as the management target is achieved.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">This has come as major surprise and shock to the fishermen.  The ten fishermen, whom I represent, and who I met over the weekend, are deeply concerned that their livelihood has now effectively been taken from them.  These fishermen would have had the opportunity in 2007 to avail of the salmon hardship compensation package but they declined the offer at the time.  I have one of the letters of offer made to one of the fishermen.  The fishermen declined the offer because they had no other form of employment.  They were highly dependent on commercial salmon fishing, the draft net fishing, at the time.</P>
        <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Their grievance is that no consultation took place with them prior to their receipt of a letter from the Loughs Agency to the effect that cessation of fishing was commencing this year.  If the salmon stocks are dwindling, it is a cause of concern to us all.  I walked along the River Finn and the River Foyle over the weekend and noticed the water levels were very low and that there was a great deal of dirt and muck on the river beds.  While I am not an expert on fishing a number of anglers and fishermen have pointed out to me that the migration of salmon up the river would be very difficult due to the fact the water level is very low and there is murky residue on the river bed.</P>
      
        <P>Perhaps that issue should be addressed, as conservation is a matter for the agency, with the funding provided in 2007.</P>
        <P>Has the declaration been signed by the Northern and Southern Ministers, given that it is a North-South body?  If the ten draft net salmon fishermen are prevented from engaging in commercial activity this year, can they obtain some of the hardship money that was available until now?  Can somebody meet them to discuss the implications for their livelihoods?</P>
        <P>I wanted to bring these matters to the attention of the Minister of State and I am delighted he is present to respond.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Salmon stocks exploited in the Foyle by the commercial interceptory fishery up to 2006 had been achieving their conservation limits.  However, the scientific advice for 2006 indicated that a rationalisation of the fishery was necessary to protect stock levels and the future viability of the commercial fishery.  In May 2007 approval was given by the North-South Ministerial Council for the introduction of salmon conservation measures to be administered by the Loughs Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.  The <Col N="511"/>agency, under the co-sponsorship of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland, is a North-South body established under the British Irish Agreement Acts, responsible for, among other things, the protection and conservation of inland fisheries in the Foyle and Carlingford areas.  Regulations agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council provided the agency with the necessary powers to manage wild salmon stocks in the Foyle and Carlingford areas, in compliance with the EU habitats directive and the recommendations of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation.</P>
        <P>Recognising the impact that cessation of the mixed stock fishery at sea would have on traditional salmon fishermen, approval was also given for a hardship scheme to be offered to former drift and draft net licence holders who had been active between 2002 and 2006.  The Loughs Agency, in conjunction with its sponsor Departments in the North and the South, introduced a hardship package for salmon fishermen no longer able to fish in the drift net fishery.  The scheme was extended, on a voluntary basis, to the existing draft net fishery operators who had fished their licences in 2006.  The scheme was intended to provide a measure of relief for individual licence holders in line with the degree of hardship likely to be experienced on foot of the cessation of fishing for salmon arising from the closure of the interceptory fishery seaward of Lough Foyle.  The scheme was jointly funded by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  The total cost was &euro;3.8 million.  The number of drift nets that operated in the Foyle area was reduced from 112 to 18, while the number of draft nets which operated within the lough and River Foyle decreased from 50 to ten.  It must be stressed that the commercial nets men who have not been issued with licences in 2010 were made aware, when the salmon hardship package was offered in 2007, that if they did not accept the package, any future suspension or closure of the fishery would not attract hardship payments.</P>
        <P>There has been a worrying decline in salmon stocks in recent years.  In 2009 they were only meeting 40% of their management targets, based on conservation limits.  Salmon stocks in the River Finn which has been designated as a special area of conservation for Atlantic salmon under the habitats directive are no longer meeting sustainability targets.  There was a particular concern about the impact on the remaining stocks where commercial drift and draft nets were continuing to operate.  In order to reach the River Finn, salmon have to pass through Lough Foyle where the drift fishery operates and the River Foyle where the draft net fishery operates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following a long period of consultation and development, the Foyle Area (Control of Fishing) Regulations 2010 were made to take account of the agency&rsquo;s national and international obligations, including the requirements of the habitats directive. The regulations provide for a practical and equitable response to falling salmon numbers in the Foyle system.  In particular, they provide for the suspension of angling or the use of nets to take salmon or sea trout, or the restriction of angling to catch and release in specified waters in the Foyle area for the purpose of conservation of Atlantic salmon if the number of migrating salmon counted going upstream in the rivers Mourne, Faughan, Roe and Finn are below stock level targets or, in the case of the rivers Mourne and Roe, if the rivers were in flood or, in the case of the River Mourne, in times of drought.  The regulations specify the target numbers for stock levels of migrating salmon in the rivers Mourne, Faughan, Roe and Finn and water levels for the rivers Mourne and Roe.  In addition, they stipulate the conditions under which netting in the River Foyle, Lough Foyle and seaward of Lough Foyle will be suspended if the number of migrating salmon counted going upstream in the rivers Mourne, Faughan, Roe and Finn is below the specified stock level target numbers.</P>
        <P>The issue of declining stocks was also the subject of a formal complaint to the European Commission in May.  The complaint maintains that the continued use of 18 drift and ten draft nets within the Foyle system is not consistent with the requirements of the habitats directive <Col N="512"/>in that it is indiscriminate in its nature, as it does not just target salmon from rivers within the Foyle system that are healthy and meeting their conservation targets but will also catch salmon from the weakest river within the system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the circumstances, there is no question of the suspended commercial interceptory fishery being reopened until stock levels allow.  While there can be understandable sympathy for those impacted upon by the necessary suspension, there can be no question of introducing a new hardship scheme for fishermen who decided not to avail of the scheme previously introduced.  These fishermen made a choice to continue fishing rather than avail of the hardship scheme at a time when there were serious concerns about the scale of the decline in salmon numbers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Commercial fishermen who chose to continue fishing were fully aware of the risks they were taking in declining to avail of the scheme.  However, if stock levels improve to a point where there is a harvestable surplus, the regulations allow for the reopening of the fishery.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the position and the reason the restrictions are in place.  I note that there was &euro;3.8 million available under the salmon hardship scheme.  Perhaps the Minister of State might consider whether any of the surplus moneys available could be used to provide some compensation for the 28 fishermen involved.</P>
