	<P>I have received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children, given the cost to the Exchequer of alcohol abuse, to provide an update on the current actions to curb such abuse and the current status of provisions providing for the labelling of alcohol products.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Marc MacSharry of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure adequate funds are made available to Sligo General Hospital for the operation of the bus bringing patients for cancer treatment to University College Hospital, Galway from the &euro;750,000 fund announced as being ringfenced for such purposes.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator James Carroll of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to outline the reason for Ireland&rsquo;s decision to go for an alternative free-to-air digital transmission platform to that of the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Keaveney and MacSharry as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Carroll as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>As Leader of the House, I congratulate Senator Pearse Doherty on his election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and commiserate with all other colleagues, especially Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, who fought such a great campaign.  </P>
        <P>Before detailing the Order of Business, the programme for national recovery agreed with the European Union and the IMF was the subject of much deliberation over the weekend.  I am endeavouring to set time aside on the Order Paper for a discussion on the programme this week.  I seek the agreement of the House to have an all-day debate on Thursday.  If colleagues have their submissions prepared, I intend to include it in the business of the House to be ordered for Thursday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on North-South co-operation in relation to sex offenders, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 5 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for eight minutes and all other Senators for five minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon seven minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from party leaders or spokespersons; and No. 35, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 19 regarding the Government&rsquo;s four year plan, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard many times from the Government that everyone must share the pain to allow the country to move forward.  While those in receipt of social welfare, the elderly and young children in classrooms must share the pain, it is clear from the deal the Government has done with the International Monetary Fund and other partners that bondholders will not share the pain.  People are furious that bondholders will not share the pain while everyone else is being asked to do so.  That is the outcome of the negotiations which the Government has concluded.  People are also concerned about the raiding of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the interest rate associated with the bailout.  The euro continues to face critical problems which will have to be addressed.  It appears Ireland is paying a heavier price than it should pay as a result of the decisions taken in recent days.</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P Just="Left">Parliamentary democracy was abandoned during the negotiations on the deal.  Why will the deal not be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Why was so little information made available to the parliamentary process, namely, the D&aacute;il and Seanad?  The deal will not be put to a vote in the D&aacute;il.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the House debate it today to give Senators an opportunity to put forward our views.  The abandonment of parliamentary democracy is a continuation of what has been clear for a long time.  This side has consistently raised the fact that much negotiation takes place and many announcements are made outside the House.  We have seen this occur again in recent days and weeks.  How can people have respect for politics when the Government shows so little respect for our political institutions?  We must restore respect for politics.  Surely, therefore, discussing the IMF-ECB deal in the Houses and having the Government provide more information is the correct approach?  We are receiving more information from the Governor of the Central Bank and the European negotiators than from the Government.  I call on the Government to provide much more information for members of the public, the media and the Houses.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate former Senator Pearse Doherty on his election.  It is important that the House does so.  Perhaps it would be better to avoid mentioning that the main Government party came third in the by-election.</P>
        <P>In light of comments made in the House last week, including by Senator Paul Bradford, I congratulate the ICTU on organising an effective, responsible and civic-minded demonstration on Saturday.  The march afforded people an opportunity to express their viewpoint in a manner other than at the ballot box.  The demonstration will not have harmed the negotiations in which the Government was involved at the time.  If anything, it will have helped the Government.  When done properly, demonstrations are welcome.  As Senator Bradford correctly noted last week, it is appalling and gives the wrong impression when protests degenerate into incidents such as storming the gates of Government Buildings or Departments.  They are welcome, however, when done in a responsible and civic-minded manner.</P>
        <P>In light of the issues raised by Senator Fitzgerald when calling for an early debate on the recent deal, the Leader should provide time for debate on another issue which emerges from all that has taken place.  An issue emerges in the middle of all this and I wish we had time to discuss it, as it was to discuss such issues this House was established.  Matters such as neutrality, sovereignty and independence are being confused and made to appear almost synonymous in much of the debate.  Neutrality was never meant to be a concept in which nations would stand idly by while a wrong was being done.  Similarly, the concept of independence does not exclude or rule out our having a shared view on global or international issues, while sovereignty is not lost in accepting help from another country or member state.  None of this would be the case anymore than if we were to stand in line to help another country or member state, financially or otherwise, we would be taking away some of its sovereignty.  That is the vital test.  We would not do such a thing but would help by showing good will.  We should not confuse a threat to or loss of sovereignty with a loss of good government which is an entirely separate matter.</P>
        <P>It is not good for the country to face into a general election with people feeling a new Government would not be able to rule with full sovereignty and independence.  Of course, it will be stuck with whatever the current Government will leave it and that is a fair and important point to make.  However, we do not want to say to the people that there is nothing left to rule, that this is no longer an independent country and that we can no longer make decisions for ourselves.  That is patently not true.  We should focus on how we have come to be where we are and I hope we will do this in the debate which Senator Fitzgerald has proposed.  In that sense, the blame game must definitely be played because one cannot walk away from these <Col N="4"/>matters without apportioning blame.  However, we must also look forward and create a sense of optimism and enablement for the people as we face into a general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether we have a debate on the IMF-EU programme either today or on Thursday, I would have thought an essential first step would be circulation of the document to Members of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not seen it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are working on a need to know basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the document about which people are talking?  Like everybody else, I read the newspapers.  Is it not bizarre that not even one screed of paper on what this incredibly important programme is supposed to contain has been circulated to us?  We are told the memorandum of understanding is before the Cabinet and will be published and brought before the D&aacute;il.  Can we see the document?  The first principle in having a debate is that we should know precisely what it is we are to discuss.  It is extraordinary that we have seen nothing.  I receive material every day, as, I am sure, colleagues do.  I have paper up to such a height in my office on legislation of varying degrees of importance, as well as other documents.  However, I do not have this one which we have been told is the most important and momentous programme we will ever be in a position to debate or discuss in this House.  As Senator Fitzgerald rightly noted, it is unbelievable and extraordinary there has been no consultation and that, apparently, not only was it proposed not to engage in consultation with the Houses of Parliament before the agreement was put in place &mdash; there might be some excuse for this &mdash; but also that there would not be any consultation afterwards.  It is no exaggeration to say this amounts to a gross undermining of democracy, the Constitution and the way in which a parliamentary democracy is supposed to operate.</P>
        <P>The points made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole about sovereignty are well taken.  However, even if no constitutional issues arise from the programme, it is certainly the case &mdash; this is where I depart from the Senator &mdash; that the policy options and alternatives a Government will wish to look at in the future will be seriously circumscribed and delimited by what is apparently contained in the document.  Choices on social and economic policy will be circumscribed by what is contained in it.  If one does not wish to describe this as a loss of sovereignty, that is fine.  We can debate what is meant by sovereignty.  However, the document will have an enormous and negative impact on the freedom of action and movement of a future sovereign Government for many years to come.  Clearly that is a basis for us on which to debate this question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As an example of how bizarre this state of affairs is, let us take the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Until last Friday we were all under the impression, including citizens who contribute to the fund, that it was an important prudential provision for the future of the country in regard to public service pensions.  A colleague, former Deputy Derek McDowell, was castigated by Ministers in 2002 for daring to suggest a small amount of the pensions reserve fund could be used for developmental purposes &mdash; the head was taken off him.  Now, it is not a question of dipping into it or using a part of it; from what one can see, every single penny of it is being handed away.  The point I am trying to make is not so much in regard to the huge error contained in that decision but the complete failure even to signal the possibility that this would happen before a decision was made to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="5"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I too wish to be associated with the vote of congratulations to Senator Pearse Doherty and to all those who stood in the Donegal South-West by-election.  In the times we live in, we should express our gratitude to everyone who puts their name on a ballot paper and seeks to engage with the public, who are obviously angry, disappointed and disillusioned, and react accordingly.</P>
        <P>With regard to the IMF-EU package and the all-day debate we will have on Thursday, it is necessary that we devote as much time as possible to this.  I accept the point made by Senator Alex White that this must be accompanied by suitable documentation in regard to what exactly we are debating.  I hope the focus of the debate will be not only on whether this is or a good or bad deal, or whether it is right or wrong for it to be accepted, but also on clear ideas as to what the current alternatives are, which is at the heart of the agreement that has been reached.  It will be for others to argue those points on Thursday.</P>
        <P>I also ask that Members emphasise that those negotiations were undertaken on behalf of the State, and the people undertaking them were officers of the State, including the Governor of the Central Bank, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the head of the National Treasury Management Agency.  To try to bring down the negotiations to a political context is unfair to those people, in particular, and the job they were doing on behalf of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a political decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the debate will be understood in those terms.</P>
        <P>In terms of where we are as a country and the need to consult widely with the people, the decision that has been made was a sovereign decision of Government.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that we need to have a debate on the question of sovereignty.  We have made many decisions in recent years about the nation and its sovereignty, how we pool it in the European Union and in the form of the euro currency, and how the policy decisions that have been made by successive Governments, which have made this one of the most open economies in the world, have exposed us to the situation in which we find ourselves.  Those are all factors that have undermined sovereignty in this country and we need a debate in those terms.</P>
        <P>In regard to the finer detail of the debate, I stress to Members that many of the aspects of this agreement require legislation to be passed, including legislation to deal with the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  There will be opportunities to consider the finer points and details and to have the required votes and actions of parliamentary democracy in this and the other House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the opportunity to compliment all the local authorities throughout the country for their wonderful response in gritting the main roads in particular during this bad spell of weather.  A question arose for the city manager in Waterford yesterday concerning leaving bags of grit in estates so that civic minded people could spread it around the estates, given that local authorities obviously cannot get to every location.  The manager indicated that an Oireachtas committee last year asked the Attorney General for advice in regard to any liability that would arise from residents spreading grit or clearing in front of their houses.  The Leader might indicate what was the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice on that matter, which might enable local authorities to grit estates with the assistance of residents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; on the programme screened last night in regard to cigarette smuggling and those involved, including subversives and hardened criminals. Will the Leader inquire whether we need further legislation to ensure the punishment fits the crime?  When one hears that the importer of 13,000 illegal cigarettes was fined 13 cent by a judge and that importers of tens of thousands were fined &euro;150, one realises the punishment is absolutely <Col N="6"/>ludicrous considering the quality of the cigarettes.  All cigarettes are bad for one but these counterfeit cigarettes are of serious danger to one's health.  We need action regarding the smuggling of illegal cigarettes into the country.  Will the Leader inquire about proposed legislation in this regard?</P>
      
        
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret the announcement of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, not to stand again for election.  I would like to raise the same issue as Senator Cummins.  I have regularly referred to the tobacco industry in the Oireachtas.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children produced a report on it.  It has always been said increasing the price is the only way to deal with tobacco consumption, yet the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and Minister for Finance baulk at the idea of setting the price too high because they say it will further the underground market.  The two issues need to be dealt with simultaneously.  There is no point in saying we cannot deal with cigarettes being smuggled into the country.  The number of smugglers getting caught is small but if the number of staff tackling the problem were increased, it would be helpful.  Smuggling represents a massive loss to the Exchequer and, therefore, any increase in the use of drug dogs and equipment that can detect smuggling will be of benefit.  There is a serious price to be paid in our hospitals because of the arsenic and various poisons people are inhaling from the cigarettes in question.</P>
        <P>The second issue I want to raise concerns a topic discussed on &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; last night, FIFA&rsquo;s dirty secrets.  A couple of weeks ago, I asked that Ireland become involved with the enlarged partial agreement on sport.  We need to deal on an international basis with corruption, organised crime and circumstances that are not right in sport.  Last night it was alleged that $100 million was given to three FIFA officials.  Two other officials have been banned from making a decision on Thursday as to what country will be allowed to host the World Cup.</P>
        <P>Where does the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport stand on corruption in sport?  The International Olympic Council is saying it will investigate the matter.  This is not appropriate and not enough.  Why are sports commentators saying what has occurred in respect of Thursday&rsquo;s bid is almost treason against England considering that eight secret deals must be done with the government that cannot be exposed?  They were exposed last night, however, by the Dutch Government.  Considering the types of moral links and compromises that must be made, it is time to ask the Minister the price of hosting the World Cup in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The deal done on Sunday was pretty secret also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment proposed by Senator Fitzgerald.  Will the <?oasys _dc28- ?>terms of the memorandum of agreement be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in order that<?oasys _dc0- ?> the representatives of the people can vote upon them?  If not, in what sense can this Parliament be described as a democracy?  Are we in the Oireachtas the servants of the people or merely the lackeys of our own morally and financially bankrupt banks and international financial interests?</P>
        <P>Is the Leader aware that every single economist and financial commentator, irrespective of whether he or she is in favour of burning the bondholders, acknowledges now that the process of not burning them is immoral and penalises the Irish people for the mistakes, stupidity and greed of the banks?  Is it not the case that this process is immoral, unjust, unethical and unfair?  Acknowledging these facts, will the Leader state whether, in these circumstances, a proper financial system or a proper and just civil society can be sustained on a foundation of immorality, unfairness and injustice?  Is the Leader aware that the Nobel prize winning economist, Paul Krugman, said, &ldquo;And you have to wonder what it will take for serious people to realize that punishing the populace for the bankers&rsquo; sins is worse than a crime; it&rsquo;s a mistake.&rdquo;  In light <Col N="7"/>of the fact that the director of the largest single bond investment group, Mr. El-Erian, whose name I put on the record of the House last week, has indicated that the bondholders should be burnt, will the Leader comment on this matter?  Will he ensure the House will at least have an opportunity to vote on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Some days ago Senator O&rsquo;Toole announced that he would not be seeking re-election.  I was sorry to hear that, particularly on the basis that I value his contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should put a question to the Leader on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole recently noted that, in its current form, the Seanad was indefensible.  In his contribution on the Order of Business he referred to neutrality, sovereignty and our independence and asked whether these had been weakened by our entering into an agreement with the European Union and the IMF.  I do not believe they have because there is nothing wrong with seeking help.</P>
        <P>There is now more than ever a compelling requirement for us to examine our political system.  Fundamental reform is necessary, particularly in the light of the fact that for the past three months Members on all sides have been point-scoring and trying to gain party political advantage.  Therefore, this House must be retained.  The debate on reform may not take place before Christmas or prior to the end of the lifetime of this Seanad.  I hope I will return to the House following the next election and that the radical reform required will be introduced.  I would like Senator O&rsquo;Toole to be present to support such reform.  There is a need for the reform to which I refer to be introduced immediately after the election of the next Seanad.</P>
        <P>A number of proposals have been brought forward and I am not surprised that the one which recommends the abolition of the Seanad is gaining popularity, particularly when one considers the exact nature of what has been discussed in the House during the past three months.  Members of the public are not tuned in to what is happening here.</P>

	<P>Senator Ormonde should put a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>If the debate on the matter cannot be taken immediately, I urge the Leader to make time available for it as soon as possible.  This matter must be kept on the agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senators that the Order of Business involves questions to the Leader.  Senators on all sides are drifting and tending to make speeches.  If this continues, I will be obliged to make additional interventions.  I have been quite lenient in respect of the contributions of a number of Senators, but I will be obliged to tighten matters in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I become worried when I hear people such as Senator Boyle passing off responsibility for political decisions.  The Government is the Executive and its members, not the officials, negotiated on behalf of the people.  The Government was duly and democratically elected.  In the context of the debate on the future of politics, it is statements such as those made by Senator Boyle which oblige me, as a politician, to become concerned about the future of our democracy.  As a result, I request a debate, for which others have called in the past, on the future of politics and the Republic.  At this most critical juncture in our history, political accountability appears to be missing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when one hears the Deputy Leader of the House and chairman of the smaller party in government make comments such as those he uttered earlier.  Political accountability is required for political decisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In joining the euro a number of years ago Ireland agreed to a shared monetary union.  In essence, we agreed to a loss of sovereignty in respect of our monetary system.  Sadly, in the light of the events of the past week and the programme agreed between the Government and the IMF, we are now ceding our fiscal independence and sovereignty.  This will tie the hands of future Governments and policymakers to a large degree, which must be a source of some concern.  The outcome of the negotiations was extremely disappointing and it behoves all Senators to indicate exactly how they feel in that regard.  I am particularly disappointed at the interest rate that will apply.  I am also disappointed at the fact that the National Pensions Reserve Fund has been raided.  Fine Gael had made very solid proposals on how part of the fund could be invested in the economy in order to provide a stimulus.  The most important aspect of this matter is that senior bondholders appear to be untouchable.  The people cannot understand this and clear reasons must be provided as to why this decision was made.</P>
        <P>Our national bank, namely, Anglo Irish Bank, which was bought by the Government appears to be engaging in semantics of late.  It appears consideration is being given to rebranding it.  We are referring to a zombie bank which has literally sucked up both the economy and taxpayers&rsquo; money.  It cannot be allowed to remain in place.  As Fine Gael has continually stated since the start of the financial crisis two years ago, it must be wound down.  There is, therefore, a need for a debate on the future of the banking sector.  We need to find a banking resolution mechanism before it pulls the whole economy down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate on Thursday on the EU-IMF funding.  I am conscious, as is the rest of the country, that it is increasingly clear that the bondholders and the markets are particularly targeting the peripheral countries and the less advanced financially countries in Europe.  First, Greece was targeted.  We know there was short selling of Greek bonds, which was outlawed, and eventually Greece decided not to sell its bonds to anybody but banks or insurance companies.  It seems Ireland has been targeted, Portugal has been targeted, and they are talking about Spain and Italy.  Iceland has already gone into default.  The reality is we are not alone in Europe but is happening throughout the eurozone.</P>
        <P>There is much misrepresentation and that is not good at this time.  When financial debate runs out and there is nothing more to be said, that is the time to say nothing more instead of talking about a suite of rates, as if the IMF and the EU could have given us a different rate if we had only asked for it, which is clearly patently untrue.  Similarly, why are there calls for a vote on the issuance of bonds and the taking up of a bond?  Why is it being called for now?

        <P Just="Left">At a time when we need level heads, we need to see a financial way forward and we should be talking about what is the best monetary policy and the best way of expanding the economy rather than stating that the Government should not have used the National Pensions Reserve Fund and it was needed for the pensions of the future.  Each of the Opposition parties had intended to use it for something else anyway, in other words, they are speaking out of both sides of their mouth asking why the Government is not holding it for pensioners when they intended to use it to reflate the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s announcement on standing for the Seanad on the next occasion, I am not sure he fully appreciates that if the Seanad is to be reformed or abolished, we need a Seanad to pass the legislation.  In light of this, he might reconsider his position.</P>
        <P>With regard to last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, a number of weeks ago I raised this very issue, about the continuous increase in excise duties on tobacco in Ireland.  This has been done by successive governments on the false assumption that as the price of cigarettes is increased, consumption will fall.  The fact is that one third of cigarettes smoked in Ireland today are illegally imported.  We have to draw the right lessons from this.  The price of cigarettes here is now double the European average.  This is a problem we have created and we have to deal with its essence, which is the level of excise duties and the price of cigarettes.  If we do not reduce the price of cigarettes to the European average, we are enriching criminal gangs and dissident republican organisations which deal in this illegal trade with a vengeance.  The loss to the Exchequer is estimated at &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion, and for economic reasons alone and in the interests of the public finances, it is necessary to address this problem.  The only solution is to deal with the pricing of the product and the taxation on cigarettes.</P>
        <P>We had thought the Government could do no further damage to the economy and then we find it has entered into an agreement with the IMF and the EU at an unsustainable rate of interest.  It shows that for people leaving the House to enter into this type of negotiation is a very bad idea.  The Government was beaten before it started.  It was playing above its league in these negotiations.  It is an extraordinary outcome and one which I believe those on the Government side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very impressed yesterday that despite the very bad weather, when I walked out on my street, I met a number of neighbours who were visiting people who lived on their own.  I was impressed that the spirit and enthusiasm of self-help and community effort was alive and well despite the bad weather.  I mention this because just the other day we heard talk about the problems facing this country and about what we as citizens should do about them.  Mention was made of civil disobedience, protests, strikes, etc.  We have a huge challenge facing us and we as citizens can do something about it.  I suggest that what we should do should be something not unlike showing the spirit I saw yesterday when people were visiting neighbours and helping them out.   I suggest we should encourage a sense that we can move as a nation to do something that will set an example.  For instance, when we had problems like this in the past, it was suggested we should consider offering to do one day&rsquo;s work free of charge as a way of contributing to relieve our problems.</P>
        <P>I make this suggestion for two reasons.  First, it would help the community and we would all feel better for it.  It would also send a wonderful message to the rest of Europe that while our nation has been dragged down and castigated by the media around Europe, we are able to set an example and demonstrate that we are different and will do what needs to be done.  It would demonstrate that we were going to stand up and fight the situation, not by protests or civil disobedience, but by putting our hearts and souls into doing something along the lines suggested.  The week before last, the traders in Rathfarnham main street all got together to discuss the problems they were having with the cleaning of the street.  They agreed they would do it themselves rather than ask the council to do it.  I mention this to show it is possible to do something about problems.  We can do something to solve our problems ourselves.  Let us see if we can turn and be positive rather than negative about the situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I endorse the comments of Senator Quinn and congratulate the former Senator Doherty.  Can we have a debate on the minimum wage?  It is important we have a debate on the issue because it is going almost unnoticed that it is proposed to reduce the minimum wage by &euro;1 an hour, which amounts to approximately &euro;2,000 per annum to the lowest paid in society.  The Croke Park agreement protects the wages of workers covered by that agreement but those at the lowest end of society potentially will have their wages reduced by up to &euro;2,000 per annum.  A case has been put that this will create jobs. I would like to see the evidence for this assertion.  There is no point in introducing such a measure without allowing for a proper debate on it because we must have clarity on how the proposal will be implemented.  Will the pay cheques of those at present on the minimum wage be reduced by &euro;40 a week, or &euro;2,000 a year?  Will the measure create new jobs or will it simply mean that existing workers will be cheaper to employ?  It is important that we debate this issue with honesty and integrity.  I have previously made proposals in this House on a maximum wage within the public service, an issue that has to be considered carefully also.</P>
      </Speaker>
        
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the call for a debate on the IMF-EU package.  We are postponing a debate we must hold; it is not right that we must wait until Thursday.  As Senator Alex White noted, the memorandum of understanding should be published because if the package goes through, we will have to live with it for a number of years.  I am concerned about the use of &euro;17.5 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  That clearly was not the reason for establishing the fund.  In regard to the &euro;35 billion firebreak, on which the markets are taking a different view, &euro;10 billion will be invested immediately in the banks, while the other &euro;25 billion will be a liquidity support.  Is that where the National Pensions Reserve Fund <Col N="14"/>is supposed to be used?  That is why we should be debating the matter today.  Was the possibility of having a debt for equity swap considered in respect of creditors and bondholders?  We are left in the dark.  It is wrong that everything we know came from people such as the Governor of the Central Bank and Ajai Chopra rather than Government sources.  It appears the banks have not been properly stress-tested.  We do not know how many more mortgages and business loans may be sour.  On the average or blended rate of interest, how is the money to be drawn down?  We have no information on the order or priority of loans.  We have been left in the dark on many of the details of the negotiations.  It is wrong that the document has not been published and placed before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Quinn.  Given all of the negativity in the media on a daily basis, it is good to see people responding positively.  I am confident that the spirit of the people will emerge in due course to lead us back onto the road to recovery.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s call for a debate on Seanad reform.  However, I would go further because there is a national emergency.  Surely we have learned from what happened in the past decade that we need to provide for greater political oversight.  We should, therefore, broaden the debate to include political reform generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the parties which claim our discretion has been circumscribed because of the arrangements made in respect of the IMF, the European Union and the ECB, does the Leader agree that, in fact, the agreement puts a ceiling on the interest we will pay on borrowings and that our discretion has not been impaired?  It will be open to any Government, including the current Administration, to borrow in the markets when the rates are appropriate.  I welcome the deal and, while the interest rate payble has been criticised, it was predicted last week that it would be 1% higher.  The Governor of the Central Bank has clearly explained why the rate was pitched at 5.8%.  While there is a great deal of obfuscation and negativity, will the Leader agree, although I have been critical of some of the pro-cyclical budgetary and taxation policies pursued in the past ten years, that in investing in infrastructure, including the road network etc., in reducing the national debt to a very low level and in putting money into the National Pensions Reserve Fund, was a good idea?  Will he Leader agree also that it would make no sense to leave money in the fund on which we would receive an interest rate of only 1% and to borrow money at a rate of 5.8%?  There will be nothing to stop a future Government if it has good ideas on investing in job creation and providing a stimulus for the economy from acting in that regard.  Many economists would disagree and say that would be a foolish approach to take because of the openness of the economy.  Will the Leader agree that what we have done in this arrangement seems to be the most prudent course to take in all the circumstances in which we find ourselves?</P>

        <P>I seek a debate on the future of the European Union and the eurozone and ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be present for it.  Many people have asked me a question in the past few days since the events of last Sunday.  They thought this country was an integral part of the European Union and that other European nations were friends of Ireland.  Senator Walsh, among others, made reference to the interest rate to be charged.  The IMF is charging a much lower rate than the European Central Bank.  Why is that the case?  Why is it that our so-called friends in Europe are putting the boot into Ireland?</P>

	<P>At a time when the people are looking for and receiving leadership from the Taoiseach, on the events of the last week and the direction the country will be taking, I find it very disconcerting that there seems to be an effort led by the Opposition and other elements in society to rubbish the deal.  At the same time statements are being made in complete isolation from what is happening in the rest of Europe.  During the past few hours bond rates charged to Portugal, Spain and Italy have all increased.  The cost of money to the Italian economy has increased by half a percentage point in 24 hours.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the Seanad under Standing Order 30 to discuss a matter of public importance: the need for Seanad &Eacute;ireann to discuss the terms of the IMF bailout, the involvement of the Oireachtas in its approval and democratic accountability to the people.  A deal has been done over the heads of the people by a discredited Government, which has lost the support of the electorate, with unelected and unaccountable financial interests.  I urge the Cathaoirleach to take into account the views of Dr. Krugman, the Nobel prize winning economist, who said: &ldquo;These debts were incurred, not to pay for public programmes, but by private wheeler-dealers seeking nothing but their own profit.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Leader think of what the prison chaplains have said in recent days?  When the State&rsquo;s prison chaplains say current prison policy is a disaster, they have to be taken seriously.  When they say conditions in many prisons are an insult to the dignity of any human being and an affront to the basic tenets of decency, does the Leader not think we should take them seriously?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>When the prison chaplains point out that at one point last year 129 prisoners did not even have a bed to sleep in and some did not even have a mattress to sleep <Col N="19"/>on, does the Leader not think we should take them seriously?  When they point out that there are over 800 assaults by prisoners on other prisoners each year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask a Leader for a debate on the matter.  The prison chaplains who are honest brokers and do not have a political agenda have pointed out that some of the attacks that took place on prisoners last year were fatal.  Why is the Ombudsman for Children explicitly prohibited from investigating complaints and allegations made by young people in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution?  Why is it the case that employees of the State are involved in leaking stories to the media, for example, on the whereabouts of Larry Murphy when he was released last year?  Whatever one may think about his atrocious crimes, the State has a duty of care to ensure the Irish Prison Service operates in a responsible fashion.  Why would the Minister for Justice and Law Reform not even meet the prison chaplains when they issued their report last year?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Leader agree that whatever about the Government&rsquo;s general political legacy, it has shown little desire to view prison and prisoners as anything more than a numbers game and that there has been an attempt to consider our justice system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to pick up on the question Senator Mooney asked the Leader about what is happening with the financial markets and suggest a more obvious answer as to what is driving the trend today.  The financial markets doubt the credibility of this plan.  There was a marked difference between the market reaction to the Greek plan and to our plan.  When the Greek plan was announced, Greek shares, Greek banks and Greek bonds all improved.  There has been no change to ours.  In fact, a deterioration has taken place.  That is the key question we must confront which leads on to a second point I wish to make about the interest rates.</P>
        <P>The rule of thumb in evaluating whether interest rates are sustainable is whether an economy can grow more quickly than the rate of interest being charged.  To make this plan credible, the rates of growth we would need to deliver next year and the year after are greater than 5.8%.  The question we must ask is whether people believe that is possible.  If they do not, it leads to a credible questioning of the nature of the plan.  We would be in dereliction of our duty if we did not do so.</P>
        <P>I agree with the amendment Senator Fitzgerald tabled.  There has been much talk about sovereignty, and perhaps rightly so.  It would be an extraordinary signal of how cheaply this House regards its sovereignty if it did not discuss immediately this plan which will have such a considerable impact on the future of our country.</P>

His outlook for the country is uplifting and he spelled it out in laymen&rsquo;s terms.  Ireland is a small open economy and things can change quickly once the foundations are put in place.  Then again, it is all down to growth, which I hope will happen.</P>
        <P>I welcome the 100 jobs announced by Accenture yesterday.  I was surprised that no one welcomed the creation of these jobs.  This House will have to lead the way.  If the media will not carry good news, we should be the ones to welcome the 100 jobs announced yesterday.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely referred to a constitutional matter which is before the Supreme Court and the Cathaoirleach ruled on it.  Senator Callely will write to the Cathaoirleach in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senators Quinn and Walsh and other colleagues referred to the spirit in our communities, in particular in supporting the elderly in our communities in these very difficult and inclement weather conditions.  We should visit our neighbours and be part of our communities.  As Senator Quinn said, we should give that extra time, whether it is one day a month, one day a week or whatever, to show good example and leadership.  Most of us became involved in public life through involvement in communities.  Only for our communities, none of us would be here representing any party in either House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Walsh congratulated Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments over the years on putting money into the National Pensions Reserve Fund and on reducing the national debt which was absolutely huge when we took over in 1987.  The top tax rate was 65p in the pound and the lower rate was 35p in the pound.  We turned things around before and I have no doubt the resilience of the people will help the Government of the day to do so again.</P>

As the Cathaoirleach correctly said, that is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If any Member wishes to bring a matter before that committee, it will be dealt with by the Cathaoirleach.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Mooney in wishing F&aacute;ilte Ireland well with its new launch.  There is a serious challenge facing the Minister responsible for tourism and her Department regarding the numbers of people coming to Ireland and the value for money existing in the country, as flights have a low premium and the hotels are also low cost.  I have a vested interest in the area but the opportunity to support F&aacute;ilte Ireland has never been more required than at present.  I wish the organisation well.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen called for a debate on the issues raised by prison chaplains.  The Senator outlined the difficulties indicated in the chaplains&rsquo; statement.  I have no difficulty in having the matter debated in the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Andrews.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important subject.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform regrets that he is unable to be present for the debate owing to other business.  I assure the House that he is determined that no opportunity will be given to convicted sex offenders to take advantage of any differences in the law and arrangements in place in the different legal jurisdictions on these islands.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>I will briefly set out the legal position on convicted sex offenders who either have served a sentence or were convicted and did not receive a sentence of imprisonment.  The Sex Offenders Act 2001 established a notification system, under which, in summary, a convicted sex offender is obliged to notify the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of where he or she resides and any change of address for more than seven days and any change of name.  The Act contains provisions requiring offenders convicted in Ireland to notify the Garda when travelling abroad and, significantly, provisions requiring offenders convicted abroad who have a similar notification obligation in their own country to notify the Garda when coming to Ireland, whether coming to live or for shorter stays.  The Act&rsquo;s provisions extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State, including from Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Persons convicted of sexual offences are also required to inform their employers or any prospective employers of their convictions, where a necessary and regular part of their work consists mainly of the person having unsupervised access to or contact with a child or children or a mentally impaired person or persons.  Under the Act, sex offenders released from prison can be subject to supervision and other restrictions.  For example, the Act introduced a system for the supervision of sex offenders after their release from prison.  Post-release supervision orders allow for court sanctioned supervision of offenders after their custodial sentence has expired.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Act is modelled on similar systems in other common law jurisdictions and, in particular, owing to our common travel arrangements, is closely aligned to the system in the United Kingdom.  The Minister is very much in favour of a greater approximation of the laws north and south of the Border, in particular on the operation of the respective notification systems in order that sex offenders will not gain any advantage in living on or visiting either side of the Border.  The notification period for sex offenders convicted in our neighbouring jurisdictions has been reduced from 14 days to three.  The Department of Justice and Law Reform is developing legislative proposals to bring the notification requirement in this jurisdiction &mdash; currently seven days &mdash; into line with that in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
        <P>Consideration is also being given to what additional information offenders might be required to give to the Garda in the context of notification requirements for the sex offenders register and to revising the process of applying for a sex offender order.  A senior Garda officer can apply for such an order against any sex offender whose behaviour in the community gives the Garda reasonable cause for concern that an order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from him or her.  The Department is being assisted in this review of the legislation by a number of agencies, including my office, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the Garda.</P>
        <P>All convicted sex offenders are monitored by the sex offender management and intelligence unit which is part of the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, NBCI.  The unit is supported by nominated Garda inspectors in each Garda division who are responsible for the monitoring of sex offenders in their division.  When the Garda becomes aware that a sex offender has left or is intending to leave the State, the unit ensures the relevant law enforcement agency in the country of destination is informed.  When the Garda becomes aware that a sex offender is entering the State, it will make every effort to ensure he or she is aware of his or her obligations under the Act at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Garda is particularly aware of the importance of knowing the level of risk posed by individual sex offenders and it therefore has trained a substantial number of garda&iacute; in a number of assessment tools which are used extensively to assess the level of risk of all convicted sex offenders.  This training is ongoing.  In addition, a pilot scheme is being jointly run in a number of Garda divisions by the Garda and the probation and welfare service to facilitate the inter-agency risk management of <Col N="24"/>sex offenders.  These local sex offender risk assessment and management, SORAM, committees engage with other relevant services, such as the HSE child protection services, in order that the risk posed to the community by convicted sex offenders is reduced as far as possible.</P>
        <P>The Garda is developing further training in assessing and managing the risk posed to the community by sex offenders.  A number of garda&iacute; have been trained at the Garda College as trainers to facilitate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in developing its own risk assessment training capability.  Steps are also being taken to develop this training capability further.  Probation officers work closely with the Garda and other partner agencies to ensure the compliance of the offender with supervision in the interests of community safety.  In conjunction with the Garda and others, probation officers by and large successfully engage with the offenders concerned and ensure their compliance through ongoing motivation and monitoring.  To assist in its supervision of sex offenders, the probation and welfare service, in partnership with the Granada Institute, runs the Lighthouse treatment programmes for sex offenders under its supervision.</P>
        <P>In 2009 the Minister for Justice and Law Reform published a detailed discussion document on the management of convicted sex offenders.  This document was prepared by a high level group involving the Department, the Garda, the Irish Prison Service and the probation and welfare service and which examined the current arrangements in place for the management of sex offenders with a view to strengthening inter-agency co-operation and further enhancing public protection and safety.  Their remit included a review of the procedures and legislation relating to the assessment, monitoring and supervision of convicted sex offenders.  A summary report on the views received as part of the consultation process, along with responses from the Department, was published on the Department&rsquo;s website last month.</P>
        <P>In 2009 the Minister announced a new policy on the management of sex offenders in prison.  The policy document is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service.  The policy is aimed at bringing about changes in offenders&rsquo; lives that reduce risk of re-offending and enhance public protection.  It forms an integral part of the wider range of interventions by criminal justice and community-based agencies.  In addition, a new programme of group interventions for sex offenders was introduced in January 2009.  The programme, Building Better Lives, allows more responsive and flexible delivery to a greater number of offenders than heretofore.  The new treatment programme will ensure all sex offenders serving sentences of one year or more will have access to appropriate treatment.  This new programme replaced the sex offender programme which ran from 1994 to 2008.  A comprehensive range of services are available to sex offenders and any willing participant can be facilitated within the range of therapeutic interventions.  These comprise one-to-one interventions, group interventions, community-based services and interventions available to prisoners generally.  Therapeutic interventions with sex offenders are delivered primarily through the psychology service of the Irish Prison Service.  Interventions by community-based services in 2009 include motivational enhancement groups provided by the Granada Institute in the Midlands and Wheatfield prisons and interventions with young sex offenders provided by the Northside Inter-Agency Project, NIAP, in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service is testing the use of the global positioning system, GPS, on a small number of prisoners &mdash; about 20 &mdash; who are being given temporary release with electronic monitoring.  These prisoners, none of whom is a sex offender, are carefully selected having regard to a range of criteria, including the nature of the offence, public safety and overall conduct in prison.  The test phase began in August 2010 and is due to run until the end of the year, at which time it will be evaluated to assess its viability in terms of cost and other considerations as a tool in the management of offenders.</P><Col N="25"/>
        <P>The discussion document on the management of convicted sex offenders put forward the possibility of using GPS electronic monitoring technology to monitor higher risk convicted sex offenders for the first six months following the completion of their prison sentences and their release back to the community.  In the consultative process following its publication, the majority view expressed was that electronic monitoring of sex offenders would be of very limited value, although the view was also expressed that it could be of value in a limited number of particular cases as part of a broader plan for the management of this particular cohort in the community.  The Minister intends to explore further the possibility of making legislative provision for the use of electronic monitoring in specific circumstances.  This consideration has begun.</P>
        <P>The Government attaches great importance to the continued development of co-operation at all levels between policing and criminal justice agencies North and South, ranging from co-operation between police officers locally, policy co-ordination at official level, co-operation between institutions, the exchange of best practice to ministerial contacts and oversight.  The two Ministers, Deputy Dermot Ahern and Mr. David Ford, MLA, and their officials meet regularly, both formally under the intergovernmental agreement on co-operation on criminal justice matters and informally.  An intergovernmental agreement on North-South co-operation on criminal justice matters was signed in July 2005.  A new agreement was signed in April 2010 to ensure the provisions of the 2005 agreement would remain in place following the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
        <P>Under the agreement, the two Ministers meet regularly to discuss criminal justice matters of mutual interest or concern to the two jurisdictions and consider the scope for, and develop plans to achieve, more effective co-operation and co-ordination on criminal justice matters between the two jurisdictions.  A working group comprising representatives of the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and criminal justice agencies from both jurisdictions supports the ministerial meetings, takes forward current co-operation and identifies areas in which co-operation could be enhanced or initiated.</P>
        <P>Among the areas in which formal co-operation is taken forward is registered sex offenders.  A project advisory group, jointly led by the Garda and the PSNI and including representatives of the two justice Departments and the probation services, meets regularly.  The group evaluates the potential for sharing information, examines the registration criteria in both jurisdictions for sex offenders and identifies areas for further co-operation.  As part of their ongoing co-operation, the Garda and the PSNI examine how the means of transmitting information to each other and the training given might be improved.  I commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on their adoption of positive measures to improve the flow of information and expertise between the two jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>It was in the context of these arrangements that the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Under-Secretary of State at the UK&rsquo;s Home Office signed in November 2006 at Hillsborough a memorandum of understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK relating to sex offenders.  This was negotiated between the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Home Office, with input from the Northern Ireland Office.  It relates to information about persons travelling between Ireland and the UK and who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdiction.  It therefore covers sex offenders travelling between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain.  The purpose of the memorandum is to facilitate the sharing of information of this type between the Garda, the PSNI and police forces in Britain to protect the public from the risks presented by sex offenders and to investigate serious sexual offences.  It covers all information necessary to achieve these purposes.  As a result of the memorandum, the exchange of such information <Col N="26"/>between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI and British police forces, which has been taking place for some time, is on a formal footing.</P>
        <P>The memorandum of understanding will be underpinned by the planned changes to legislation I referred to earlier.  It is also intended that a statutory obligation will be placed on the Garda Commissioner and the director of the probation and welfare service to establish arrangements to assess and manage the risk posed by convicted sex offenders and to share that information with one another.  Such information may also be shared with the relevant authority in another jurisdiction in accordance with the terms of any written agreement or understanding for the reciprocal exchange of the information.  Subsequently in 2008, an agreement for the sharing of personal data in the investigation of sexual offences and the monitoring of sex offenders was signed between the Garda and the PSNI.  The agreement provides for the sharing of personal information through single points of contact in both services and conforms to the data protection legislation in place in both jurisdictions.  The Garda sex offender management and intelligence unit is the single point of contact within the Garda.  Regular meetings take place between Garda management within the unit and their counterparts within the PSNI.  These meetings cover a range of issues relating to the management of convicted sex offenders.</P>
        <P>Given the shared land border with Northern Ireland and the common travel area with Britain, these agreements greatly facilitate the exchange of information relating to the movements of sex offenders and the investigation of sex related crimes.  The progress made in the cross-Border monitoring of sex offenders has gone well beyond discussions and there is an excellent relationship between the Garda and the PSNI in the management of sex offenders.  This is evident from the recent arrest of sex offenders who had travelled to this jurisdiction from Northern Ireland in breach of their notification requirements.  The exchange of information between both organisations was instrumental in effecting these arrests.  The nominated Garda inspectors in the Border divisions have been attending multi-agency meetings in neighbouring counties in Northern Ireland as a matter of course.</P>
        <P>The cross-Border relationship regarding the management of sex offenders is not limited to the Garda and the PSNI.  Excellent relationships also exist between the probation services in both jurisdictions which ensures effective communication is maintained regarding sex offenders who move between the two jurisdictions.  All these agencies are examining further ways in which they work together, including examining means for the pooling of resources to assist in delivering cost-efficient training to personnel in the various agencies in the two jurisdictions.  A group has also carried out work to examine current arrangements for returning sex offenders who travel to the other jurisdiction in breach of the conditions of their release or notification requirements, to identify any weaknesses in arrangements for their return to face court sanctions and to make recommendations for improvements where necessary.  The group&rsquo;s conclusions were reassuring.  It found that the number of individuals who cross the Border in breach of their requirements is small and that the co-operation between the police forces in regard to such cases is exemplary.  Nevertheless, Ministers in Dublin and Belfast are determined to ensure our two criminal justice systems are as co-ordinated as possible in tackling such cases.  The proposed legislative changes I have outlined represent one step along this road.  These will support the information-sharing provisions in place.</P>
        <P>We have strong and effective legislation in place.  We must ensure, however, that we never become complacent.  Work is ongoing, therefore, on strengthening and harmonising the legislation in effect in both jurisdictions to the greatest extent possible in order that sex offenders cannot take advantage of differences between the provisions in place.  I also believe the formal and informal arrangements in operation between the two parts of our island and with Britain <Col N="27"/>are working efficiently in order that offenders are monitored and effective action is taken quickly, if that becomes necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  It is an important subject.  We all wholeheartedly support North-South co-operation in the management of sex offenders and their movements, all efforts to ensure that convicted sex offenders on either side of the Border cannot seek refuge or anonymity on the other side and, particularly for our area of responsibility, that the Republic is not seen as a safe haven for those who have been convicted of these nefarious crimes in Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>The CSO recorded crime statistics for the third quarter of 2010 which show a shocking 80% increase in sexual offences on the same period of 2009.  One has to accept that this rise in the number of recorded sexual offences for the first nine months can be partly explained by an ongoing review of all cases reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, some of which will have occurred in the distant past but which are represented in the current figures being reported.  The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre reported in October an alarming increase in the number of victims accompanied to the sexual assault treatment unit in the Rotunda Hospital and an extraordinary increase in the number of calls to its helpline, which is compared to a 40% increase in the past year.</P>
        <P>The importance of co-operation between North and South has been highlighted by particular cases where convicted paedophiles have travelled back and forth between Britain and Ireland from the mid-1970s until recent times.  A number of cases have been highlighted in the media, although I will not mention the names, and the various examples have confirmed that Ireland is seen as a safe haven.  People who were convicted of attempted rape in the United Kingdom have been detected in this country and some other individuals who were convicted or suspected of the most serious crimes of this nature have been identified in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 included a provision to ensure Ireland would not become a safe haven for sex offenders convicted outside Ireland and who might seek to avoid the reporting requirements imposed on them by the place of conviction.  As the Minister of State said, anyone who is convicted of a sexual offence in another country and who later moves to Ireland is subject to a reporting requirement in the same way as someone convicted in Ireland.  However, not having a modern sex offenders database but rather a paper system is unfortunate and something that must be rectified if we are to have the effective co-operation and monitoring we seek.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State highlighted various agreements and areas of co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this area, as in so many others, the two organisations work extremely well together and this is all the more important given the increase in dissident republican terrorist activity.  One can see from the list of areas of co-operation within this area of sexual offenders the evidence of greater understanding and deep co-operation between the two organisations, which is very important.</P>
        <P>The then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith, on 13 February 2008 promised that it was intended to update and bring the legislation underpinning the sex offenders register more into line with that in our neighbouring jurisdictions and to strengthen further the legislation on sexual grooming in light of continuing developments in technology.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said in March 2009 that the notification period for the purposes of the sex offenders register would be reduced from seven days to three days to bring it into line with requirements in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, an issue which was raised earlier this month by Deputy Alan Shatter.  Notwithstanding that statement by the Minister in 2009, that notification period still stands at seven days.  The Minister of State said the Department of Justice and Law Reform is <Col N="28"/>developing legislative proposals to bring the current notification requirement of seven days into line with Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom but that is the same promise made in March 2009 and we are no further towards regularising the situation.  If we are serious about co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities in this area, we should get our act together and do what we promise.</P>
        <P>There is a clear need for a computerised all-Ireland sex offenders register.  The UK has had such a system since its launch in 2006 &mdash; the violent and sex offender register.  The lack of such a system in our jurisdiction seriously hampers our ability to play our part in co-operation with the PSNI.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report on the Children First guidelines recommends that a list of sex offenders in an area should be given to each local health office in order that the risk to children can be assessed.  Will the Minister of State comment on whether that recommendation has been followed?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to electronic tagging.  Given the overcrowding in our prisons and the particular importance of electronic tagging in regard to sex offenders, the progress in this area has been very slow.  The Minister of State indicated there is an ongoing pilot project in this area and, hopefully, this will provide guidance on how we move forward on the matter.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact this matter is on the Order of Business today.  The recent case of a man who had served his sentence for a most heinous sexual crime, and the concern in the community that was created by his release, highlights how important this issue is for many people.  Neither jurisdiction, North or South, must be utilised to provide a hiding place and anonymity for sexual offenders.</P>
        <P>The only other issue I wish to highlight concerns reports that only a small proportion of sex offenders in prisons have received specialised treatment.  The Minister for Justice and Law reform has not acted on this matter, either to ensure greater resources be made available so sex offenders can avail of specialised psychiatric or psychological treatment, or to ensure the imposition of a sanction for not availing of such treatment.  This issue needs to be addressed but has not been addressed by the Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has outlined quite comprehensively the depth of co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The latter takes the monitoring of sex offenders very seriously and has carried out its work in an exemplary fashion.  I welcome the fact that these statements are on the Order of Business and that the Minister of State has stressed the importance of North-South co-operation between police forces.  This matter has the full support of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Significant progress has been made in legislating for sex offences in the past decade or so.  It is regrettable that we were not debating this 30 years ago.  However, circumstances have changed.  For such legislation to be a success, it is critical that there be international co-operation.  However, it is more critical that our neighbours in Northern Ireland, particularly the PSNI, along with other arms of the State, such as appropriation authorities, co-operate with one another to the maximum extent to ensure those convicted of serious sex offences, usually against young people, cannot slip out of this jurisdiction across the Border and find shelter in the Six Counties, and that those convicted in Northern Ireland or Britain cannot find shelter here.  The Border is very easy to negotiate and it is critical that there be as much co-operation as possible between both jurisdictions.</P><Col N="29"/>
        <P>The monitoring of sex offenders is critical.  The sex offenders management and intelligence unit is part of the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The unit is supported by nominated Garda inspectors and each Garda division in the State has its own staff from monitoring sex offenders.</P>
        <P>An integrated system for ensuring co-operation between the probation services on both sides of the Border is as important as co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and PSNI.  The Minister of State said that to assist in its supervision of sex offenders, the probation service, in partnership with the Granada Institute, runs the Lighthouse treatment programmes for sex offenders under its supervision.  Sex offences covered by the 2001 Act are appalling and serious.</P>
        <P>In addition to ensuring the co-operation of the various authorities concerned, it is important to ensure that, in so far as it is possible, sex offenders be treated, be it through counselling or treatment by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.  I read of two or three cases in which there was a lack of regret on the part of paedophiles.  One case involved the downloading of images of young people and another involved physical interference with young people.  In one case, in which the court was prepared to offer a young offender some leniency, I was amazed that the offender felt at all times that what he had done was normal and appropriate.  He refused treatment and help.  As a consequence, he probably received a more serious sentence then he would have received had he apologised and said his actions were wrong.  The worrying point is that, if that offender is on the streets again, in this jurisdiction or elsewhere, he may, considering his mental attitude to serious crimes, re-offend.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the management of sex offenders, both inside and outside prisons.  This is essential.  Sex offenders in prison are usually segregated.  Within prisons, under the sex offenders programme, therapeutic interventions with sex offenders are delivered primarily through the psychology service of the Irish Prison Service.  My experience of dealing with prisons, primarily Cork Prison, and my experience as a practising lawyer is such that I would have said ten years ago that the amount of resources, including clinical psychology and counselling services, for inmates in general left a lot to be desired.  Either there were not sufficient staff or the programme was not being managed correctly.  I am not being disparaging towards the Minister of State in saying this.  Offering an offender a 45-minute consultation, perhaps once in six months, was not enough.  The service should be improved.  I accept that many strides have been made in the past ten years but feel strongly that more can and should be done to rehabilitate the offenders in question.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to electronic monitoring.  I am very interested to note the testing of the global positioning system for monitoring sex offenders, although I accept it is only a pilot scheme.  I do not hesitate in saying this should be expanded.  Sex offences are very serious.  Generally, those subjected to sexual harassment and abuse are usually minors, some of whom are very young.</P>
        <P>We dealt with cross-Border co-operation.  It is important to acknowledge that, in November 2006, a memorandum of understanding on information-sharing arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom relating to sex offenders was signed by the then Minister.  This progress was important.  It indicates that, since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, there has been North-South co-operation in many areas, especially in regard to sex offences.  As a result of the memorandum of understanding, the exchange of information between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI and British police forces, which has been taking place for some time, will now be on a formal footing.  This is extremely important.  Prior to 2006, co-operation took place, not only with the UK but also with countries across Europe, in respect of sharing information relating to sex offenders.  The fact that matters have been placed on a formal footing is a welcome development.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>The Garda Sex Offender Management Unit is the single point of contact within the force.  It is great that members of this unit and their counterparts in the PSNI meet on a regular basis.  The utopian situation would be to eliminate all sex offences or to minimise the number that are perpetrated.  Unfortunately, we live in a society where such a utopia will probably never become a reality.  In the past 12 years or so, substantial progress has been made by successive Governments in the areas of legislation, monitoring and co-operation in respect of curtailing the number of sex offences that occur.  We have changed the way in which sex offenders are dealt with and monitored.  Probation officers work to ensure that such offenders are properly supervised and there is co-operation among the various police forces.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate and I am glad the Minister of State came before the House to share his extremely important views with Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and acknowledge the good work he has done in this area since his appointment.  However, I do not share the same kind of enthusiasm expressed by certain other groups in respect of the matters to which he refers.  My great hope for the British-Irish Agreement and the commitment to shadow legislation was that the area which we are discussing would have been one of those in respect of which substantial progress could have been made.  I wish to provide a number of classic examples of what is not happening and to suggest what might easily be done.</P>
        <P>In the first instance, the registers of sex offenders, North and South, should be shared.  Whereas in legislative terms it would not be possible to have one register for the entire island of Ireland, it would be possible to create a situation where both registers could be completely shared and where people would not be obliged to cross the Border in the interests of sharing information.  The Border is open and people traverse it every day.  In that context, it would be in everyone&rsquo;s interests, including those of sex offenders, to share the two registers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The notification period which applies in the North is being reduced from 14 days to three days.  That is a welcome development.  However, the period which applies in this jurisdiction remains at seven days.  With the sharing of information relating to sex offenders, progress could be made in this regard.</P>
        <P>Another issue, which I discussed with the Minister of State approximately 18 months ago, is vetting.  The situation in this regard is a complete mess.  I am familiar with a person who was vetted as a teacher in the North, who came to teach in the South and was required to be vetted again, who returned to the North as an educational psychologist and had to be vetted once more and who was vetted all over again on returning to the South.  That is complete nonsense.  The Garda unit does an excellent job but there is a need to consider what is involved here.  When people change jobs, they should not be required to be vetted again and the information relating to their original vetting should be made available, in a secure way, to those to whom it is appropriate.</P>
        <P>Perhaps two years ago, the Minister of State and I discussed the issue of protocols relating to people in sports organisations who deal with those who are under age and who are involved in sport.  The authorities, North and South, should examine this matter in the interests of putting in place the same protocols in both jurisdictions.  The position is similar with regard to educators.  The rules and protocols, suggestions and proposals relating to teachers and others in the area of education who deal with children should be the same, North and South.  If the latter cannot be achieved, then we should try to ensure that as many of these as possible should be the same.</P><Col N="31"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to the fact that many sex offenders, particularly paedophiles, do not acknowledge, accept or believe that they have done anything wrong.  These individuals leave prison with exactly the same view of the world they harboured when they were incarcerated.  I am of the view that in the case of sex offenders, the reduction in sentence &mdash; anywhere from one third to one half of the overall term &mdash; to which prisoners who display good conduct are entitled should be tied to their attending treatment or participating in rehabilitation courses.  There should be a clear connection in this regard.  If a person does not acknowledge the gravity of his or her crime and has no appreciation regarding what he or she has done, it is not safe for him or her to be released back into society.  That is the reality.  There have been many cases where unsuitable individuals have been released early from prison.</P>
        <P>I do not quite understand how post-release supervision orders work.  However, it appears that we are making provision for the Garda to seek such orders.  In my opinion, if a judge considers a sex offender to be a risk, then such an order should automatically come into play.  We should make provision in legislation to ensure that post-release supervision orders become part of the normal approach to dealing with this issue.</P>
        <P>In the context of the approach to sex crimes, there is already a great deal of engagement between legal practitioners, North and South.  On a number of occasions each year, members at the various levels within the Judiciary hold private conferences at which they discuss issues such as sentencing and approaches to certain types of cases.  There is a great argument in favour of holding such meetings on an all-Ireland basis at times.  This is a matter to which the North-South Ministerial Council should give consideration.  Members of the Judiciary in this jurisdiction and their counterparts across the Border should be able &mdash; in private session &mdash; to discuss how to approach cases involving sex offenders.  This would assist in bringing about a degree of uniformity between these two different but common-law based legal systems.  In this way, we might arrive at an approach that would be acceptable to those on both sides.</P>
        <P>In summary, I would appreciate movement in respect of vetting, the sharing of the sex offenders registers, North and South, to the Garda and the PSNI and a reduction in the notification period.  I am surprised that the latter cannot be dealt with by means of a ministerial order.  In addition, the reduction in the term of sentence that is available to all prisoners who display good conduct should, in the case of sex offenders, be related to their submitting to partake of the various treatment options on offer in different prisons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the positive nature of the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  There is a broad consensus regarding the need to achieve co-operation, cohesion and coherence in respect of how sex offences are dealt with on both sides of the Border.</P>
        <P>It is important to state that this is not a one way street.  There have been instances where sex offenders lived quite happily here to escape responsibility for crimes they committed in Northern Ireland and the development of codes of practice and protocols would be important as much for the North of Ireland as for here.  The fact there is now a member of the Northern Ireland Executive with responsibility for justice in the form of Mr. David Ford, MLA, allows us to progress this agenda in a way that has not happened previously.</P>
        <P>The development of all-island protocols is necessary.  In listening to Senator O&rsquo;Toole, we must acknowledge the work done on child protection protocols by the GAA, which does not get universal acclaim, particularly in Northern Ireland, and which as far as I know has an all-island application and which could be used as a template for the adoption of these measures by other voluntary organisations and other sporting organisations, and even examined by the Governments in both jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>On the question of notifications and areas like exclusion orders, the real problems arise with the reality of a border for persons, who have been victims of sex crimes, in how they can be protected.  This is where my party would like to see much progress being achieved.  There have been fairly high profile situations in the past, with sex offenders finishing sentences and being released.  Similar knowledge of when such persons are released in Northern Ireland will help public confidence here and develop better standards.</P>
	<P Just="Left">The best area of effective co-operation would be, as highlighted in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, between the probation services in both jurisdictions.  We need a common standard on how one identifies persons as they are being dealt with in prison, and Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point about the usage of the facilities that should be there for sex offenders, and how persons as and when they are released are dealt with in both jurisdictions is an important factor. It is an area that sometimes is prone to hysterical debate in certain types of media. This debate is important and proper effective measures developed by the Government, or any effective Government, will help alleviate much of the ongoing concern in this area.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Boyle for sharing time.</P>
        <P>It is because every year there is a campaign by Women&rsquo;s Aid, 16 Days, highlighting the issue of domestic abuse &mdash; obviously, sexual violence is part of that &mdash; that I was anxious that<?oasys _jy ?>we would have a debate today on this area of sex offending.  I want to make a couple of comments.</P>
        <P>We have been focusing on sex offenders and the fact that often they do not accept they have an issue and there is an argument that there is nothing to cure them, but I want to take it from the other perspective, that of the person who has suffered sexual crime.  In my area, where there is no concept of a border, where the Dohertys and McLoughlins are on both sides of the Border, it is imperative that we continue to develop cross-Border co-operation.  I totally agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on having a shared register.  I would like an all-island register, but whatever maximises the sharing of information, so that persons who are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I just want to put my tuppence worth in.  Support for the victims of domestic violence, which is often sexual violence, is very important.  In Letterkenny hospital there is a great multidisciplinary team which is helping people go before the courts and giving them the confidence to deal with matters.  It is all very well to talk about sex offender registers, but at the other end of the scale we must look after the victims of sex offenders and get them to come forward.  I commend the work being done in the Inishowen Women&rsquo;s Outreach centre.  It has stated that in the first three months of this year 59% more women came forward.  In an area which has the population of County Leitrim and which is the size of County Louth basically, 32,000 people, it is a vote of confidence in this organisation that those who have suffered abuse have a service they feel confident about going to locally, and this is replicated throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I agree that the vetting should be per person, not per job.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, as I myself come across those situations.  I am disappointed there was such a short amount of time, but I wish the Minister of State well with the work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for enabling me to contribute as I am anxious to do so.  I welcome the debate.  We all are deeply concerned about the need to ensure there is co-operation across the Border in terms of monitoring of convicted sex offenders.</P>
        <P>I should declare an interest, having acted for the State some years ago in a case in which the notification provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 were under constitutional challenge.  We successfully defended those against constitutional challenge.  I am glad to say the court ruled that these were not penalties but that the notification requirements, on the evidence to the court, were an important part of the process of preventing sex offending, that subjecting sex offenders to notification requirements means they know they are kept under surveillance and under observation and it can have an important preventative effect in terms of preventing further offending by sex offenders, which is in all of our interests.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech in which he spoke of increased and enhanced co-operation between North and South in terms of monitoring sex offenders.</P>
        <P>I seek clarification on a number of matters.  First, he stated there is consideration being given to amending the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to reduce, in particular, the notification period, which is currently seven days, to what it has been changed to in the UK, namely, three days.  Is that <Col N="34"/>for every aspect of the notification requirements, including, for example, where an offender is to travel away from their home address for more than three days?  Currently, when it is seven days the obligation to notify kicks in.  My party would welcome the proposal but I seek clarity on what is meant by that.</P>
        <P>Second, what additional information might offenders be required to give the Garda?  Currently, it is fairly minimal &mdash; name and address.  Is any other information envisaged there?</P>
        <P>What changes to the sex offender order process are envisaged?  I understand that in practice there is little application of the sex offender order provisions and I wonder what is intended to be done to that to improve it.</P>
        <P>I have two final points.  I am well aware that there have been improvements made to the provision of treatment places for convicted sex offenders.  It was a real national scandal how few treatment places were available and how little take-up there was of treatment by convicted sex offenders in prison.  Can the Minister of State confirm that anyone who applies for treatment is now able to obtain a treatment place within the prison system?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Has there been any movement on the issue of disclosure?  It is a difficult issue.  In Britain, the Home Office guidelines provide for inter-agency co-operation on a need-to-know basis and information on the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders is not disclosed to the public except in exceptional cases, and indeed, any disclosure to third parties is exceptional.  I understand the Irish position on disclosure is less clear.  The Act is silent on it.  Of course, there are obligations on sex offenders themselves to disclose the fact of convictions to employers.  This raises the issues about vetting which others have mentioned.  Has the Minister of State any update for us on that?  I am sorry the time is so short.</P>

       <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators for their comments.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan suggested that the list of sex offenders is paper based.  I am glad to be able to say that the list is now electronically issued and is integrated with the Garda PULSE system with appropriate security.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator inquired about the passing of information by the Garda to the HSE.  The Children First guidelines provide for this.  There is close co-operation between the two organisations and I announced earlier in the year that we would put the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing, which would give further statutory protection for the exchange of information between these two organisations.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole suggested a sex offender&rsquo;s reduction in sentence for good behaviour should be tied to participation in a treatment programme.  However, naturally, it is better to have voluntary participation rather than it being in any way seen as some form of duress.  No decision has yet been made on whether the reduced period will apply to all aspects about which Senator Bacik asked but all possibilities are being considered.  Consideration is also being given to having to provide additional information and increased disclosure to other relevant organisations.</P>
        <P>Recently, I visited the Garda vetting unit and great progress is being made in North South co-operation.  I hope the vetting legislation will be presented to Government prior to Christmas.  It is at a very advanced stage.  Everyone will agree this is an area ideally suited to North-South co-operation.  In recent weeks, I launched the North-South child protection hub, which is the first manifestation of the co-operation taking place between the two governments on the issue of vetting.  It is an area in which policy is developing.  There is a national organisation for the treatment of abusers which is doing its work very carefully and sensitively.  As Senator Boyle <Col N="35"/>pointed out, it is an area that can attract very strident comment if not properly dealt with.  It is very sensitive.  I thank Senators for their comments in a very constructive debate.</P>

The Minister of State&rsquo;s response also had to be cut short.  It is in that context I opposed the change in the ordering of business to 5.15 p.m and this change to 5.30 p.m.</P>

        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that the Government&rsquo;&rsquo;s four year plan published on 24 November 2010 contains nothing by way of concrete measures to restore employment;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />further notes that every job lost costs the State &euro;20,000 a year in tax forgone and direct payments, and that the number of jobs lost since 2007 now stands at 288,000 costing the Exchequer an additional &euro;5.8 billion per annum;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />believes that unless there is concerted action by the Government on a comprehensive jobs strategy there can be no hope for recovery in the Irish economy;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />regrets the fact that the Government is so overwhelmed by the banking crisis that it has lost sight of the key role it must play in promoting a growth-led strategy, rather than one which is focused exclusively on the necessary fiscal adjustment; and</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is0p11- ?><?oasys _ix ?>calls on the Government to establish a strategic Investment bank to fund viable businesses around the country and invest in strategic infrastructure projects, bringing forward coherent sectoral strategies in areas such as tourism, food, cleantech and the creative industries, re-invigorating the State agencies, including the county enterprise boards, ensuring the provision of high-speed broadband, and giving greater priority to support for applied research to support the commercialisation of new knowledge.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We welcome the opportunity to have this debate as debate on this issue has been lacking on the Government side in recent weeks and days.  All the focus currently, as it should be, is on the appalling news of the bailout we have been forced into from the IMF, the European Union and the ECB, on the cutbacks the Government will impose, and on the so-called national recovery plan &mdash; a real misnomer &mdash; the Government has published.  We are in the international news for all the wrong reasons.  It is clear the Government has sold us out and sold our sovereignty for the sake of propping up a few zombie banks and for the sake of honouring a guarantee that should not have been given in September 2008.  It is of no pleasure to those of us who voted against the bank guarantee in 2008 to see that we were right about the appalling consequences it has had in terms of signing us up to an unconditional guarantee for the enormous and mind-boggling level of private losses we now realise the banks sustained over those years.</P>
        <P>The words spoken by economist Paul Krugman at the weekend were clear.  He said that what we had done in Ireland was to make our private losses into public obligations.  The Government is responsible for that and that is the reason our sovereignty has now been sold out to international institutions.  It is a sorry and sad day when we see the IMF and the European Union <Col N="37"/>dictating terms to us, as they are doing no matter what the Government says.  In the midst of all of this extraordinary political change and development, the Labour Party suggests there has been insufficient focus by the Government on the crucial issue of job creation.  This is the real focus of our motion.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s four year plan, published on 24 November, contains nothing by way of concrete measures to restore employment.  It talks about a growth strategy, but there can be no growth.  International institutions are pouring scorn on the Government&rsquo;s projections for growth.  There cannot be a growth strategy unless there is a strategy to tackle unemployment and job creation.  That is the reality.  Nothing was said about the need for investment and a stimulus in creating jobs.  We cannot divorce the jobs or unemployment crisis from the fiscal crisis.  The Government previously attempted to divorce the banking crisis from the deficit crisis by pretending the two were separate, but we were driven into the arms of the international institutions by the banking crisis.  Equally, the unemployment crisis has an enormous impact on the economic crisis and the deficit.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party motion notes that every job lost costs the State &euro;20,000 a year in tax forgone and direct payments.  Since the 2007 general election 288,000 jobs have been lost at an additional cost to the Exchequer of &euro;5.8 billion per annum.  That stark economic figure masks the human and social costs each job loss represents.  Each of us has friends or family members who have lost jobs since 2007 or been forced to emigrate as a direct result of the Government&rsquo;s economic policies.  Unless the Government takes concerted action on a comprehensive jobs strategy, we cannot hope for recovery or sustainable growth in the economy.  We regret that it has become so overwhelmed by the banking crisis that it has lost sight of the key role it must play in promoting a growth-led strategy.  Its rhetoric is focused on fiscal adjustment and cuts to public services.  The plan gives no hint of a commitment to job creation.</P>
        <P>Last Saturday the Labour Party finance spokesperson, Deputy Burton, organised a pre-budget seminar which, like all my party&rsquo;s policies, focused on job creation.  It included excellent presentations by economists such as Marie Sherlock and John Martin of the OECD who spoke about the need to retrain the unemployed and target particular groups such as the large numbers of young men who had left school early to work in the construction sector during the boom years.  While they may have completed apprenticeships, their training was narrowly focused and, in many cases, left them with difficulties in terms of basic literacy and other skills.</P>
        <P>These issues draw our attention to the need to restructure F&Aacute;S.  It is unfortunate that the crisis in the economy took place at the same time as the immense crisis of confidence in that organisation because we desperately need a coherent public employment and retraining service which can co-ordinate apprenticeship programmes and expand the short-term course offered by F&Aacute;S in the boom years.  Apprenticeship courses should be more holistic and less vocational in nature.  Trainees should be given a general education which would include literacy skills in order that they would be better able to take up jobs in the sectors that remain productive.</P>
        <P>The Opposition does not dispute the Government&rsquo;s claim that some areas are enjoying growth, but we need a concerted strategy to support continued growth.  There is insufficient focus on developing the indigenous manufacturing and export-led sectors which have the potential to achieve sustained profitability and job creation.  There is also a lack of commitment to areas which economists have identified as offering the potential to achieve further growth.  They include health care, insurance and small-scale construction. For example, retrofitting could make homes more energy efficient.  The big construction projects have come to an end, with the unfortunate result that a number of architecture firms have closed, but home improvement projects offer opportunities to construction related businesses.  Again, however, they need support.</P><Col N="38"/>
        <P>The Labour Party has pointed to the need to ensure adequate credit flows to the small businesses which can support job creation, even during the recession.  These businesses are being starved of credit.  During the debate on NAMA, the Minister for Finance promised that a credit ombudsman mechanism would be established.  France has established a very successful independent ombudsman model to which small businesses can appeal if they are unreasonably refused credit by their banks.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation whether the Irish version has enjoyed much success, given that it appears to many of us that banks continue to refuse loans to small businesses.  We need to know why the ombudsman has not been effective because this is a means by which we can support the small businesses which employ large numbers of people.</P>
        <P>The motion calls on the Government to establish a strategic investment bank.  This is a major element of the Labour Party&rsquo;s economic policies.  Such a bank would fund viable businesses and invest in strategic infrastructural projects.  Under the new national development plan which my party has promised, we would prioritise labour intensive projects such as the schools building programme which did not use the total capital allocated to it, even though this is an area in which the Government could be stimulating growth and job creation.  The bank would also bring forward coherent sectoral strategies in various areas, including tourism, food, clean technology and creative industries, reinvigorate State agencies and facilitate the provision of high speed broadband services.  The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry has strong potential to achieve profitability and sustainable growth, but it needs to be targeted for job creation.</P>
        <P>We cannot support the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion which proposes that the Seanad endorse the national recovery plan.  I am amused by the suggestion made in the amendment that we must recognise the measures taken to ensure the continued operation of a sustainable banking sector.  If we did not know it already, the IMF and the European Union have told us that the banking sector, as currently organised, is far from sustainable.  We have long been calling for Anglo Irish Bank to be wound down and this is now going to happen.  Given that the Government&rsquo;s economic policies have failed to the point where we have had to seek outside help, to suggest the national recovery plan is a pragmatic or achievable roadmap for sustainable growth is laughable.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify certain reports that have appeared in the newspapers.  We have not yet seen the memorandum of understanding agreed with the IMF, the European Union and the ECB, but the national recovery plan which we have seen was designed for a different purpose.  It was not designed to fulfil the requirements of the IMF and the EU.  The memorandum of understanding will dictate the terms of the budget and of economic policy over the next four years because the Government is planning it, but in practice it will not be the Government that will implement it in the years to come.</P>
        <P>There is plenty more I could say on job creation, which my colleague, Senator Prendergast, will address.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s motion and its policy generally is to focus on job creation and on the need to stimulate growth in the economy and not to proceed in the short-sighted way the Government is doing in focusing only on cutbacks and savings rather than on stimulus measures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.  Its main focus is jobs.  From the beginning of the economic crisis the Labour Party has emphasised that jobs are the key to recovery.  Every person who loses a job is another person on the dole queue, another person who might have a difficulty in repaying his or her mortgage, and many people have that difficulty.  Every time a job is created the Exchequer benefits through income tax and more money being spent in shops and small businesses throughout the country.  It is that simple.</P><Col N="39"/>
        <P Just="Left">I, with my colleagues, was very surprised on the release of the Government&rsquo;s four year plan to note there were no concrete proposals in it to promote job creation and create economic growth.  The focus of the plan and the Government has been on cuts and tax increases rather than on getting people back to work.  It was an opportunity we had to make a difference to the lives of many people who are out work.</P>
        <P>We recognise the need to balance our fiscal position in the next few years and none of us is under the illusion that will be easy.  We will be unable to achieve our goals without a concerted and focused effort on getting Ireland working again.  Unless the fiscal adjustments outlined in the four year plan are accompanied by a jobs strategy, there is a serious threat that the cure will kill the patient.  I do not like to say that but it is a fact which has been written and spoken about on many occasions since the plan was published.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate there will be cuts to the public capital investment programme but what is more unfortunate is that no alternative strategy has been set aside to replace the spending from other sources such as through a strategic investment bank, a bank which would have supported investment in small and medium enterprises and assisted in the funding of infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Since the four year plan was released, many members of the business community have made the point that the lack of funds available for capital and innovation will damage Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment.  According to a survey of 200 Irish business leaders by Ernst and Young last week, fewer than a third believe that Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s four year plan will restore competitiveness and jobs growth.</P>
        <P>A friend of mine who has been in business for many years was refused an overdraft facility of &euro;3,000 by her bank.  She has been in business for 27 years.  I cannot understand how someone who has had a business for 27 years could be refused such an overdraft facility by her bank.  She was told by her bank that it did not have the capital to grant her the facility.  It is sad that is the case.</P>
        <P>To restore jobs and competitiveness, we need a sustained programme of investment in the right capital, namely, transport, energy, communications and innovation, but the four year plan fails to address this.  What is worse, rather than ignoring the fact that we badly need to get people back to work through the types of measures outlined in this motion, the Government decided to break the piggy bank by putting billions of euro from the National Pensions Reserve Fund on the table during its game of poker with the IMF and then it broke the piggy bank now that this money has gone.  A large amount of this money is to be cleaned out of the fund and handed over for the benefit of the banks.  As Senator Bacik stated, we all know where we are at with the banks.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party outlined a number of innovative and practical ideas for how we can stimulate job creation and growth by using only a portion of the money in our National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The four year plan does not embrace any of those ideas.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal for a strategic investment bank aims to make a major contribution to the immediate task of promoting recovery while also playing a central role in transforming and restoring this country to an export-led growth model.  To achieve that goal we need to do more than tax and cut.  We need finance for investment in infrastructure for our 21st century knowledge economy and finance for investment in the Irish businesses that will grow up around that infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal for a strategic investment bank is set out in our policy paper, Investing in our Future.  Our proposal is that a strategic investment bank would be based on the twin models of the German investment bank and on the Irish experience with the ICC and the ACC, both of which are successful models with proven track records.</P>
        <P>Despite the many problems we face, we can and should be optimistic about the future of our country because we live in a time of great economic change.  At such times, great innovation <Col N="40"/>and a seismic shift in thinking can occur but we should be driven by technological advances which present great opportunities if we seize them.  The stale outlook of the Government, however, proves that it is unable to think in the innovative way needed to promote jobs.  Successive CSO figures have painted a grim picture of the appalling jobs crisis that confronts us.  In south Tipperary alone, more than 2,500 people under the age of 25 are out of work.  That is a sad reflection and that level of unemployment is replicated throughout the country, as the Minister of State is aware.</P>
        <P>The level of unemployment is neither morally nor economically sustainable because we are losing a generation of young people.  The parents of many young people of my son&rsquo;s age and others have gone through the process of rearing them and have given them a college education for export.  That is sad.  Young people have ideas, the education and the confidence to be the future entrepreneurs and innovators who could pave the way to a prosperous future.  We all know families who are facing into the most difficult Christmas period in decades because they have found themselves out of a job.  It is heartbreaking for them.</P>
        <P>Although the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal for a strategic investment bank brings with it many opportunities, the main focus of this motion is jobs.  The proposal is balanced, fair and necessary if we are to have any hope at the beginning of this plan of saving our country from the economic mire over the next four years.</P>
        <P>I note in an amendment to the motion a reference to, among other measures, continuing the car scrappage deal.  I acknowledge the car industry has had a bumper year, if Members will pardon the pun, on foot of the benefits of this measure.  That is good for the industry as many people are employed in it, but cars are not manufactured in Ireland and therefore there is no economic boost from that measure in terms of it having a job creation aspect.  I await with interest the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply to the motion.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I join others in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to the House.  I thank the Labour Party for making Private Members&rsquo; time available to enable us discuss issues in regard to job creation and employment.  I will begin by way of rebuttal to comments made by Senator Bacik.  It is not we who do not wish to talk about some of the many positives that have been achieved from time to time or some of the many initiatives that have been taken by the Government throughout the various Departments related to work activation and encouraging employment, notwithstanding these tremendous difficult times.  As an Irish citizen rather than a Fianna F&aacute;il Member of the House, I would welcome if people were somewhat more responsible in their commentary.  While it is certainly legitimate in this day and age to play the ball and it may even be legitimate to play the man, when one hears Deputy Burton at the weekend describing the country as banjaxed, one wonders why she has to take a pickaxe to the pitch altogether.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

	<P>No interruptions, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a legitimate point to make.  While it is perfectly legitimate to play the ball and criticise the Minister of the day for the policy that is to be implemented, in this environment one must not deny the resilience of this great nation, its people and their ability to overcome the challenges that have been presented to them.  It is worth noting that in the depths of this serious crisis, namely, the substantial borrowings that will have to be taken to meet the shortfall between what we are spending and what we are taking in, the debt to <Col N="42"/>GDP ratio in 1987 was in the region of 125% and even now, following a full drawdown of the facility being made available by the IMF, it would still be in the region of 102%.</P>
        <P>The current unemployment level is disgraceful and is far too high at 13.8%, but as late as 1993 it was as high as 18%.  That is not to excuse any mistakes made in the past &mdash; far from it &mdash; but we have been in difficult positions before and we have risen to the challenge.  The Taoiseach announced he will seek a dissolution of the D&aacute;il shortly after the legislative process which follows the budget has been completed.  People will have the opportunity to argue the points and performances of the past.  That will happen soon enough.</P>
        <P>Many things in terms of work activation have taken place recently.  There are many positives of which I would like to remind us.  For example, from July of last year to July of this year, the value of exports were up 12%.  In the first half of the year, service exports were 8% higher than in the corresponding period in 2009.  Our trade surplus is up 29% to &euro;4 billion.  Enterprise Ireland states that its companies will recover approximately 70% of the export earnings lost last year.  IDA Ireland won 75 investment projects in the past 12 months which is more than one announcement per week.</P>
        <P>That is not what the people are treated to on Sundays.  They are told this country is banjaxed.  The Opposition should play the issue, play the ball and even play the man, but it should not dig up the pitch because it might end up in government.</P>
        <P>Probably the most challenging year for the global economy and not just for the Irish one was 2009.  If one was to believe the Opposition&rsquo;s charges, our reach seems to be phenomenal when one considers our impact on all the other economies of the world.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since 2009 the Government&rsquo;s policies and investments have enabled IDA Ireland companies to create 4,500 new jobs and increase exports to &euro;110 billion.  We have seen a drop in the unemployment figure in recent months which suggests a stabilisation of the situation.  The Government&rsquo;s policies and investments will enable Enterprise Ireland companies to create 7,000 new jobs and win new export sales worth approximately &euro;750 million.  Internationally, foreign direct investment was down 30% but in Ireland it fell by only 4%.  Internationally, exports fell by more than 20% but in Ireland they fell by less than 3% and service exports actually grew by 2%.</P>
        <P>The Government announced the plan, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, which sets a number of ambitious targets to be achieved by 2015.  It will increase the number of new export-focused jobs by more than 150,000 with a similar number of indirect jobs also being created.  It will increase the value of exports by indigenous companies by a further 33%, diversify the destination of indigenous exports, increase overseas visitors by 8 million and secure an additional 780 inward investment projects through IDA Ireland.  This plan will also help farmers and firms expand their market share overseas and will boost food exports.  It worth noting that Ireland remains the largest exporter of beef in the world, supplying food for 30 million people throughout the European Union.</P>
        <P>The employer job PRSI incentive scheme will support job creation and counter the drift of people into long-term unemployment and welfare dependency.  A new fund for job expansion has been launched by Enterprise Ireland which will provide up to &euro;150,000 to eligible clients with a development plan which will increase employment.  We have put &euro;500 million into an innovation fund to support Irish and international entrepreneurs based in Ireland and we are increasing funding for seed and venture capital to support companies in order that they can grow and create jobs, although certainly more can be done in this area.</P>
        <P>Although it is not intended, as I have said previously, I would like &euro;2 billion of the IMF funding to be made available to the small and medium-sized enterprise sector by way of the <Col N="43"/>State taking equity in those companies.  That could be done quite quickly, perhaps by using Enterprise Ireland.  Someone good at auditing and someone good in the legal end of things could assess what applications should be successful.  Some &euro;2 billion would give a significant and much needed stimulus to that sector.  This could complement IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and all the other positive things happening.  That is as far as I would go in terms of the Labour Party&rsquo;s motion and the bank it proposes to establish.  The State taking equity in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector would be innovative, get money into the sector and create jobs in the sector very quickly.</P>
        <P>More than 1,000 small Irish firms have benefited from the innovation voucher scheme which allows them to link up with college researchers.  This is welcome and helps to solve business and technical problems.  We have put in place a &euro;300 million investment programme in our higher education institutions to provide state-of-the-art research facilities.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we have maintained our 12.5% rate of corporation tax.  We are faced with tremendous challenges.  In ordinary circumstances, no one would set out to have to contemplate the kinds of measures we will see in the budget next week and which are in the four year plan.  As a nation, we are resilient enough to meet those challenges regardless of who is in government.  I believe in the people and in their resilience to meet those challenges.</P>
        <P>People will know I do not heckle in the House and I am not someone who gets involved in cheap blows, but as an Irish citizen, I yearn for the body politic to dispense with the political games.  By all means play the man and, if necessary, play the ball and the man but the Opposition should not dig up the pitch in the interests of winning an election in which it clearly will do better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am a little surprised by Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s last comment.  He might have completely missed the fact the IMF was here and is telling us what to do.  We have already dug up that pitch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have ploughed up the pitch.  The only way any plan for the future will work is if we can improve growth, create jobs and increase competitiveness across all sectors of the economy.  The IMF has acknowledged that great work is being done by the private sector and some sections of the public sector to improve competitiveness and the ability to grow in the future which, in turn, will lead to more jobs.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s political plans are set out in the NewERA and Reinventing Government documents which focused on creating jobs and competitiveness and on transparency and accountability in all sections of society because that is what will make the difference.</P>
        <P>Our Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues should acknowledge that after a decade of economic stupidity on their part, it is time to return to that old mantra: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the economy, stupid.&rdquo;  I do not believe they should be critical of Deputy Rabbitte or Deputy Burton in regard to comments they may have made in the media because, regrettably, their comments cannot do any harm.  We are now tied to the IMF.  The terms of the IMF funding are quite stringent and will have a huge impact on what will happen in this country over the next couple of years.</P>
        <P>If anything, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, should acknowledge the incredible stupidity of Ministers saying repeatedly that we had enough money until next June.  What was the Government going to do after next June?  The reason Ministers kept saying we had enough money until next June was that they did not intend being in government after next June and did not care what happened to the country.  That puts them in the position of putting this <Col N="44"/>country&rsquo;s sovereignty at risk and of making matters worse.  There is no acknowledgement of that.</P>
        <P>The arrogant way this Administration treated the people is the reason it will get a hammering at the next general election.  It has no regard for the views of the people and where they find themselves.  In the process of trying to save their own skins, Ministers have robbed every State piggy bank on which they could get their hands.  The PRSI fund, which had &euro;3.5 billion in it a few years ago, is now practically dry.  They have used the National Pensions Reserve Fund as part of the bailout.  They have squandered any taxpayers&rsquo; money on which they could get their hands or any funds which have been built up over the years to save their own sorry hides.  That is a concern of people.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Members of the Government parties should not talk as if this issue is limited to what is going on.  The biggest crisis facing a large number of Irish people is personal debt, not the Fianna F&aacute;il-IMF bailout fund.  Figures show personal debt is very large and has increased over recent years.  They give the Minister of State an idea of the previous and current positions.  The following figures describe household debt versus disposable income.  In 1995 in Ireland, for every &euro;10,000 earned people owed &euro;4,800.  By 2008, for every &euro;10,000 earned, people were &euro;17,600 in debt.  That is the biggest increase in debt in the world I have come across.  The UK also has a serious problem with personal debt, and for every &euro;10,000 earned there people were in debt to approximately &euro;10,600 but that has increased to close to our figure of &euro;17,300.  In France, for every &euro;10,000 earned in 1995, people there owed &euro;6,600 and in 2008, for every &euro;10,000 earned they were &euro;7,200 in debt.  Spain has been thrown into a position similar to ours.  In 1995, for every &euro;10,000 earned there people had &euro;5,900 of debt and that figure has gone to &euro;13,000, which is still substantially less than our<?oasys _jy ?>figure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a major concern because the number of distressed mortgages has also increased dramatically over 12 months.  The value of those distressed mortgages is approximately &euro;8 billion.  If people continue to lose their jobs or see a cut in their disposable income, it will hinder the ability to repay all these types of personal debts.  Mortgages form the biggest personal debt but there are other types which take up a massive percentage of disposable income. If for any reason people are unable to make repayments and lose their houses, ending up with massive debt and court cases awarding judgment against them, there is a significant consequential effect.  The Government should take this into account as much research has shown that people suffering indebtedness, especially debt they cannot repay, are prone to economic and medical effects on their lives.  There is also a serious concern about what is known as a benefit trap, with people who cannot make repayments or who lose their homes ending up dependent on social welfare.  As long as they are on social welfare, they can feel a certain comfort and often such people find it even more difficult to get back to work or self-employment to get out of the mess.  We could be entering a vicious cycle if we do not take control of these issues and the Government could end up, especially in the upcoming budget, taxing people into such a position.</P>
        
        <P>Who are the people most at risk from inflation?  Inflation has edged up slightly over recent months and those vulnerable to an increase include people with high energy usage &mdash; water, gas and electricity &mdash; and mortgages.  These are young families and this should be taken into account or generations of people will feel the effects of what is happening now.  The consequences will affect parents, children and significant numbers of people in society.</P>
        <P>Over the course of the next few weeks we will discuss the budget and other economic policies.  The Minister of State should bear in mind that when the Government presents the budget, he should be careful to ensure it does not damage the economy any more than it has been damaged <Col N="45"/>up to now.  Young people and families should be protected from the changes that will come from the budget.  Above all, the Government must acknowledge its responsibility in creating what is an unbelievable crisis in the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the national recovery plan as a strategy for economic recovery with the aim of restoring stability to the public finances, improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and stimulating enterprise growth and job creation.  The Government published the four year budgetary plan last week mapping out Ireland&rsquo;s return to economic stability.  The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 is described as a blueprint for a return to sustainable growth in our economy.  It was unveiled by the Government with the aim of restoring confidence, creating jobs and driving economic growth.  I am pleased to be in the Seanad to outline how the plan gives citizens and businesses as well as international observers a clear sense of the economic and budgetary conditions that will apply over the next four years as we emerge from our economic difficulties and banking crisis.</P>
        <P>The plan sets out specific actions to spur further improvements in competitiveness across all sectors of the economy, including measures to cut costs in energy, waste, transport, professional fees, property and labour.  It commits to maintaining the 12.5% corporation tax rate, which this Government continues to reiterate as a key component of our industrial policy.  On taxation, new measures are balanced in a way that is least harmful to enterprise while at the same time generating the required Exchequer revenue.  The Government has maximised support and protection for enterprise and jobs as these are key to economic growth and recovery.</P>
        <P>The need for the plan is abundantly clear.  The Government will spend &euro;18.5 billion more this year than it will receive in taxes and that gap must be closed.  It is unsustainable that Ireland would continue to borrow &euro;2 for every &euro;5 it spends.  Implementation of the plan will reduce Ireland&rsquo;s deficit to 3% of gross domestic product, GDP, by the end of 2014, and the achievement of that goal is critical for the proper functioning of the economy in the eurozone.  The priority, however, is to ensure the public finances are stabilised in order that we can support enterprises to grow and create jobs.  It is clear the best way to support businesses and create jobs is to fix the banks, address the deficit in our public finances and improve our national competitiveness.  These actions are not aimed at firms of any particular size or sector but the overall economy.  They are aimed at improving the overall business environment in this country in order that all firms can survive and grow.</P>
        <P>According to the Central Statistics Office, the productivity of the Irish workforce was a third higher than the EU average in 2009 as measured by GDP per person employed.  We have seen reductions in costs as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, compared with our EU neighbours.  Our average hourly labour costs fell by 3.2% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009, while average OECD and euro area labour costs continue to grow.</P>
        <P>There are areas where the Government acknowledges a need to take further action to restore Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness.  The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s annual competitiveness challenge was published today but its analysis fed into the consideration of the four year plan.  As the NCC and others have recognised, we have made progress over the past two years but more needs to be done in terms of reducing costs and improving productivity in all sectors.  The recovery plan has a range of measures aimed at tackling some of those areas over which we have some control that will reap rewards in terms of our international competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The Government does not create jobs.  The job of the Government is to support the private sector by removing structural impediments to competitiveness and employment creation as well <Col N="46"/>as securing conditions for growth.  There are actions which will be taken to cut costs for businesses but also to remove other obstacles for enterprise as well as measures to improve cash flow.</P>
        <P>As mentioned by some Senators, energy costs are significant for businesses in Ireland.  Figures released by EUROSTAT yesterday show that in the year to the end of June 2010, there have been significant reductions in Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas prices.  Electricity prices for medium to large businesses fell by 20% to 36%, which is the largest drop in the EU and compares with an EU average of a 4% reduction.  Gas prices for all enterprises were between 11% and 18% below the EU average.</P>
        <P>The plan will continue to focus on rigorous efficiency targets for the State energy companies as well as implementation of the national energy efficiency action plan to achieve national energy savings of 20% by 2020.  From 2012 to 2014, our semi-State bodies will invest almost &euro;8 billion in sustainable energy, including renewable energy and the development of smart grids, a flexible grid that can incorporate renewable energy on our system and allow for a two-way flow of electricity.  The &euro;600 million east-west interconnector will be built by 2012 and this will mean we can export our clean green power to the United Kingdom and beyond.</P>
        <P>Access to broadband is key for Irish industry to compete globally as well as nationally.  Our broadband penetration has trebled over the past three years and our speeds have doubled.  The recent Cisco Oxford survey places Ireland 13th in the world for broadband leadership.  Commercial investment in broadband is supported by the Government&rsquo;s national broadband scheme launched by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and operated by 3, a telecommunications company.  The objective of the scheme is to deliver broadband to certain targeted areas in Ireland in which broadband services were deemed to be insufficient, and this was completed in October 2010.</P>
        <P>The next generation broadband task force comprises industry, Government and ComReg representatives and is aimed at ensuring the development of next generation broadband infrastructure will meet the demands of Ireland&rsquo;s smart economy.  The task force will meet in December to consider how best to maximise the impact of the investment in broadband infrastructure.  Potential for collaborative approaches to investment will be considered in line with the European Commission communication published in September permitting such an approach.  The overall objective of the task force is to foster a dialogue and follow-up actions which will promote the advancement of next generation broadband.</P>
        <P>Costs in sheltered sectors will be tackled.  The Government will receive regular reports from an independent figure who will oversee the promotion of competition in the professions.  A package of measures will be implemented to reduce legal costs, including the introduction and enactment of the Legal Costs Bill.</P>
        <P>Although commercial property costs have fallen, there is scope for further improvement in this area.  While upward only rent reviews have been banned since February this year, the working group on transparency in commercial rent reviews made further recommendations in July to improve the rent review process for tenants and landlords.  The plan commits to the implementation of the recommendations.  It also includes actions to be taken on the rental of property by the State for its own purposes, as well as investigating the potential for providing access to vacant or under-utilised public property for entrepreneurs or business start-ups to use as incubation centres.</P>
        <P>A key element of improving our competitiveness to reposition Ireland as an internationally competitive location for doing business is tackling our labour costs.  We have already seen the process of adjustment in labour costs, with a 6.75% improvement in 2009 <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the euro <Col N="47"/>area.  The State must also ensure people choose work over welfare.  The national minimum wage is currently the second highest in the European Union and the Government&rsquo;s proposal to reduce it by &euro;1 per hour will remove a barrier to job creation.  It is essential to strike the right balance between the national minimum wage, labour legislation, social welfare rates, taxation and activation of the labour market to avoid disincentives to return to work.  The reduction in the amount of the national minimum wage will be implemented in conjunction with reform of the welfare system designed to reduce unemployment traps.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s four year plan provides significant funding for enterprise agencies, namely, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, which will underpin their work of job creation and the research agenda.  This is in line with the principles set out in the Government&rsquo;s infrastructure investment priorities report of July last.  The capital investment in the agencies will drive recovery in the domestic economy as it will allow Ireland to continue to win foreign direct investment, grow indigenous exports and create high quality sustainable jobs in the smart economy.</P>
        <P>The plan underpins the work of the job creation and research agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, by providing funding that will allow them to meet their targets.  The capital investment in the agencies will allow us to continue to win foreign direct investment and grow indigenous exports.  In this context, it is important to acknowledge, as previous speakers have done, that Ireland continues to regularly win foreign direct investment.  Accenture, for example, has announced today that it will create 100 jobs.  We are moving up the value chain in the types of foreign company which consider Ireland as a location for investment, especially in research and development and innovation.  This is a critical factor which must be highlighted as a positive aspect of the economy.</P>
        <P>The capital funding to be provided for the enterprise agencies carries with it challenging job creation and economic targets which are a key aspect of the economic recovery plan.  The enterprise sector has a fundamental role to play in revitalising the economy.  Accordingly, the enterprise agencies have been provided with funding to support this effort.  Additional funding will be provided for Enterprise Ireland to support the research and innovation effort in Irish enterprise.  This will enable the organisation to continue to support companies to undertake collaborative research projects and realise their potential.</P>
        <P>While high levels of entrepreneurial activity have always been important to economic prosperity, in the current economic climate the survival, growth and development of small businesses are central to full economic recovery.  The capital allocation for the county enterprise boards in 2010 is almost &euro;15 million, a figure which has been supplemented by an additional &euro;3.3 million sourced from savings elsewhere in the Department, bringing the total to more than &euro;18 million.</P>
        <P>A guiding principle of the expenditure adjustments set out in the four year plan is that future capital investment must be targeted and employment focused.  Public capital investment will have its greatest impact in maintaining sufficient capacity in the economy and supporting productivity enhancements.  The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies will be critical in achieving a return to economic growth.  Future policy will focus heavily on commercialisation of research outputs.  Capital investment will, therefore, support direct job creation in world class, export oriented enterprises.  There will also be a level of direct job creation during the delivery phase of valuable public infrastructure.  The national retrofit programme, in particular, will give rise to a considerable level of jobs in the construction sector nationwide, while the intended introduction of water charges by 2014 will require a nationwide project to install meters in domestic residences.</P><Col N="48"/>
        <P>Foreign direct investment will continue to be a catalyst for national prosperity.  Foreign owned companies create hundreds of thousands of high quality jobs, both for the employees of the investing company and in the firms which provide goods and services for them.  The continued attraction of sustainable foreign direct investment is critical to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  Foreign owned companies produce more than 70% of all goods and services exported and spend more than &euro;19 billion in the economy, including more than &euro;7 billion on payroll each year.  International investment will continue to be a key driver of employment, exports and growth.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition to multinationals is also strongly based on what I refer to as the four Ts &mdash; track record, talent, technology and tax regime.  Our reputation for excellence in all of these areas continues to attract a strong flow of companies to the country.  Foreign direct investment has returned to levels not seen since 2005-06 and the IDA has won 76 investments so far this year which will create more than 6,000 jobs.  Of these investments, 22 are by companies new to Ireland.  As I noted, Accenture which is backed by the IDA announced this morning that it would create 100 high value jobs, the focus of which will be the company&rsquo;s new research and innovation centre, its first dedicated centre globally.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland recognises that future sustainable economic growth will be based on a thriving Irish export sector characterised by innovative companies.  Exports are critical both to maintaining current jobs and driving future job creation.  There have been two calls under the employment subsidy scheme and 1,632 approvals have been made, valued at more than &euro;130 million towards 14,902 subsidies.  The companies in question have committed to maintain more than 100,000 jobs, of which 88,000 are full-time and 13,000 are part-time, to 30 November.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland remains focused on ensuring companies throughout Ireland survive the recession and are positioned to seize the export opportunities the tentative recovery in major economies will present.  There has been a good recovery in export markets for indigenous Irish companies thus far this year and it is expected this positive trend will continue, with the prospects for job creation improving as a result.  Enterprise Ireland also emphasises the role public procurement plays in economic recovery and development and supports small and medium-sized firms to tender for the supply of goods, services and works to the public sector.</P>
        <P>One of the key messages in the Government&rsquo;s national recovery plan is that export-led growth will fuel domestic recovery.  It recognises that the implementation of the strategy and action plan set out in the document, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, will ensure our trade, tourism and investment sectors will be well positioned to respond effectively to emerging opportunities as the global economy recovers.  Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy is an integrated strategy that is global in scope and covers both existing and new high growth potential markets.  The strategy provides a framework to maximise the potential for increased exports, tourism and investment that can support well paying jobs.  It has set a number of ambitious targets to be achieved by 2015, for instance, the creation of 150,000 direct new jobs in manufacturing, tourism and traded services.  This figure is based on agency estimates of their growth targets over the strategy period to the end of 2015.</P>
        <P>The new strategy also foresees the creation of a similar number of new indirect jobs.  This latter figure takes into account the differing impacts of new jobs in manufacturing and services, based on the numbers of projects, job intensity, purchase of raw materials and services, the re-spending of salaries and the impact of taxation.</P>
        <P>Our export performance in recent years has shown considerable resilience.  CSO data show that, overall, our total exports in the first half of this year were up almost 3% when compared with the same period last year.  In particular, our services exports are performing very well, <Col N="49"/>with the value of such exports having increased by 8% during the period in question.  Data for our merchandise exports in July, August and September have also shown strong growth which augurs well for a final year outturn.  I firmly believe Ireland&rsquo;s recovery will be export-led, necessarily and essentially.</P>
        <P>Through its underpinning of the work of the relevant State agencies, by providing the funding to allow them to meet their targets, the national recovery plan fully supports the implementation of the new trade strategy.  Likewise, the capital investment in the agencies will allow us to continue to win foreign direct investment, grow indigenous exports, increase the number of tourists and create high quality sustainable jobs in the smart economy.  With the plan, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy,we are positioning Ireland to be successful in selling our goods and services abroad, while winning global investment and attracting visitors from around the world.  The strategy will help Irish exporters to expand their market share overseas, including in food exports.  Export-led growth is the right strategy to follow.  Supporting export-led growth is, therefore, of critical importance for the recovery of the country.  I am confident that the four year recovery plan fully supports the achievement of the ambitious targets set out in the recently published document, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy.</P>
        <P>Investment in research, development and innovation plays a significant role in building Ireland&rsquo;s smart economy.  Research, development and innovation investments not only embed existing operations and employment but also pave the way for future investment and job creation.  The Government is committed to the overall development of the smart economy.  We are firmly of the view that innovation can help to accelerate our economic recovery and get us back on the path to sustainable growth.  The Government strategy being implemented comprehends research and the application and commercialisation of its fruits.  Research, development and innovation investments in IDA-supported companies have been steadily growing and in 2009 amounted to over &euro;500 million, with investments in a wide range of sectors.  Research, development and innovation investments in IDA-supported companies in 2009 represented 49% of all the investments in that year.  In the years to 2014 the goal will be to increase the number of firms undertaking meaningful or significant research, development and innovation projects.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the generation of new companies from the outputs of research offers a potential source of future jobs and revenue.  Enterprise Ireland will devote a significant effort to developing new start-up companies with high performance potential.  The funding to be provided for Science Foundation Ireland will enable the agency to stabilise the number of researchers and research teams.  This is critical to ensure Ireland will retain the excellent science base we have built in the past decade.  It also supports indigenous companies which are reliant on knowledge for growth and job creation and will strengthen research and industry collaborations.  Since 2007 researchers from Irish companies and higher education institutions have won funding totalling &euro;269 million for research projects in areas such as ICT, health, nano-technology and energy.  Small and medium enterprises account for 74% of the funding to private industry.  This funding enables Irish SMEs to collaborate with world class research teams across Europe.  The Irish success rate of applications is 24.04%, well above the European member state average of 22.47%.  The new ideas and innovations generated from these research collaborations will help to create new high quality jobs.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is focused on maximising the return from the State&rsquo;s investment in research and development.  This includes the spin-out of innovative companies from research clusters, the transfer of technology to existing companies, including within the multinational base in Ireland, and supporting collaboration among companies based in Ireland and the research institutions which can work on projects of commercial application.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>There is also a strong effort on the part of Enterprise Ireland, working with universities and institutes, to collaborate with overseas colleges in research and development.  This effort should be promoted in the trading and investment strategy published some months ago.  We should concentrate on promoting Ireland, not only as a centre of learning and a centre for research and development but also in building strong collaborative links with universities and research institutes throughout the world.  This area offers enormous potential.  In my time as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce we put a great deal of effort into trying to bring Irish universities and institutes together and then went abroad to sell Ireland Inc. as a place in which collaborative work could be done in the areas of research, development and innovation.</P>
        <P>With the capacities we have and the high quality and critical mass of research undertaken in Ireland during the past ten years or thereabouts and by working with the multinationals, the commercial world and outside research bodies, Ireland can really benefit in the years to come.  I will encourage whoever will sit in the ministerial seat in Kildare Street to promote actively the idea of Ireland being an education hub and, more important for longer term strategies, build on these collaborative links.  They may be tenuous, but they are being established on a continuing basis.  I am sure that with support from the Government and everybody else concerned they will bear great fruit in years to come.  One can already see this in the context of UCC and the Cancer Research Centre which engage in a very strong collaboration with an outside agency in the United States.  That collaboration is underpinned by work done on both sides of the Atlantic and mirror-imaged across all sectors of the economy.  It is seen in the clusters of medical device manufacturing companies in Galway which work with similar clusters in Massachusetts and elsewhere.  There is enormous potential in that strong collaborative approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to mapping out how we are to put the public finances on a stable footing, the four year national recovery plan is also a blueprint for economic growth, driven by export performance and based on having a more competitive economy.  A competitive corporation tax rate, labour tax wedge and marginal tax rate are critically important determinants of our attractiveness for foreign direct investment, labour market participation and overall competitiveness.  The plan recognises this fact and lays out proposals for taxation, accordingly, maintaining an overall competitive tax regime.  One of the strengths of the plan is that it sets out a figure of &euro;5 billion in tax and revenue raising measures but does so in a way that is least harmful to the enterprise sector.  Any person who reads the published National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 will see that we are trying to ensure we will not make Ireland less competitive, and that we do not place taxes in areas that would create blockages for entrepreneurs or investment in job creation measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For that reason, whatever the outcome of a general election or discussions that may be held about this document, when people go on the hustings, we should have a fair debate on the content of the plan and what it tries to achieve.  If any person opposes the plan, he or she must be honest and declare how he or she will find funds in the years ahead.  I have listened to the contributions made by Senators.  Although tax increases are proposed in the plan, it is obvious that if parties of a different political hue were in government, further increases would be necessary to fund their proposals.  This is something that should be explored consciously and discussed in an open and honest manner.  First, there will be no change to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax.  As clearly stated in the plan, while taxation has to play a part in restoring balance to the public finances, this will not apply to our corporation tax rate.  A low rate of corporation tax on export oriented activity has been a cornerstone of our industrial policy since the 1950s and the 12.5% rate is now part of our international &ldquo;brand&rdquo;.  The contribution from <Col N="51"/>the corporate sector will be made through the maintenance and creation of high value employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again welcome the strong support across all sides of the Houses in recent times for the corporation tax rate although kites were flown at times.  A Fine Gael motion was tabled in the D&aacute;il on the matter and it received all-party support.  It is critically important to send the very strong message that Ireland retains sovereignty in its taxation affairs and that, in the context of corporation tax, the only people who can change the rate are those who are democratically elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It will remain within the competency of the national Government.  This should be said on every significant occasion.  When Senators make their contributions inside or outside the House, they should continue to emphasise this fact because sometimes ears may be closed to the truth.</P>
        <P>The plan will ensure we will retain a competitive labour tax wedge.  Income taxes drive a wedge between the cost of hiring someone and the actual take home pay of that individual.  Increasing the tax wedge increases the cost of labour, replacement rates and stimulates a move towards the informal economy.  Under the plan, it will be necessary to broaden the tax base by increasing the overall tax burden on average earnings for a single person from 29% in 2009 to 34% by 2014.  Ireland will, however, maintain a competitive tax wedge, being the second lowest tax of the EU members of the OECD.  Although tax increases are included in the national plan, it is critically important to point out that Ireland will not be a high tax economy when it comes to employment.</P>
        <P>The marginal tax rate &mdash; the amount in tax paid on the last euro of earned income &mdash; is also a competitiveness issue.  Research shows that very high marginal rates increase the average rates paid in tax by high skilled workers and create a brain drain, resulting in a lowering of innovative activity and productivity.  It is important, therefore, that the taxation measures included in the plan do not lead to an increased marginal rate.  I welcome the clear statement that over the 2010 to 2014 period of the plan the top marginal rates will remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>I refer to the banks and the provision of credit to viable enterprises.  Central to this has been the repair of our banks which are the key facilitator of business transactions in the economy on a daily basis.  Specifically, the provision of credit to our enterprise sector, especially SMEs, should primarily come from a properly functioning banking sector.  The code of conduct on lending to small businesses, the bank guarantee scheme, the recapitalisation scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency have all contributed to the stabilisation of the banking sector with a view to facilitating the flow of credit.  In this regard, the House will be aware that the Government secured a commitment from the main lenders, AIB and Bank of Ireland, to make available not less than &euro;12 billion in total for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs over 2010 and 2011, including funds for working capital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, have both made it a priority to meet the banks regularly to discuss the availability of bank credit for businesses, especially SMEs.  They have reminded the banks of their obligations under the recapitalisation package and of the huge investment of taxpayers&rsquo; money into the banks aimed at getting the economy moving again.  The Government has arranged that AIB and Bank of Ireland will make available not less than &euro;3 billion each for targeted lending for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs, farmers and sole traders in both 2010 and 2011.  Specialised funds for seed and venture capital and for environmental lending are also in place.  Banks are working with Enterprise Ireland to provide better financing for high-tech companies and exporters.</P><Col N="52"/>
        <P>Each bank&rsquo;s performance in regard to its &euro;3 billion lending plans is reported regularly, including sectoral and regional breakdowns.  The Credit Review Office, headed by Mr. John Trethowan, is monitoring the banks and assessing their policies.  His work is having a positive and meaningful impact on this aspect of banking at present.  As noted by Senators earlier, in his second quarterly report published on Thursday, 18 November, Mr. Trethowan indicated he had analysed 19 applications for loans to small firms and told the country&rsquo;s two main banks that credit should have been given in the case of five of them.  In other words, he overturned five refusals.  The report also showed that the two banks covered under the Government&rsquo;s recapitalisation plan, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, have, through their respective appeals mechanisms, processed 114 internal reviews of decisions on loan applications.  Of these, 86 were upheld, 20 were reversed and eight are still being reviewed.  In his report, Mr. Trethowan stated: &ldquo;Current market perceptions that banks are not lending to SMEs is based on experiences from six to nine months ago, and the current situation whilst still not entirely perfect, is now continually improving.&rdquo;  This development will no doubt be welcomed by all sides of the House as the issue of funding to SMEs, working capital and cash flow was continually raised by all during any debate on the economy, job creation or SMEs.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned in this House last month in the course of an Adjournment debate, all Departments are now required to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.  This directly impacts on the cash flow of SMEs.  One of the commitments under the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, published on 24 November 2010, is that the 15 day prompt payment rule will be extended beyond Departments to the wider public sector.  My Department is working on how this arrangement can be put in place in practice, including in regard to reporting requirements by State agencies.  My officials will consult other Departments and State agencies on the matter shortly.</P>
        <P>A second commitment under the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 of interest to SMEs is the decision by the Government to review the business expansion scheme.  The scheme has been operating for 26 years but funds raised under it since 2008 have declined significantly and businesses have complained that the scheme is administratively too complex.  For these reasons, the Government has decided, subject to European Commission approval, to transform the old scheme into a new and better focused business investments targeting employment scheme, BITES.  The Government has taken targeted action to ensure credit is available to viable businesses without imposing burdens on the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>We are providing the necessary certainty and confidence for the international markets and for Irish citizens that we can restore order to the public finances, reach our budget deficit target of 3% of gross domestic product by 2014 and stimulate economic recovery by investing in enterprise and jobs.  I am pleased to see there has been favourable international comment on the plan.  The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs has welcomed the plan, stating &ldquo;it is an important contribution to the stabilisation of Irish public finances&rdquo;.  He also noted it &ldquo;strikes a good balance of durable expenditure and revenue measures, with due regard to protecting the least well off&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The national recovery plan is also supported by the agreement reached over the weekend on a funding package of &euro;85 billion from member states of the European Union through the European financial stability fund and the European financial stability mechanism, bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark, and the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s extended fund facility on the basis of specified conditions.  This includes a contribution from the State of &euro;17.5 billion which will come from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and other domestic cash resources.  The details of the programme closely reflect the key objectives set out in the national recovery plan.</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P>Much of the commentary is fair in the context of the political charges that can be made against the Government for what was done and how we got here.  It is important, however, to keep matters in perspective and not rewrite history.  I take no joy in standing here.  As I have said in the House on numerous occasions, I have more at stake in this country turning the corner, becoming prosperous and giving opportunities to our young people as a father of three young people than I ever will have as a Minister of State or as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy or candidate.  I have been abroad on numerous occasions promoting Ireland as a place for foreign direct investment and promoting Irish companies in export markets throughout the world.  While some may not believe it, I know that commentary in these Houses is taken seriously and has an impact on how people abroad view us.  I genuinely and passionately believe this is of huge significance.  We can decide how we fight the next election but commentary and loose tongues will undermine confidence in this nation.</P>
        <P>While I am not suggesting we should have shirked our responsibilities, the Government has spent the past two years fighting for the country&rsquo;s basic identity and economic survival and for the survival of the institutions that fund our small and medium businesses.  We can argue about how we got here and about the mechanisms we have used to ensure we still have a country and a banking system that are at least basically functioning, surviving or on life support.  There is continual use of the scorched earth policy, however, which is normally used by the retreating army, not the advancing army.  We have a situation where much of the commentary coming from some parts of the House is almost in the vain hope that the whole thing will fall over and they will then march over the scorched ground and picked up the burnt-out carcass of what remains.  I say this as one who may not have an opportunity to speak in the House again because of the dissolution which will happen some time early in 2011.  I urge Members, when debating, to be conscious that there is a broader audience.</P>
        <P>I could deal with the political points that were made in the context of the funding of the banks and whether we should have nationalised them or let them fail.  Any objective analysis would point out that the Government&rsquo;s first and foremost duty is to try to ensure we have a State that functions, that can pay its way in the world and, more importantly, can pay its citizens in the form of social welfare payments and pay to teachers, nurses, doctors and garda&iacute;, as well as pay for the services any modern state would consider normal.</P>
        <P>With regard to the IMF-EU package, we will be paying an average interest rate of 5.8% if we draw down the facility.  As we speak, Irish bonds are being traded at over 9% on the second-hand bond market.  The Government could have been cute and decided, as it would not be in office in June 2011, to let matters drift.  No responsible Government could pass a budget for 2011 knowing there was not enough funding to meet even the basic commitments of that budget.  At least whoever is in government will know they had access to guaranteed funds subject to conditions on the basis of which any Government could decide upon its priorities.  There are parameters laid out that people will have to live within to gain access to the funding.  If they do not want to gain access to that funding and live according to the parameters laid out in the national recovery plan and agreement with the European Union and IMF, they can tear up the plan.  In that case, they will have to gain access to funding somewhere else.  I am not an expert economist but realise that the bottom line is that we, as a sovereign people and Government, have a responsibility to ensure we have funding mechanisms available to us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The talk of a sell-out of sovereignty is alarmist in the extreme.  Let us be quite clear about this and ask whether we are beholden to the IMF and the European Union or to bond markets.  Either way, we must borrow money somewhere.  I would prefer to be borrowing it from people with a genuine interest in seeing this country survive, grow and prosper.  There is collegiality among those within the European Union and, more important, the eurozone at present.  Today&rsquo;s market conditions demonstrate a re-focusing of efforts to undermine Portugal, Spain, <Col N="54"/>Italy, Belgium and the whole eurozone.  This country has invested enormous sums emotionally in the European concept.  For us to suggest now that we could have defaulted and that we should tear up the old bonds and throw them on a bonfire is inappropriate.  We are very dependent on the stability of the eurozone and on a functioning political European Union.  It has been our friend and will continue to be our friend but we have a duty to play our part in ensuring there will not be an unravelling of a project that most in this country believe is good and from which they have benefited.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to the House, with which he is very familiar.  I do not propose to score partisan political points, but that does not mean I will not have some criticisms to make.  If the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was his last in the House, he should note it was a fine one, although I did not agree with some of it.  It was very clear that he spoke from the heart, particularly when he invoked the future of his family.  Few of us in the House could remain unmoved by the genuine sentiments he expressed.  However, I support the motion.  I had not anticipated speaking at this point, but I am happy to do so.</P>
        <P>The first point of the motion states Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;notes that the Government&rsquo;s four year plan published on 24 November 2010 contains nothing by way of concrete measures to restore employment&rdquo;.  It does not contain very much and I am not saying this in a partisan way.  The plan certainly does not appear to contain enough.  I do not make this charge for the purpose of gaining political advantage in that this comment has been made by a number of financial experts.  For that reason, it is worrying.  It is a central point in the remarks made by Dr. Krugman who certainly does not share the Minister&rsquo;s view on bondholders.  He holds what appears to be a majority view which is shared by the directors of some of the largest bond-holding companies.  All economists admit that what has happened here is unjust, immoral and indefensible on ethical grounds.  I asked on the Order of Business whether it was possible to sustain an appropriate financial system, or a just  and decent civil society, on grounds that were universally acknowledged as being immoral, unjust, unethical and, according to Dr. Krugman, a mistake.  I agree with that point.</P>
        <P>It is true the Government is feeling overwhelmed.  Who would not?  I certainly would feel under considerable pressure.  I have a degree of sympathy with the Government members as human beings.  All of us have seen repeated on a number of occasions in the past few days the extraordinary scanning shot of the Government Front Bench in the D&aacute;il.  Body language is very instructive.  There is no doubt the Members shown were beaten people.  One only had to look at the expressions on their faces to realise they were really concerned.</P>
        <P>My Labour Party colleagues have called on the Government to establish a strategic investment bank to fund viable businesses.  This is absolutely desirable and who could possibly disagree?  However, from where will they get the money?  I do not know.  We have actually frittered away our resources.  Therefore, this good idea is not sustainable.  Like the Minister of State who was engaging in his frankness, I am not an economist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome some of the points made by the Minister of State.  I did not have time to read his speech, but I was listening to it in my office.  I am glad the issue of upward-only rent reviews has been addressed and is continually under review.  I refer, in particular, to the working group on commercial rents.  This is a vital issue.  However, why is it taking so long to address it?  I have been talking about it for years in this House.  I highlighted what I had seen in our most fashionable streets.  I walk up O&rsquo;Connell Street and Grafton Street and through the Hibernian Way and could see what was happening.  It was blindingly bloody obvious.  It was insanity to have upward-only rent reviews.  It was also insanity to increase our VAT rates when the British <Col N="55"/>did not.  We share a land border with a part of the disunited kingdom which was lowering its rate when we were increasing ours.  There was a certain amount of daftness in that regard.   Let me welcome the provision to address this issue.</P>
        <P>I welcome the scrutiny of legal costs, in respect of which there is a scandal.  The most glaring example concerns the tribunals.  Some members are commanding salaries of &euro;2,500 per day, day after day.  Let us have itemised accounts from lawyers.  The Minister of State should get his colleagues to consider this.  One simply never receives itemised accounts.  One receives a bundled-up bill referring to stationery, postage, research, secretarial work and so forth.  It is a load of nonsense and only one bald figure is listed.  Since we are down to our last brass farthing, let the unfortunate people who have to pay legal bills know how much is spent on stamps, correspondence and secretarial time.  I am not making any charges against individual legal practitioners because the practice to which I refer is followed throughout the profession.  One never receives an itemised bill.  I have never received one, although I am a very litigious man.  I have never in my entire life received an itemised bill from any legal source.  Let us address this issue.</P>
        <P>The interest rate of 5.8% does not represent generosity.  We have been good citizens of the European Union throughout our membership.  We have taken very hard medicine and are being rewarded with punitive rates.  The interest rate is an average figure; the actual figure for part of the loan will be considerably higher.  No good deed goes unpunished.  Let the people in Europe read this and realise there is at least one person here who recognises the lack of collegiality.</P>
        <P>I was listening to a German Green Party member doing his damnedest to say Ireland should immediately scrap its corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  How neighbourly is that?  The journalist Polly Toynbee is not a Member of Parliament, but the language employed by her in her article in <i>The Guardian</i>, a very good newspaper, was a disgrace.</P>

	<P>It was a racist caricature and she should be ashamed of herself for describing us as beggars, cheats, liars and thieves.  Is that the language used by a good neighbour?  In spite of its not being so, Ms Toynbee&rsquo;s view is widely held underneath the soft parlance of the British Conservative Party.</P>
        <P>With regard to Mr. Chopra, in one jump we seem to have gone from snip to chop.  His emollient tones did not fool me one bit, including comments to the effect that we were brave little soldiers and that the Irish had character.  Why the hell should we accept the interest rate offered?  We should be given the money by those concerned at a rate of 1% because we are saving their bacon.</P>
        <P>I hope to God someone from the ECB reads this debate.  The ECB flooded the market with cheap money.  It did not care where that money went and, of course, it went into our half-baked banks.  The ECB was then among those who carried out stress tests on those banks and it informed everyone that they were perfectly all right.  Who is the ECB fooling?  Why should taxpayers who had no part in what happened be penalised and placed in penury?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is just too bad.  I wish I had more time.  There are certain areas on which we can focus.  I have just been listening to a news report on RTE regarding the Kerry Group, which is a splendid organisation.  The Kerry Group began as a little co-op and it now provides 23,000 jobs worldwide.  It is to businesses of this sort that we should provide encouragement.</P><Col N="56"/>
        <P>The Minister of State said &ldquo;It is clear the best way to support businesses and create jobs is to fix the banks&rdquo;.  He should return on Thursday when we will be debating the EU-IMF programme for Ireland and we can then discuss how to fix the banks.  I know how I would fix them and I am aware of how the citizens of this country would like to see them fixed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also referred to our export performance, which is fine.  He also indicated that &ldquo;the Government secured a commitment from the main lenders, AIB and Bank of Ireland, to make available not less than &euro;12 billion in total for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs&rdquo;.  Is this happening now?  Is it possible to believe a word those in these two banks say?  Will the position in this regard be monitored?  Let us consider the figures provided by Mr. John Trethowan in respect of current practice in the banks.  These figures indicate that at least 25% of the applications from small and medium enterprises were improperly rejected.  That is the only conclusion one can reach in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to prompt payment by the Government within 15 days of receipt of invoices.  It is about bloody time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am doing so.  What is being done with the National Pensions Reserve Fund is disastrous.  There is a train crash coming down the line in respect of pensions and the EU and the IMF are being allowed to dip their nasty little fingers into this fund.</P>
        <P>I had hoped to speak after my colleagues, Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Mullen.  I do not have permission to move their amendment to the motion but I am very interested in it.  I would like a proper examination to be carried out in respect of the proposal for metro north.  I hope this project proceeds and I was very much involved in progressing it in the early stages.  The project must provide good value, however, and must give rise to the creation of the envisaged number of jobs.</P>
        <P>The second part of the amendment in the names of Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Mullen refers to the moral hazard created by narrowing the gap between welfare and wages giving rise to a need for an immediate reversal of the decision to reduce the minimum wage.  I was not able to give my support to the amendment as a result of the inclusion of this stipulation.  I want to protect people on the minimum wage.  I have been lobbied by restaurant owners, however, who are going out of their minds in respect of this matter.  If we could take account of the needs of the restaurant sector while protecting the minimum wage to the largest degree possible, progress could be made.  An absolute disaster has been visited upon restaurant owners as a result of the kind of wages they are required to pay to, for example, those who work on Sundays.</P>
        <P>Let us consider this matter sector by sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not appalling that multibillionaires are buying petrol for their yachts in Monte Carlo at the expense of the weakest in society?  This is being done by reducing the hourly rate of the minimum wage by &euro;1 and it is an utter moral scandal.  We in this House should stand for decency and principles and for those who are at the lowest point on the scale.  From what he said at the end of his very moving contribution, I know that, in his heart, the Minister of State shares that view.  I do not care if people read what I have said but I hope to God they do.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the motion we are debating is a criticism of the four year plan, particularly in the context of the perceived lack of specificity in respect of job creation measures.  I also presume the purpose of the Labour Party&rsquo;s tabling this motion is to argue the point in that regard.  Is what is being sought specific reference to the number of jobs in each sector and to the taking of targeted approaches over a number of years?  The Minister of State clearly indicated that in light of the economic conditions in which we are operating and the general philosophical approach to governing this country, it is not possible for Irish Governments to create jobs directly.  The best that can be done is to foster a climate in which jobs can be created.</P>
        <P>It is hoped we can stabilise the level of unemployment and begin to reduce it.  There was obviously a great increase in employment during the Celtic tiger years.  When the Celtic tiger went bust, there was a dramatic decrease in employment in a short period.  One thing is certain, namely, we will not be able to recover the jobs that have been lost in a similar timeframe.  A longer period will be required to recover those jobs.  We are honest enough to admit that even after the four years of the national recovery plan, the level of unemployment will be in the region of 10%.  It is slightly dishonest for people to pretend that matters might be otherwise.</P>
        <P>The only way to proceed differently would be to revert to the days of the central command economy.  There was a time, even as late as the 1980s, when Ireland was accused, in the context of how the Government ran the economy, of being the most centrally controlled state outside of Albania.  If it is being suggested that we should return to a period when jobs were created for the sake of doing so and regardless of their export potential, their value added potential or their sustainability, then we would dig an even deeper hole for ourselves in a very short space of time.  The debate should focus on those aspects of the matter.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Strangely enough, our State companies are among the better performing enterprises in the country at present and are creating jobs.  It is somewhat churlish to refuse to accept that jobs are being created.  Even with the economy at a standstill, 50,000 jobs are created each year.  Many of these are being created in the green and smart economy sectors.  In the past year, 20,000 jobs have been created in the energy sector alone.  The Labour Party for the past 18 months has been claiming the Government&rsquo;s retrofit programme as being of its invention.  The establishment of this programme came about as result of a direct contribution by the Green Party to the work of the current Administration.  When the programme for Government was agreed in 2007, it was hoped that during our then anticipated five-year term of office, 100,000 homes would be retrofitted.  The programme has been ramped up to such a degree that 100,000 homes per year are being retrofitted.  The expansion of the programme has led to the creation of 5,000 direct jobs.  We need to identify and promote similar initiatives in other areas.</P>
        <P>Several speakers referred to the general matter of creating a more enterprising economy, ensuring there is access to working capital and seeing to it that an enterprise culture is fostered, developed and harnessed.  I am of the view that initiatives relating to this matter would be ongoing, regardless of which parties were in government.  There are key philosophical points, <Col N="58"/>however, which must be understood in respect of what might be the differences between various political parties or Governments of whatever composition.</P>
        <P>One of the differences to which I refer relates to education.  The recent visit of the European Commissioner, Olli Rehn, emphasised this point.  What the Commissioner found to be most acceptable and of most assistance in terms of the recommendation of the four year plan was the emphasis on both enterprise and education.  The latter is important to underpin the medium and long-term success of the economy.  There has been little reference to that matter during this debate and greater consideration should be given to it, especially as we have fallen down in respect of it in the past.  Action must be taken on many levels.  In the first instance, the workforce must be made competent in the context of operating in a vastly changing technological age.  The second point is that there is a need to retrain workers in any event.  The third aspect is that we must take workers from particular sectors and move them into new areas.  Construction is the obvious example in this regard.  The retrofit programme takes into account some of those who will not be building new houses.  We have far too many new houses in any event.</P>
        <P>Another example is the area of heritage.  I received a delegation in my constituency office in recent days &mdash; I do not know whether the Minister of State had the same experience &mdash; from a newly constituted group of tradesmen who take an old approach to their trade and who style themselves the ancient guild of stonemasons.  They are of the view that the way to bring the large number of new apprentices operating in the area of stonemasonry &mdash; these individuals work with brick, mortar and block &mdash; up to speed is to encourage them to work on heritage projects.</P>
      
        <P>In the Cork area there is much potential in terms of the redevelopment of Fort Camden and Spike Island and other heritage sites such as Charles Fort.  If one is talking about direct Government intervention in linking education and training, that is a possibility and where we should be focusing some of our efforts.  Obviously, I have given a local example in Cork but, no doubt, examples could be found elsewhere in the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of job creation, we need to bring about what the Minister of State referred to, that is, fostering a climate of hope and confidence and a belief jobs can be created in the knowledge they will be sustainable.  The biggest dint we have taken in the past few years with the increase in the number of job losses in such a short period of time has been in respect of the belief bubble economies are what we should live with from here on, and that there will be rapid rates of growth followed by rapid rates of declines.  If we have learned anything from this period of our economic history it is that we must develop economies slowly, that we must make them sustainable and protect them from the international pressures which cause damage in the short term.  If we get that right, we might prevent the cycle we are seeing and saw in the 1980s, 1950s and 1930s.  As we approach the hundredth year of independence as a state, we can teach future generations what we have learned and put these lessons into practice.  I hope they transcend political differences because it will be a challenge to the Government and its immediate successor to put them into practice in the next year or two which will be vital years, not only in dealing with the uncertainty of the moment but in putting in place the bedrock to ensure we will never come back to this place again.  If that is understood across the political spectrum, the hope we need to gain for Ireland can be gained quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  In the short term the fiscal and banking issues must be resolved, but our recovery will be all about the creation of jobs.  It is my party&rsquo;s view that the focus was not put on job creation until quite recently by the Government.  As my party&rsquo;s motion states, every unemployed person costs the State about &euro;20,000 <Col N="59"/>between social welfare payments and lost income taxes and contributions.  This must be factored in in considering the cost of all decisions made.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to make vicious cuts in social welfare payments in the four year plan, but the best way to save money on the social welfare bill is to get people back to work.  It would also result in the growth required.  However, there is nothing of significance in the four year plan to address this problem.</P>
        <P>There are many shovel-ready capital projects to be undertaken.  Schools need to be built, while insulation work needs to be carried out.  In other words, there are actions that could be taken straightaway to get unemployed construction workers back to work.  The Minister of State referred to plans in terms of retrofits, etc.  We must do this work quickly.  It must be accelerated.  However, we must also wean the economy off its dependence on construction.  In the medium term we must return to growth and expand our export base.  There is positive development in that regard, which must be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>In an increasingly global economy we must look strategically at what we do well in Ireland and try to excel at them.  I want to talk about three areas in particular.  Agriculture and food production are obvious ones.  Rather than exporting commodities, as we do to the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, we must add value and export to more sophisticated markets.  Indigenous companies must be positioned to export to emerging markets such as Brazil, India and China.  Enterprise Ireland is doing good work in this regard, but it must do more, do better, be properly resourced and pointed in the right direction.  We need to be more ambitious for it.  Its brief is to support companies in the traded services sector or exporting manufacturing companies only.  County enterprise boards could support companies with up to ten employees only.  If these smaller companies are to be successful and grow and have more than ten employees, where can they go for support?  Enterprise Ireland can do nothing for them, and this must change.  That serious gap is acknowledged everywhere we go when people talk about these issues which can be addressed if there was the will to do so.  County enterprise boards have had their budgets cut by in the region of 30% this year.  How can this be right at a time when we should be doing everything possible to get people back to work?</P>
        <P>Another sector that is of importance to us and in which we could excel is tourism.  Its importance has been underlined by the United Nations World Tourism Organization in its Tourism and Economic Stimulus &mdash; Initial Assessment of 2009 which urged all governments &ldquo;to put Tourism at the core of their stimulus packages because the jobs and trade flows from a strong tourism sector, as well as business and consumer confidence in travel, can play a big part in recovery&rdquo;.  There are many fine proposals contained in Deputy Upton&rsquo;s recent tourism document entitled, Extending the Welcome, but is the Minister of State aware that we make it so difficult for tourists to come here from India, China and elsewhere?  For several months I have been working on a case to try to get a Chinese national here on holiday to visit an Irish friend who is well capable of supporting her and can guarantee this.  The Minister of State would not believe the obstacles placed in front of her and her Irish friend.  We should be welcoming the tourist dollar, not rejecting it.</P>
        <P>A third area in which we should have a competitive advantage is green energy.  There is tremendous potential to develop offshore wind farms around the coastline.  Ireland has an enormous untapped indigenous power source in offshore wind energy.  The National Offshore Wind Association of Ireland claims such projects present an opportunity to Ireland to become the green power centre of Europe and an international centre for the development of new offshore wind technologies.  To harness this potential, there is a need for the Government to put in place a framework which would recognise the long-term benefits of this resource.  The Labour Party, in its policy document, The Energy Revolution, brings forward plans for a <Col N="60"/>national energy efficiency retrofit programme to create at least 30,000 direct construction jobs.  It is hard to understand the absence of a major insulation programme for schools, hospitals, Garda stations and public buildings, even though there are thousands of construction workers with the necessary skills available.</P>
        <P>These are some of the things Ireland can do well and it is this approach, identifying areas in which we can be the best in the world, which will reap rewards.  I am not saying none of this is happening but more must be done.  It is a national imperative.  More proactive strategies are needed.  The unemployment rate is running at approximately 13.7% and the OECD projects unemployment in Ireland will still be at 13% by the end of 2011.  In 2008, 25% of the total number of unemployed were long-term unemployed; the number now stands at 43%.  There is a crisis emerging which needs an appropriate and urgent response.  Labour market activation measures are needed more than ever.  While I accept large fiscal deficits are making this more difficult to achieve, the jobs crisis is far from being resolved, even though Government spokespersons have been pointing to the small reduction in the number on the live register as evidence to the contrary.  Those who have left the live register are now in foreign countries such as Canada, Australia and the United States and more are leaving by the day.  Training and placement opportunities are needed and must be at the top of our political agenda.  The crisis in F&Aacute;S is not helping and the reorganisation is taking its toll.  We need a functioning organisation at this time to get the unemployed back to work quickly before there is structural long-term unemployment, before people lose hope and there is dependency on welfare payments.</P>
        <P>With the public finances in such a disastrous state, we must adopt a value for money approach to all of these matters.  There must be a proper analysis of what works and what has not worked and we must learn from best international practice.  We must also learn from those who have participated in some of the current programmes.  Let us be prepared to ask them about their experiences and act on the results of these surveys.  We must be prepared to scrap some of the low level training programmes which may be of little benefit in favour of more challenging programmes linked with training opportunities in more diverse sectors.  It is no longer appropriate to have a plethora of construction-related courses, with the exception of those which have a green energy focus.  Why not introduce training courses which would appeal to those seeking careers in the media, including newspaper journalism, public relations, marketing, sports, including greenkeeping, etc., which are not readily available?  There is an excessive emphasis on computer programmes in the F&Aacute;S courses available.</P>
        <P>Unemployment subsidies must be expanded and targeted at new recruits, the long-term unemployed and other vulnerable groups.  Job search assistance and monitoring is essential.  Processes must be put in place that ensure a person becoming unemployed for the first time comes in contact with a case officer within at most two weeks, and thereafter has planned continual appointments and follow-up.  It is not good enough merely to tick the boxes on this most important aspect of getting people back to work quickly.</P>
        <P>We must also focus on our graduates, 30% of whom are unemployed according to a recent UCD survey.  Recently, the Union of Students in Ireland attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and gave us its thoughts and a proposal for a meaningful national internship scheme.  Students would work for their dole while getting valuable work experience and would also bring their skills to the enterprise, which is very important.  This should be done immediately.  Let us give our graduates a reason to stay rather than a reason to emigrate.  At least give them something to think about before they decide to emigrate.</P>
        <P>We have a structural problem with welfare in this country.  I am not talking about the so-called unemployment traps referred to by the Minister of State which are constantly peddled about unemployment benefits being too high and thus preventing unemployed people from <Col N="61"/>taking up low-paid jobs.  The same traps did not prevent the unemployment rate from going to 4% during the boom, so I do not accept the arguments.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Professor Brian Nolan stated that cutting welfare benefits will not incentivise people to take up jobs that do not exist.  Neither will the reduction in the minimum wage achieve anything in line with what the Minister of State had to say.  The structural problem to which I refer is the difficulty in taking up short-term jobs, perhaps for a month or six weeks.  This is an important point and I will finish on it.  The transfer between these type of jobs and welfare payments should be seamless.  There should be no need for fresh applications and no delays in payments after such short-term jobs have finished.  Unless this happens, people will not take up these jobs.</P>

	<P>At a recent economic conference in Balbriggan which I attended, there was a show of hands by business people as to who had work available if they could afford to hire.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senators Ann Ormonde, Larry Butler and Ivor Callely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Government amendment and in doing so I recognise some interesting points are made in the non-Government motion.  These stem from the question of a public private partnership for metro north and the suggestion we examine the offer from Siemens Ireland to install water meters.  The details of these proposals would have to be worked out but the proposals themselves are quite laudable.  The non-government motion is incorrect to state the Government&rsquo;s four year plan contains nothing by way of concrete measures to restore employment.  It quite clearly does.  It refers to the &euro;500 million innovation fund, the employment subsidy scheme and the enterprise stabilisation fund.  Not only this, the four year plan specifically states that protecting those who have lost their jobs and getting them back to work is the most pressing priority of the Government.</P>
        <P>Many and various areas of where we can grow our economy have been mentioned in the debate and it is very obvious that growth will be export led.  As the third most globalised economy in the world, there is no question or doubt that we will share disproportionately in the 4.5% growth in the world economy this year and next, and the targets we have set for growth will be reached.  With this in mind, many people have suggested certain areas for growth, and agrifood is an ideal area as commodity prices of late have been quite strong, stemming from demand which is reflected in the growth in world economies.  Tourism is another obvious area and I ask the Minister of State to examine tourism from Brazil, Russia, India and China in particular as there are difficulties with people from there obtaining visas.</P>
        <P>The motion also contains a proposal on the &euro;10 travel tax which is seen as a panacea.  I am glad the Minister with responsibility for this area has requested those who have an interest in it, namely, the airlines, to come up with proposals.  The idea that the &euro;10 tax can be reduced at present without concrete proposals from the airlines as to what extra business they will bring in is unreasonable.  I believe the Minister will receive proposals.  These proposals should not be <Col N="62"/>used again by any company to renegotiate for lower landing fees.  If proposals are made, I hope they are specific to the &euro;10 tax and not used again and again to try to get a better deal in every possible area, having made a deal on the &euro;10 tax.</P>
        <P>One of the new areas we will be looking at is supporting indigenous industry and the Kerry Group has been referred to.  Other groups will emerge and these will be very innovative.  The innovation of the people is coming through in the hour of necessity.  We are getting through quite clearly and quite well and we are on a very strong trajectory.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to eat into anyone else&rsquo;s time.  I suggest the Government has taken the correct path in the narrow confines in which it has found itself and this path has been backed up by the EU, the IMF and the four year plan.  When the election is held with the budget behind us, we will have put this country on the road back to recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be very brief.  I welcome the Minister of State and I especially welcome the points he made when he spoke from the heart at the end of his speech.  These are the points about which I wish to speak and which I want to endorse.  The Minister of State said we are here to reform the banking system and to create an environment for job creation.  I welcome and endorse the points made on how we are to go about this.  The Minister of State mentioned maintaining the 12.5% corporation tax and the importance of metro north and its potential to create 35,000 jobs.  I thought the water metering system was a very interesting idea and we should accept the offer from Siemens which stated it would install meters without any cost to the State.  This is something we should discuss again.</P>
        <P>Let us stop points scoring.  I stated this on the Order of Business earlier.  We have a golden opportunity to speak about the future of Ireland and keep our heads high.  There is talk about our sovereignty and independence being diluted and our neutrality gone.  I see nothing wrong with asking for money if we need it.  There is nothing wrong with this and I keep my head high.  Let us put hope back into our system.  Let us give confidence to the people.  Let us try to educate the broader public about what we are doing to correct measures and not talk to ourselves and score points.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I echo everything the Minister of State said.  I endorse the points he made on national recovery, development skills and preparing young students coming out of schools and colleges for work experience programmes.  These are the areas where I want to see co-ordination between the Departments of Education and Skills, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Social Protection.  As these Departments have not worked well together, I hope from here on in there will be better co-ordination between them because this is where the jobs are and this is how we will make the transition from school or work experience to work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to participate in this Private Members&rsquo; debate on the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  We seem to be on a roller-coaster of an economic and financial nightmare with everything falling apart.  There is a general air of anxiety and demoralisation.  Unemployment and financial burdens have brought hardship, suffering and personal degradation into almost every home.  The spectacle of well-educated young people unable to find suitable work and being forced to emigrate is deeply regrettable.  The social advances made over the past decade, along with other advances made by our country are likely to be affected.  The perception is that the Government is adjusting everything downward with mass unemployment, financial crisis, additional taxes, widespread hardship and an inability for this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration to govern. I know it is not necessary, but I will take this opportunity to give the Government, through the Minister of State, a very clear message from the public, that we are holding it responsible for the mess this country is in.</P><Col N="63"/>
        
        <P Just="Left">For a variety of political gains, there has been a destructive propaganda campaign about the economy, our finances and the Government&rsquo;s administration.  A vacuum has been allowed to develop and there is a widespread feeling among the public that there is no one at any level in the current Administration capable of taking control.  The view is that the Government is completely at a loss and unable to cope.  We are just short of the masses shouting: &ldquo;Crucify him; crucify him.&rdquo;  Although the festive season is approaching, I do not share this type of play, especially at such a crucial period in our country&rsquo;s history.  The Government has made mistakes and should raise its hand and apologise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I was determined not to be political or to try and score points in my comments, but it is difficult not to.  I had to send a text message to people today to inform them that my branch AGM had been cancelled because of the snow.  I had to look through every number in my phone book to do that.  I noticed that a significant number of my contacts now live in Canada, Australia and London because of the policies pursued by the Government and the policies that have elected people such as the Minister of State to the D&aacute;il in the past 13 years.  It is difficult not to try to score points as a result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Labour Party and fully support its motion.  This is what politics is about.  The motion brings our economic mess back to the fundamental issue of employment, which is central to people&rsquo;s lives.  If employment is not available, people will leave the country.  People&rsquo;s lives have been ruined because of the policies that have been pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il and its different friends in government in the past 13 years.  This makes it difficult not to be party political when pointing that out.</P>
        <P>I want to mention some other issues with which the Minister of State was in agreement in his speech.  Senator Boyle stated that the Minister of State said the Government does not create jobs.  This is my second term in the Seanad and I am aware that the numbers employed in the public sector demonstrate that Fianna F&aacute;il and the different parties in Government spent significant money creating jobs during the past 13 years.  If we examined the increase in the numbers employed in the public service, we would see it coincided with election times.  There were also huge increases in public expenditure at those times.  It is a bit rich now for the Government to say it is not the Government&rsquo;s job to create jobs, although I believe it is not its job.  I agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments that the Government should focus on the work environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not get my seven minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator did not have seven minutes.  I apologise for that.  The Senator said he would give his last minute to Senator Butler.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make a few other points.  I will give him the last half minute.  The Government must create an environment where jobs can be fostered.  This motion is important in that context.  Senator Hanafin mentioned that the four year plan states it is the Government&rsquo;s priority to stimulate jobs, but there is little else in that regard in the plan.  Surely job stimulation should be at the core of the four year plan, but it is hardly mentioned and there is little concrete detail on how it will be done.  I am not happy about that.</P><Col N="65"/>
        <P Just="Left">I had wished to mention several other issues, but will stop on two final points.  I agree completely with Senator Ryan on the importance of the two sectors he mentioned for stimulating employment, agriculture and tourism.  This would not require significant investment from the State as the infrastructure for both is in place.  These two areas still have tremendous potential for the creation of significant employment for the future.  I do not agree with Senator Hanafin on the travel tax which was imposed, partly at least, because of the difficulty the Government had with a particular private air transport operator.  The Government has stubbornly stuck to it, despite that it has done increasing harm to the tourism sector in the past 18 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to put an important point to the Minister of State.  I endorse and welcome the four year plan.  One thing that should have been included in the plan, however, is mention of the energy industry.  Even at this late stage, an addendum should be made to the plan to ensure companies such as Spirit of Ireland, which could invest &euro;3.5 billion over the next few years to build a system that would allow us export electricity, are mentioned.  This is vital and would ensure our electricity base prices would remain among the lowest in Europe.  It is also important to bear in mind that in 1985 we were paying 35p out of every &pound;1 for our borrowings, but our new borrowings under the EU and IMF loans will only cost approximately 22 cent out of every &euro;1.  It is important to remember this.  With bond holders currently offering money at 9%, the deal we have been offered is reasonable, although I would have liked us to have been able to borrow at 5%.  The Minister of State should look at including an addendum in the four year plan with regard to the energy industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate.  I do not want to criticise the various political parties for their actions over recent years.  We all know the state the country is in, know the gist of the national recovery plan and have our views on whether the growth rates contained in the plan are likely to be realised.  One thing we can all do is to play our part in trying to create as many jobs as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In that regard, I welcome the contributions from the various Senators who have come up with ideas as to how to generate jobs.  In recent months I have spoken to people in many businesses across my county of Meath and to people who would like to set up new businesses.  I listened to the messages they would like to send to the House with regard to what we can do to make it easier to create local jobs.  The key issue which arises repeatedly is the lack of access to the credit market.  My colleagues have spoken about our ideas for a strategic investment bank and this would not be before time.  It is something that should be created as soon as possible.  We also need to look at bill payment mechanisms.  Currently, some large companies wait for months before they pay their small subcontractors.  We may need additional legislation in this area to ensure people pay their bills on time.</P>
        <P>We need to take a look at social welfare with regard to sole traders and people who start their own businesses.  Many of these people who go out of business find that they have no access to social welfare.  This needs consideration.  Senator Butler mentioned green economy jobs.  We can generate additional jobs in this area.  Ireland has some of the highest wind speeds in the world.  Denmark has managed to generate more than 20,000 jobs in the wind generation sector.  We should identify the problems that arise in creating jobs in this sector in Ireland.  One issue that repeatedly arises is access to the grid and the gates process.  We need to find out the constraints that inhibit producers from accessing the electricity network.  There is further potential in other areas of green energy.  For example, every euro we spend on the biomass industry generates 70 cent of local expenditure.</P><Col N="66"/>
        <P>We need to follow the example of France and Germany by supporting our artisan food and craft industry.  Officials in France see their role as facilitating production whereas our officials often see themselves as gatekeepers.  We need to help rather than hinder new industries.</P>
        <P>Tourism is one of our greatest assets.  Senator Ryan spoke about the potential for job creation in that sector.  I have heard great ideas from people in my own county.  A Book of Kells heritage centre could become the key destination for visitors to the Boyne Valley and County Meath.  The beautiful courthouse building in Kells, which is being refurbished at present, could become the nucleus for a heritage centre, thereby giving tourists an opportunity to learn about the Boyne Valley and the historic town of Kells.  I will be requesting F&aacute;ilte Ireland to fund that project.  Similar projects could be pursued in every town and village in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can continue to grow employment in the tourism, agriculture and green energy industries.  All we hear at present is bad news but having consulted many people from County Meath and elsewhere, I believe we have the talent and enthusiasm to recover and it would not take much to put the economy back into shape.  My colleagues have outlined the way we should proceed.  I thank Senators for their contributions and commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, who has responsibility for children for coming to the House to respond.  </P>
        <P>The problem is we often blame alcohol abuse on children, but they are only following the example set by adults and what is considered normal in our culture.  I am not a teetotaller, but I accept that we need to address the issue of alcohol pricing.  The budget will be announced next week and many will say that, like cigarettes, we need to increase the cost of alcohol to minimise consumption.  I come from a Border region and know there is a bigger issue which we need to try to address at British Isles level.  If the United Kingdom and Ireland operated a similar system, we would be able to cope with it.  I engaged in many debates last year, including on Radio Ulster and Radio Foyle, in which I raised the issue of a comparable VAT rate between Ireland and the United Kingdom and I was in the unusual position where I received <Col N="68"/>great support from the Unionist community.  I thought it would challenge what I had to say on radio, but it agreed with me.  Has there been any advance made on this issue?  Have talks taken place with the United Kingdom and, in particular, the authorities in the North on alcohol pricing?  People travel abroad to purchase alcohol, although it is more likely that people from the United Kingdom will travel to France in vans to purchase alcohol than it is for people to bring in substantial quantities of alcohol into Ireland by aeroplane.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of the labelling of alcohol products.  Unlike the Minister of State and Senator MacSharry who do not have to worry about their weight, I fluctuate from one extreme to the other.  When I am on a diet, I read the salt, calorie, sugar and saturated fat content on food products, but when it comes to alcohol, I am only aware of one product in respect of which it is stated it contains 28 calories per 100 ml.  I can choose that product on a night out, or I can guess what other products contain.  I have said previously that there is a market for diet alcohol which we are not exploiting.  Recently I spoke to somebody at the Vintners Association of Ireland pre-budget briefing and was informed that there was available a light version of a product along the lines of Baileys which was being exported to America.  There are research options for people to look at to give us a choice as when we are dieting, we not only worry about our food intake but also our alcohol consumption.</P>
        <P>I received the Alcohol Action Ireland plan, Tackling the Financial Hangover: Pre Budget Submission, which states the average cost of alcohol per taxpayer is approximately &euro;3,318.  The cost to the State is estimated to be &euro;3.7 billion; the cost to the health care system, &euro;1.2 billion, and the cost in terms of crime, &euro;1.2 billion.  The figure in respect of road collisions is estimated to be &euro;5.26 million, while the figure for lost output owing to absences from work is estimated to be &euro;330 million.</P>
        <P>We have a culture not of alcohol use but alcohol abuse with which we must deal.  Alcohol is linked with every celebration, commemoration, etc.  We must, therefore, be more coherent in the plans we adopt to tackle the issue.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The House will be well aware of the harm caused by alcohol misuse in society.  It would be simplistic to describe the problem as one related to under-age drinking.  Most of the harm occurs among the adult population.  It manifests itself, for example, in street violence, accidents, hospital admissions, drink driving, alcohol poisoning, suicides and alcohol dependency.  Some of these problems arise where the light or moderate drinker drinks to excess on a single drinking occasion, while others result from regular heavy drinking over a longer period of time.</P>
        <P>I would like to describe alcohol misuse in a health context.  Alcohol causes twice as many deaths as all other drugs combined.  One in four deaths among young men under the age of 34 years is due to alcohol compared with one in 12 deaths due to cancers and one in 25 due to circulatory disease.  Suicide rates have doubled in the past 20 years.  Alcohol is a factor in almost half of all young male suicides.  It is also responsible for nearly one quarter of the injuries presenting to emergency treatment centres.</P>
        <P>In order to tackle the problems associated with alcohol misuse, we need to take responsibility both collectively and individually.  The social acceptance of alcohol in our society needs to be questioned.  We also need to question what example we, as adults, are giving to our children and young people.  The Government has acted and will continue to take the necessary steps to reduce the level of alcohol-related harm.  To date, we have introduced mandatory alcohol test<Col N="69"/>ing of drivers, reduced the opening hours for the sale of alcohol in off-licences and supermarkets and implemented controls on the marketing of alcohol.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Government alcohol advisory group was set up in January 2008 to make recommendations to address the public order aspects of the licensing laws.  The group&rsquo;s recommendations formed the basis of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  The introduction of the Act, which was conceived and passed within six months, has demonstrated this Government&rsquo;s commitment to dealing with alcohol misuse.  The Act contains provisions for reduced hours for off-sales of alcohol, tougher public order provisions allowing garda&iacute; to seize alcohol from minors and for test purchasing of alcohol by persons under the age of 18.  The Act requires applicants for a wine retailer&rsquo;s off-licence to obtain a District Court certificate to obtain the licence.  It has also attached stricter conditions to the granting of a special exemption order.</P>
        <P>In March 2009 the Government agreed to include alcohol in a national substance misuse strategy that would be co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A steering group has been established to develop proposals on alcohol policy for an overall national substance misuse strategy that will incorporate the agreed drugs policy element.  The steering group is being chaired jointly by the Department of Health and Children and the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs.  It will base its recommendations on effective evidence-based measures to deal with the significant public health issue of alcohol in areas such as supply, pricing, prevention, treatment, awareness and education.  The steering group is working towards completing its report by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Alcohol labelling is one of the many issues being discussed by the steering group.  The Department of Health and Children has indicated its intention to prepare proposals for legislation in this area.  The intention is that health advice or warnings would be placed on alcohol drink containers, such as bottles and cans, as well as promotional materials.  The health advice would include advice on the dangers of consuming alcohol in pregnancy.  In addition, it is proposed to provide for the inclusion on the label of the amount of pure alcohol in grams contained in each bottle and can, etc.  I look forward to the publication of the report from the national substance misuse strategy steering group which will advise the Government on the necessary policies and actions to be taken to reduce further the harm caused by alcohol misuse in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unbelievable that one in four deaths of young men is related to alcohol.  In discussing labelling, I ask that when the legislation is forthcoming, we might talk about calorie content, which is a significant issue in people choosing products.  It might sound silly but as a person who knows people who do much dieting, I know the calorie content is as important as anything else, such as the level of pure alcohol in the drink.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This motion asks the Minister for Health and Children to ensure adequate funds are made available to Sligo General Hospital for the operation of a bus bringing patients for cancer treatment to University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, from the &euro;750,000 fund announced as ring-fenced for such purposes by Professor Tom Keane.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will recall very well the personified anger and the depth of this justified anger and disappointment in the people of Sligo and the north west following the transfer of cancer services to UCHG.  I could probably filibuster for a day and a half on the issue.  The HSE as a whole, with a centralising approach to plans, pathology and categorisation seems to <Col N="70"/>have a policy, from the perspective of the people who live in Sligo and the north west, of the people moving closer or dying.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, we are where we are and there is an intolerable position where a bus brings patients for treatment to University College Hospital in Galway each day.  A new bus is to be delivered very shortly and from that, given budget cutbacks enforced on the hospital, the hospital and friends of the hospital who will purchase the bus must secure operating costs for the vehicle on an ongoing basis in the region of &euro;70,000.  The budgetary constraints mean the hospital must seek the funds from third party sources.</P>
        <P>The hospital applied to the Irish Cancer Society for funding as it is the group administering the &euro;750,000 fund which Professor Tom Keane indicated would be available for travel and transport services for patients travelling to cancer treatment in University College Hospital in Galway.  On doing so, Ms Mairead Lyons on behalf of the Irish Cancer Society informed the Friends of Sligo General Hospital that it could not fund the programme without the permission of the national cancer control programme.  This was duly sought and declined in writing last week by Dr. Mary Hynes of the programme on the basis that it was not part of what is known as the travel to care scheme, whereby people make their own way to treatment and claim back money, or the care to drive programme.  That programme is idealistic, however beneficial it might be in its intentions, and is being rolled out for St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, although not throughout the country.  Volunteers are expected to come forward to drive people to hospital.</P>
        <P>If we have a fund of &euro;750,000 and a bus in place that can bring people for treatment, notwithstanding the discomfort and injustice being perpetrated on the people of the north west, why are we trying to roll out new schemes with the money?  That money is required for the operation of the existing bus.  The argument from the Department is that the bus always brought people for radiotherapy.  Since the transfer of other cancer services, people are going to UCHG to use that facility for many cancer related treatments other than radiotherapy.  Rather than being foolish about this we should use our common sense and prioritise.  If there is no money to run the bus, the &euro;750,000 should be used to run the bus.</P>
        <P>On a temporary basis and at an absolute minimum I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure the &euro;750,000 as announced by Professor Tom Keane and administered on behalf of the HSE and others by the Irish Cancer Society is made available to groups such as the Friends of Sligo General Hospital to try to minimise the stress and pain on those people who must travel to Galway.  It should be made available for that purpose.  I appeal that this be done immediately pending permanent budgetary arrangements.  The money must be made available to people.</P>
        <P>I cannot overestimate how annoyed the people of the north west are because of how they have been treated in the transfer of all these services.  To say to them under the auspices of a letter from Dr. Mary Hynes that they would get no funding to help the running of the bus is nothing short of a urination on the people of the area in which I live.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take the only common sense approach that is justified by instructing the HSE and national cancer control programme to tell the Irish Cancer Society to administer this fund thoughtfully to ensure groups such as the Friends of Sligo General Hospital have adequate funding for the running of the bus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to set out the position on funding support for patients from the Sligo area travelling for cancer treatment.  The need for patients to travel arises partly as a result of the consolidation of cancer services that has taken place in the past two years.  It is also the case that some cancer services, in particular radiotherapy, have always been located in a small number of hospitals. The university hospital in Galway and Limerick <Col N="71"/>Regional Hospital have been, since 2005, the hospitals providing radiotherapy services in the HSE western region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The consolidation of cancer services in the past two years has been undertaken by the national cancer control programme in line with the recommendations in the 2006 national cancer control strategy.  The goals of the programme are better cancer prevention, detection and survival through a national service based on international evidence and best practice.  Achieving these goals has required the realignment of cancer services to move from a fragmented system of care to one consistent with international best practice in cancer control.  Eight hospitals in Ireland were designated by the HSE as cancer centres in line with the recommendations of the 2006 strategy.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure patients receive the highest quality standards of care while at the same time allowing local access to services where appropriate.  This means diagnosis and treatment planning being managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, with treatment other than surgery, such as chemotherapy, delivered in local hospitals.</P>
        <P>The HSE has designated University College Hospital Galway and the Mid-Western Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the managed cancer control network for the HSE western region, which includes Sligo.  I recognise, as does the national cancer control programme, that the consolidation of cancer services in the eight centres means that patients may need to travel longer distances than heretofore to access some cancer services.  For patients in Sligo, this applies particularly to breast cancer diagnosis and surgery which are now located at Galway.  Radiotherapy services for Sligo patients, on the other hand, continue to be located at Galway as has been the case since 2005.  Outpatient radiation oncology clinics continue to be delivered at Sligo, as does medical oncology.  A second medical oncologist is being appointed on a permanent basis at Sligo to support this service.</P>
        <P>In 2008, the Friends of Sligo Hospital applied for a lottery grant for the purchase of a bus and &euro;170,000 was provided in September 2008.  I understand the bus has now been purchased and will replace an existing bus which had been in operation for Sligo patients for some time.  I am advised that the Friends of Sligo Hospital has sought funds from the national cancer control programme for the running costs of the bus.</P>
        <P>I assume the &euro;750,000 fund about which Senator MacSharry spoke refers to the Travel2Care scheme.  The scheme is funded by the national cancer control programme and administered by the Irish Cancer Society on its behalf.  It is being implemented on a phased basis in line with the transfer of cancer services to the designated centres and the approved satellite centre where this transfer of services has caused financial hardship.  The scheme provides some financial help towards the costs of public transport such as trains or buses, private transport costs or petrol and parking.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international standards.  The provision of funding by the national cancer control programme under the Travel2Care scheme recognises the impact on patients of travelling for services.  The provision of lottery funding to the Friends of Sligo Hospital is a further step in helping to alleviate the impact for patients of travel for some services.</P>
        <P>The HSE is reviewing its policy on eligibility for non-ambulance based patient transport services in order that a consistent policy is adopted nationally for these services.  The Minister is requesting as a matter of urgency that the issue of funding of the bus from Sligo to University College Hospital Galway be resolved in the context of this policy review.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="72"/>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to various improvements that have been made.  The issue of follow-up mammography at Sligo General Hospital has not been addressed.  I ask that action be taken in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated the Minister is requesting as a matter of urgency that the issue of funding for the bus from Sligo to University College Hospital Galway be resolved in the context of this policy review.  The issue could not be more urgent.  While the decision to provide lottery funding to help finance the purchase of a bus is welcome, the decision not to help fund the costs of running of the bus in light of budgetary constraints when &euro;750,000 is available through the Travel2Care and care to drive schemes is ridiculous in the extreme.  It is akin to providing a linear accelerator and asking members of the public to operate it themselves without a radiation specialist.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister of State provided a set-piece response.  I ask him to convey my concerns to the Minister.  I hope the Minister&rsquo;s request concerning the funding for a bus from Sligo to Galway will be dealt with in a matter of hours or days rather than in the turnaround time we have come to expect from the Health Service Executive.</P>
