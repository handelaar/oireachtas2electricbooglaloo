	<P>The recession is at an end and this is to be welcomed.  Sadly, we are in for a long period of growth in the numbers unemployed.  The new live register figures reveal that 452,882 people are out of work.  Unemployment has risen to a staggering 13.4%.  I accuse the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green parties of having no jobs strategy.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the House witnessed the appalling self-congratulatory exercise of the Government&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion, in which the Government complimented itself on introducing our policy of exempting employers from PRSI, with the highest number of people unemployed and the staggering rate of suicide, as was mentioned yesterday, with 527 poor unfortunate people losing their lives to suicide because of the stress and anxiety of being unemployed.  This is the biggest crisis facing our country.  There are 300,000 more people unemployed now than when the Government took office in 2007.  This unemployment crisis is its sad legacy.</P>
        <P>It is reported today that the United States Ambassador, Mr. Dan Rooney, is calling on the Taoiseach to intervene regarding the granting of a foreshore licence for a water cooling system for the Poolbeg incinerator.  Why is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, stalling this project when there are 600,000 jobs at stake&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>How many jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, I meant to say 600 jobs.  I thank the Leader for the correction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>No problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the figure for the unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">He has also been asked to deal with the issue of waste.  It is time for the Taoiseach to restore our reputation with this US company, to intervene to implement Government policy and to remove the Minister, Deputy Gormley, so that he does not have a conflict in this matter.</P>
        <P>Another issue which really saddened me today is the new data from a leading financial journal stating that losses at Anglo Irish Bank are the worst recorded losses anywhere in the world of any bank, worse than Citibank or Royal Bank of Scotland and we have bailed it out to the tune of &euro;22 billion.  We have bailed out the developers and Fianna F&aacute;il and the bankers. <Col N="831"/> The Government should mark my words: not one rogue banker will go to jail.  This is a terrible situation.  We have been led a merry dance to pay for their crime and it is a crime.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children came to the House yesterday.  She hopes to save &euro;2 million by introducing a prescription charge Bill.  The people who will pay are the poorest of the poor, the sick people, while at the same time we are bailing out the banks to the tune of &euro;22 billion.  It is outrageous and the Government has stood idly by.  Nursing homes have been closed; home care packages have been reduced; Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients are not getting the care packages they need, including respite care, while services for people with disabilities have been cut.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is also being closed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a lot to say because Members on this side of the House must represent the voiceless and the sick.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party should not be as exercised about animal rights and welfare but about the rights and welfare of people.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to the story in <i>The Irish Times</i> today on legal fees.  I declare an interest in that I am vice chairman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The Leader has been involved in this issue since 2002 when he chaired an inquiry into the insurance industry.  I have been involved in the issue for many years and the idea is to keep the cost of claims reasonable.  We have been fought every step of the way by the legal profession, as it is entitled to do.  We seek to deal directly with people who make a claim.  If a person is injured at work and makes a claim, we want them to receive all the correspondence.  However, the legal profession fought against us with the support of the Law Society and took us all the way to the Supreme Court.  We were told we could not deal with a client directly but that we could copy to him or her information on our dealings with the solicitor.  That helped to ease the problem.</P>
        <P>We should take an interest in this issue because the legal profession is central to the democratic structure.  I hold the profession in the highest regard and its input is of great importance in a free society.  However, its members also have responsibilities to the citizenry.  In this case they submitted a bill of &euro;2.1 million in legal fees and the matter was appealed to the Taxing Master who hears appeals.  He stated: &ldquo;I have never encountered such grossly excessive fees being marked by learned counsel or solicitors.&rdquo;  He was outraged and expressed his bewilderment and disgust, words we do not normally see included in decisions handed down in court.  People must be aware that Personal Injuries Assessment Board is working hard to reduce costs for clients and should be doing so with the total support of the legal profession which has a major role to play in that regard.  If we are being fought every step of the way, with constant judicial reviews of the work of boards and constant attacks, I would like to receive the support of the House to make whatever changes are necessary to legislation governing the board to achieve what was intended by the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  I also ask for the support of the legal profession in so doing.  It is appalling, a bill of &euro;2.1 million in legal fees was reduced to &euro;400,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Senator O&rsquo;Toole that there are many in the legal profession who are just as appalled, shocked and amazed as he is at the story he related and the level of fees marked in the case mentioned.  As the decision is being appealled, we cannot debate the <Col N="832"/>matter in too much detail.  However, the Senator&rsquo;s amazement is shared across the legal profession.  It would be a mistake for anyone to think the fees in question are typical of what lawyers across the board earn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is absolutely typical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty in having a debate on the PIAB.  I respectfully disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on his point about the attempt made to exclude the possibility of people receiving the advice and assistance of lawyers in a personal injuries action.  That was always wrong and the decision of the Supreme Court was correct, but that issue is separate from that of the level of fees claimed which should be debated.  As this point is usually raised late on the Order of Business, I do not get an opportunity to respond to it.  As a lawyer, I have no difficulty in debating the matter in the House and more publicly.  By all means, let us have these issues debated.  I have no difficulty in debating them, if the Leader wants to arrange such a debate at a time he sees fit.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the role of this House in monitoring European legislation.  It may be difficult to fit this item in before the end of the session, but I ask him to try hard to do so, particularly in the light of what he said yesterday on the involvement of the House in the processing of European legislation.  He was contemplating setting aside one Thursday every month in the autumn for a discussion of the issue.  This sounds like a very good idea, but, as a member of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, with Senator Leyden and others, there are great complexities associated with the scrutiny of European legislation.  This is not an argument against the proposal made, but let us not rush in jumping the fences.  A report of the Sub-Committee on the Review of the Role of the Oireachtas in European Affairs is to be published next week.  I will attend a meeting at 11.30 a.m. to finalise it with my colleagues.  It looks to be a very good report on how the Houses can participate more fully in European affairs and the monitoring of European legislation.  We could have a debate on the report before the end of the session.  The report will be published on 7 July.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue the following week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about the proposed overview of planning in Cork city and County Cork?  He should also examine the glaring inconsistencies as regards one-off houses and in planning policies in rural areas.  I do not refer to developments in towns but to how families, sons, daughters, nephews and nieces, find it almost impossible to receive planning permission in rural areas, despite the effects of the recession.</P>
        <P>We must give credit where it is due.  I have been listening in the past few days to many people, including our backbenchers and Independent Members, on the success they have enjoyed with the Minister in resolving issues associated with the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, of which I fell foul in this House on a point of principle.  Credit should be given to Senators Coffey and Cummins of Fine Gael who batted on the issues involved and apparently agreement has now been reached.  We will debate the Bill the week after next and accept what should have been accepted initially.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  The point is well made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not always praise Fine Gael, but Senator Coffey tabled amendments on Committee and Report Stages, at which point I decided not to support the Bill.  The amendments were neglected by the Minister ridiculously.  This morning four or five Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers have come out and claimed credit for the changes to be made. <Col N="833"/> Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae is also claiming credit, as is Deputy Michael Lowry.  Credit is due to this House.  If business had been conducted properly, I would not be in the position I am and the furore in the D&aacute;il in the past few days could have been avoided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have been asking for a debate on fisheries for more than 12 months, particularly in the light of the Common Fisheries Policy which is being negotiated in the European Union.  It will lay down a marker in terms of the rights of fishermen and their quotas in the next decade.  It is important that the House debate this critical issue for a couple of hours in the next few weeks.  I received a commitment this time last year that it would be the first issue to be debated in September.  I would not like to be here this time next year still calling for a debate.  I also call for a debate on farming before the year is out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for his acknowledgement.  I also thank Senator Ormonde and other Senators on the other side of the House who spoke in favour of Fine Gael amendments to the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill which they saw as credible and realistic.  It was disappointing to hear Independent Members and backbench Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies debating matters in the media.  Two months ago we tabled reasonable amendments which we told the Minister we would withdraw if he was prepared to table amendments.  The Leader needs to take note and ask all Ministers to give proper consideration to amendments tabled in this House.  We are debating the issue of the relevance of the Seanad.  However, what has happened in respect of this Bill constitutes an insult to this House and its Members.  As a Member who worked hard on the Bill and who tabled many amendments that apparently are about to be accepted in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, although they are as yet unseen, I certainly took this as an insult.  All Members should note this for future consideration with regard to any legislation coming before this House.</P>
        <P>More than one year ago, I asked for a debate on the future of waste management.  I refer to the fairly public and serious conflict between Dublin City Council and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with regard to the Poolbeg incinerator.  In common with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, on occasion I have raised the point that multiple incinerators are planned through the various regional waste management plans.  However, there is no overall national waste management strategy and no co-ordinated plan to decide on the future for waste streams.  Waste infrastructure is vital for competitiveness in business, residences and local authorities and it is important to have clear direction and a clear plan and strategy for this.  Consequently, I ask the Leader to provide for a debate on the subject either during this session or early next session and to bring this matter to the attention of the relevant Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the suggestion that the Minister for Justice and Law Reform should come before the House to discuss issues such as the report in today&rsquo;s newspapers regarding the Taxing Master&rsquo;s report on a particular incident involving the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  I understand the separation of powers between the political sphere and the Judiciary but there must be a chance for Members to discuss issues such as sentencing policy, the costs charged by the legal profession, the right of people to their good name, the number of times that some people are obliged to come before court without their hearing taking place, as well as issues in respect of the free legal aid system.  There must be a place and time in which Members can express their point of view, rather than trying to impose their thoughts on the Judiciary.  I understand that not many of the issues to which I have just referred have been reviewed by the Judiciary in the recent past and therefore, it is valid for Members to air their concerns here.  Anyone outside the House can do so at the pub.  Members should <Col N="834"/>have the capacity here to have a discussion in respect of real and important issues within the judicial process and within the generality, rather than the specifics, of particular cases.</P>
        <P>I also ask that the Minister for Justice and Law Reform be invited to the House to discuss briefly a recent report to the effect that cigarette sales in shops have fallen by 40% since the internal advertisements within shops have been banned.  The retail industry asserts that there has been a 40% drop in legal cigarette sales within a one-year period.  However, the contention of the retail industry is that this has led to illegal sales being the real way in which people now buy cigarettes.  Its contention is that many retailers are being offered illegal cigarettes to be sold under the counter.  Will the Leader invite the Minister before the House to discuss his views on this report?  While I would welcome a genuine 40% reduction in cigarette sales, if this fall is as a result of them being sold in another way, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform should be able to explain to Members the measures he proposes to take to counteract the illegal cigarette trade, while acknowledging the great successes the Customs and Excise and Garda are having in finding many hauls that have been imported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was impressed with and agree with the essential point made by Senator Coffey on the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill.  I participated in the debate on this Bill in the Seanad with great interest and tabled a number of amendments.  What struck me at the time was that although Members had different views on the various amendments, there was an intense debate.  I formed the impression that the arguments were not heard in respect of the content of the aforementioned amendments.  Were it to now turn out that similar amendments will be accepted for political pragmatic reasons when the matter comes before the D&aacute;il, it would reflect badly on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to engage with this House.  The Legislature has a job to do, which is to scrutinise legislation and to make amendments.  Members deserve to have such amendments considered on their merits.  It will look bad if a different attitude is adopted simply for political pragmatic reasons.  While I do not wish to prejudge this because those amendments remain unseen, it appears somewhat ominous.</P>
        <P>On the Civil Partnership Bill, there have been a number of calls for a free vote on this issue, precisely because of its significance and importance as a cultural and moral issue about which many good people have different views.  However, I ask the Leader whether he also will give a commitment to there being a full and open debate on Second Stage on this Bill.  Time limits should not be imposed on people&rsquo;s contributions on an issue of such significance.  I also ask the Leader whether a guillotine will be imposed on Committee and Remaining Stages of this Bill.  I sincerely hope there will not be because this Bill pertains to a highly important issue.  It is evident that it is of concern to many people with different points of view.  However, all amendments and all sections must be considered in full.</P>
        <P>I do not like the possibility that this Bill might be before the Seanad at a stage where, if amendments are to be included in the Upper House, the D&aacute;il will not sit to consider such amendments.  I cannot discern how this conveys any kind of respect for the legislative process.  Once the D&aacute;il has risen for the summer, the most that should be considered in the Seanad are fiddly, relatively unimportant legislative items.  I refer to matters about which no great injustice would be done to the political process were amendments not accepted in the Seanad because the D&aacute;il was not sitting.  However, on an issue as important as the Civil Partnership Bill, it must be the case that there is full openness in the other House to the possibility that amendments may be accepted in this House.  I would be grateful for a response from the Leader on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the remarks of my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, in acknowledgment and praise of Senator Coffey and the Fine Gael group.  It is important that <Col N="835"/>he made those remarks and I always have tried to acknowledge the contribution of others.  Moreover, it normally is in the best interest of best legislation to so do.  It is the manner in which Members should be seen to conduct their business, rather than contributing some political baggage for the sake of it.  I greatly welcome and support the sentiments and remarks expressed by my colleagues, Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Mullen.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Although approximately 5,000 people die each year in Ireland from sudden cardiac arrest, everyone can help to reduce this number by being aware of what to do in the case of a person suddenly collapsing.  To this end, I congratulate the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council on its Citizen CPR initiative, which is a nationwide public awareness campaign to promote bystanders&rsquo; CPR.  Will the Leader consider allocating time to debate the issues surrounding CPR?  I note that many appliances have been installed in Leinster House but I am unsure whether either Members or staff are fully aware of the procedures that would apply, should they need to be used.  Therefore, I seek a debate on this issue.  Anyone who consults search engines such as Google about CPR will learn of the benefits that have accrued in places such as the United States with its mass population, where this has been greatly promoted over the past 25 or 30 years.  It is a highly important issue.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I asked the Leader whether he could arrange to have the business plan of NAMA and the progress thereon brought to Members&rsquo; attention.  I was aware that NAMA had submitted its business plan last October.  On my return to my office yesterday having raised the issue, I became aware that NAMA submitted a new business plan to the Department of Finance only yesterday.  May Members see the new business plan submitted by NAMA?</P>
        <P>I support Senator Alex White&rsquo;s call on the matter pertaining to European affairs.  I am pleased to note there has been agreement regarding the setting aside of one Thursday in a month for debate on such matters.  I have asked for a considerable period that a time in the month also be set aside for a debate on financially-related matters and the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from Senator Callely, I wish to tell people about the heartsafe programme in Clonmel.  It is the only heartsafe town in the country.  A total of 16 defibrillators are placed throughout the town.  The aim is to have ten people trained on resuscitation on each of those defibrillators.  I have raised previously in the House that defibrillators are placed around the Houses as well and Members should know how to use them.  In Clonmel we recently had a public display on how to use defibrillators.  One of those involved in the display was a six year old boy, which shows exactly how easy it is to use a defibrillator.</P>
        <P>It is incumbent on Members of the House to know how to use defibrillators.  It is so easy to do.  It would give a certain amount of security and ensure people would have more of an interest in their health.  People should have certain tests carried out at a certain time in their lives.  Many people present would fall into that category.  It would be a good exercise to have physical health check-ups and for people to be aware of the facilities we have in the Houses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>For a long period I have argued with conviction against the introduction of incineration.  As far back as 2001 I opposed it in a debate in this House on two grounds primarily.  One is the health risks that are involved with the emission of dioxins.  I accept people contest that belief but serious questions arise in that regard.  A significant issue arises in terms of incineration taking waste in a way that totally negates all the other higher priorities in the waste management structure of re-use, recycling and minimisation.  In order to justify the significant capital expenditure on incinerators they will gobble up all the waste they can get and more.  I compliment the Minister.  I hope he is successful in his campaign.</P>
        <P>Another issue that arises in that regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I agree very much with what my colleague, Senator McFadden, outlined this morning.  It is a sad and sorry state of affairs in which we find ourselves.  While there has been a slight increase in growth in the economy, that is due to a surge in exports, which is welcome.  However, we must not run away with ourselves or allow ourselves to be deluded because when the CSO figures were seasonally adjusted we found there was an increase of 5,800 in the number of unemployed.  That is something that needs to be worked on more than is, unfortunately, the case at present.</P>
        <P>What Senator O&rsquo;Toole outlined this morning and what we read in the newspaper on the level of fees was stunning.  We have been most supportive in this House of the work of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Perhaps the Leader would arrange for us to have an early debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank Reform Bill is due in the House shortly.  Will the Leader clarify whether it is correct that it will not arrive until 8 July?  That is bad practice because the D&aacute;il will have risen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps the Leader will outline the position in that regard to us because we are making a mockery of the House if there is no opportunity for the views that will be expressed on this serious issue to allow for a possible amendment.  I look forward to hearing the Leader&rsquo;s views on the matter and confirmation of the date.  We do not wish all Stages to be rushed and taken together on the one day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the many points that have been raised on the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill.  I was astounded by the decision that the amendments would not be introduced in this Chamber but in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I compliment Senators Coffey, Cummins, Mullen and Senator O&rsquo;Donovan on this side of the House for taking a stand and having the amendments brought forward.  For the life of me I cannot understand why the amendments were not introduced into this Chamber.  It does not make sense.  It was an offence to all of us who were working on the ground on the issue and had a great knowledge of how the Bill was progressing in this House for the Bill to be transferred to the other House.  I hope that when the Bill returns to the House that the amendments will be the ones introduced by the Opposition, which I had to vote against.  I felt such a hypocrite in that situation.</P>
        <P>I called for a debate on the planning guidelines, which I accept will not take place before the summer recess.  The planning guidelines for one-off houses is important in terms of how we go about planning.  The issue does not relate to planning <i>per se</i> but to planning guidelines.  There are two separate issues.  The Leader should not put the two together because they do not go together.  We need a discussion on that issue.</P>
        <P>The jury is out on another matter introduced by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, namely, landfill versus incinerators.  That discussion is ongoing.  It is important that we have a discussion on the matter in this Chamber.  There are no fixed answers to the issue.  I do not know where the hammer will come down but it would be useful to have a debate on the matter in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to support Senator Mullen on the Civil Partnership Bill.  I had not thought it out until he spoke but if it is the intention to have the Civil Partnership Bill taken after the D&aacute;il has risen then we are wasting our time in having the debate unless there is a willingness to accept amendments.  I would like some form of guarantee from the Leader that at least we will be listened to on any Bill we take after the D&aacute;il has risen.  I am not sure how one does that but I imagine we will have to take the Civil Partnership Bill before the D&aacute;il has risen so we can propose amendments and know they can be accepted.</P>
        <P>The Leader will recall when Senator Ross discovered a flaw in the public opinion aspect of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill on the very last day after the D&aacute;il had risen.  I recall that on the evening he discovered the flaw the Leader accepted that and within minutes the Bill collapsed.  That is not going to happen this time unless there is a commitment that the debate will take place either before the Dail rises or we ensure we will not find ourselves in a situation where no amendments are accepted.  That is an important point.  I am pleased Senators Mullen and Coghlan have raised it.</P>
        <P>We have been worried about costs and we have talked about the cost of the legal profession.  There have been a number of discussions in recent days on the cost of other products in the Twenty-six Counties.  Yesterday the euro reached its lowest level since its introduction against the Swiss franc.  We may well say that every time it drops in value it is of benefit to exporters but it means the cost of everything we import increases.  We are inclined only to measure ourselves against sterling which has not been doing very well against other currencies.  Let us recognise the difficulties associated with trying to build the economy when the euro has a low valuation.  We should be trying to build the economy while the euro has a high valuation, as <Col N="838"/>others have done, and obtain the benefit.  A low valuation makes life much easier for exporters but much more difficult for importers, particularly importers of fuel and other products that affect almost everything we do.  Let us recognise that it is not all good news when the euro has a low valuation; it is considerably bad news for all of us in Ireland who must purchase and produce goods.</P>

Many issues have been mentioned such as the Civil Partnership Bill and the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, as have many others during the years.  The former leader of the Progressive Democrats, Mr. Michael McDowell, announced a few nights ago that he had changed his view on the Seanad.  He previously believed it should be abolished but now believes it should remain because it is important.  I share his view.  Mr. McDowell is a former member of the Fine Gael Party whose leader is still sticking to the notion that the Seanad should be abolished.  This is absolutely wrong.  We, therefore, need a debate on the integrity of the Seanad.  The leader of the main Opposition party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The second issue I would like to raise is that of waste incineration.  I ask the Leader for a debate on waste management which is always a very important social issue.  In Galway for many years there was an extensive debate on waste incineration and the maximum recycling option was chosen.  We were told when the initial reports were released that the maximum level of recycling that could be achieved was 48% and that this was the highest figure in terms of the viability of an incinerator.  However, in the pilot project a recycling rate of up to 77% was achieved.  The recycling figure in Galway has consistently remained above 50%.</P>

	<P>There are better and safer ways to manage waste than through incineration.  We need a debate on the issue before we go down the route of having waste-guzzling incinerators.  The key aspect is that they destroy important natural resources.  We, therefore, need to examine proper recycling options.  The debate should be held early in the next session.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to come to the House this morning or afternoon to discuss the reason a &euro;350 million project that could create 600 jobs is being stalled.  Senator McFadden is absolutely correct in saying 452,882 of our fellow citizens are unemployed.  That is the fault and responsibility of the Government.  The Minister has refused to grant a foreshore licence critical to the development of the project <Col N="839"/>at Poolbeg.  Why did the United States ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Dan Rooney, feel compelled to talk to the Taoiseach and seek a meeting with the Minister?  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business in order that the Minister can discuss the matter in the House.</P>
        <P>I remind the Members opposite that on radio this morning the Minister did not accept he had made changes to the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill; he said the opposite.  The hypocrisy of the Government has been further exposed.</P>

The reality is that if Government Deputies and Senators had exercised their consciences, &euro;22 billion in taxpayers&rsquo; money would not have been poured into the zombie bank, Anglo Irish Bank, to prop up the supporters of those Government Members in both Houses who do not have a conscience.  How can the Government, particularly the Green Party which has attempted to flex its muscles on a Bill to ban stag hunting, a Bill of show over substance, not have a policy on unemployment?  Unemployment presents the biggest crisis the country has faced in recent years.  I refer, in particular, to youth unemployment, for which the figures are absolutely startling.  The figure for young jobseekers has risen by over 6,000 and now stands at 91,646.  The Government has increased registration fees in third level institutions and wants to reintroduce third level fees which were abolished by Ms Niamh Bhreathnach when she was Minister for Education and Skills.  The level of unemployment has tripled and the Government has cut social welfare payments for the under-25s, in some cases by half.  That is absolutely shameful.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance, to the House to be held accountable, for once, for one of the biggest crises the country has faced in modern times.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Last week during a motion on the Adjournment, I was in a position to uncover a level of unhealthy proximity and familiarity between HIQA and the HSE.  Documents were finally made available to me as a result of directions by the Office of the Ombudsman.  Today, we will see further evidence of this situation, as inconsistencies in HIQA have been found in respect of the 133 nursing homes it has surveyed.  This information shows that the proximity and subjectivity within which the HSE and HIQA operate is similar to what occurred in terms of our economic meltdown, in that the regulatory authorities, the Central Bank as the overall authority and the service providers were operating with a level of familiarity and proximity that led to catastrophe.  The details I have uncovered are borne out in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> in regard to the nursing home issue.  If we allow this unhealthy situation to continue, it could compromise more than people&rsquo;s financial well-being.</P>
        <P>I call for an urgent debate on governance standards within the HSE, an organisation that has &euro;15 billion of the people&rsquo;s money Voted directly to it with no recourse to the Government or the people.

	<P>I refer to the intervention of the US ambassador, Dan Rooney, in respect of the Poolbeg incinerator and the failure of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to deal with a two year old application for a foreshore licence.  I second Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s proposed amendment to the Order of Business in this regard.  The serious issue that arises is that of abuse of office.  We are running the risk of the State being taken to court by the company in question if the rules and regulations laid down and in respect of which the company has a legitimate expectation are not applied in a fair, transparent and open manner.</P>
        <P>Whatever the merits of the incinerator, decisions have been made and the rules must be applied.  As in Greece, we will face daily fines for not complying with our landfill obligations under EU law.  The Minister must know that he cannot act in an arbitrary manner.  He must apply the rules, regulations and law as laid down.  The Minister should recognise his conflict of interest, given that the incinerator is to be situated in his constituency.  This matter should be handled by another Minister.</P>
        <P>There is a more fundamental issue.  A US company is involved and the spotlight is on Ireland as to whether we are prepared to abide by the rules and regulations and whether the regulatory system operates.  There have been unfortunate examples in the financial sector.  If the Government is seen as operating in this way in its dealings with foreign investors, we will have a problem.  The Minister should stand aside and another Minister should deal with the matter.</P>

	<P>I agree with the calls for a debate on waste management, the issue underpinning the points, some of them valid, on the legitimate expectations to which Senator Regan referred.  I do not doubt that the Minister is aware of the requirements for consistency with legitimate expectations, but the situation is more complex, as he warned the incinerator&rsquo;s promoters that the waste management strategy had changed and now involved new thinking.  International studies on the best way to handle waste did not recommend a mass burn municipal incinerator.  If the incinerator contracts go ahead, they will eventually be seen as akin to the West Link contracts that so enraged people.  We will either pay fines for not providing the required levels of waste or stop recycling to ensure we avoid those fines.  Neither is a palatable solution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Taking waste and not viewing it as a resource is out of sync with the 21st century.  Resource scarcity is a considerable issue and resource wars will begin to emerge.  We must look after our resources, given our position as an island nation dependent on imports.  The burn technology to deal with waste is dinosaur technology and needs to be put to one side.  Leading experts in the Irish recycling industry with whom I have spoken believe that 100% recycling of all waste streams within the municipal waste quotient is possible.  I was impressed by some of what I heard recently.  Mentioning names and companies would be invidious, but one can think of the country&rsquo;s main companies.</P>

	<P>Many people in a knee-jerk reaction just say that we need Seanad reform.  Some of the ideas put forward were nothing short of hare-brained.  We were told, for instance, that the Seanad elections would take place on the same day as the D&aacute;il elections.  How could we possible meet our electorate if they are out canvassing for votes?  How could an electorate be asked to elect, say, 20 or 30 Seanad Members when the quota is in or around 50,000, and then tell those people that they cannot deal with financial matters?</P>
        <P>People who give this reaction should think long and hard about the benefits and the system that operates in this House.  We have a wonderful opportunity at the moment.  Will the Leader write to the Chair of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on European Affairs that is looking at how the Oireachtas will deal with the new requirements under the Lisbon treaty?  The Seanad is ideally placed to deal with the new requirements for dealing with EU directives, so much so that we have the panels that represent each of the different facets of Irish life represented in this House.  If we did not have that, we should set up a committee to deal with these directives which would have such representation.  We already have it.  Let people think long and hard before they give knee-jerk reactions.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, I suggest that the level of interruptions in this House has got out of hand.  It should not be allowed and it should be brought up at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I support the calls by others for a debate on waste management.  It would be useful to have such a debate in the House.  There are conflicting views on the best approach to waste management.  I agree with Senators &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in and Dearey who spoke against  relying on mass incineration as a policy.  That has now been shown to be outdated.  Instead, we should put more reliance on renewables and increasing our recycling rate, which is not impressive at the moment.  Senator Regan is right in saying that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is conflicted on this.  People in Dublin South-East will be most unhappy that the incinerator still appears to be going ahead, despite the many stalling tactics the Minister has adopted.  Certainly, the prospect of this mass incinerator on an ill-conceived site in a densely populated area is of great concern to many.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In response to some of the contributions on civil partnership, I welcome the fact that this is an historic day for same-sex couples in Ireland, who for the first time will see the prospect of legal recognition for their relationships being put on the Statute Book.  As a member of the Labour Party I must say we are very unhappy with aspects of the Bill and we do not believe it goes far enough in terms of achieving full equality for same-sex couples.  None the less, it is a <Col N="845"/>step in the right direction, and that has to be welcomed by all who are concerned about human rights of others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Suicide Research Foundation, NSRF, in its annual report, 2009, indicated that there has been a major increase in deliberate self-harm among Irish men since 2007, particularly among younger men.  The increasing rate of deliberate self-harm is a strong indication that there will be an increase in suicide.  As an acute observer of suicide, in line with the production of my document, What We Can Do About Suicide in the New Ireland, in 2008, I was not surprised by the latest CSO figures on the surge of 25% in suicides in 2009 over 2008.  Some 80% of the suicides were among men and the largest increase was in the 25 to 44 age cohort.  That brings us back to deliberate self-harm, because the main method used by men is potentially much more lethal than for women, that is, hanging or drowning, where the chances of dying are much higher.  Women generally self-harm by self-cutting, tranquillisers or whatever. </P>
        <P>The NSRF says the indications are that the frightening 25% increase in suicide in 2008-09 is due to the economic recession, enhanced by job losses, spiralling debts and the fear of homes being repossessed.  These factors lead to marital tension, strain in relationships and mental illness.</P>

There has been a serious cutback in nurses in accident and emergency departments that are dealing with deliberate self-harm.  On the one hand, we have an increase in suicide and the incidence of deliberate self-harm, with young men in particular turning up in emergency departments, where the services have been drastically cut.  It is a paradox that there is more deliberate self-harm and suicides, and yet the acute services have been drastically cut back.</P>

We must be seriously concerned, however, because we know jobs will not emerge from the improved figures for a considerable time, perhaps a year or 18 months.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, this morning on the new 100 jobs in Galway.  I remind the House that 1.87 million people are still at work in Ireland, but there is a serious challenge facing both Houses of the Oireachtas on high unemployment.

        <P>I intend to propose to the various leaders and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that we will at least devote one day a month for the scrutiny of EU proposals.

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Bill, which has several purposes, to the House.  Its main purpose is to give further effect to the Government&rsquo;s cancer control strategy and, in particular, the development of radiation oncology services under the national plan for radiation oncology.  The plan will result in the expansion of public radiation oncology services, integrated with surgical and medical oncology.  It includes the integration of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Rathgar, into the HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme.  Accordingly, this Bill dissolves the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital and transfers the hospital and its staff to the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provided for the integration of the national cancer screening service into the national cancer control programme.  Cancer screening is an intrinsic component of cancer control and integrating it into the cancer programme ensured that <Col N="851"/>services and resources were co-ordinated in the fight against cancer.  Similarly, the provision of radiation oncology services is an intrinsic component of cancer treatment.  This Bill makes provision for the integration of St. Luke&rsquo;s into the HSE&rsquo;s cancer programme along the same lines as last year&rsquo;s legislation for the cancer screening service.  The legislation also provides for the discontinuance of the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, which was introduced in 1947.  Nobody is currently in receipt of this allowance and financial and other supports are provided to such persons under a number of other schemes.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains a number of minor technical amendments.  First, it makes technical amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 and the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 to assist in the interpretation of these Acts.  Second, it makes a technical amendment to the Health Act 2007 which relates to decisions taken under section 55 of that Act.  Third, it makes textual amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to correct typographical errors.  I propose to give an overview of the main policy areas of the Bill and then to set out its provisions in more detail.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme, NCCP, was established and approved by Government in 2007 to give effect to the national cancer control strategy 2006.  The strategy set out the future framework for delivery of cancer treatment in Ireland.  It also endorsed the national plan for radiation oncology which had been approved by Government in 2005.  Implementation of the programme involves the transfer of diagnostic, surgical and radiation oncology services to designated centres each with a critical mass of expertise, sufficient throughput of cases and a high concentration of multidisciplinary specialist skills.  This approach is supported by international evidence, which demonstrates that the concentration of cancer services in large volumes in specialist centres produces superior outcomes.</P>
        <P>The reorganisation of breast cancer diagnosis and surgery into the eight cancer centres has been the most high profile aspect of the work of the cancer programme to date.  This has been a significant and challenging task and its completion late last year marked a major milestone for the cancer programme.</P>
        <P>Considerable progress has also been made on other cancer services.  One important development is the establishment of rapid access diagnostic clinics for lung and prostate cancer patients in each of the eight centres.  These clinics will speed up access to diagnosis and multidisciplinary decision-making for patients whose symptoms are indicative of these cancers.  So far, we have six lung clinics and five prostate clinics and the remainder are due to be established this year.</P>
        <P>Good progress is also being made on the reorganisation of surgical services for pancreatic and rectal cancer patients.  There will be one national centre for pancreatic cancer surgery, at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin, while rectal cancer surgery will be carried out in each of the eight centres.  The community oncology programme is a more low profile aspect of the cancer programme&rsquo;s work but an extremely important one.  The major focus of this programme is on creating capacity and knowledge among health professionals in the community to promote best practice in cancer control.  These initiatives are all part of the overall implementation of the cancer control strategy.</P>
        <P>Demand for cancer services, including radiation oncology, will continue to increase in the coming years as the population ages.  The report of the expert group, Report on the Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland, in 2003, the Hollywood report, recommended the development of a clinical network of large centres.  The national plan for radiation oncology services was approved by the Government in 2005 and, as I said, endorsed in the 2006 cancer control strategy.  Its aim is to provide new or additional radiation oncology facilities in four cancer centres: St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, Cork University Hospital and Univer<Col N="852"/>sity Hospital Galway.  There will also be satellite facilities at two other cancer centres, the Mid Western Regional Hospital, Limerick and Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
        <P>With regard to the north west, it is Government policy to promote a cross-Border solution in the provision of radiotherapy services.  The Minister has offered to contribute to the capital cost of the proposed new radiotherapy centre at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry.  A final decision by the Northern Ireland Health Minister, Mr. Michael McGimpsey, on this proposal is expected in the near future.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the national plan for radiation oncology services is under the governance of the cancer control programme.  Construction of new facilities at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals will be completed at the end of this year.  When these new facilities come on stream, they will increase radiotherapy capacity significantly.  We will have 12 linear accelerators in the public system in the eastern region, compared with eight currently in operation at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  The two new facilities at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s hospitals will come together with the facilities at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to form the St. Luke&rsquo;s radiation oncology network.  The new facilities will be under the governance of the cancer programme, not the individual hospitals.  To facilitate the establishment of the St. Luke&rsquo;s network, the former director of the national cancer control programme, Professor Tom Keane, advised that there be a single governance model and that, therefore, St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital should also come under the governance of the cancer programme.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital was established by statutory instrument in 1999 as a voluntary hospital under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961.  It already receives all its operational funding from the HSE.</P>
        <P>Providing for the effective delivery of radiation oncology services as a fully integrated component of the cancer control programme is the main purpose of the Bill.  Accordingly, it provides for the dissolution of the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and the transfer of its staff and facilities to the HSE.  This means that all staff of the new network will be employees of the HSE, not any individual hospital.  This will facilitate the transfer of employees between locations, subject, of course, to the usual industrial relations arrangements.  It will allow for a single referral facility, a single management structure and shared support services across all three sites.  Additional development funding and 54 posts have been provided for the cancer control programme this year for the new centres.  In addition, some staff and resources will transfer from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to the new centres in the second half of this year.</P>
        <P>In 2014, when the national plan for radiation oncology services is completed and further capacity has been developed at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals, all remaining staff and resources will transfer from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to St. James&rsquo;s or Beaumont Hospital and radiotherapy services will no longer be provided at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  From 2014, therefore, all publicly funded radiotherapy services in Ireland will be provided as part of an integrated multidisciplinary service involving surgical, medical and radiation oncology services.  This is in keeping with the recommendations made in the Hollywood report.</P>
        <P>As many will be aware, there are organisations which are very closely associated with St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital but which are at the same time separate entities.  They are not encompassed within the legislation, nor should they be.  The Department of Health and Children has liaised closely with the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospial on the future of these organisations &mdash; the St. Luke&rsquo;s Institute of Cancer Research and the St. Luke&rsquo;s Cancer Research Fund.  The focus of both entities is on cancer research and the continued development of expertise and knowledge and there is widespread agreement that this should continue into the future.  The Minister understands the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is taking the necessary steps to ensure these organisations continue to have legally sound structures following the enactment of this legislation.  She very much welcomes this.</P><Col N="853"/>
        <P>The Minister is also very aware of the significant work done by the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital for many years.  To date, it raised more than &euro;26 million in funds for various projects within the hospital.  It has been a major force in fund-raising for radiation oncology services during the years and the Minister understands those involved wish to ensure the great goodwill and support for St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in the community can continue to benefit cancer patients into the future.  This is also to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Another key policy area of the Bill is the reallocation of certain functions from the health sector to the Department of Social Protection.  The Government decided some time ago that to increase the effectiveness of the health service generally, it was important that the service concentrated fully on addressing its core health objectives.  Accordingly, it was considered there could be scope to transfer certain functions from the health service and locate them more appropriately within other Departments.  The subsequent Core Functions of the Health Service Report in 2006 found that there were a number of schemes which were seen more as offering income supports than personal social services.</P>
        <P>A number of implementation groups were set up to carry out the transfer of functions.  One of these, the interdepartmental implementation group on non-supplementary welfare allowance payments, was given specific responsibility to examine the transfer of responsibility of income supports to the Department of Social Protection.  A total of 25,000 domiciliary care allowance cases transferred from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection in 2009.  In this context, the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, IDMA, was examined by the group.  The IDMA was originally introduced in 1947 for a specified list of diseases, including tuberculosis.</P>
        <P>In a situation where policy is moving towards mainstreaming supports for people with a disability, the sustainability of a separate income support payment for a prescribed set of diseases must be questioned.  The group found that the key objectives of the IDMA were met by other allowances, in particular, disability allowance and supplementary welfare allowance.  The incidence of the specified infectious diseases has been steadily declining and the number in receipt of the allowance in 2009 was very small &mdash; fewer than 20.  The group, therefore, decided to ask the HSE to examine the small number in receipt of the IDMA with a view to establishing their eligibility and suitability for transfer to an appropriate equivalent Department of Social Protection income support.  The HSE completed its examination of the small number of recipients in 2009.  It found that some were no longer eligible for the allowance and that others were suitable for transfer to an appropriate Department of Social Protection payment.  It should be noted that the weekly payment rates for IDMA, disability allowance and the supplementary welfare allowance were the same and, therefore, those who transferred to a new payment were not disadvantaged.  The HSE has informed the Department that no one is currently in receipt of the infectious diseases maintenance allowance and that there are no applications or appeals in hand.  Therefore, it has been decided to remove the infectious diseases maintenance allowance from statute by repealing section 44 of the Health Act 1947 and section 36(2) of the Health Act 1953.</P>
        <P>I will now outline the principal features of the Bill.  Part 1, comprising sections 1 to 4, inclusive, contains standard provisions dealing with the Short Title, commencement, definitions and expenses.  Section 3 removes the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s duty to provide an infectious diseases maintenance allowance and also revokes the St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Board (Establishment) Order 1999.  Parts of the legislation will come into operation by ministerial order and different provisions will be brought into operation at different times.</P>
        <P>The specific provisions of the Bill that relate to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital are in Part 2, comprising sections 5 to 13, inclusive.  Section 5 provides for the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to be dissolved.  Section 6 provides for the transfer of the land and other property of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital <Col N="854"/>to the HSE.  The Bill also includes a provision that the site may not be disposed of in any way without the permission of the Minister.  Many will be familiar with the location of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its very attractive grounds.  How this site may be used in future will be on many people&rsquo;s minds.  The Minister understands that the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and the board have been considering the future use of the hospital after 2014 and that they intend to submit their proposals to her in the very near future.  The Minister stated during the D&aacute;il debates on the Bill that she is committed to St. Luke&rsquo;s remaining within the public health service and that she will consult the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, the Health Service Executive and other interested parties on how the site could best be used for the benefit of patients in the future.  To provide further assurance, the Government introduced an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il which ensures that St. Luke&rsquo;s will continue to be used by the HSE for the delivery of health and personal social services.</P>
        <P>Sections 7 to 9, inclusive, are standard provisions dealing with the transfer of rights and liabilities of the St. Luke&rsquo;s board to the HSE, the preservation of contracts and pending legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>Section 10 deals with the transfer of St. Luke&rsquo;s staff to the HSE.  Staff are being transferred to support the future provision of radiation oncology services within the network model.  For staff, some of whom will transfer to other sites in the network at the end of this year and some of whom will remain at St. Luke&rsquo;s for a number of years to come, this provision provides certainty on their future conditions of employment.  All current employees of St. Luke&rsquo;s at the date of transfer will become employees of the HSE on conditions and pay that are no less beneficial than those they have currently.  All superannuation benefits and reckonable service transfer with the employees.  Furthermore, the Bill provides that the pension liabilities of St. Luke&rsquo;s will now become the pension liabilities of the HSE.  The Bill provides certainty, therefore, about the future for pensioners of St. Luke&rsquo;s also.  These provisions are similar to those under which the national cancer screening service staff transferred to the HSE in April this year.</P>
        <P>Sections 11 to 13, inclusive, are standard provisions dealing with the transfer of records and the preparation of a final report and final accounts of the St. Luke&rsquo;s board for submission to the Minister and the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Part 3, sections 14 to 17, inclusive, deals with various miscellaneous technical and textual amendments.  Section 14 updates the definition of &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 to reflect the new legal framework for the regulation of nursing homes, namely the Health Act 2007.</P>
        <P>Section 15 is a technical amendment to the Health Act 2007 to enable a decision by the Chief Inspector of Social Services to take effect immediately in cases where the registered provider or applicant informs the chief inspector that he or she accepts the decision.  Section 16 makes textual amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to correct typographical errors.</P>
        <P>Section 17 updates the definition of &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 to reflect the new legal framework for the regulation of nursing homes.  It also amends the definitions of &ldquo;allowable deduction&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum retained income threshold&rdquo; to ensure they take account of situations where both members of a couple enter long-term residential care.</P>
        <P>The contribution of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital board and its staff to the provision of cancer services has been immense.  The Minister acknowledges this contribution and thanks the board members, the management and staff for their commitment and dedication.  It is also important <Col N="855"/>to say that the board has provided great support and co-operation for the process of integration into the cancer programme.</P>
        <P>The Minister looks forward to the ethos and sense of professionalism, which is so much a part of St. Luke&rsquo;s, contributing to the continued successful implementation of the cancer control programme and in particular the new St. Luke&rsquo;s radiation oncology network.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This legislation, which changes the governance of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, has evoked a strong reaction from the thousands of individuals and their families who have used the services in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  That is clearly because of the quality of service those families and individuals have received in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  It has led to incredible fund-raising of &euro;26 million, the establishment of institutes and foundations to support cancer research, and an organisation called Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  All that has happened in the past 55 years while the hospital, in the absence of quality cancer care in other areas of the country, fulfilled a vital role.</P>
        <P>Since its formal opening in 1954, hundreds of thousands of patients and their families have been through the doors of St. Luke&rsquo;s and experienced quality care.  They have not just received medical care.  They have received medical and psychological support and, at the most stressful of times, they have had a very good experience in the hospital.  That is the reason we have had so many people reacting to the news in the Minister&rsquo;s Bill.</P>
        <P>I will read one of the e-mails I got about St. Luke&rsquo;s; I am sure the Minister has received many also.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Over 180,000 people have petitioned Dail Eireann to retain St Luke&rsquo;s and all its services.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. History shows that decisions taken without due care and rationale have enormous consequence; [the person gives some examples].</P>
        <P LI="1">3. Visit the Facebook &lsquo;Save St Luke&rsquo;s Cancer Hospital&rsquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I looked at the website and 2,215 people have signed on to the Facebook page in an effort to keep St. Luke&rsquo;s as a viable entity.</P>
        <P>It is important that we take account of the holistic and healing ethos in St. Luke&rsquo;s and do whatever we can to bring that forward into whatever new services are being developed.  There is no doubt that it is a gem of a service.  The quality of people&rsquo;s experience in the hospital has been very good, and the quality of care has been excellent.  However, the medical context is now changed.  As the Minister of State outlined, we are moving to specialist centres with inter-disciplinary teams where the quality of care is the very best possible, and we hope that will continue.</P>
        <P>I welcome the approach the Minister has taken to the lands at St. Luke&rsquo;s, which will be kept for health services.  However, I point to the contradiction in what the Minister said on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il when Deputy James Reilly moved an amendment to the Bill.  Will the Minister&rsquo;s staff in the Department re-examine that?  On 30 June Deputy Reilly said he would table an amendment on Report Stage to ensure that any review of services or new plan for St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital would be brought before the health committee.  The Minister said in reply that he was happy to agree to Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s suggestion.  Before Committee and Report Stages of the Bill in this House I ask the Minister to look again at that amendment which she agreed to accept but which is not met by the amendment tabled in the D&aacute;il during the debate yesterday.  I ask that it be examined and built into the Government amendment because it appeared at the time that the Minister was happy to accept that.</P><Col N="856"/>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome that there will be ongoing discussions between the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and the Minister to work out the future use.  It is extremely important that we learn from the ethos in St. Luke&rsquo;s and that in developing HSE services that ethos becomes part of what is available to patients under the HSE services which, sadly, have been lacking in quite a number of cases.  I do not have the time to go into the details of those now but, unfortunately, it is easy to recall the disappointment many cancer patients experienced at the hands of our medical services in the past six months to a year.  I readily acknowledge that there have been very good experiences as well but the experiences of people like Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley, the late Susie Long, the women in Portlaoise and the people whose X-rays were not read in Tallaght hospital was very bad and we must work constantly to improve the services available.</P>
        <P>I support the role of specialist centres.  I never had any doubt about it, particularly in regard to breast cancer services, for example.  However, we must take account of geographic considerations which are important.  Undoubtedly, the outcomes are better in specialist centres and it is vital that we all acknowledge that.  I want women and men to have the best possible outcomes.  Those affected by cancer deserve the very best care and if we are not engaging in best international practice, that is wrong.</P>
        <P>We cannot move people to specialist centres before the specialist centres are properly developed and have the ethos and the support services that have been available in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  Many of our general hospitals, for example, were not ready for the designation they got as a specialist centre.  We have seen that in Galway and in other hospitals.  I note that at the same time we are debating this legislation about moving radiation oncology to Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s hospitals, 52 beds have been closed in Beaumont Hospital in the same number of weeks.  A question arises, therefore, about the timeframe around the development of radiation oncology.  Perhaps in her reply, the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, could outline that.  She commented on it in her speech.  However, I note that the original plan for the development of those specialist centres had a different timeframe and it appears it is being pushed back, probably to 2015.  We have stated that the radiation oncology services would move in 2014, but I understand that has already been extended to 2015.  Is it likely that the services will continue for a longer period in St. Luke&rsquo;s than is currently envisaged in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech today?  For example, we had been told that there would be two new radiotherapy centres, at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont, at the end of 2010 under phase one of the national plan for radiation oncology.  They all were supposed to be rolled out by 2011, but that timeframe seems to be in serious question.  In principle moving people to specialist services is excellent and in principle outcomes are better, but in practice, if we are unable to develop the services and make them available because of cutbacks and if the support services are not in place, then obviously, it should not happen and the timeframes may well need to be revisited.  I have no difficulty in supporting the principle of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the title St. Luke&rsquo;s Oncology Network.  It is important that the title has been kept.  It is a positive statement and a positive acknowledgement of the work done in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I hope every effort will be made to support the work of the two research institutes and foundations in their ongoing attempts to get more money for cancer services and to continue the fund-raising work.</P>
        <P>I hope the volunteers who are terribly disappointed and the professional staff from St. Luke&rsquo;s will be able to make the transition envisaged positively, and no doubt they will do it in a professional way.  I hope their disappointment at the changes being made today will not hamper their ongoing work or will not make them feel disillusioned about the support they have given to cancer services, and, I hope, will continue to give because we need the efforts of all the volunteers in this area.  I have been involved for several years with the breast cancer voluntary <Col N="857"/>organisation Europa Donna and I am familiar with the work it has done to support individuals who have breast cancer.  Really, a family can never have enough support if a member is going through cancer.  The medics and the professionals will never be enough.  It always will be about the support that one gets from family and one&rsquo;s wider network and from the volunteers who do such fantastic work with all of these illnesses and offer such brilliant support services.  I hope the thousands of people who have given so much to St. Luke&rsquo;s will be able to continue to work for the benefit of cancer patients throughout the country.  That is extremely important.</P>
        <P>I suppose one of the major criticisms of the HSE has been the lack of the kind of ethos we have seen in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  It is a significant challenge for us to turn the HSE, as the overarching supervisor of the health services, into the kind of body able to deliver the quality service that was available in St. Luke&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill.  Will the Minister look at the amendment Deputy Reilly tabled?  I acknowledge that to some degree the Minister has met his request that the lands would be maintained for health and allied services, and I welcome that.  I congratulate and pay tribute to the enormous amount of work that all of those associated with St. Luke&rsquo;s have done over the many years that it has been providing such a tremendous service to Irish people who have had cancer.  I hope their work will continue, albeit, perhaps, in a new place but also on the grounds of St. Luke&rsquo;s where the services will take a slightly different format than we have been used to.</P>

	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, to the Chamber and thank her for her presentation.  I am delighted to be associated with the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
        <P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald.  It was a pleasure to listen to her presentation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>She spoke from the heart with such knowledge.  I can see she has a genuine compassion and concern for what is happening here today.  That probably comes from all sides of the House, where everybody, whether one has had members of one&rsquo;s family or one&rsquo;s friends affected by cancer, knows somebody who has been through St. Luke&rsquo;s.  Thankfully, I have never had anybody close to me there, but I have certainly had some good friends who have gone through, received very good treatment and come out the other end, and equally so, ones who did not come out the other end.</P>
        <P>What is lovely about St. Luke&rsquo;s, everybody says, is the beautiful serenity, peacefulness and solace.  The Minister of State mentioned it when she spoke about the grounds.  It is a special place.  Really, it is a little oasis tucked away in a busy part of Dublin called Rathgar.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, we are here today to see the winding up of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  I say &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo; with a little smile on my face because we are fortunate also in that our cancer control programme has reached such a level and we are now seeing the establishment of eight new specialist centres.  I will always called them &ldquo;specialist centres&rdquo;, rather than the term &ldquo;centres of excellence&rdquo; that is commonly used, because, as I have heard Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady state previously, every centre that provides health care services is a centre of a excellence but these are specialist centres where there are multidisciplinary teams.  I congratulate the former director of the entire cancer programme, Professor Tom Keane, and I wish his successor well in her new role.</P>
        <P>No doubt before the national cancer programme was rolled out Ireland had one of the worst records in Europe.  Sadly, we all know the sorry tales of the women who have been affected so <Col N="858"/>badly by misdiagnosis of breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer &mdash; all sorts of cancer.  Not alone have women been misdiagnosed, but men have been misdiagnosed.</P>
        <P>However, today is not a day to dwell on the national cancer control programme.  It is a day for us to pay tribute to St. Luke&rsquo;s and the wonderful work it has done over 55 years.  It was set up in 1954.  I note Senator Mary White has just come in.  Her husband, P&aacute;draic, has been chair of the board for ten years.  They always seemed to attract very good, hard-working, progressive caring-type minds to St. Luke&rsquo;s and they carry out their duty in a diligent and &mdash; again, I use the word &mdash; serene way.  Things are done and nobody knows about them, but those who avail of the service certainly know about it.  I come back again to speak about the wonderful caring staff.  I am glad they will be redeployed and that they can carry on the significant work they have been doing over the years for cancer sufferers.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady state that the building and the grounds will be almost ring-fenced and nothing will be done without the Minister&rsquo;s say.  Naturally, one cannot leave it as a shrine but it seems to be a very special place.  The board of St. Luke&rsquo;s to which I have briefly alluded certainly seems to be caring and hard-working.  All boards are hard working, but it is difficult to get that special mix of people who really feel for what they are doing and how they do it.  They certainly seem to have it on the board, and the staff are no different to their board.</P>
        <P>What does one say about a charity like The Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital?  Some &euro;26 million is an incredible amount of money to have raised.  It is done by people who have had a member of their family suffer cancer or who have been sufferers themselves and have received and continue to receive wonderful treatment in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  As voluntarism is a thing of the past, credit is due to those who have raised such a huge amount of money.  Having done voluntary work for different groups and charities, I know what it is like to ask for money and hate doing it.  However, it has to be done.</P>
        <P>I refer to the reason given for the closure of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  Professor Tom Keane, rightly, has found that the hospital cannot be a stand-alone unit and that its facilities must be transferred to the specialist centre in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  The wonderful radiotherapy unit will cease to operate in 2014, when the other two units will come into play at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals.  I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Fitzgerald that there is a concern that the date of 2014 will be extended to 2015.  I do not see a real problem with this because St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospial will continue to provide a first-class service.  I agree the specialist units and multidisciplinary teams are the way to go.  Ireland had to come into the real world.  As the Minister said yesterday in the House on a completely different matter, we have men and women in the medical world at the height of their careers who are leading the country and its 4.5 million people towards the best global level of health care and that we will be able to hold our heads up.  However, there have been hiccups, which we will not deny.  With the centres in place, it is to be hoped Ireland will move on and that patients who present with cancers will be treated appropriately.  It is to be hoped also that fewer will present because there will be better screening programmes.</P>
        <P>I will speak about a parochial matter.  I reiterate that I have always supported the moving of smaller units to specialist units and have not changed my position.  I supported the transfer of breast cancer services from my own hospital in Sligo.  However, I was surprised to find that one of my colleagues had discovered under freedom of information legislation that the service in Galway might not have been ready for the transfer.  I have been informed by the cancer support group, Cancer Ireland, that the transition has been made and things are working out well.</P><Col N="859"/>
        <P>I wish those involved in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital well in the transition.  I congratulate the hospital for the wonderful service it has given the nation in the past 55 years.  I thank, in particular, its wonderful, dedicated staff, its wonderful board and the incredible Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital which, with the staff and the board, has helped patients to come out the other end.  This is wonderful to see, but it is equally important to acknowledge the wonderful comfort and solace St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital provides for those who will not be fortunate to come out the other end.  I know from talking to a person who had a family member in the hospital that it was the most wonderful place for the person concerned to end their days and find solace.</P>
        <P>I wish the Bill well and look forward to the debate on the remaining Stages.  It is lovely to see everyone singing from the same hymn sheet on legislation.  I congratulate the Department for dealing with the matter so sensitively and the Minister of State for presenting the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State.  I support the Bill, but I have a few questions to ask about it.  </P>
        <P>My colleagues and I have received an amount of correspondence on the following issue.  I am aware there has been a delay in timelines in moving from the site.  The move was due to take place in 2011.  The date was extended first to 2014 and now to 2015.  There will always be factors influencing the roll-out of any closure or change of use.  I am aware that patients will be treated in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  There will be an impact because of the closure of 65 beds in Beaumont Hospital and the moratorium on staff recruitment.</P>
        <P>I recently received an e-mail from a lovely woman:</P>
        <P LI="1">Saving St Lukes is more than the building and the lands but it is retaining the hospital as it is and even adding to what it can do, rather than winding it down. Currently patients attending St Lukes receive more than the standard care and develop what can only be called a close relationship with both the team they deal with and indeed all the staff who work in St Lukes, as opposed to attending for similar facilities in other more mainstream hospitals where patients feel they are on a conveyor belt and indeed keel over if a staff member knows their name without looking at a file!</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Surely, you have to agree, that in these darkened days patients need and deserve the light into their lives that the staff and facilities in St Lukes bring to them.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I urge you on behalf of these, and future patients, to vote against the Bill.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I can accept the concepts expressed in that e-mail.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital has been caring for cancer patients for more than 50 years.  Its website notes that it is truly &ldquo;A Haven in Rathgar&rdquo; for the thousands of patients from all over Ireland treated there each year.  A history of the hospital, with this title, was published in December 2007.  A family member of mine was treated there and was treated very well.  I am aware that when it comes to the treatment of patients, the building in which they are treated can have a big psychological effect on their ability to recover.  Sometimes not enough attention is paid to the holistic aspects of cancer treatment.  Patients employ different ways of dealing with their diagnosis.  It is the case that their personal circumstances can be helped by the way they are nursed.  The mission statement of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is linked with its surroundings; the hospital is an oasis when it seems there is chaos everywhere else in the health service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recently attended a seminar in the Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital.  I arrived very early in the morning.  As I worked as a midwife in a hospital for many years, I am very conscious of how people from outside view what is seen as normal by those working in a hospital and how they deal with people.  The environment of a hospital is very familiar to those who work in it.  They are familiar with directional signs and instructions such as the red arrow pointing to the <Col N="860"/>maternity ward, the green arrow pointing to the X-ray department and the blue line pointing somewhere else.  They try to make it easy for people, but it can only be descsribed as chaotic for those trying to identify the different roles played by staff in a hospital.  For instance, I was never comfortable looking at name tags because I always thought I should know the individuals concerned.  As I was involved in politics, everyone thought I should know them when, in fact, I was the worst person in the world for remembering people&rsquo;s names.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister of State engaged with the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital?  Have they made proposals?  I know this is departing somewhat from the topic.  It was sad to read Ms Orla Tinsley in <i>The Irish Times</i> and to hear her on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; discussing how the cystic fibrosis unit has not gone ahead and what this means for those in her situation, where being isolated is a major factor in preventing cross-infection, which has catastrophic effects on their health.  For people who have illnesses and whose immune system is bombarded by treatment such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, isolation is an important aspect of treatment.  There is nothing like a natural setting where fresh air is part of it.  My general nursing training was at Waterford Regional Hospital.  All of the wards were laid out as sanatoriums because the building used to be a sanatorium.  Every ward had four beds and full double doors on to a veranda.  When I worked in the orthopaedic unit and we had fine young lads in with broken legs because of their antics, we used to put them in the sun on the veranda.  We did not have information on putting people in the sun and letting them get fried but we did not do that, we used to do it for only a few hours.  It is important to have a good diet, fresh air, a calm environment, good music, good therapists and people with the best interests of patients and their outcomes at the top of the agenda.  I agree with specialist centres but sometimes people need to have a moment to give someone some time.  Surroundings are particularly important and the idea of an isolated garden, waterfalls and music or art therapy within the footprint of a modern hospital means that St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Rathgar, is a gem.  These factors are so important to people.</P>
        <P>An earlier contribution referred to fundraising and the &euro;26 million raised by Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  I compliment those who raise funds.  I have never passed a fundraising container for St. Luke&rsquo;s.  This was the case before I ever had a personal need for it.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is synonymous with excellent care.  One of the issues concerns the future of the site.  People would like to know the site is enshrined so that the Minister has the final say, with this taking into account the views of relatives.</P>
        <P>I refer to the rollout of colorectal screening.  I looked at the national cancer registry and saw that between 2005 and 2007, an annual average of more than 27,000 new cancers were registered.  The most common was prostate cancer, with 2,462 cases.  We spoke briefly about the heartsafe programme and people taking responsibility for their health.  All men over 40 years of age should have their PSA checked.  This is a blood test to detect prostate cancer.  We have a regular NCT for cars and people should have the same for themselves.  This should include screening programmes such as BreastCheck.  Breast cancer is the second most common at 2,335 cases and colorectal accounted for 2,156 cases.  Lung cancer accounted for 1,118 cases, which is a major amount even though it is reducing because people have more of an idea of the risk factors associated with smoking.  The risk of developing cancer is 6.6 per 1,000.  Early screening, detection and prevention is key in respect of how we treat and manage people.  We are talking about a facility that gave the very best care to people with cancer.</P>
        <P>I refer to the new radiation technology at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, which will improve survival and quality of life for cancer patients.  This was the first public hospital in Ireland to make the most advanced technology available to patients.  This provided great comfort for those who were treated and will continue to be treated at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital until the timeline for relo<Col N="861"/>cation has been finalised.  If the answers about the future use of this site can be clearly indicated, people will be happy with the outcome.  I thank the Minister of State for her attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Her speech was comprehensive and to the point.  I acknowledge the quality of speeches today.  It is an honour to speak in such a debate.  There have been some responsible and heartfelt points made by Members.  I note I am following a number of lady speakers.  Every Member who spoke heretofore has been a lady.  This demonstrates the caring nature of women and the need for women in politics.  This debate is about an older facility, into which great love, care and attention has gone.  This caring facility has thrived because of the major community effort people put into it.  The reality is that the old infirmary building is no longer up to the task of providing top-level facilities needed in the modern era in rolling forward the national cancer programme, which everyone in the House is behind.</P>
        <P>Health care should not be considered from the point of buildings alone.  Health care is about people, not about buildings.  When we talk about St. Luke&rsquo;s, I hope we are not talking about the closure of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  Not only is there a building, there is an ethos and years of history.  People have put great effort into what St. Luke&rsquo;s is today and it is essential that every effort is made to ensure those who put in the effort are accommodated and facilitated in terms of their knowledge and the work they have done so that they become part of the new service in so far as possible.</P>
        <P>We have a major problem here, with cancer increasing by 41% between 1994 and 2015.  We spoke about sunbeds recently.  When we have such debates, it is important not to talk only about cancer care but also about cancer prevention.  Good and all as St. Luke&rsquo;s, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and the new national cancer programme are, we do not want our people getting cancer.  We want to minimise the risk of cancer.  It is possible to propose measures that minimise these risks.</P>
        <P>The population is projected to increase to 4.3 million by 2015 even though there is a certain amount of emigration.  We must upgrade our facilities and ensure the HSE is as efficient as we can make it.  Any Government will contend with this problem, whether the HSE or another structure is governing health care.  It is important to have an efficient and caring system.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>My fear regarding this issue is that this Bill pertains to a system that was based to a great extent on caring and that worked with facilities that were neither the most modern nor the most up-to-date.  Although the intention is to move to a highly technical process using very good facilities, we may be losing something in terms of caring.  Caring should never be lost from the health services because it is the way in which so many people get better.  I refer to how people who may not feel cared for but who understand they are getting the best medicines would have an ability to recover much faster.  I believe Senator Fitzgerald used the word &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; and while many people do not understand the word, holistic health is highly important.  As for people being in the right frame of mind, many studies have backed up the importance of mental and emotional linkages to good physical health.</P>
        <P>Radiation therapy itself is an important treatment that is used in cancer management by 50% to 60% of patients and is successful.  It is used in the clinical management of a limited number of non-malignant medical conditions and two major types of radiation therapy exist, namely, external beam and brachytherapy.  I acknowledge that between 1960 and the 1990s, many centres were undeveloped.  However, the work of Professor Keane has been mentioned and there has been a huge initiative on the part of the Government, the body politic and the HSE to improve cancer care services.</P><Col N="862"/>
        <P>I refer to the reason there has been such an increase in the rate of cancer, which is a matter that must be examined constantly.  In some cases, it is because people, who are living longer, now live long enough to get cancer.  At the same time however, one must consider both the environment and environmental health, as well as what actually is causing cancer.  As I stated, holistic health pertains to all aspects of health and not simply to treating illness when it has developed.  It is not about allowing or even encouraging people to live unhealthy lifestyles and then trying to patch them up when unfortunately they become ill.  It should be about living as healthy a lifestyle as possible in order that one avoids the diseases in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Rathgar, which has cared for patients for more than 50 years, has a reputation for excellence of treatment and devoted care of patients that is exceptional.  The Bill before Members provides for the dissolution of the board, which then will become the responsibility of the HSE and specifically of the national cancer control programme.  It is important to note that St. Luke&rsquo;s will continue to provide specialist radiotherapy and related services at Rathgar for the next four to five years until the planned facilities at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals come on-stream fully.</P>
        <P>I welcome the significant provision in the Bill that the final decision on the long-term use of the beautiful and tranquil site will lie with the Minister and that the intention is to retain it for health purposes.  I strongly advocate its use for support services for cancer patients in the future.  I am aware that the board of the hospital and the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will present a proposal on these lines to the Minister in the near future.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the board, management and staff of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  They and their predecessors can be proud of the service and ethos they built up over the years.  All those staff will continue to contribute their expertise and service either at St. Luke&rsquo;s or at the other patients&rsquo; centres in Dublin in the future.  I also wish to acknowledge the passionate commitment of Mr. Joe Guilfoyle from County Waterford and the commitment of the patient support group led by him.  In addition, I commend the work of the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in mobilising funds and support for the hospital in every parish in Ireland.  I acknowledge the role of the current chairman, Peter Byers, and his predecessor, David O&rsquo;Halloran.  It is fitting that the new radiation oncology network in Dublin involving St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals is called the St. Luke&rsquo;s radiation oncology network.</P>
        <P>Finally, I wish to put on record that my husband, Padraic White, was the chairman of the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s for the past ten years and I commend him on his dedication and his belief in the ethos and staff of St. Luke&rsquo;s, who provided an oasis for those with cancer in Ireland.</P>

        <P>As I was walking into the Chamber to give my Second Stage speech, I met two gentlemen from my parish who are friends of mine and my family for many years.  One is a next door neighbour and the other is from the same townland.  They told me they were present to express their concerns regarding the passage of this Bill through the Seanad.  They mentioned that both of them were availing of the services at St. Luke&rsquo;s and are undergoing treatment there at present.  The decision of patients of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to come into Leinster House today demonstrates their affinity and gr&aacute; for that hospital.  They had nothing but praise for the service provided there.  This Bill provides for the discontinuation of such services for cancer patients and as such constitutes an attack upon the sick.  Therefore, my support and that of my party will not be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>The Bill principally deals with the discontinuation of services at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital for cancer.  As previously noted, more than 180,000 people have signed a petition to the D&aacute;il and Seanad appealing to Members as representatives and as the jury in this case to vote against this cruel and drastic legislation.  This Bill is little more than an attack on the sick.  One hears hear much about the Government&rsquo;s plans regarding centres of excellence.  However, although St. Luke&rsquo;s has been a centre of excellence for many years, the Government, in a cynical and cruel move, wishes to close it in the future.  Similar scenarios have arisen in my native county, in which two community hospitals, one of which also is a nursing home, are under threat of immediate closure by the HSE and the Government.  That is simply one example of what the Government is doing to health services.</P>
        <P>As I noted earlier, many people from County Donegal have a strong affinity with St. Luke&rsquo;s and either have been treated there or have had loved ones treated there.  No one to whom I have had the chance to talk has had anything but praise for the services that were made available to them while in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I make this point in respect of people from my parish who must travel for four and a half hours to get to St. Luke&rsquo;s and who understand the services that are available there.  However, they also understand that County Donegal and the north west have been completely left out of the radiation oncology plan proposed by the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE in which it is proposed that no centre of excellence will be situated north of a line from Dublin to Galway.  That is nothing short of a scandal and the decision must be revisited.</P>
        <P>Health care services across the State are in crisis.  The HSE has been exposed many times as being grossly incompetent and unfit to run a health service.  The Government tries to hide behind it, but central to the HSE&rsquo;s failure is the disastrous health policy of the Government.</P>
        <P>The experience of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is replicated around the country.  The Government wishes to downgrade or close hospitals.  It is following a policy of over-centralisation and the privatisation of services.  This policy rewards the private health care sector with land on public hospital sites and tax breaks to develop private for-profit hospitals.  At the same time the Government wishes to close long-standing, tried and trusted facilities such as those provided in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  Across the country cancer patients have been denied life-saving opportunities because successive Governments have failed to provide the radiation oncology facilities required.  The Government has had ample time and the benefit of a booming economy to plan and budget for the provision of radiotherapy centres across the country.  The State could and should have taken the lead and provided these centres as public facilities open to all on the basis of need alone.  Instead the Government committed itself to entering public private partnerships to deliver them.</P><Col N="864"/>
        <P>Very few Members are unaffected by cancer.  Withdrawing services from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is little more than an attack on people who are suffering.  This proposal made by the Government to close St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital as a cancer centre by 2014 should be opposed by everyone who believes people have a right to decent health care.  I will vote against the Bill and urge everyone who referred to the 180,000 people who had petitioned them to listen to their voices, including of those who have survived cancer and been treated in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and who are pleading with us not to pass the legislation and to reject the Bill outright.  I urge Senators to join me in doing so today.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  As other colleagues have done, I pay tribute to all the staff in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital for their enormous work, dedication and commitment to patients which are not alone evident in the treatment outcomes for patients but also in the confidence, security and comfort with which they have been able to receive treatment.  This can only have come about through the tremendous efforts made by staff in the hospital who have gone beyond the call of duty.  I give credit also to those who have supported the hospital, who have raised funding, volunteered or given of their time in other ways.  Their efforts have resulted in the provision of an outstandingly high standard of service.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the level of concern expressed at talk of a change in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital when the Bill was published.  There were concerns that this would signal the end of the hospital and the excellent service provided therein.  That is a reflection of the high regard in which the hospital is held.  It is also symptomatic of the degree of uncertainty in the face of change.  It is important that we put the matter in context.  This is about taking the next step forward in enhancing cancer services.  I have great regard for Professor Tom Keane who has led the programme that has resulted in concrete and tangible achievements.  In the years to come a greater number will survive cancer because of the steps that have been taken in the national cancer programme.  The proposed developments in the Bill represent part of the next step to enhance the level of service and increase the capacity, effectiveness and efficiency of the service.</P>
        <P>I welcome the two new radiotherapy centres at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals; the former will open at the end of this year and the latter early in 2011.  What was especially important about them opening within that timeframe was that one of the concerns expressed was that perhaps services in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital might come to an end before the new centres were opened.  That they are due to open by the end of this year and early next year and that services will continue in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital until 2014 is important in terms of service delivery.  The centres in St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals will be well served by taking the lead of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in the delivery of services.  It is important that under the Bill everyone will be brought under the umbrella of the same service in terms of co-ordination and inter-agency co-operation.  In all of the reports, whether they relate to direct service provision or general health services, one of the deficits that is constantly identified is that there is not enough inter-agency co-ordination and co-operation.  The Bill is a positive step forward in ensuring we tackle this aspect from the outset.  I pay tribute to all involved and reassure people that this is a positive step forward.  There will not be a discontinuation of services.  The Bill is about increasing and enhancing the level of service, not diminishing it.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Corrigan for sharing time with me.</P>
        <P>I have a particular interest in this issue.  I do not like to drag my good wife into the debate, but she has worked in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and the cancer centre in Belfast as a senior radiation therapist.  As such, she has a particular insight into the issues involved.  I asked her the other night whether patients from County Donegal being treated in the cancer centre in Belfast received enhanced treatment as compared to the excellent treatment they had received during the years in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  She was in absolutely no doubt that the clinical setting was critical when it came to cancer treatment and that placing a cancer treatment centre in the heart of a large hospital, with all disciplines and specialisms on-site, would undoubtedly result in better outcomes for patients.  To characterise the move as an attack on the sick is convenient sloganeering, but it is not factually correct.  That comes from my own resident expert.  I recognise the fantastic work done in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and also the fact that better practices should be pursued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  I also welcome the advances made in cancer care in recent years.  I fully support the concept of having eight centres of excellence, providing for enhanced services and with multidisciplinary teams in place.  We must have these facilities; that is what the experts say.  We have heard what Senator Dearey&rsquo;s wife said about multidisciplinary teams and the enhancement of services.  We must have such centres and they must be staffed adequately.  We must get them up and running to avoid the misdiagnoses that have occurred in many hospitals in recent years, which was an absolute scandal.</P>
        <P>There is no question but that we are going down the right path by having centres of excellence but we should not close down facilities until similar ones are put in their place.  This has been alluded to by Senator Feeney, who referred to Sligo.  Facilities were closed down in Sligo before adequate facilities were put in place in Galway.  That should not happen elsewhere.  There should be an orderly closure of facilities only after their replacement has been provided.  This is a fair suggestion.</P>
        <P>Radiation oncology and radiotherapy have been a burning issue in Waterford for many years.  The Minister of State spoke of centres of excellence in Dublin, Cork and Galway and referred to the north west.  In passing, she mentioned Waterford.  Our debate pack on the Bill also glosses over Waterford.  It states: &ldquo;In addition, the Government has also decided that in the further development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I presume the Government is fully committed to providing radiotherapy facilities in Waterford.  The deadline for provision of a number of the centres seems to have been extended in several areas for some of the disciplines.  I want the Minister of State to let me know today, or if not today fairly soon, the timeframe for provision of radiotherapy facilities in Waterford Regional Hospital in the south-east region.  At present, we are lucky there is a private hospital, the Whitfield Clinic, providing radiotherapy for patients in the south east under an arrangement between it and the HSE.  However, there is a commitment from the Government and I want to know the timeframe for the development of cancer services, especially radiotherapy services and the linear accelerators necessary at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
        <P>St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital has been a beacon of light for more than 50 years for those suffering from cancer.  Its day of downgrading is a sad day.  We have had representations on this from many people.  I have known Mr. Joe Guilfoyle, chairman of the support group, for many years.  People are angry and sorrowful to see the downgrading of such a wonderful hospital, bearing in mind the serenity and treatment it afforded to patients down through the years.  I am glad <Col N="866"/>the facility will remain open and that radiotherapy and other services will continue until 2014.  Perhaps the Minster of State will clarify this.</P>
        <P>St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital has been a haven of care, security and tranquility for people who have suffered from cancer.  Patients and their families love the hospital.  I hear this daily.  I welcome the announcement, which I hope is not just words, that the hospital and its grounds will be used for health services.  It could be used as a step-down facility for those recovering from cancer.  It could be used in many other ways.  It should not be lost to the health system.  I hope the words spoken will be honoured.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the deadline has been extended.  All the deadlines have not been met in regard to the centres of excellence.  I hope we can expedite the development of the eight regional cancer services and that they will be in place before we close down any other units.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Cummins and others in expressing regret over the downgrading of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  I acknowledge the work it has done and the care it has provided to thousands of patients who received treatment in the facility over the years.  Its work was brought home to me a couple of years ago when the eight year old son of my cousin had cancer.  He received his treatment in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  It was very convenient for the family to be able to stay just around the corner from the hospital.  Subsequently, little Luke Roche died of his illness but I know the care he and his family received in St. Luke&rsquo;s was remarkable.  The family was very happy with the way he was treated.</P>
        <P>I echo the comments of Senator Cummins on radiotherapy services for the south east.  It is a long-running political issue in the region.  The Government made commitments on the provision of public radiotherapy facilities for the region but it seems from the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments that they have drifted far down the list of priorities.  Perhaps she will clarify her statements in her concluding remarks.</P>
        <P>Part 3 deals with amendments to the nursing home legislation.  This covers a contentious issue that has been discussed many times in the House in recent months.  Supported care homes are being treated as nursing homes by HIQA in terms of the application of standards.  Will the Minister of State, when concluding, state whether a change of legislation is required to ensure these homes, which are not nursing homes, will not be covered by the HIQA standards?  This is because they were never intended to provide 24-hour nursing care for those living in them.  They are just supported care homes, mostly for single people who want sheltered accommodation towards the end of their lives.  Would a ministerial regulation be sufficient to ensure the supported care homes will not be in the same category as nursing homes according to HIQA standards.</P>
        <P>There are six supported care homes in Kilkenny.  We all acknowledge that standards are needed for them and for nursing homes, but they are not nursing homes.  When people&rsquo;s requirements are such that they need nursing home care, they leave the supported care homes to go to the public facilities in Thomastown or Castlecomer, or the private facilities available throughout the county.</P>
        <P>There is a section in the legislation that deals with nursing homes and changes to the definition of their proprietors.  The Minister of State may be able to answer my questions.  Yesterday she was present to speak on the unemployment motion.  I have been asking the Leader for a long time to invite the Minister of State to the House to talk about this issue.  It is through the efforts of a very well-known Kilkenny man, Dr. Peter Birch, who was Bishop of Ossory for several years, that much church property was handed over to local communities for the provision of supported care homes.  Dr. Birch was very much ahead of his time.  Supported care homes are not nursing homes and were never designed to be such, yet they are being penalised <Col N="867"/>as if they were under the standards of HIQA.  If applied, these standards will ultimately result in the homes&rsquo; closure.  That is why I seek a response on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their participation in this debate.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give further effect to the Government&rsquo;s cancer control strategy and, in particular, the development of radiation oncology services under the national plan for radiation oncology.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the discontinuance of the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, originally introduced in 1947.  It provides for technical amendments to the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009 and the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 to assist in their interpretation.  It also makes a technical amendment to the Health Act 2007, which relates to decisions taken under section 55 of that Act.  It makes textual amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to correct typographical errors.</P>
        <P>The incidence of cancer is continuing to rise, as figures from our national cancer registry show.  We must have the necessary radiation oncology facilities to meet requirements to ensure the best possible outcomes for cancer patients are achieved.  By the beginning of 2011 with the establishment of the St. Luke&rsquo;s network, radiation oncology services will be provided at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  The number of linear accelerators will increase from eight at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to 12 in the network.  High quality radiotherapy services will be delivered in an integrated fashion across the three Dublin sites by the network, which will report to the director of the national cancer control programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new facilities at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital will open in 2010 and those at Beaumont Hospital will open in early 2011.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will also continue to provide radiotherapy until at least 2014.  Additional funding and staffing have been provided this year to the national cancer control programme to open the services at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  Twelve beds will be available in both hospitals for radiotherapy patients.  The new facilities will ensure sufficient capacity for patients until 2015, when additional facilities and capacity will be completed under phase 2 of the national plan for radiation oncology.</P>
        <P>To answer Senators Cummins and Phelan, the Government is firmly committed to its decision under phase 2 for a radiotherapy centre in Waterford by 2015.  The HSE pays for public patients in Waterford to be treated in the local private radiotherapy clinic in Whitfield.</P>
        <P>The Hollywood report on the development of radiation oncology services noted that optimal treatment outcomes are achieved through the close co-ordination of radiation, surgical and medical oncology and palliative care services.  Effective treatment for patients will often require these treatment modalities to be combined simultaneously or at different stages during the management of illness.  Single modality radiation therapy is curative in certain situations.  However, combined modality treatment uses radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy, surgery and other treatments.  In advanced cancers and in conjunction with palliative care, palliative radiation therapy often offers quick and effective relief from pain and other difficult symptoms.  Therefore, it is essential that radiation oncology services and expertise operate side by side with surgical and medical oncology and palliative services.  The integration of these services provided at designated cancer centres under the cancer programme should result in the best outcomes for patients.</P>
        <P>During the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il, people expressed concerns about the future use of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and fears that the intention was to sell the site.  This is not the case, as St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will continue to provide radiotherapy services until at least 2014.  After that time, it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to use the site for health care purposes yet to be determined.  In answer to Senator Prendergast, the Minister has met the chair of the board a number of <Col N="868"/>times.  She will meet the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s on 8 July to hear that group&rsquo;s proposals on the hospital&rsquo;s future after 2014.  Colorectal cancer screening will commence in early 2012 and the preparatory work is under way.  Screening will be offered to all people aged between 60 and 69 years.</P>

	<P>That is welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the Minister&rsquo;s assurances on the future of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, concerns are still appearing.  Accordingly, the Minister introduced an amendment, which has since been accepted, to ensure the hospital will be used for health care purposes by the HSE, that is, health and personal social services in accordance with the Health Act 2004.  The Minister was happy to table this amendment in a bid to bring certainty to her position as outlined and to respond to the concerns expressed.</P>
        <P>The St. Luke&rsquo;s network model will provide a single clinical governance and management structure across the eastern region to deliver a service to patients in line with best international standards.  This also means a significant increase in radiotherapy capacity in the public system in Dublin and the east, with 12 instead of eight linear accelerators.  Further development under phase 2 of the national plan for radiation oncology will see capacity increase further to meet future needs.</P>
        <P>On the Bill&rsquo;s enactment, staff at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will become HSE staff and, therefore, will be able to work across the hospitals in the network under this governance structure.  The network&rsquo;s establishment and the involvement of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s staff in all three centres from the beginning will enable the new centres to reflect the successful patient-centric model that the hospital represents.</P>
        <P>I might be handling the carers matter in the Seanad next week.  If not, I would be delighted to meet Senator Phelan privately concerning the supported care home issue.  I cannot answer him now.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&ldquo;public place&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Road Traffic Act 1961;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il there was much discussion on the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  Some of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues used the scenario of a road traffic accident on private property such as a gated estate or a pub car park.  The Minister pointed out a strong definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; was contained in the 1961 Road Traffic Act which had been tested in the courts.  Considering that this Bill will also be contested at some point, my amendment seeks to give a strong legal status to the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;, as defined in the Road Traffic Act 1961, and place this section on a firmer footing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is provided for in the principal Act and the basic advice is that it does not need to be specifically referred to in this Bill.  If one starts to repeat established definitions, one can cast doubt on the established rules of statutory interpretation.  The meaning of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;, as defined in the 1961 Road Traffic Act, was amended in section 49 of the 1994 Act.  It states public place means &ldquo;any public road, and any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge&rdquo;.  The purpose of the amendment has already been achieved.  Therefore, I ask him to withdraw it.</P>

        <P>That section and these sections make clear that if caught on a bicycle or on an animal-drawn vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, one is committing an offence.  They lay out the conditions under which such an offence is deemed to be committed and the fines and imprisonment that one could face if caught committing the offence.  However, I examined Chapter 3, in particular section 9, which refers to what would happen if an accident were to occur and the obligation which would then fall on a member of the Garda to get a breath specimen.  I was unsure if the Bill covered only a mechanically propelled vehicle or whether the scope of this section would also include a cyclist who a garda suspects to be under the influence of alcohol.</P>
        <P>My amendment proposes that the definition of a vehicle should be the same as that in Part 6, which indicates that an animal-drawn vehicle or a pedal cycle is also part of the definition of a vehicle.  I am trying to make the two sections consistent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s concern is addressed in the Bill although I understand the point he is making.  He has attempted to spell out the meaning of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; to include mechanically propelled vehicles, animal drawn vehicles and pedal cyclists.  However, this definition is given in section 70(<i>c</i>).  It inserts a definition in the principal Act for a vehicle.  The word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; refers to a mechanically propelled vehicle, an animal-drawn vehicle or pedal cycle.  It is covered in the Bill.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 13, subsection (1)(iii), line 43, to delete &ldquo;the member may then require the person&rdquo;.</P>
      
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This section has been the subject of much debate during the various stages of the Bill in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and we have tried to improve it as we have gone <Col N="872"/>along.  I have tried to take on board many of the issues raised by Members in both Houses and I have made changes during the process to reflect some of the suggestions and questions raised.  I have been cognisant at all times of the legal advice offered and the drafting of this section, given its association with so many other vital provisions in the Bill.  I am especially conscious and I have been strongly advised that an oversight in this provision could undermine the entire testing regime and undo what we are all trying to achieve.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am committed to trying to endorse the underlying principle of mandatory testing at collision sites where injury is caused.  On the basis of an undertaking I gave here and outside the House, I sought further advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I trust that tabling this amendment will satisfy the requirements and satisfy the requirements of Senators and others who sought to have the section clarified as much as anything else.  It is not pretty drafting one way or the other but I am informed it had to be done in a particular way.  I thank the Senator for his amendment but I am confident from the legal advice I have received that the amendment I have proposed is the most robust way to deal with this matter.  I have received strong advice that simply deleting the words &ldquo;the member may then require the person&rdquo; means the mandatory element of section 9(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) and section 9(1)(<i>b</i>) carry through and the discretionary elements of section 9(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii), relating to a parking offence or minor scrape, also carry through.  This is the most effective way I can make it mandatory.  I confirm that it is mandatory with regard to the serious concerns people have raised in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 10 is in the name of the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole.  It seeks to address the issues to which the Minister had referred.  Both amendments approach the issue somewhat differently but I am satisfied.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment seems to address the issue and deals with it.  It seems the reference in section 9(1)(<i>b</i>) to &ldquo;require&rdquo; carries through to cover the situation in section 9(1)(iii).  I would be interested to hear Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s view on this but it seems to address this and on that basis I am satisfied to accept the Minister&rsquo;s position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to the operation of the Bill once the Minister&rsquo;s amendment is accepted.  If a garda conducts a roadside test but does not have an appliance available and he or she gets the appliance within one hour, then the mandatory element remains in force and there is no choice for the garda but to breathalyse the person.  Is it mandatory in the same way as if the appliance was available to the garda from the start?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is exactly what it means.  It is mandatory and not a choice on the part of the garda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Given what the Minister has said, I welcome his amendment because this was the subject of much discussion from all parties in the D&aacute;il.  The amendment will go some way towards strengthening the Bill and I thank the Minister for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  I am not 100% clear why the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; could not be substituted with &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but I understand from the Minister&rsquo;s comments that deleting the words will make it mandatory anyway and there are no ifs, buts, maybes or grey areas.  The result is that at the scene of an accident, those in possession of a vehicle will be required to blow into the apparatus or other items referred to in the legislation and I welcome this measure.</P>
        <P>I realise the campaign group, headed by someone from my county, has been very energetic and has argued this point for many years.  The measure will be welcomed by the group and <Col N="873"/>others involved and generally throughout the State.  As a result of this Government amendment there will be mandatory testing at the scene of collisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their welcome for the amendment.  This is our third or fourth attempt at drafting it and it will make testing mandatory.  It meets the requirement we have and it does not jeopardise any other aspects of the Bill.  I thank Members again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>In the additional drafting and agreement of the final text of the Government amendment, did the Minister have any opportunity to consult the PARC road safety group with regard to the amendment?  Is the group satisfied with the wording in the legislation?  The Department and the Minister have met the group&rsquo;s representatives on several occasions.  Has he discussed the Government&rsquo;s proposed wording with them?  If so, are they satisfied with it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not had direct discussion about the proposed amendment.  I had a brief conversation with members of PARC, who are in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery, on Tuesday evening and I undertook to strengthen this aspect of the Bill.  On this Stage, my concentration had to be on tabling the amendment and the only consultation I could engage in was with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to be sure about what we are trying to do.  I hope if any of the drafters are listening, they will not take umbrage but it is not an elegant section and, as a lay person, I probably would have divided this into two distinct sections.  However, the intent is clear and it meets the requirements.</P>

	<P>We have been conscious at all times in going through the legislative process how litigated such legislation is.  We have tried to tidy it up and tighten it as much as we can.  These amendments do not change in any significant way the provisions of the sections affected but the Attorney General&rsquo;s office is of the strong view that it is better to remain consistent with wording that has been tried and tested in the courts over time.  Accordingly, they present, hopefully, in a clearer and unambiguous manner the objectives of the section, which is to provide for the option of supplying a urine sample instead of a doctor or a nurse taking a blood specimen in a hospital.  It also removes the provision in these sections relating to carrying out medical examinations for the purpose of obtaining evidence.  However, the medical examinations provision will be provided for more appropriately under section 24.</P>

	<P>Section 6 provides that a person shall not drive or attempt to drive an animal drawn vehicle or a pedal cycle while under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control and penalties are stipulated for that offence.  However, the requirement in legislation to undergo a breath test other than a preliminary test at the roadside or to provide specimens of blood or urine applies only to those found in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant.  The reference to section 6 in regard to the testing of specimen and evidential matters in sections 17 to 22, inclusive, is, therefore, unnecessary.  We are deleting those references to tidy up the Bill.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is that the case?  Earlier in the Bill, it is stated it is an offence to drive an animal drawn vehicle or ride a bicycle if one is under the influence of alcohol.  If that is an offence, why is the legislation not consistent?  Why can a breath sample not be taken from somebody on a bicycle who is involved in a crash?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how this arises but the evidence from the breath test on the side of the road is sufficient in court to convict somebody of being in charge of a non-mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence.  Urine samples and so on do not need to be taken whereas when someone is using a mechanically propelled vehicle, the Garda must go the scientific route and bring people into the station.  When I read the section first, I was a little bemused but I am advised one can convict on the basis of the breathalyser for the non-mechanically propelled vehicles while one must follow the scientific test for mechanically propelled vehicles.  Presumably, it arises because the number of incidents involving non-mechanically propelled vehicles is negligible.</P>

	<P>This matter was raised by Senator Donohoe and others.  The amendment clarifies that a member of the Garda may require a person to undergo a medical examination at a Garda station or the hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is it necessary to specify a location where the medical examination will be carried out?  If an accident takes place, for example, and a doctor or paramedic is summoned to the scene of the accident, will he or she not be in a position to carry out the examination near the scene of the accident?  What do we gain in specifying where the examination will take place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the arguments made regarding what might or might not be happening at the scene of an accident was that people were going off and signing themselves into hospital and so forth.  We are seeking to capture this.  A garda can require a person to undergo a medical examination.  If there is an accident, he or she can do the testing.  In the amendment we are trying to ensure it is specific that the medical examination can occur at the Garda station if the person is not badly hurt, but if he or she is, it can be done at the hospital also.  There is no bar to the medical examination taking place at the hospital.  The amendment is making it explicit.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 27, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) The Bureau may&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) arrange for the testing of&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="4">(i) apparatus for indicating the presence of drugs, and</P>
        <P LI="4">(ii) apparatus for determining the concentration of drugs on drivers, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) give such assistance as it thinks proper to persons carrying out or intending to carry out research referred to in <i>subsection (3)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the powers of the bureau.  The Minister referred in the D&aacute;il and on Second Stage in this House to his reluctance to extend the scope of the Bill to include drugs owing to the difficulties involved in terms of how one should test in Ireland for the presence of drugs, for climate reasons, and the need for research to be carried out to clarify the level of drugs at which somebody is incapable of or should not be driving a vehicle.  Given these questions, the amendment would give the bureau the ability to carry out research in this regard to <Col N="881"/>answer the questions that must be answered.  That would enable us at some point in the future to ensure people would not be killed or injured on our roads owing to the presence of drugs in their system or in the system of the person controlling a vehicle.  The amendment would enable the bureau to do the work required to facilitate future legislation in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for tabling the amendment.  However, it is not necessary because the bureau already has the legislative authority to procure and arrange for the testing of apparatus to indicate the presence and concentration of drugs.  It is not necessary to include it in this legislation.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s concern about drugs in the bloodstream and intoxicants generally.  I said here on Second Stage and on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il that we are pursuing this issue as vigorously as possible.  There are no devices available currently that will lead to the roadside detection of drugs in the bloodstream.  There are some in operation in other areas of the world but apart from anything else they are not suitable for the atmospheric conditions across Europe.</P>
        <P>The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is very involved in the research on prototypes and so on being done at a European level and Ireland is at the forefront of research in this area and as part of the European movement.  I am aware there is a great deal of commitment across Europe, and from talking to colleagues at Transport Council meetings also, to try to move forward this issue as quickly as possible.  As soon as a suitable roadside testing device becomes available, it will be introduced.</P>
        <P>What the Senator seeks in the amendment can be done already.  Should we make a breakthrough in this area over any period we will have sufficient time to introduce legislation to allow these devices to be used because the experience, even with the intoxilysers, the EBTs and so on that we have, indicates that a full 12 or 18 months of testing, retesting and so on must be carried out.  I assure the Senator, first, that what he intends in the amendment is already available to the medical bureau and, second, if the research being carried out here or in Europe is successful, we will have sufficient time to put the legislation in place to make sure we can operate such devices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for that answer.  The gist of what he said is that an amendment like this one is not necessary because the medical bureau already has the power to do this in the future but if that is the case, why is subsection (4) necessary, which grants the power to the medical bureau to do that work with apparatus that would indicate the presence of alcohol?  If the power is already in the Bill in regard to testing for the presence of drugs, why is it necessary to have this subsection giving power in respect of testing for the presence of alcohol?  If the power is already in the Bill for testing for drugs, I would have assumed it was available for testing for alcohol as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The subsection to which the Senator refers specifically relates to alcohol.  If I read the Senator&rsquo;s amendment correctly, it says the bureau may arrange for testing of apparatus to indicate the presence of drugs, apparatus to determine the concentration of drugs in drivers and to give assistance as it thinks proper.  The bureau already has the powers to do that kind of research but the subsection we are discussing is on the functions the bureau has in regard to alcohol.  It is not quite the same thing.  It has the power to do what the Senator seeks.  When we are providing for the functions of the bureau we have to specify that in legislation to avoid litigation in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not sure I understand that.  If the power already exists and this amendment is not necessary to allow the bureau do the work on apparatus for testing for drugs, I cannot understand the reason this subsection is necessary to give it the ability to do it <Col N="882"/>on apparatus for testing for alcohol.  The logic would be that if this subsection is necessary for apparatus for alcohol, it would also have to be necessary for apparatus for drugs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be when we get a particular device but what we are doing in this section is restating the legislation as it stands.  We currently have no devices in regard to drugs other than those for testing for alcohol.  This section is restating the legislation as it stands.  It does not preclude the bureau from doing what the Senator seeks in his amendment and when a device is found that will lead to the roadside testing of drugs, it will be appropriate at that stage to insert a provision in the Bill specific to the kind of device we have.  We know what we need in regard to testing for alcohol.  We do not yet know in regard to testing for drugs.  We are restating what is already there.  I assure the Senator that it will have the power to do what he wants it to do in this regard.  When we get the device in place, we will then probably have to specify in legislation the testing and so on that they will have to do and the procedures they will have to follow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be foresighted of the Minister to accept my amendment for all the reasons he has just outlined.  The Minister said that when an apparatus is found, the legislation will be brought in but why not include a broad provision in the Bill?  In that way when the apparatus is found, the testing can start immediately without having to bring in legislation to allow the bureau to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>If I attempted to include this amendment I am sure I would be advised that it is not good practice to insert general legislative measures in anticipation of something that might happen in the future.  I remind the Senator of the discussion we had on the SOLAS convention on using a breathalyser on ships and so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>While that debate was taking place, the strong legal advice was that we should wait until we knew what we had to do and that we should not waste time trying to draft provisions in anticipation of something that might happen.  We should wait until we know what is happening and then tailor the legislation accordingly.  The same principle applies here.  We should wait until we know that we have a device and when we have it, we can tailor the legislation to suit the device.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to think my approach would save time dealing with this matter in the future but I have a sense that, having made my argument, I will not get any further with it.</P>

	<P>These amendments relate to fixed charge notices and the serving of these notices in respect of road traffic offences.  Section 35, particularly subsection (3), provides for the manner in which a notice may be served.  This procedure is also reflected in section 29 where a notice is served in respect of drink-driving offences.</P>
        <P>The amendments do not alter the integrity of the relevant subsections, as passed by the D&aacute;il, but simply adjust the layout of the wording in order to enhance the comprehension of the provision, as well as providing for consistency in wording across related sections.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have two questions.  What does the phrase &ldquo;in the case of personal service&rdquo; mean at the start of amendment No. 39?  In the Bill  reference is made to the role traffic wardens or traffic officials could play.  Would it be wise to change the amendment to read, &ldquo;the person gave to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a traffic warden or traffic official&rdquo;, in order that if the address of the person was to be obtained by another representative of the State, this amendment would apply also?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="884"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the indulgence of the Senator, as I missed his second question.  To reply to his first question, there is a personal service, as opposed to a postal service, in cases where somebody calls to a person&rsquo;s door and hands the notice to him or her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  It is mentioned in the Bill that if a member of the Garda obains the address, the address he or she receives is then valid in terms of the notice being delivered, either in person or by post, to a person&rsquo;s home.  There is a reference in the Bill to the role and the powers of traffic wardens and transport officials.  Would it be possible to widen the amendment to make it read &ldquo;the person gave to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the traffic warden or the transport official&rdquo; in order that the amendment would cover off all of the persons involved in serving notice to somebody?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for the amendment is that there are some offences, in respect of which only garda&iacute; can serve notices and they are referred to in this section.  The ones to which the Senator refers are mentioned later in the Bill and apply to traffic wardens generally.  The reason the amendment is so specific is that it is garda&iacute; who must serve the notices relating to the offences referred to.</P>

On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il Deputy McEntee proposed that under section 29(5) the period of eligibility be reduced from five years to three.  I accepted that proposal and the House agreed to the amendment.  A subsequent examination of the Bill indicated that two related amendments required to be made, to section 29(6) and section 32(1)(a)(3), to make them consistent with the D&aacute;il amendment.

	<P>I do not have information on the total numbers of traffic wardens, as they operate within the direct remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In most of the large cities there are traffic wardens.  Most local authorities employ a small number, particularly in urban areas.  On the question of a change in the law, the normal procedure is that once legislation is in place, the local authority, the employer in this case, makes the information available to traffic wardens and offers whatever training is necessary.</P>

	<P>The amendment deletes the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; and substitutes &ldquo;learner permit&rdquo;.  Does the same amendment apply to earlier parts of the section?  For example, line 15 reads, &ldquo;where a person refuses or fails to produce the licence...&rdquo;.  Should this read, &ldquo;learner permit&rdquo; or &ldquo;licence or learner permit&rdquo;?  I will expand on the point to help the Minister.  I had understood up to this point that the term &ldquo;driving licence&rdquo; also included a &ldquo;learner permit&rdquo; because I had assumed a learner permit was a form of driving licence.  Government amendment No. 53 proposes to delete the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;learner permit&rdquo;.  If this is right on line 22, should it also apply to earlier parts of the section?</P>

	<P>This amendment has been with the Office of the Attorney General and I will have to take a leap of faith in assuming there is a reason.  It is not an unreasonable point that the Senator is raising in this regard and I am trying to determine if there is a particular reason the substitution should take place.  The amendment refers to the production of a driving licence in response to a demand from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is an indication that the person driving the vehicle or accompanying the holder of a learner permit, if he or she is asked to produce a licence, must produce it.  If the person refuses or fails to produce a licence there and then, he or she is committing an offence.  However, as I said, I will have to take a leap of faith.  If there is time between Committee and Report Stages, I will try to have the matter clarified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be worth checking because if the definition of driving licence definitely includes a learner permit, it would mean there would be no need for the amendment.  If it does not include a learner permit, it definitely should include such a reference, in which case the section would need further amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A learner permit is not a driving licence.  We made that change a couple of years&rsquo; ago.  There is a distinction between the two.  A person does not receive a driving licence until he or she has held a learner permit for six months and passed the driving test.  We will clarify the point between now and Report Stage.  What I said has been confirmed by my officials.  In the first part of the section a garda is looking for a driving licence, while the second part applies if the person concerned has a learner permit.  That is why we are amending it in this way.  If we have a few minutes between Committee and Report Stages, I will confirm it for the Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment proposes to introduce a new section to give effect to certain provisions in section 65 prior to its commencement.  Section 65 repeals section 26 and section 49(2) of the 1994 Act, the Road Traffic Act 1995 and section 6 of the 2006 Act.  It restates the provisions of section 26, on consequential disqualification orders, in order to reflect the intoxicated driving provisions of the Bill and provide for the range of penalties associated with reduced blood alcohol concentration levels and associated levels in breath and urine.  It also provides for the substitution of the Second Schedule to the principal Act which sets out the offences under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2009 involving consequential disqualification orders.</P>
        <P>Section 65, however, cannot be commenced until the appropriate evidential breath testing instruments are in place to allow for implementation of the lower drink-driving limits introduced by the Bill.  Accordingly, the new section is being introduced to allow the commencement of provisions relating to consequential disqualification orders associated with careless and dangerous driving.  It is vital that these disqualification orders can be applied with immediate effect on enactment of the Bill, given the nature of the offences involved.  The new section will subsequently be repealed on the commencement of subsection 65(1).</P>
        <P>There was much discussion in the D&aacute;il on the early commencement of various sections of the Bill when Opposition Deputies urged me to proceed with commencement orders in the shortest possible timeframe.  This provision will assist me by allowing the gradual commencement of certain elements, rather than waiting until all aspects of section 65 are ready to be commenced.  Deputy Broughan tabled a number of amendments to ensure sections of the Bill would commence and we are accommodating his wishes.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment refers to section 54 which lays out material in respect of driving a dangerously defective vehicle.  Section 54(4) states it can be a defence for the defendant to show that he was an employee obeying the express orders of the owner of the vehicle.  The amendment proposes the deletion of this subsection.  It seems risky to say a dangerously defective vehicle is the complete responsibility of the owner of the vehicle rather than the driver.</P>
        <P>Some responsibility must sit with a driver who gets into a vehicle that patently is unsafe or dangerous in that he or she has a responsibility to state the vehicle in question is not roadworthy and should not be driven.  I also wonder whether a perverse consequence of this subsection might be to create cover for the presence of dangerous vehicles on the roads if the driver of the vehicle is different from the person or business that owns the vehicle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I can see the Deputy&rsquo;s point in this regard and I acknowledge that ultimately, this is a matter of balance.  However, the effect of the proposed amendment would be to exonerate completely the owners of a vehicle and to place all the blame on the person who was driving it even if he or she genuinely had no knowledge that the vehicle was defective.  It could happen that a defect in a vehicle may not be evident or that the defective parts of a vehicle may not be visible to a driver.  The intention of this provision is to ensure that a driver who was forced or asked to drive a vehicle and who was genuinely unaware of defects has a defence.  If this arises, the option still is available to the Garda or to other agencies to prosecute the owner.  If a driver is prosecuted, goes to court and uses this defence that either he was forced to drive, as the Senator suggested in the earlier part of his comments, or drove it unknowingly, the prosecution can take place of the owner, that is the employer.  This is an attempt to maintain balance in this regard.</P>
        <P>I do not believe this provision contains anything that would allow a person knowingly to take such a vehicle out on the road.  If it is obvious that a vehicle is defective, dangerous or whatever and if it can be proven that its driver knowingly took it out on the road, such a case can be won.  However, this provision is an attempt to strike a balance between the areas of responsibility between owners and drivers.  The effect of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment would remove the owners from the picture entirely, which is not what he seeks to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 68, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister on his strenuous efforts to improve road safety in many ways, not least the manner in which he successfully has ensured that the roll-out of the national development plan to improve the main interurban routes has enabled them to achieve the standard of motorways.  This is greatly to be welcomed and the improvement of road quality probably constitutes one of the greatest single contributions to road safety.</P>
        <P>Section 68 deals with inconsiderate, careless and dangerous driving.  Despite the improvements to the interurban connections, most of the roads on which one travels in Ireland are single carriageways on which the practice of inconsiderate driving remains common.  I refer, for example, to those who drive at 50 km/h, 60 km/h or 70 km/h in area with a speed limit of 100 km/h, thereby sometimes causing a build-up of 20 to 30 cars behind them.  Apart from anything else, this is highly dangerous.  I raised this point with a predecessor of the Minister who told me that within legislation, there is scope for the Garda to prosecute people who show such a lack of consideration towards other road users.  However, I have only encountered one prosecution in this regard, which pertained to a case involving a garda who came across someone driving a tractor in County Mayo and who brought the driver to court.</P><Col N="894"/>
        <P>More needs to be done in this regard.  From a road safety perspective, it is important to have people driving within the speed limit.  In this regard, despite the Minister&rsquo;s best efforts thus far, I note many speed limits still are artificially low.  Some qualitative evaluation should be carried out in this regard, particularly before the roll-out of the private sector cameras.  There is a risk of the law coming into disrepute as a consequence of people being caught in certain areas that one can identify on any road one travels.  For example, the Stillorgan dual carriageway is a three lane carriageway on parts of which a 60 km/h limit applies.  One will find the Garda operating in such areas, which obviously will maximise the number of prosecutions or the number of people caught.  While this may look well in the statistics, it will do nothing for creating a culture of acceptance or adherence to the laws.  These are not the most dangerous spots in the world and a similar situation also obtains in the Lucan area.  Although all Members could cite locations at which the Garda does this, it does nothing to induce people to adhere to the laws.</P>
        <P>As for the issue under discussion, I seek the introduction on a legislative basis of a requirement on a motorist who is driving at a certain percentage below the speed limit, be it 10%, 15% or 20%, to find the first opportunity to pull in to allow traffic to pass.  This is not happening and the inconsiderate part is not being enforced by the Garda.  Consequently, the legislation must be specific.  While the Minister obviously cannot address this issue in this Bill, I ask him to consider it.  It could form part of changing the culture towards one in which people comply with all aspects of the legislation.  The Minister has been striving fairly energetically to achieve a change of culture in driving from the perspective of protecting people on the roads.  All Members would aspire to and support this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his contribution and I agree with him.  However, it is only fair to acknowledge again that behaviour has changed considerably on the roads.  While such change has pertained to the larger issues such as speeding, drinking and so on, I also have formed the impression that drivers here are becoming a little more courteous and civilised in their behaviour on the roads.  If I may be parochial, one great example of this that no longer pertains because of the opening of the M3 took place at the Black Bull, which is the junction at which the Trim Road meets the Navan Road.  For years, a build-up of traffic took place there and a convention grew up whereby every second car got out of the side road and one also could go down to the Fairyhouse Road.  While such a degree of civility obtained, the Senator&rsquo;s point is true.  Such behaviour, in which slow-moving vehicles on rural roads hold up or back up traffic, is both inconsiderate and dangerous because ultimately someone will become impatient and will take off in an attempt to get by, thereby causing an accident.  I take the Senator&rsquo;s point in this regard and I intend to raise this matter with the Garda as well.</P>
        <P>Regarding speed limits, the Senator has a good point.  This point is included in the road safety strategy.  My Department has set a target for itself to produce guidelines on speed limits for local authorities, which have responsibility for local and regional roads, before the end of this year.  More importantly, we then intend to have a regular audit of a selection of counties over a period to ensure speed limits are appropriate in different places.</P>
        <P>I refer to safety cameras the roll-out of which will commence on 6 October.  We had a road safety meeting yesterday at which that was confirmed for me once again.  The cameras will be rolled out and put into 600 different areas around the country where there is a history of fatal accidents.  They will be well signposted.  People will know that somewhere along a particular stretch of road between point A and point B there could be or will be a camera.  As far as I am concerned there is no excuse for anyone who gets caught as there will be plenty of warning.  We are not trying to catch people.  We are trying to get it into people&rsquo;s heads that they should <Col N="895"/>not speed.  The Department of Finance might not like me saying this, but I hope nobody is caught by the speed cameras.  That will cause a bit of a problem because we have to pay for the cameras.  However, the aim is to get people to realise the areas are dangerous.  Some parts of the country are worse than others for serious accidents and road deaths.  There seems to be a culture of speeding in rural areas.  There is a serious problem close to the Border where more accidents take place on rural roads than anywhere else.  Some counties are not great in that respect.  That is the way we are rolling out the speed cameras.</P>
        <P>I do not have the statistics to hand for Senator Walsh.  I saw the Garda on the overbridge in Blanchardstown on the way to work a couple of mornings ago.  Four or five people gave out to me about that.  I do not know why they give out to me because of the Garda being on the Stillorgan triple carriageway as it is now.  I do not have statistics to hand but I got them at one stage and the vast majority of speed detection is not on those roads.  A significant proportion is on regional roads, some of the old national primary routes.  I know it annoys people to see the speed checks.  I accept the point Senator Walsh is making, that those roads are not as dangerous as local roads but the shooting fish in a barrel analogy is somewhat exaggerated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response on those two issues.  The fixed cameras are to be rolled out by the private sector.  Will the private sector also be involved in patrols involving mobile cameras?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The private sector firm will be largely involved in the use of fixed cameras.  They will move them from place to place.  They will not be in the same 600 locations at any one time but they are not mobile in the sense that GATSO vans are.  The Garda has approximately 120 such vehicles, some marked and others that are unmarked.  They will continue to do the more general patrolling.  The cameras are designed for dangerous places.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>On the point raised by Senator Walsh, there are certain locations in the country where the shooting fish in a barrel analogy is appropriate.  GATSO vans are continually set up on certain roads within 100 m of the change of speed where someone has a clear view.  That is wrong.  If the Garda to do that, people should at least be given a warning rather than having to rely on local radio stations to warn them.</P>

	<P>Section 78 covers persons using mechanically propelled vehicles while section 79 covers pedal cyclists.  What about extending the same power to the Garda to deal with persons using animal-drawn vehicles?  I accept the number of possible incidents could be quite small but animal-drawn vehicles are very common in parts of my constituency.  The power available under the Bill to demand the name and address of pedal cyclists should also be made available to demand the name and address of someone in charge of an animal-drawn vehicle.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a discussion on a Government amendment in respect of which I asked about the distinction between a learner permit and a driving licence.  I want an answer at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have checked this and Senator Ryan&rsquo;s interpretation was correct.  The first subsection relates to the provision to allow for the demanding of the driving licence.  For example, if a garda stops a car with no learner plates, he or she may demand a licence from the driver.  If the driver fails to produce the licence, perhaps because he is a learner, subsection (2) applies.  This is the subsection to which we refer.  Subsection (1) also allows for the demanding of a licence from the driver who may be accompanying the learner driver.  The inclusion of the learner permit has been knitted into the existing legislation.  Subsection (2) was necessary to expand on those provisions relating to learner permits.  Subsection (2), line 22, should read &ldquo;learner permit&rdquo;.  The first subsection refers to driving licences whereas the second refers to learner permits.</P>

I have said before it is not often that people get the opportunity to do something that will save lives and reduce injuries.  We are nearly at the final hurdle with this Bill.  I understand the amendments that have been made today will be discussed and finalised in the D&aacute;il next week, after which the Bill will pass.

I hope the activists in the area of road safety, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, will be satisfied.  I believe they will be.  There will be relief on the passage of the Bill.</P><Col N="898"/>
        <P>With regard to the number of Government amendments, I am quite confused as to whether I should congratulate the draftsmen and officials on the issues they addressed in those amendments or be critical of them for not seeing these issues in the first place.  We will take a positive view on it on this occasion.  I wish the legislation well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on getting this Bill through the House.  It has been contentious in some ways but we are all aware of the need for road safety and the protection of people on the roads.  It deals with some anomalies that have existed for years, and that is important.</P>
        <P>Now that the Bill has passed, I hope people will be satisfied with it and that the number of road deaths will continue to drop.  That is all any of us worries about.  The Road Safety Authority has been very effective.  Sometimes credit is not given for the investment made in national and regional roads, thus preventing serious accidents.  We now note with horror and sadness that most deaths on the roads are at weekends.  I include single-vehicle accidents, which are worrying and annoying because they may not all be related to road traffic offences or road conditions.  I congratulate the Minister on the passage of the Bill.  I hope he will have as easy a run when he returns with it to the D&aacute;il next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate Senator Ellis&rsquo;s remarks.  The legislation will save lives.  It is very satisfying to be passing it.  The number of lives that will be saved is the great unknown.  People will never realise that it saves lives but the reality is that the legislation will not only affect how people are caught and prosecuted but will also change people&rsquo;s actions and the manner in which they plan their weekends and lifestyles.  I hope that as younger people get older, they will realise drink driving should never be engaged in.  I thank the Minister for his amendments and for listening to us.  I hope the Bill passes through the D&aacute;il speedily.  I wish the Minister the best of luck with it.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be in attendance to introduce the European Financial Stability Facility Bill.  I acknowledge the constructive approach taken by Deputies in the D&aacute;il last week and I welcome the statements of support from the main Opposition parties.</P>
        <P>The proposed legislation will enable Ireland to join with its colleague euro area member states in the implementation of the European financial stability facility, the main purpose of which is to safeguard financial stability in the euro area further.  The facility is a contingent &euro;440 billion financial support instrument that will be able to provide loans to euro area member states that are unable to access funding on international markets due to exceptional circumstances beyond their control.  Ireland&rsquo;s main obligation under the facility will be to provide guarantees up to a ceiling of just over &euro;7 billion, if required, in respect of the repayment of funds raised by the facility to provide loans to such states.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the stability facility is a logical follow through of the steps that the EU and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, took in response to the recent Greek funding difficulties.  The Heads of State and Government of the euro area made commitments in February and March to take determined and co-ordinated action, if required, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  On foot of these commitments, the euro area finance ministers agreed in April the terms of the financial support to be given to Greece.  In this respect, the euro area loan facility was established to provide loans of up to &euro;80 billion to Greece over a three-year period.  In conjunction with this, the IMF agreed to provide up to &euro;30 billion, making a total of &euro;110 billion available for lending to Greece.  Ireland&rsquo;s share is approximately &euro;1.5 billion, based on our European Central Bank, ECB, paid capital, and legislation was enacted in May giving effect to our participation.  The measures put in place ensure that Greece will not need to rely on the sovereign debt markets for the next three years, thus giving it the necessary breathing space to rectify its public finances.  However, I emphasise that the loan facility has considerable policy conditionality.</P>
        <P>At the time, it was recognised that developing and implementing bespoke instruments each time a member state faced difficulties was not a sustainable or prudent approach.  Accordingly, the European Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, decided at an extraordinary meeting on 9 May to establish a comprehensive package of measures &mdash; the European stabilisation mechanism &mdash; to support financially member states in difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond their control.  The measures would be of sufficient magnitude to address future potential needs.  Including an IMF contribution, the package will provide up to &euro;750 billion in financial support to eurozone member states, if required.</P>
        <P>This package has three distinct elements.  The first is the establishment of the European financial stabilisation mechanism under which up to &euro;60 billion may be borrowed by the European Commission and loaned to member states, subject to strict conditions on budgetary consolidation.  The Council regulation establishing the stabilisation mechanism was adopted by the Council on 10 May.  The stabilisation will be the instrument of first resort should a euro area member state seek assistance.</P>
        <P>The second element is the &euro;440 billion European financial stability facility, which is the subject of this Bill.  It will be governed by the intergovernmental framework agreement between the euro area member states and the special purpose vehicle company that will be used to implement the facility.  The Minister for Finance signed the framework agreement on behalf of <Col N="900"/>Ireland on 10 June, subject to the enactment of the Bill.  The agreement is included in the Schedule to the Bill.  While the facility is independent of the EU budget, the EU Commission will play a key role in its operation.  There is also provision for important functions to be carried out by the European Investment Bank, EIB, and the ECB.</P>
        <P>The third element is the assistance the IMF can provide to member states under its existing standby arrangements.  It is estimated this amounts to an aggregate &euro;250 billion.  The IMF has stated that, upon request in individual countries&rsquo; cases, it is ready to provide financial assistance to its European members in conjunction with the new European financial stabilisation mechanism and the European financial stability facility.  This would be on a similar basis to the assistance the IMF has agreed to provide to Greece in conjunction with the euro area loan facility.  In overall terms, an aggregate amount of the order of &euro;750 billion is being put in place to provide support for euro area member states.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s direct financial implications for Ireland relate to the subscription of capital for the company that will operate the facility.  The State has already committed to contributing its 1.59% share of the currently issued share capital of &euro;31,000, amounting to approximately &euro;490.  In addition to the issued share capital, there is an unissued but authorised share capital of &euro;30 million.  Calling up further capital from the authorised share capital requires a unanimous decision by the board of directors and each shareholder is represented by a director.  The provisions relating to this and other matters are all set out in the company&rsquo;s articles of association, which have been laid before the Oireachtas.  Were the entire authorised share capital called up, Ireland&rsquo;s share would be just under &euro;478,000.  However, this will be reduced slightly following the accession of Estonia to the euro next January.</P>
        <P>The key obligation of the State under the framework agreement is to provide guarantees to the European financial stability facility company to enable it to raise money to provide loans to euro area member states.  It is only if a guarantee is called that the State will need to fund its share of the guarantee in question.</P>
        <P>The framework agreement sets out the contribution key which dictates how much of each funding instrument the State will guarantee.  This will vary in each case, as I shall explain when I set out the main articles of the agreement.  Under the agreement, Ireland&rsquo;s guarantee ceiling is just over &euro;7 billion.  In the highly unlikely event that a guarantee is called, this will not mean Ireland will never see its money again.  The European Financial Stability Facility Company remains liable for funds paid under any guarantee and will endeavour to secure repayment of an underlying loan in default with a view to returning such funds to guarantors as soon as possible.  In such an event, it is likely that a lengthy period would elapse before losses, if any, could be quantified.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to permit Ireland to work together with its fellow euro area member states to ensure the overall financial stability of the euro area.  The Bill will allow Ireland to issue guarantees in accordance with the European financial stability facility framework agreement and provide for payments to be made from the Central Fund in respect of any obligations arising under the agreement, subject to a maximum ceiling of &euro;7.5 billion.  The Bill is straightforward legislation because member states&rsquo; obligations are spelled out in detail in the agreement which is a Schedule to the Bill.  After I have explained each of the sections of the Bill, I will explain the key articles of the agreement.</P>
        <P>Section 1 defines the company which will implement the instrument on behalf of the euro area member states and the European financial stability facility framework agreement.  Section 2 provides that the Minister for Finance may issue guarantees on behalf of the State for the purposes of the framework agreement.  Section 3 provides that money may be paid from the <Col N="901"/>Central Fund to meet the obligations of the State arising from the agreement up to a maximum sum of &euro;7.5 billion.  There is an obligation to subscribe to the capital and other costs of the company and additional obligations could arise if a guarantee is called.  Section 4 provides that any money received by the State is to be paid into the Central Fund.</P>
        <P>Section 5 deals with the reporting obligations.  The Minister must ensure a report is laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as soon as practical after 31 December this year and every six months thereafter.  There is provision for more frequent reporting from time to time, if considered necessary.  The report must include information on outstanding guarantees, moneys advanced by the State and money repaid to it under the framework agreement.</P>
        <P>Section 6 amends the reporting requirements of the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010.  The amendment to the earlier legislation providing for assistance for Greece takes on board the views expressed during the passage of the legislation for more frequent reporting.  It also makes the reporting requirements consistent with the reporting requirements of this Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 7 is a standard section on the expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill.  Section 8 sets out the Short Title.</P>
        <P>The Schedule to the Bill contains the European financial stability facility framework agreement which begins by stipulating the parties to the agreement.  These consist of the euro area member states and the European Financial Stability Facility Company.  This is followed by a preamble which outlines the origins of the facility and explains its purpose.</P>
        <P>As the framework agreement is a lengthy and detailed document, I will highlight some of the key points.  Article 1 covers the entry into force provisions for the facility.  Essentially, the obligation to issue guarantees only becomes operational when member states, comprising 90% of the guarantee commitments, have submitted their commitment confirmations.</P>
        <P>Article 2 covers the granting of loans, funding instruments, the issuance of guarantees and generally sets out how the facility will operate.  It provides that a euro area member state seeking financial assistance must agree a memorandum of understanding with the European Commission in liaison with the IMF and the ECB which sets out the budgetary and economic policy conditions, with which the borrower will have to comply in order to receive financial assistance.</P>
        <P>Detailed terms and conditions will be set out in a loan facility agreement between the company and the member state in question, subject to the approval of all guarantors.  The company will be responsible for raising the money it requires to advance the loans to borrowers and establishing the terms, on which it issues or enters into funding instruments.  The interest rate to be charged to a borrower will cover the company&rsquo;s cost of funding, plus a margin to provide remuneration for the guarantors.  Guarantors will be required to issue irrevocable and unconditional guarantees in respect of funding instruments issued or entered into under the agreement.  The amount of each member state&rsquo;s guarantee is based on its contribution key to the capital of the ECB, multiplied by 120% of the value of the principal, interest and any other amounts due under a particular funding instrument.  Each guarantor&rsquo;s total potential exposure is limited, as set out in Annex 1, to its share of ECB capital among the existing 16 euro area member states.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the limit is &euro;7.002 billion.  The issuing of guarantees is limited to funding instruments related to loan facility agreements entered into on or before 30 June 2013.  It is worth noting, however, that individual loan tranches may be issued after that date.</P>
        <P>Article 3 covers the preparation and authorisation of loan disbursements.  The strong conditionality of any country programme is emphasised by the requirement that the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, must present a report to the euro group on the compliance of the borrower with the terms and conditions of the memorandum of understanding before each <Col N="902"/>disbursement of a loan, apart from the initial disbursement.  The guarantors will evaluate the report and unanimously decide whether to permit the disbursement.</P>
        <P>Article 4 covers the issuance of or entry into funding instruments.  In particular, the company is required to fund the loans it makes by the issuance of or entry into funding instruments on a matched funding basis, if market conditions permit it.  It also requires the payment dates for loans to be 14 business days before scheduled payment dates for funding instruments.  If matched funding is not possible, the company may, with the unanimous approval of the guarantors, pursue a diversified funding strategy.  In this regard, there is provision for the company to delegate responsibility for its management to one or more debt management agencies of euro area member states or other institutions.</P>
        <P>Article 5 provides for credit enhancement, liquidity and treasury matters.  Credit enhancement is seen as extremely important because such measures are designed to help secure the highest possible ratings from the credit rating agencies with obvious benefits for the rates at which the company can raise funding.  The first element of credit enhancement is that each guarantee issued by a member state will be for 120% of its actual share of the amount being guaranteed.  This will be of great comfort to holders of funding instruments issued by the company because it builds in redundancy and allows for the extremely hard to imagine scenario that one of the guarantors will fail to honour a call on a guarantee.</P>
        <P>The second element is that the money raised by the company from the 50 basis point service fees and the up-front payment of the net present value of the margin of each loan it issues will be held in a cash reserve to form a cash buffer.  Should the company ever issue any loans, the cash reserve will quickly reach a substantial size, thereby boosting the resources of the company.  The cash reserve is available to cover shortfalls in payments to holders of funding instruments and will only be distributed back to guarantors when the company has fulfilled its purpose and been dissolved.  It has to be invested in high quality liquid debt instruments.  The company will, in the event of a delay or failure to pay by a borrower, first make a demand on the guarantee from each guarantor.  If this does not cover the due payment on the funding instrument, the cash reserve can be used.</P>
        <P>Article 6 covers claims under a guarantee.  If the company does not receive a scheduled payment under a loan, it will call in the guarantees from the relevant guarantors.  It will also, if necessary, draw on the cash reserve.  Once a guarantee has been paid, the company will be liable to reimburse each guarantor, subject to the extent of the funds actually received from the underlying borrowers in respect of the relevant loans.</P>
        <P>Article 7 covers the contribution between guarantors.  If a guarantee is called to meet a scheduled payment and, owing to non-payment by one or more of the other guarantors, a guarantor ends up paying more than its required proportion, that is, its share of the guarantee in question before it is increased to 120%, after three business days that guarantor will be entitled to an indemnity from each of the other guarantors for the excess it has paid, plus interest at the rate of one month EURIBOR, plus 500 basis points.</P>
        <P>Article 8 deals with calculations and adjustments of the guarantees.  I have explained that a prospective borrower can make a request to be excused from having to provide further guarantees.  If this is accepted unanimously, it becomes a stepping out guarantor and the contribution key in Annex 2 for the remaining guarantors will be adjusted accordingly.  For example, the article specifically provides that Greece is to be treated as a stepping out guarantor from the start.  As a consequence, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution rate to guarantees of 1.59% in Annex 2, as it stands, will increase to 1.64%.  On that basis, under the agreement, Ireland&rsquo;s exposure in respect of its overall guarantees remains at just over &euro;7 billion.</P><Col N="903"/>
        <P>Article 9 outlines the procedures to be followed by the company if it becomes aware of breaches of conditions by a borrower or the need for amendments to a loan facility agreement.   Article 10 deals with the company, inter-guarantor decisions, directors and governance.  It provides each shareholder, that is each euro-area member state, is entitled to be represented by a director, specifically its representative on the euro-group working group which typically is the relevant economic and financial committee member.</P>
        <P>Each director&rsquo;s voting weight will correspond to the number of shares held by his country.  The article identifies what decisions guarantors must take on an unanimous basis.  These include decisions on the granting of loan-facility agreements, the disbursement of loans, various modifications of loan-facility agreements, stepping-out guarantors, significant changes to the credit enhancement structure and the funding strategy of each European financial stability facility, EFSF, programme or any increase in the aggregate amount of guarantees that might be issued under the framework agreement.</P>
        <P>Corporate matters of the company that require unanimity include the call-up of capital, the employment of the chief executive officer, approving the accounts and any changes to the company&rsquo;s articles of association, a copy of which has been laid before the House.</P>
        <P>The definition of the EFSF framework agreement includes amendments to it.  That has been included for the good reason that there will be some technical amendments to the agreement from time to time; it would be a gross misuse of resources to have to prepare amending legislation each time.  For instance, this definition would accommodate the accession of Estonia to the euro and the consequential amendments that would have to be made to the agreement under Article 13(7).</P>
        <P>The most significant change that can be made to the agreement would be an increase in the overall ceiling of &euro;440 billion.  Under section 3, the maximum amount the Central Fund can pay out is &euro;7.5 billion.  I am seeking some leeway over the current maximum exposure of &euro;7.002 billion to allow for an emergency increase in the agreement&rsquo;s ceiling of &euro;440 billion, potentially when the House is not sitting.  The leeway could permit agreement to an increase of around &euro;28 billion over the current &euro;440 billion ceiling without requiring further legislative amendment and, as such, I believe is appropriate.  However, any increase above that level will require an amendment to the legislation before we could agree to it.</P>
        <P>Article 11 deals with the duration and the liquidation of the company.  It will remain in existence until 30 June 2013 as a minimum and be liquidated as soon as any loans advanced by it have been repaid and all its liabilities to holders of its funding instruments have been discharged.  If no loan-facility agreements are in place on or before 30 June 2013, then the company will be dissolved immediately.  On its liquidation, liabilities, if any, may be divided among the shareholders and any assets, after the cash reserve has been distributed, will be distributed to shareholders.</P>
        <P>Article 12 covers the appointment of the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank to fulfil various financial functions.  Article 13 covers the administrative provisions.  These include the use of resources, reporting, the transfer and disposal of shares and amendment of the agreement in the event of the accession of a new member state to the euro.</P>
        <P>Annex 1 sets out the list of guarantor member states and their respective guarantee commitments.  Annex 2 sets out the contribution key for each member state.</P>
        <P>The EFSF is an essential contingency measure.  As Senators will be aware, other broad-ranging measures are also being considered at EU level with a view, <i>inter alia</i>, to improving the economic governance of the euro-area and the related arrangements for budgetary surveillance.</P><Col N="904"/>
        <P>In this latter regard, the European Commission yesterday issued a further communication on reinforcing economic policy co-ordination.  To this end, a task force has been established by the European Council President, Mr. Van Rompuy, on which Ireland is represented by the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding what has been implied in some media reports, Ireland has nothing to fear and everything to gain from this important process which is likely, if anything, to enhance the role of national parliaments in these matters.  In these difficult economic times, our membership of the euro has been and continues to be of critical importance to the economy.  We must, therefore, play our part in defending the currency, not only because of the principles of solidarity and responsibility that come with our membership of the euro, but because safeguarding financial stability of the euro-area is vital to our own economic recovery and future success.  This is the Bill&rsquo;s purpose.</P>
        <P>I have outlined the legislation&rsquo;s full, and possible financial implications.  This is important legislation for Ireland and for our partners in Europe.  I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this important legislation.  A commentator on the euro crisis wrote it was Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, who observed how a lever can let a single man move the world.  The commentator then asked how could difficulties in the Greek economy, worth less than 2% of the total eurozone income, nearly overwhelm the entire eurozone economy and prompt the need for this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Several reasons behind these events give us an understanding as to why this legislation is required.  Before the economic crisis, there were certain subjects in national and global economies that were out of bounds for discussion.  Criticising our country&rsquo;s economic performance during the Celtic tiger or Irish banking practices was out of bounds and sometimes deemed unpatriotic.  This narrowed the parameters in which we were evaluating how the economy was performing and those economic forces outside of our control.</P>
        <P>Another factor to take into account is the incredible amount of economic integration that has taken place in Europe in the past decade.  What happens in the Greek economy or the Irish banking system can suddenly be very important to other European banks and larger economies across Europe.</P>
        <P>In the eurozone, we have monetary union with the same central bank and currency but not fiscal union.  National economies maintain the same currency with the same interest rates set by the European Central Bank while making their own spending and taxation decisions without any co-ordination across national boundaries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Stability and Growth Pact was put in place to ensure the problems in one national economy did not cause problems for the rest of its eurozone neighbours.  Between 2000 and 2007, Greece was in breach of the pact&rsquo;s rule that its deficit on public expenditure over revenue could not be over 3% of its gross domestic product in any year.  Economic growth, however, at the same time was slipping.  The European average between 1981 and 1993 was 2.25%.  Between 1993 and 2003, it slipped to 2% and now the outlook forecast is 1%.  At a time when the economic growth was desperately needed to cope with the debt levels in Europe and those we now find in Ireland, we find such growth is not there.  This measure, although important, is one of a suite of broader measures introduced and acknowledged by the Minister of State.  We have already seen put in place a bilateral aid plan for Greece, the stabilisation fund, which is under discussion today, and another measure of great importance, although we are unsure of the extent of its importance, that is, the role the European Central Bank is now playing in supporting Government bonds in secondary markets.  The week before this agreement was put in place <Col N="905"/>it became apparent that many European governments were facing great difficulty in financing national debts.  The European Central Bank is not allowed to play a role in primary bond markets under the terms of the treaty which created it.  However, it is allowed to play a role in bond market roll-overs and it is doing so at the moment.  The IMF, International Monetary Fund, plays a role in dealing with the difficulties faced by some national economies as well.  It is setting out the terms under which a country may access funding.  All of these measures would have been unthinkable one year ago and beyond the imagination of many two years ago.  This is happening now because, for a period, the European banking system and bond markets, upon which we all desperately depend, faced profound difficulty.  These measures were prompted because of the difficulties we all faced.  For a long time, to discuss these difficulties was viewed as not the right thing to do.  It was deemed unconventional.  I have no doubt that, as a result, some of the difficulties which we now must face and manage have been increased or made worse.</P>
        <P>In that spirit, I will raise several concerns about this Bill and the direction in which we are going.  Notwithstanding that, my party supports the Bill because there appears to be little choice at the moment with regard to how we are going to manage these difficulties in the short term and since there is not much choice, these Bills must be supported.  However, broader concerns exist which we must begin to consider now and upon which we must act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I firmly believe there is an absolute obsession with evaluating all the difficulties we face in exclusively budgetary terms.  I was struck by a survey carried out last week by <i>The Economist</i>.  It examined the consequences of the vast amount of debt with which companies, individuals and Governments must deal.  The report concluded with the fact that the only historically proven strategy to allow economies to deal with such issues has been a relentless focus on generating economic growth.  When such growth takes place, it delivers the buoyancy which allows the debt level to come down.  As a result of the difficulty in which we find ourselves, such a level of focus is not in place.  There is not sufficient focus on asking what we can do to generate employment and growth rather than simply asking what we can just do to deal with the budgetary difficulties we face.</P>
        <P>In discussions on the Bill there is occasional reference to the unthinkable and I will refer to the unthinkable on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State referred to &ldquo;the unlikely event that a guarantee is called upon&rdquo;.  Such phraseology appears again and again.  However, the financial markets do not believe such events are unlikely at the moment.  They believe several economies, thankfully not our own, at some point in the future will face the need to restructure their debt and will find themselves in a position where their debt and the plans to deal with it are not realistic and will not work.  Most of that concern relates to Greece at the moment.  However, until recently, other economies were included within that horizon of concern.  It is important to discuss these unlikely events more, not because we hope they will materialise &mdash; nothing could be further from the truth &mdash; but if they do, we can ensure the measures are in place to avert the unthinkable from happening.</P>
        <P>This leads me to what I believe to be the greatest weakness with the package and the plan laid out in the Bill.  It refers to the conditions upon which economies will be able to access funding from the new fund but it does not refer to what such conditions will be or what would happen if those conditions were breached.  It suggests a role for the IMF in laying out a plan for national economies to follow but it does not go into the detail of what that plan would comprise or what would happen were than plan to be breached.  This point is vital because it relates to the one question hanging over the future of the eurozone, that is, at what point so called fiscally strong countries, such as Germany, will tire of supporting other countries which have not run their national finances in the same order.  My great concern is that we cannot expect the solidarity which has been the driving force of the European Union political project <Col N="906"/>to be there forever with regard to economic matters.  It is important that as legislation is introduced and reviewed by countries we must ask such questions and question what might happen.  If we ask such questions we will produce better plans and strategies to avert the unthinkable from happening.</P>
        <P>The Bill and its measures are driven by a consideration of this point, which is the reason we support it.  However, greater questions are at stake regarding the extent of the focus on European economic growth overall, on how a new stability and growth pact will work and on the conditions required of countries to access the fund.  I have a dreadful feeling these will be the great questions to dominate our economy and others in the years to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the European Financial Stability Facility Bill 2010.  I have no intention of going back over the causes of our economic crisis again.  There have been countless opportunities in recent months to make a variety of points in the House.  We are where we are.  For the most part, we fully realise why we are in the position in which we find ourselves.  Some mistakes were made but it is clear from the actions taken, especially by this Government, in the European context, that we have learned from any mistakes made and we are taking the appropriate measures with our European partners to deal with them.</P>
        <P>I refer to the purpose of the Bill, which the Minister of State has outlined in extraordinary detail.  It enables the Government to participate in the proposed system of financial stabilisation along with other members of the eurozone.  The three stabilisation features include the European financial stabilisation mechanism, under which &euro;60 billion may be borrowed by the EU Commission and loaned to member states; the European financial stability facility, the purpose of this Bill, which is a &euro;440 billion facility; and the assistance the IMF can provide, which is in the region of &euro;250 billion.  As the Minister of State noted, this was decided in May.  Under the Bill, Ireland will contribute <i>pro rata</i> to the &euro;440 billion eurozone special purpose vehicle, available to member states under strict terms of conditionality.  I fully accept that we would all prefer clarification on what conditions are likely to be included.  As Senator Donohoe remarked, perhaps we can tease out these conditions further to get an indication of the relevant conditions, which will have to be very robust, on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State noted, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the SPV, special purpose vehicle, will not exceed &euro;7.5 billion and the IMF will also provide an additional &euro;250 billion.  The Bill is in addition to and distinct from the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010 which committed the Government to participating in &euro;80 billion of support to Greece.  The Minister of State went through this in some detail.</P>
        <P>Why is it needed?  We are all clear on why it is needed.  The Minister for Finance stated in the House that to develop and implement bespoke instruments each time a member state faced difficulties is not a sustainable or prudent approach.  Although I am not a finance graduate, I believe that in unison with all the measures being introduced we should apply basic common sense to what has been going on.  I am not at all confident that on a Europe-wide basis the necessary regulatory reform will be introduced in the financial services industry.  I would like more regulation to be introduced in Europe.  Ireland has begun a process to deal with that but I am not comfortable that is the case throughout Europe and I hope the Minister of State will use the opportunities that arise to pursue that issue.</P>
        <P>The facility will be governed by the intergovernmental framework agreement between member states and the special purpose vehicle, SPV, which will be used to implement the facility.  The SPV will raise money on the markets using government backed credit guarantees and will last for approximately three years.  The financial implications for Ireland mean the <Col N="907"/>Government will provide &euro;7 billion.  The new financial stability facility company remains liable for funds paid under any guarantee and will endeavour to secure payment of any underlying loan and default with a view to returning such funds to guarantors.</P>
        <P>The commentary on the proposal has been interesting.  Dominque Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the IMF, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I strongly welcome the far-reaching steps unveiled today by the European Union and the European Central Bank (ECB) to restore confidence and financial stability in the euro area. These are strong measures that will help to secure global economic and financial stability, and preserve the global economic recovery.  Implementation of actions to put public finances on a sustainable footing is key to restoring economic health in Europe.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The chief economist of Citibank said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The creation of the European Stabilisation Mechanism (ESM) and the accompanying announcements of the ECB have...eliminated the prospect of sovereign liquidity crises turning into sovereign solvency crises and the prospect of major EA [euro area]/EU bank failures due to EA sovereign exposure.  They have also reduced the risk of the fiscally stronger and more competitive EA members leaving the currency union.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am more interested in the issues raised by Senator Donohoe, which can be teased out on Committee Stage but I was taken by the comments of Arthur Beesley, financial correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the face of relentless market pressure, euro zone finance ministers have taken key steps to avert any repeat of the fiscal meltdown in Greece with a deal on the final shape of their &euro;440 billion guarantee fund for distressed single currency members...This is the state of play. When not fighting fires, the European authorities are trying to rebuild the house. It ain&rsquo;t easy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That captures where we are.  This facility is another cog in a wheel that will need continued attention.  We have much work to do in the regulatory area.  I do not have confidence that other European governments will take the necessary measures, which have been taken here.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on that for Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in two minds about this Bill because I was struck by Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s comment that the Opposition parties support this because they have no choice in this matter.  We are in such an extraordinarily difficult situation that not to be part of this rescue operation would leave us vulnerable.  There are two ways of looking at this and the Minister of State looks at it mainly from one angle rather than the other.  One either looks at it as either the guarantor or the guaranteed.  In this we are guarantor and guaranteed.  As guarantor, it does not make much sense for us to be guarantor of any more debts.  We have guaranteed many debts recently, including domestic debts.  How much money has the State guaranteed at this stage?  What is the total amount of the guarantee?  I include all the semi-State guarantees given by the Minister and the implied guarantees.  I gather the debt owed by, for instance, the DAA is not officially guaranteed by the State but, in effect, if it went belly up, which is quite a possibility, the State would have to fork out the &euro;1 billion owed by the authority.  Plenty of other semi-State bodies are in this position where the State has either implicitly or explicitly given guarantees.</P>
        <P>I worry when the Minister of State says, apropos of nothing, that the Government will guarantee another large sum of &euro;7 billion in this case on top of what we guaranteed to Greece.  I worry when this is done in a cavalier fashion how much we are on the line for, particularly as there was a certain complacency in the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that the amount is <Col N="908"/>guaranteed and no money is being called on.  That is absolutely true at the moment but guarantees are there for only one reason, which is to be called on.  We must consider the scenario where this money will be called on and how we would cope with it.  Given the amount involved and the money guaranteed for Anglo Irish Bank and others, we would find it difficult to pay.  I am not sure this makes great sense for us, therefore, as guarantors.</P>
        <P>As the guaranteed, we are getting a pretty good deal.  The reason we are in this fund is that we are pretty much next in line.  The facility was introduced in the wake of an attack on the euro and on the Greek economy by speculators and this is a challenge to them.  Their immediate response was not to be impressed and I am doubtful whether by forming a shadow fund such as this the speculators will be put off and frightened away.  There has been no resurgence in the euro and there has been no leap in confidence in Greek debt since this fund was formed.  The opposite has happened and it has junk bond status now.  I suspect the reason for this is the markets for whom we must have respect, whether or not we like them, have given a verdict that the only way to strengthen the currency and revive confidence in the Greek economy is by getting our house in order.  It is not by setting up big funds that are just a challenge to the speculators.  This is not that big a fund to speculators if they get going against it.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State says states are unable to access funding on international markets due to exceptional circumstances beyond their control, he is not right.  In almost all circumstances, the nations in trouble have dug holes for themselves.  It is certainly true in the case of Greece, which, as Senator Donohoe correctly pointed out, breached the Growth and Stability Pact seven or eight years in a row and it is certainly true in our own case.  To keep peddling the myth that we are in a mess that we did not create ourselves or we are facing a temporary crisis that we did not create ourselves is just not right.  We will need this facility because we ran up the large deficit and allowed the banks to go absolutely bananas and we have run the economy into the mess it finds itself.  If we go knocking on the door of this fund looking for money, we will not be able to plead that it is a matter beyond our control.  It is a matter for which we are directly responsible.</P>
        <P>As guarantors, the facility does not make sense but we are pretty wise to be involved because we are likely to need it next and it is there for nations like us.  The <i>Financial Times</i> quoted the bond margins over Germany today.  Greece must pay 8% more; Portugal, 3.4%; Ireland, 3%; and Spain, which is in the dock at the moment, must only pay 2.11% more.  The markets are saying that, if any country is going to call upon the fund, first it will be Portugal and then Ireland.  We are, therefore, reasonably sensible to be involved.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the issue of budgets being submitted to the European Commission.  This is an extension of the Europeanisation and globalisation of the discipline being imposed upon us.  On reflection, I welcome this.  With one or two exceptions, the nations of Europe have proved that they are not running their economies responsibly.  The danger is not so much that the European Commission will expel Greece, that Greece will default and leaving the euro or that Ireland will do the same, but that Germany which will finance the fund we are discussing will decide that it is fed up and will not fund it further.  Every other country is breaching the terms of the Growth and Stability Pact and making it absolutely irrelevant in a way and to an extent that Germany is not doing.  Germany could decide that the political pressures are too much.  We saw the result of the election in Germany recently when the bailout of Greece was being contemplated and about to be agreed.  The ruling party got a drubbing in the polls.  Germany could state it will not expel a country from the euro, that there is no mechanism to do so, but could decide to pull out of it itself.  That would be catastrophic.</P>
        <P>It is reasonable, therefore, for the European Commission and other European nations, led by Germany and France, to wag their fingers at us, point out that we have proved that we are <Col N="909"/>not prepared to abide by the rules and ask to see our budget in advance, or at least the budget parameters, to be approved.  We are asking them to bail us out.  A bailout has not yet happened &mdash; these are just guarantees, although they are serious matters &mdash; but being bailed out means that somebody must do it and that the bailout is conditional.  It is conditional, unfortunately, upon the most powerful nation or person doing the bailing out, which in this case happens to be Germany.  We should, very reluctantly, say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the Bill, not as great Europeans and pretending we are doing our duty as great Europeans, but out of pure self-interest because we are likely to be next or second in line.</P>
        <P>We should not be starry-eyed about the prospects of a sum of &euro;750 billion somehow deterring the speculators.  That type of figure presents a challenge to them and they will ride roughshod over it, if we do not get the economy in order.  That said, we should point out &mdash; this is the appropriate Bill in which to do so &mdash; that the Minister for Finance has done a great deal to convince overseas markets, although not enough, as they are wobbling again, that there is a determination on the part of the Government to bridge the deficit.  We should give credit for the fact that &mdash; I do not know how it has happened &mdash; the budget measures introduced have been reasonably successfully implemented without too much difficulty and trouble and with great skill.  The message has certainly got across to those who needed to hear it, particularly the trade unions, that we are in a situation where we require their co-operation, not their undermining.  It is fair to say the public service unions have behaved in a reasonable way and that is an acknowledgement I do not give easily.  Ireland has been fairly successful in achieving the objectives it has set, even if they do not go far enough.  There are great difficulties to come in the budget in December.  However, we must be part of this fund because this might be the next country to call on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill, the second legislative measure to emerge following the recent meetings of the Council of Finance Ministers and the European Council, is the response to the crisis engendered by the instability in the Greek national finances.  This measure seems to have gained the most confidence.  I accept what Senator Ross said about the current instability in international markets, the flaws in the euro as a currency because it is a transnational currency, the fact that fiscal policy is not a uniting instrument among all its members and the fact that the criteria that were meant to over-ride the existence of the currency are not in balance as regards national debt and the proportion of GDP.  The Senator spoke about Ireland being in the same ball park, at least in terms of market lending rates, as Spain and Portugal.  That is due to the undeniable fact that our budget deficit remains the highest in the eurozone and the European Union.  However, it is also undeniable that our overall level of borrowing, despite issues such as the banking crisis, is still within an average ball park and in a far better position than that of countries in greater difficulties such as Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy.</P>
        <P>At a recent European Green Party seminar in Brussels I had an argument with the Italian delegate as to which of our countries had the greater fiscal problem.  Recent figures for Italy&rsquo;s national debt show it to be &euro;1.8 trillion, proportionately far higher than ours.  Consider the general angst and media commentary that attended the special emergency budget of the new British Government which provides for an adjustment of &pound;6 billion sterling on a national debt of &pound;894 billion, given that this country started a &euro;4 billion adjustment process last year, with a figure of &euro;3 billion next year and &euro;3 billion the following year, in a series of adjustments to 2015.  It can honestly be said we have made the difficult decisions and are prepared to address the imbalance &mdash; we can argue about how that happened &mdash; in the quickest time possible.  It is also not debatable, although I suspect others will make it a debating point, that in addressing the need to get out of the difficulty as quickly as possible, one must front-load such decisions.  That is the situation in which the Government found itself.  Nevertheless, the decision to establish a stability facility fund is a good one for the future of the euro.  It asks short-term and <Col N="910"/>medium-term questions on how the stability can be strengthened further.  There will be pressures about a common fiscal policy and questions about whether the criteria in terms of the money supply can and should be relaxed more and whether the ruling set at the beginning, at the behest of the Germans, on maintaining the rate of inflation at around 2% is a good one.  Could a relaxation to a rate of 3% or 4% be one of the instruments we should use to help ourselves get out of the difficulties?  These are debates that must take place at Council of Ministers level and we must wait to see what will transpire.</P>
        <P>I suspect the inclination will be one to serve the euro currency well, that is, to remain cautious, conservative and effect as little change as possible.  We are well served by having Jean-Claude Trichet, the person leading the European Central Bank, making such decisions.</P>
     
        <P>We must realise also that the tolerance the European Central Bank has shown in recent years may not always exist, and we are seeing signs of that now.  In recent weeks alone there have been question marks over the way that might affect lending to banks, and inter-bank lending.  That in itself might have a retarding effect.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Given the release of the CSO figures yesterday and the recent IMF report we should be thinking more on the positive rather than the negative side.  We are getting the balance right but what we should not do is create an expectation.  I say that knowing there is a wider political context where expectations are purposefully dampened in Opposition and put in the most negative light possible, but the indicators are that at least things are going in the right direction.  They will move slowly but that slow movement and growth is probably to our betterment as a society and economy because we have seen the effect of quick-fix fast movements in economic growth in the past.  We were not able to handle it.  It was not to our betterment.  If we are to learn from the mistakes of the past we should claim more of the approach we have seen from Jean-Claude Trichet and the European Central Bank and introduce as many instruments like this European Financial Stability Facility Bill as we can.</P>
        <P>Gaps remain, however, and some of those gaps may not be able to be filled because of the inconsistency of the euro as a currency.  The euro is currently weak, and some seem concerned about that, but a weak euro is to our benefit as a nation and if we are to have export-led growth, the current position is not detrimental to us.</P>
        <P>There are other international factors, however, such as the way the Chinese put out economic statistics about themselves that are now being questioned and the valuation of the Chinese currency against the dollar, which will have a knock-on effect in terms of the current links with the dollar, sterling and the euro.  The indications, however, are that because a speculation game is afoot against particular members of the eurozone that will keep the euro in a relatively weakened state.  As long as we can avoid default of any of the members, any of the members coming out of the eurozone or any worsening position in the individual countries, we will be well positioned to make use of these and other instruments for the improvements and growth our economy needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to the contributions of colleagues, the note hit in the first instance by Senator Donohoe and repeated by others and which comes across in the debate is the sense of inevitability and unavoidability in regard to this measure.  The Minister of State described it in his contribution as a logical follow-through of the steps the European Union and the IMF took in response to the Greek crisis.  He is right to describe it as logical but it is also inevitable.  It literally flows from it.  It is an essential requirement of that policy decision that this type of fund be put in place.</P>
        <P>Unlike some of the other financial debates we have had, and I include the debate we had almost two years ago on the guarantee where as we know from Professor Honohan&rsquo;s report <Col N="911"/>there were other options, and we can argue about the effectiveness or lack thereof of different options available to the Government, there was at least a possibility that we could have a debate, but unfortunately in this debate whereas it is important for us to tease out as best we can what the Government is proposing and to have the Minister set out the basis and rationale for this measure as he has fairly done, we are left in circumstances where there is no choice but to support this measure.  I will be supporting it.  I do not want to sound mealy-mouthed in the sense that is the only reason I believe it is necessary to express solidarity through a mechanism such as this one.  Having said it is inevitable and that there is no choice, it is extremely important that this measure be put in place and passed.</P>
        <P>It is true that we may end up having to avail of the fund at some point in the future.  I very much hope that will not be the case but no one can avoid being concerned when we examine the European league table in respect of the countries that are at greater risk than others.  It may be true that an &ldquo;I&rdquo; was taken out of the PIIGS at some point in terms of some of the international commentary, and Ireland is no longer coupled in the first instance with Greece, Portugal and Spain, but we are not that far off.  Any reasonable observer or participant in this discussion would have to see that we are in the frame in terms of a future risk but because we are, relatively speaking, such a small economy may be one of the reasons Doomsday does not arrive for us.  There are many things to criticise the Government for, and I am not making this as some sort of debating point in this instance to take from this proposal because I believe this proposal should be adopted and passed.</P>
        <P>People spoke about Greece in this discussion and we had this debate previously when the specific measures were being introduced in regard to Greece, the Stability and Growth Pact and the mechanism in place since the Maastricht treaty and some of the other related treaties.  It is true that Greece was not in compliance with the 3% rule but it was not the only country not in compliance with it.  If my memory serves me correctly, some of the larger countries were in default in that respect.  I recall a controversy five or six years ago in regard to that.  That tells us, in terms of sheer logic, that it cannot simply be the failure to be in compliance with the 3% rule that got Greece to where it is now.  There must be other factors.  It cannot be the only factor.</P>
        <P>For lengthy periods we were in compliance with the 3% rule but we find ourselves in a difficult position notwithstanding that.  Admittedly, many, if not a large proportion, of our difficulties are self-inflicted but, regrettably, staying within the 3% rule did not save us from them.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned here on the previous occasion we had this debate, profound consideration will be necessary on how we harmonise economic policy across the eurozone in circumstances where we have a single currency.  We have one piece of the jigsaw in regard to our currency but so many other economic policies would inevitably require to be harmonised if that system was to hold true in the future.  I look forward to that debate emerging in the coming months, not just in this House and in this country but across the European Union.  It is necessary that should occur because the 3% requirement is essentially a dead letter now.  We may aspire to returning to some sort of test of that kind but as we understand it, it seems to me to be a dead letter.</P>
        <P>I am interested also in the conditionality of these measures, which was touched on by a number of colleagues.  In other words, where a country applies for support from the fund it has been signalled or stated in Article 2 of the framework agreement that there would be requirements for budgetary and economic policy to be managed in a particular way.  We are all familiar with that from previous decades in regard to the IMF and the notion that if a country borrowed from, was funded or backed by the IMF it would dictate basic essential economic policy to a <Col N="912"/>country dependent upon it.  We are considering the same issue here.  What would be the nature of the requirements that would be dictated to a country were it ever to require assistance from the fund?  We should at least consider that or have some sense as to whether there has been much debate at European level on the nature and extent of those kinds of requirements.  The Minister of State might comment on that when replying.  It is all very well for people to say that if a country gets the money it must do something in return such as slash and cut and so on.  I understand the basic <i>quid pro quo</i> point people are making but we must not lose sight of the impact of those kinds of requirements on citizens.  These are political choices that ultimately must be made in a country.  When did we have this debate about sovereignty?  There was a bit of a phoney debate a few weeks ago when the Leader of the Opposition made some point, perhaps an ill-guarded remark, about loss of sovereignty and then, somewhat inevitably, he was hopped on by Government spokespersons and told that he was being a Eurosceptic or whatever.  Certainly, the way the remarks were couched was a little unfortunate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To have an intelligent assessment of what is happening here, those of us who support the European project still believe there should be a high measure of economic sovereignty and decision-making available to decision makers and politicians, those who are elected by the citizens of a country.  In the choices we make, for example, about how much money we want to invest in the health service, education, child care or whatever, we want to be able to make these decisions in our own country.  It is not a Eurosceptic or Neanderthal position to state that we want to hold on to those decisions.  We need to understand and be able to assess to what extent there is a risk that such decisions about those vital choices would be ceded from our own jurisdiction.  It is not an unreasonable issue to raise.  These are essential political questions where we should be sure that we understand what the risk would be if we, or Greece or some of our other partner countries, could no longer take them or have that measure of control and sovereignty over our own economic well-being.  That touches on the debate here on economic policy, and we will be back here on many occasions in the autumn dealing with these issues in the run-up to the budget.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle made a point that there was a major debate in Britain about its budget and he used this phrase, that we had got the balance right, by which I am not really quite sure what he means.  On public services, when a country must make an adjustment, as we debated last year, what is the balance as between cuts in services or revenue measures such as taxation increases?  These are central political questions.  When one cuts public services, whether in Ireland, Britain or Greece, it has been demonstrated repeatedly that it has a disproportionate effect on the less well-off, the poorer in society who are more vulnerable.  Right up the chain, among the lower paid right across the board, when one cuts public services it has a disproportionate effect.  No doubt that is what is causing the emerging political tensions in Greece and in Spain.  Ultimately, that is what is occurring.  There is no point in us standing here talking about financial measures in billions of euro unless we remember that we are talking about individuals and families who work to earn a living.  They have aspirations for their future, to which they are entitled, and which, by the way, I say to Senator Ross, are mediated through trade unions.  I have no difficulty with that.  People organised in trade unions are entitled to do that and are entitled to organise to defend their interests.  That is where this debate is at.  That, it seems to me, is where the fault lines are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister of State outlined clearly how it works.  Senator Ross put his finger on it when he stated that it is certainly a good idea that we should be involved in this support for the European currency.</P><Col N="913"/>
        <P>The European Community has been playing catch-up since the eurozone was set up.  There were no facilities within the eurozone to protect the euro at any stage.  This is an effort, and it is only an effort.  In fact, it is a small effort to address how we will run our budgetary measures and the entire European system without having oversight of budgets throughout the European Community, how tightly those will be run, and whether we have the figures to produce that we work within a certain system.</P>
        <P>I hope we will be able to meet the demands Europe will probably set for us over the coming years.  That will be important.  If there is security in the eurozone by way of the stabilisation fund which will now be put in place in each country, we will be able to take part in that and support each other.  That is the idea of the Community, where we work together.</P>
        <P>We have taken extraordinary measures in the past three budgets, and Europe has seen that we are prepared to deal with our  budgetary strategies.  On that basis, I believe we will be able to look after our sovereignty because it is important, as Senator White stated, to ensure that we have good health services and good public services.</P>
        <P>We will be a little more demanding on our public service, the health services and the various services that we run.  There are approximately 350,000 presently employed in the health services, in the public service and in all the various services that we need so badly and they provide such a good service to us, but even the unions have realised that nobody owes us a living any more and we must meet budgetary constraints.  We saw in the Croke Park agreement where commonsense prevailed.  Why did we not have the same uproar as the Greeks, Italians or whoever?  Commonsense again prevailed.  We have a well-educated sensible people here who could see that what needed to be done was important.  All they needed was the leadership to do it and the Government has shown leadership in that regard, and it is important to say that.  There is far more to do in terms of the EU situation.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind that figures published yesterday contained a mixed message.  There was 2.7% growth in GDP in the quarter and then there was a very bad message on the live register.  We had a fine quarter in exports, with growth of 6.9%.  The aspect of those figures that encouraged me was the 2% increase in imports because that will stimulate the economy in the goods and services market.  It will take time to start to see the growth come in the economy.</P>
        <P>Europe has a part to play in that and it must introduce various stimulus packages for European development.  No later than last week President Obama stated that it was important that Europe would play its part in ensuring that there is not a double dip and we do not go into a further depression.  That is vitally important.</P>
        <P>I am critical of Europe in terms of it not being prepared for the present situation.  It had not prepared for a downturn in the world economy.  It had not prepared for a banking crisis.  We can blame ourselves, maybe, for many of the problems of our economy but if one looked at the European Union, nothing was happening there either.  We have a major role to play to ensure we bring our budget back under control and this is being done.  Our current agricultural policy in Europe is wrong.  The European agricultural policy is wrong and we should argue for change.  We could create many more jobs in the agricultural community here, providing there are proper market conditions, something we do not have at present.  The conditions are artificial and until the present situation is changed in the European Community and we have a competitive market, we will not succeed in the agriculture business.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing it to the House and for his clear explanation of its provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this Bill.  I note it results from the difficulties for sovereign states in raising funds.  We have provided the facility and we are part of that facility, along with <Col N="914"/>the European Stabilisation Fund and the IMF.  We must question why this facility was necessary in the first place, the reason being the supranational nature of international funding.  Given the supranational nature of international funding, it is time we also had supranational regulation.  This funding was absolutely necessary for Greece but it was not absolutely necessary that Greece would fall into the trap into which it fell.  In other words, it was a problem created for Greece by the international markets.  I am cognisant of the fact that a fund of &euro;15 billion by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was set up to sell sovereign debt in Greece short.  In other words, selling off the bonds at a hugely reduced rate with a view to buying them back later, given there is going to be a run on the market.  In many cases and in other states, these people who have purchased sovereign debt funds at a discounted rate have held out for the full payment from the sovereign nation.  In welcoming the &euro;750 billion fund it is essential that light is thrown again on the misdirection in international finance.  I am conscious that EU regulation will be introduced to prevent this happening again.  If proof positive were needed as to the sequence of events, the Greek Government refused to sell to either hedge funds or banks that might off-load their debt quickly.   Instead, the Greek Government insisted on selling to insurance companies and pension funds that have a certain stability and long-term view as they would be the only ones to hold their debt.</P>
        <P>We should consider the way the Irish Government managed in the 1980s.  In the 1980s Ireland had an unemployment rate of 18%, interest rates of 18% and a debt to GDP ratio of more than 120% and yet we paid every penny owed.  It was significantly more difficult in the 1980s for a nation like Ireland to pay its debt than it is for Greece today, if it was not for the outside influences.  Those outside influences are a danger because there is no morality with these hedge funds.  In fact, having created from the international funding the problem in sub-prime lending, some of these very hedge funds took a stand against the banks that were in difficulties, such as Lloyds TSB and HBOS, whose shares were sold short by hedge funds in the middle of the financial crisis.</P>
        <P>It is quite correct to set up this fund but we must also consider the reason for it.  It will be useful but the second part has to be an examination of the nations that are currently part of the euro and whether they are achieving what they set out to achieve or what they claimed to have achieved when they joined the eurozone.  If individual sovereign debt can be picked off, it undermines the euro which is part of a very positive whole and which we are attempting to defend properly.  However, this should be in conjunction with other measures to defend against the type of speculation that took place against Greece and would readily have taken place against Ireland if there was any credibility.  However, there was no credibility in taking a stand against Ireland because the management of the economy here was correct.</P>
        <P>There is every international indication that we did the right thing at the right time.  When we reached a fork in the road, in many different instances we always took the difficult and the right road.  This has been proven right and right again.  There was no real credibility in going after Irish sovereign debt but the predators certainly went after Greek sovereign debt.  We have a position in which we have a stability fund and there are other mechanisms that could easily have been brought in, including Germany borrowing the funding in the name of the sovereign nation and benefiting from the reduced rates but this should never have happened.  We introduced very strong regulation but we need to have supranational regulation so that if a hedge fund is trading within a nation and that trade is a particularly high trade, it must subscribe to the local national regulation and to the supranational regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the political agreement which lies behind the Bill.  When the markets seek to undermine the soli<Col N="915"/>darity of the eurozone, prompted by the funding difficulties of the Greek Government, the finance ministers of the eurozone came up with the package on a big enough scale to carry conviction, namely, resources of up to &euro;750 billion in financial support to euro area member states if required.  All too often, when there is a financial market crisis, governments do too little, too late and fail to impress the markets.  On this occasion, as Senator Hanafin stated, our Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, along with his ministerial colleagues in the eurozone, stung the markets with the sheer size and imagination of the support package and he has succeeded in setting aside doubts over the ability of member states to raise funds.  The power of the total package is shown by the fact that it enables Greece to borrow up to &euro;80 billion over the next three years without having to go to the markets which would have charged prohibitive rates of interest even if they were prepared to lend to Greece at all.</P>
        <P>This package gives Greece and its citizens the chance to get their financial house in order before they need to return to the depth markets in some years.  The Greek crisis led to the euro ministers devising this package and in doing so, they came up with a solution which can help other eurozone members if the need arises and they have to reinforce the solidarity and credibility of the euro.</P>
        <P>This Bill provides the ceiling on guarantees which Ireland is asked to provide at &euro;7.5 billion.  It is unlikely that Ireland will ever have to be called upon to pay on foot of these guarantees which are preventive in nature.  I welcome this Bill and the Irish commitment included in it, since as a small country, Ireland benefits disproportionately from being a member of the eurozone.  As Senator Hanafin said, we did the right thing at the right time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the eight Senators who contributed and I thank the House for its unanimous support for the Bill.  Many interesting and important issues were raised in the course of the debate.  One would go back to what caused the need for this type of legislation.  It was the inability of Greece to borrow at sustainable rates from international markets and the rise of contagion in terms of financial instability to other sovereign debt issuance.  This gave rise to the euro area loan facility to Greece, which enables it to meet its funding requirements without recourse to the markets for the next three years.  At the same time, Greece is required to meet strict policy requirements, including cuts in public service pay, cuts in pensions and increases in VAT and excise duties.  At a broader level, ECOFIN last May decided on a package of contingency measures, including the European financial stability facility.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe raised the continuing critical issue in referring to the obsession with evaluating all difficulties in financial terms and suggested it was better to generate economic growth.  The value of generating economic growth is not disputed by anyone but the question is how that is achieved.  I have often expressed the view that increased and improved competitiveness, which we have done substantially over the past couple of years, is the key to restoring growth and increasing exports.  We must strike a reasonable balance between budgetary consolidation and stimulus programmes.  We must be realistic in the European context.  We are taking measures to stimulate the economy, including the capital budget, various labour market measures and financing measures for small and medium-sized enterprises.  However, a net financial stimulus is not possible in the current situation for us or for most European countries.  It is imperative we reduce sovereign indebtedness.  If we are talking about net fiscal stimulus, the experience is that while we can maintain or increase activity for a certain limited period &mdash; the last time we tried it was in the early 1980s &mdash; ultimately we end up with greater indebtedness.  The tolerance of the markets for increasing indebtedness to provide a stimulus does not exist at the moment.  That addresses some of the points raised by Senator Donohoe.</P><Col N="916"/>
        <P>Senator Ross asked how much we have guaranteed.  The figure in the 2008 finance accounts was &euro;5.015 billion but this excludes the bank guarantee of &euro;440 billion.  He considered this from the point of views of guarantor and guarantee.  In terms of European solidarity, it is not possible to say that a country is only interested in being a guarantee.  We must show solidarity despite the difficult financial situation and that has a cost.  We must carefully monitor the situation in respect of guarantees but we must consider the opportunity cost of not having such guarantees in place.  Senator Ross was quite clear about the benefit of having the guarantee.  The phasing out of the bank guarantee will be achieved over time, consistent with any requirement for continued support of the funding conditions of the banks and the maintenance of financial stability overall.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross was correct in saying we must continue to put our house in order.  We do not have a choice when it comes to relenting on that but we must do so as intelligently and as effectively as possible.  We must do it in a way that minimises economic and social damage.  Senator Ross has frequently commended the budgetary measures pursued by the Minister and his continuing endeavours to promote market confidence.</P>
        <P>When discussing the German situation we must be very clear that Germany is an enormous beneficiary of the euro and the eurozone.  If there was no eurozone, the German currency would soar, making its exports much less competitive.  We must bear this in mind when analysing Germany.</P>
        <P>I was in this House for five years and I have been here for many financial debates as a Minister of State.  This is the first time I can recall Senator Ross praising the public service unions.  The praise is deserved and I commend him for so doing.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross envisaged Ireland borrowing from the facility in the near future and wondered whether we would be before or after Portugal.  The markets have increased the margin of our bonds over German bonds in the secondary market but the Government is of the opinion that we have taken the necessary steps to convince the markets of our determination to rectify our finances.  Senator Ross is correct in saying the markets have a tendency to wobble frequently over the past number of months but this drives home the need to take sustained and repeated action with regard to our finances.  We have time to take further steps and we are in a comfortable position with regard to funding for 2010.  Even if we did no further borrowing this year, existing cash reserves would cover requirements for the remainder of the year, including the repayment of all short-term borrowing.</P>
        <P>The NTMA has targeted a total bond issuance figure of approximately &euro;20 billion in 2010 and by mid-June had raised &euro;16.4 billion or 82% of the full-year target.  A total of &euro;5 billion was raised through syndication on 14 January, &euro;10 billion in bond auctions from January through to June and &euro;1.4 billion in the domestic retail debt market.  In addition, the NTMA holds large cash balances which stand at approximately &euro;20 billion.  This allows it to time its long-term issuances to take advantage of opportunities in the bond markets and avoid periods of volatility.  Ireland is some way down the path of addressing the main challenges facing it.  This has been recognised internationally and the credit rating agencies have recently reconfirmed Ireland&rsquo;s rating.  However, the net point is that it is still within our own hands to decide our future and I firmly believe we are equal to the challenge.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White, having spoken about the inevitability of this process, went on to discuss what harmonisation of policy might consist of, what the IMF might dictate, if Ireland or any other country were to need its help, as well as the importance of maintaining the ability to make decisions within the country.  I could not agree with him more on this point.  If one were to sum up the entire purpose and determination of Government policy in the past two years, <Col N="917"/>it has been to take whatever measures are necessary to keep decision-making within our own hands, rather than throwing up our hands and allowing outside bodies to dictate that we do this and that.  Although the struggle is not over, we have maintained a course of action and, as necessary, taken further measures, which was particularly the case last year, to achieve that goal.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to exaggerate or put too much of a positive gloss on it, as we are coming from a very low level, but there are signs of an upturn.  I hope such progress will be sustained gradually.  Increased competitiveness is leading to the creation of more jobs, but, unfortunately, we still are losing more than we are creating.  However, I certainly hope that over time the balance will begin to shift.</P>
        <P>There are unpalatable choices or options, including some discussed in the last year or two, on which a general political consensus has emerged, despite economists&rsquo; suggestions such measures should be taken such as on third level fees, property taxes, water rates, etc.  While some of these may be introduced gradually, one may take it for granted &mdash; I include a possible raising of the corporation tax rate &mdash; that if we were in a position where we would be obliged to call on aid, many such decisions would be taken out of our hands.  Moreover, it is doubtful whether outside bodies would be concerned about the social impact of some cutbacks on which they would insist.  Again, my point is that the general thrust of Government policy, including in what one might call the community and social spheres, has been to try to keep in place as much as possible of the system and the advances made in recent years.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to do this totally, but the aim of Government policy is to minimise the damage to the social fabric of our society.  Moreover, there are some areas in which it is still possible, despite everything that has happened, to achieve some advances.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin spoke about speculation against sovereign debt which, undoubtedly, has taken place.  Unfortunately, that is one of the hazards in the world in which we operate.  While it is easy to denounce the ethics and morality behind it, unfortunately, that does not necessarily remove the hazard.</P>
        <P>I thank all Members for their contributions and support for the Bill.</P>

        <P>Sections 1 to 8, inclusive, agreed to.</P><P Just="Center">SCHEDULE</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule be the Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of questions for the Minister of State on the Schedule.  In considering the Bill it is interesting to note that most of the material with the biggest impact is contained in the Schedule.  I understand this is the nature of such legislation.  However, I have a few questions that I wish to put to the Minister of State, to which I would appreciate a response.</P>
        <P>The first pertains to section 1 of the Schedule on its entry into force which outlines that the framework agreement can only come into force following its ratification by at least five euro area member states, accounting for at least two thirds of the total guarantee commitments set out in the Bill.  Does the Minister of State know the current status of the ratification process?  Have enough countries ratified the agreement to enable it to come into force?</P><Col N="918"/>
        <P>My next question pertains to section 4(6) of the Schedule which refers to the framework agreement&rsquo;s funding strategy.  The Bill gives the organisation running the fund the ability to delegate responsibility for its operation to &ldquo;one or more debt management agencies of euro-area member states or other such agencies or institutions&rdquo; approved by the guarantors.  This goes to a point Senator Hanafin has made many times in the House and on which he touched earlier.  I am interested in hearing whether the debt management agencies will be publicly run ones, such as, for example, the National Treasury Management Agency here and its equivalent agencies across Europe, or if it would include private organisations such as banks which would then have an opportunity to make a profit out of the operation of the fund?</P>
        <P>My next question relates to the latter part of the Bill.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will let the Minister of State know when I find it.  When a new member state enters the eurozone must it automatically join the fund or does it have the option to remain outside of it?  New members of the eurozone would have the ability to take advantage of the fund in the future if they had to, which I hope they would not, but they would be able to immediately take advantage of the credibility the euro has gained through the setting up of the fund and therefore it would appear fair that any future member of the eurozone would have to become a member of the fund for it to be able to participate in the benefits.</P>
        <P>Would the NTMA or an equivalent organisation play a role in where the ratification procedure stands at the moment across Europe and how would the fund operate in terms of new members of the eurozone?  I refer to section 13(7).  It outlines: &ldquo;In the event that a new country becomes a euro-area Member State, the Parties hereto shall permit such new euro-area Member State to become a shareholder of EFSF by receiving a transfer of shares&rdquo;.  It should be more than a case of permitting the new members to join us.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The first question relates to the ratification procedures.  Essentially, when 90% of the guarantee commitments have been received the facility would be ready to issue guarantees if necessary.  In terms of ratification, some countries have finished it and others will do so in the course of July.  Austria has ratified.  Belgium will not ratify before the end of July but that is due to elections there.  Cyprus has ratified.  The Finns are expected to ratify by the middle of July at the latest.  France has ratified.  Germany has ratified.  Greece is a stepping-out guarantor.  It will only be a guarantee, to use the terms of this debate.  It will, in effect, be in place there by the morning of 6 July.  Subject to completion of the Bill, the date here for ratification is 1 July.  In Italy provisional approval has been given and final approval will be given later this month.  Luxembourg has completed ratification.  Malta is expected to ratify within the next six days.  Portugal has completed ratification.  Slovakia has had elections so that has disrupted its timetable.  Ratification there will take place at the end of July at the earliest.  Slovenia will ratify by the end of July.  Spain will ratify on 5 July.  In The Netherlands ratification depends on explicit approval of a supplementary budget that will be introduced today.  That is the broad picture.  The measure is, in effect, about to come into force.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s third question related to new euro-area member states.  For the moment that is Estonia.  I cannot recall when Croatia is due to become a member.  It is due to become a member of the European Union next year but I do not think it will become a member of the eurozone next year.  It is envisaged that joining the facility will be a condition of joining the <Col N="919"/>euro.  The language in section 13(7) uses the term &ldquo;permit&rdquo; but there is a clear understanding that new euro member states will join the facility as shareholders and guarantors.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe also asked a question about funding strategy and the delegation to debt management offices.  The reference to debt management offices specifically refers to the NTMA and its equivalents.  The reference to &ldquo;such other agencies&rdquo; refers to the private sector but the clear intention is to use the public agencies.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an gCathaoirleach as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a ard&uacute; ar an Athl&oacute;.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White.  As she will know, having been a member of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, an issue has arisen regarding community development projects, CDPs, on which the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, has been to the fore since he took up office.  He said during recent visits to both Cork and Tralee that he was amenable and open to considering service level agreement proposals for CDPs.  Given that he is open to considering this option, the desired option of the national umbrella body for CDPs, the National Community Development Forum, NCDF, the forum submitted a proposal for a service level agreement to him on 11 June.  The model proposed would help and enable the <Col N="920"/>CDPs to maintain their local structures and continue their excellent community work, particularly in disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I pay tribute to the CDPs in Mahon and Ballyphehane in my area of Cork which do Trojan work.  However, there is ambiguity and an issue arises about the merger of the partnerships which do a huge amount of work and are overseen by a voluntary board.  They are open to all in the community, men and women.  The projects empower and enhance local communities.</P>
        <P>Although the deadline for submitting an integration plan was yesterday, the Minister has so far refused to meet the umbrella group and acknowledge its submission to the Department.  Some 100 groups are unsure of where they stand.  The Minister of State is genuine and, coming from Carlow, immersed and rooted in the community.  As such she understands the importance of this subject.  I would like her to clarify whether the NCDF national service level agreement proposal has been accepted or rejected by the Minister.  Is he available and willing to meet the NCDF to discuss it?  Will he extend the deadline and engage in consultation to bring about a resolution?</P>
        <P>At a time of massive unemployment and challenges for communities, we should be focusing on sustaining them and making them vibrant, irrespective of the socioeconomic divide.  To disadvantaged communities, in particular, this Adjournment matter is very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been no formal notification received by the NCDF from the Department.  I find this extraordinary.  Will the Minister consult the forum in the presence of an independent arbitrator or individual?  The CDPs have come a long way since last autumn when the Minister of State was a member of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the relevant groups appeared before it.  She saw Ms Cathleen O&rsquo;Neill on the Vincent Browne programme a few nights ago.  Ms O&rsquo;Neill does great work in Kilbarrack in Dublin.</P>
        <P>There are 100 projects and one size does not fit all, as the Minister of State knows.  The position in Carlow, Cork and Dublin is not the same.  I ask for a definitive response from the Minister.  Does the Minister of State believe it is correct for the Minister to refuse four times to meet the umbrella body?  Deputy Carey is the Minister in charge.  I know he is very fair and genuine and do not believe he is the one who is saying, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The Minister of State would be willing to negotiate with the umbrella body.  I, therefore, seek an extension of the deadline by one month, dialogue and clarity on behalf of the people we both represent.</P>
        <P>I hate using the word &ldquo;voiceless&rdquo; because I know from the work done in Mahon and Ballyphehane in Cork that we have empowered people.  We have given men and women who would otherwise not be involved in the community an opportunity to blossom and flourish.  That is what this is all about.  It is not about building political fiefdoms and kingdoms but about creating and building community.  Outside the gates today there are people protesting about the Civil Partnership Bill, as is their right.  The matter I am raising on behalf of the NCDF is another form of protest.  Some 100 projects require leadership.  The Government must meet, listen to and engage with the NCDF and, if necessary, change, if it is wrong.  I believe it is wrong in what it is doing.  The CDPs have indicated that they will enter partnerships.  This is an important night for the Minister of State and her Department and I hope she will be positive in her response.</P>

	<P>I am responding to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey and thank the Senator for raising it.  </P><Col N="921"/>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to update the Seanad on the current position on the new local and community development programme, LCDP.  As the Senator is aware, the local development social inclusion programme and the community development programme were the Department&rsquo;s two main social inclusion community development programmes.  They came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the local and community development programme.  All community development projects, CDPs, and local development companies, LDCs, currently in receipt of funding through the LCDP, have signed up to implement the new programme in the context of the Department&rsquo;s integration strategy and to meet specified deadline dates.  This includes the submission of a work plan by 26 March and an integration plan by 30 June.  It should be noted that funding for community development projects this year has been ring-fenced and maintained at the 2009 level.  In few other areas of public spending has it been possible to do this.</P>
        <P>The Department has set out a national model involving full integration of CDPs with LDCs but made it clear that other options can be considered, that it is not a question of one size fitting all.  However, alternative models will be required to meet a range of criteria, including a reduction in the number of structures, promoting the potential for integrated delivery of services to the public, supporting efficiencies and reducing the burden of company law compliance for CDPs.  The only option not acceptable is one that seeks to preserve the <i>status quo</i>.  Some models proposed by CDPs and other parties in the period since the launch of the LCDP have had to be rejected on that basis.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks the Minister has been able to respond positively to possible alternative models brought forward by the Paul Partnership and Limerick city CDPs, HSE South and a number of CDPs in the Cork-Kerry area.  While agreement has not yet been fully finalised in these cases, the Minister is confident that there is a real possibility that agreement will be reached.  The position is that, unless a project has received provisional approval from the Department for an alternative LCDP integration model, groups were still required to submit their plans for full integration by 30 June.  There are no plans to effect a general extension to that deadline.  Additional proposals from other CDPs and LDCs, including Northside Partnership, the National Community Development Forum, NCDF, and others have also been under consideration.  It is anticipated that any alternative model of the nature proposed, if agreed, could be used in a small number of specific areas only.  The Minister, Deputy Pat Carey, wishes to assure the Senator that the Department will continue to respond positively to all constructive proposals that it receives, based on the specified criteria, and that the officials will continue to be available to meet project boards.  However, a model that does not entail significant change is unlikely to meet the specified criteria.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that, despite statements by some commentators, full integration does not mean closure of a CDP or the cessation of CDP activities in any given area.  As has been stated previously, any worthwhile community development activity or service delivered under a CDP can continue to be delivered under the proposed new LCDP structure and by the same staff currently doing this work.  CDPs may opt out of the LCDP integration process and decide to go it alone.  In such cases, the Department would be supportive in respect of the retention of any assets acquired with programme funding and may be in a position to provide for some limited funding for a transition period, subject to certain conditions.</P>
        <P>Despite the tone of some coverage of the redesign of community-local development programmes and the integration strategy, those involved in community development have nothing to fear from the new model.  It is all about ensuring that front line services are maintained and that the important services currently being provided continue to play a vital role in strengthen<Col N="922"/>ing our most disadvantaged and marginalised communities.  In this regard, it is important to acknowledge the incredible work carried out by CDPs and LDCs, but communities and the challenges facing them change.  Accordingly, our approach to those challenges must change.  We need to look to the future.</P>
        <P>I reassure all concerned that the Minister&rsquo;s focus remains firmly on ensuring that scarce resources are targeted at the most vulnerable communities through optimising our efforts and resources on the front line.</P>

	<P>Given the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, will she elicit a commitment from the Minister?  From speaking with members of the NCDF, I know they will be able to give him the structures he needs.  Could we extend the process by two weeks?  Two weeks would guarantee the position.  Will the Minister meet the groups?  The Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks did not address this point.  The groups have been refused a meeting four times and their proposals have received no acknowledgement.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Most of my Adjournment matters tend to revolve around education matters.  As I always do at the start of an Adjournment debate and while I have no problem with the Minister of State being in attendance, I suggest that a Minister from the relevant Department should be present.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy White, will be well able to answer my question.</P>
        <P>During the last school year, St. Joseph&rsquo;s school on Parnell Street in Waterford had approximately 86 students on its roll, 40 of whom required speech and language therapy.  They are faced with an appalling situation.  Since May 2009, the school has had no speech and language therapist.  It is designed to cater for children experiencing speech and language difficulties.  That half of the school&rsquo;s students have not had a speech and language therapist available to them for more than 12 months despite needing this service is a disgrace.  The principal, Mr. Dermot Murray, has been in constant contact with the Department of Education and Skills throughout the period to try to reach a resolution whereby this facility would be restored, but none of his correspondence has been successful.  Representatives from County Waterford in the Lower House have asked questions, but this school takes in students from the east of the county, Waterford city, south County Kilkenny and parts of counties Wexford and south Tipperary.  The area is large.</P>
        <P>I understand that the person who held the position is on illness leave and has not been replaced.  The Department&rsquo;s letters to the principal go to varying lengths to explain that efforts are being made to appoint someone to the position.  Whatever efforts have been made, none has been successful.  It has been speculated that one of the possible solutions being considered is to have the position taken by a speech and language therapist from outside the school.  In this way, parents would need to take their children from the school to visit the therapist.  Crucially, there would be no interaction between the teachers and the therapist.  This solution <Col N="923"/>would not be good enough.  Given the students&rsquo; difficulties, daily contact between the teaching staff and the person filling the role is essential to ensure students are progressing in their therapies.</P>
        <P>The situation is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s fault, but this is time that the affected primary schoolchildren will not get back.  We all know the value of early intervention and support for people with particular education requirements and the knock-on benefits for the country such intervention can have.  The school&rsquo;s situation is not acceptable and I hope the Minister of State will have some positive news about a resolution to the difficulty.  It is wrong and unjustifiable that more than a year has passed since this facility was available to the school&rsquo;s students.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Phelan rightly stated, I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I am pleased to take the opportunity to outline the position in respect of the provision of speech and language therapy at St. Joseph&rsquo;s school in Waterford.  I know the school, as I attended school in Waterford.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised the Minister that the speech and language therapy service for the school has been provided directly as a school-based intervention programme for several years.  The service caters for all children currently identified as requiring intervention varying from high priority direct intervention to low priority-review with school support intervention programmes.  The service was suspended in 2009 due to staffing issues.  However, school support intervention programmes have continued and a speech and language therapy service to a limited number of children has been offered within existing staffing resources.  The HSE has advised the Department of Health and Children that it has been endeavouring to address the issue and is progressing to a revised approach over the coming months to develop a structure of integrated therapy to schools in the Waterford area.  St. Joseph&rsquo;s school will be considered within this primary care development.</P>
        <P>Depending on the child&rsquo;s needs, it is likely that therapy provision could be delivered through continuing therapy in community-based clinics or, where appropriate, in a school-based therapy programme.  Service continuity can be affected by staffing issues, including resignations, maternity leaves, career breaks, and so on.  However, the maintenance and development of speech and language therapy services remain a priority for the HSE locally, with three new additional posts established in the past two years in primary care, disability services and child psychiatry.</P>
        <P>Children who meet the criteria for other specialist HSE services will continue to receive their interventions through multidisciplinary teams, including early Intervention for all children under six years; autism spectrum disorders, where the intervention of the ASD team is indicated; child and adolescent mental health service team, following diagnosis of mental health disorder; and the Central Remedial Clinic service in Waterford, where children present with primary physical disability and continued multidisciplinary team intervention is recommended.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to the long-term goals and objectives of the national disability strategy.  Our commitment in the area of disability has been consistent.  Overall, approximately &euro;1.6 billion is spent annually by the health service on specialist health and personal social services and supports for people with a disability.  Despite the current economic climate, the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan for 2010 provides for additional funding of &euro;19.5 million to meet the anticipated growth in demand for disability services in 2010.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="924"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems from what the Minister of State has just said that the HSE is going down the route of having the therapist outside the school.  I want the Minister of State, if she can, to just relay the views of the school, and mine, as well as those of many representatives to the effect that this is not acceptable.  It is essential that there is complete contact between the teaching staff and whoever fulfils this role, if it is to be done properly.  While it might be in the remit of the HSE and it might argue that it is a priority that speech and language therapy services should remain available, its actions in this instance indicate that this is far from being a priority in the case of this school and the students concerned. </P>
        <P>This is not a question, but I should like if the Minister of State could relay the sentiments to the effect that what is being proposed here is not deemed to be acceptable by the people concerned.</P>

	<P>I googled the coastguard in Malin Head and came up with an article, headed, &ldquo;Is this the most famous radio station in the world?&rdquo;.  It was not about the radio station but rather the wireless room associated with the <i>Titanic</i>.  Part of the reason that Malin Head was involved in that was that the Marconi equipment was delivered to the <i>Titanic</i> in time for the sea trials on 2 April 1912, prior to its maiden voyage.  The article said: </P>
        <P LI="1">Phillips and Bride spent the day completing the installation and adjusting the equipment.  They exchanged test calls with coast stations at Malin Head (North coast of Ireland), callsign MH and Liverpool (actually known as &ldquo;Seaforth&rdquo;) , callsign LV.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I cite this as a prelude to the fact that this is a very important location for me, my constituents and the country.  The coastguard station has been there for well over 100 years.  Malin Head coastguard station was as good as closed after the Fearon report of 2007 but with the help of the local community expertise and pressure, the commitment and knowledge of the staff at the station, and working with our Valentia colleagues and the people of Kerry, the report was factually undermined.  At a transport committee meeting the assistant secretary of the Department, Mr. John Fearon, could not credibly defend the report he had signed off on.</P>
        <P>After a long battle the then Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, announced that the Government, having considered the matter fully and taken into account the various views expressed, had decided to retain the present configuration for the delivery of the marine rescue co-ordination.  That was based on the marine rescue co-ordination centre in Dublin and two sub-centres, at Malin and Valentia.</P>
        <P>The need to urgently upgrade the existing equipment was recognised and the purchase of three integrated communication systems, ICS, cores at a cost of approximately &euro;2.5 million was approved.  One was to be located at each centre.  Tendering procedures for the necessary radio equipment was at an advanced stage and delivery and installation of the first ICS core in Dublin was to be in late 2009 with work at Malin and Valentia to commence in 2010.  This phasing was to ensure that full national coverage was maintained while development work took place.</P>
        <P>Each of the two ICSs outside Dublin were to be linked to a range of coastguard remote aerial sites which would ensure the capacity to retain full national coverage should one of the centres go offline.  This decision meant that the capacity and flexibility of the national maritime and rescue communications system would be considerably enhanced, thus supporting the ongoing development of maritime safety services across the island of Ireland.</P><Col N="925"/>
        <P>The Irish coastguard station in Malin Head receives and co-ordinates responses to emergency calls.  It monitors radio traffic, answers 999 and mayday calls.  It assesses the situation and co-ordinates others where an on-the-scene response is being provided.  The station has been extremely busy even in recent weeks &mdash; with five call-outs in one day recently &mdash; and I commend the staff for their work.  We have had much comfort from the fact that the &ldquo;localness&rdquo; of the service, it is believed, led to the recovery of the bodies of fishermen who died recently.  For the families involved it was a great comfort that the radio station was there.  I know this might not equate with the technical argument that experts might make to the effect that this could happen anywhere where such a facility was located.</P>
        <P>I condemn those who make hoax calls.  Those who risk their lives on the seas or in any emergency service do so for a greater good and the fact that others are prepared to abuse emergency services, and thereby possibly prevent a genuine emergency from being responded to, is deplorable.  Malin Head and Valentia are marine rescue sub-centres, each with delegated authority from the MRCC since 2001 to co-ordinate a response to search and rescue incidents in their areas of responsibility.  The criteria for who can work there has improved to facilitate fishermen to be given recognition for their work and experience on the water to count towards their being able to qualify for this type of diversification of employment.  This has been important in my area, with the loss of jobs in the fishing sector.</P>
        <P>Given these types of good news developments in recent years and the wonderful service provided within the meteorological station and the coastguard, I ask, &ldquo;Where stands the promised upgrading of the facilities as well as the technology in Malin Head?&rdquo;  There had been plans for upgrading the facility in 2003, to employ nine further staff.  These plans were to be finalised in 2005 and implemented in 2007 before the threat of closure was mooted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many years on now we have had a major investment in the centre here in Dublin, and a welcome commitment to maintaining the centres in Malin Head and Valentia.  I know the Minister of State does not have direct responsibility in this area, but I hope she has a very positive answer on where we stand now on the technological and infrastructural supports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel  Dempsey, I am pleased to have this opportunity to provide an up to date position on the development of the marine rescue sub co-ordination centre, in Malin Head. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Following on from a Government decision in November 2008, the Irish Coast Guard engaged with the Office of Public Works on the installation of the new technology integrated communications system at the marine rescue co-ordination centre in Dublin, and the marine rescue sub-centres at Malin Head and on Valentia Island.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works site investigations at Malin Head have confirmed that the current buildings, operations room and ancillary spaces do not provide adequacy in terms of space, capacity and facilities for four 24-hour operator positions, as envisaged.  A four-operator set up is desirable for the long-term delivery of the search and rescue service.  To extend the current building would create a number of difficulties as it is situated beside the aerials earth mat, which should not be built on, and any major refurbishment would entail a lengthy transfer of operations to Dublin&rsquo;s marine rescue co-ordination centre.  A new building is therefore the preferred medium-term solution, which will entail a development time of about three years from the start of planning</P>
        <P>Therefore, to activate the new equipment quickly and provide some additional capacity for the national maritime communications network, the ICS hardware will be installed in a nearby site in Crockalough by the end of 2010 and will be remotely linked to the current three-operator <Col N="926"/>centre in Malin Head co-ordination centre.  Malin Head will be required to close for a short period while the equipment is migrated to new technology in the first half of 2011.</P>
        <P>Working parallel to this development the Department of Transport and the OPW will work towards the construction of the proposed new centre adjacent to the current co-ordination centre, depending on funding and planning permission.  It is intended that Malin Head will continue operations throughout the build phase and that 24-hour operations will thereafter transfer to the new building with no interruption of service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad there seems to be progress in having the communications infrastructure there, and I have to conclude that there is now an intention to fastrack the building.  I note the words on to funding, but the most important aspect of the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer is that there will be a commitment to Malin Head and the people employed there.  Regardless of whether the physical infrastructure is closed for a short period there will be no downgrading of the personnel employed there at the moment.  That is the first thing that is obvious from the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, to my mind. </P>
        <P>I welcome the introduction of new technology and establishment of a better service at the station.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the current staff will not be affected by any closure in 2011?</P>

	<P>I will bring back those concerns to the relevant Minister.  On the whole, this is good news and we will see how we can protect the current staff. </P>
