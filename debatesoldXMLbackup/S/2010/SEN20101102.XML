      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re report of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Sport, Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs entitled, 20 Year Strategy on the Irish Language 2010&ndash;2030, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 6.45 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments.</P>

	<P>I again note that the schedule for this week does not feature legislation.  Will legislation be available to the House before the Christmas break?  Does the Government intend to introduce any?</P>
        <P>The cost of borrowing for Ireland continues to increase and has reached record highs again today.  As the Deputy Leader is aware, there is a sense of great uncertainty internationally as far as Ireland is concerned.  The country features in the headlines in today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Financial Times</i> and many other news items focus on uncertainty about us.  This uncertainty has been fed by the resignation of Deputy Jim McDaid who in his letter of recognition states that where the Government has made decisions, it has invariably pursued the path of least resistance, focusing on what is politically possible rather than what is economically necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A decision taken by a Member of the other House is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been repeatedly pointed out in this Chamber that the Seanad must discuss the difficult decisions that will be made.  In that regard and in the light of recent publicity concerning third level registration fees, has the Government taken a decision on the matter?  Will the Deputy Leader inform the House what is the Green Party&rsquo;s position on the issue of registration fees?</P>
        <P>The issue of a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights has been raised again.  I was astonished last week to hear the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, state that if the referendum had been passed and the constitutional amendment made, it would not have been relevant to the case discussed last week.  I fundamentally disagree with his view.  It is impossible to state retrospectively whether passing a referendum and enshrining children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution would have affected practice.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on the issue were unacceptable.  Is the Government serious about holding a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights?</P>
        <P>With the key decisions due to be taken in the next few weeks, the possibility of bringing forward the budget has been mooted.  The vacuum that has been created regarding the budget has left people concerned, fearful, upset and unsure of how to plan their household budgets.  Has the Government considered bringing forward the date of the budget to deal with the grave uncertainty affecting individuals and families?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have bored the House in recent weeks by referring daily to the Croke Park agreement and the lack of political traction in making it work.  I compliment the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on being the first Minister to give political traction to it.  This issue must be closely scrutinised.  I have listened to people who have criticised the agreement and suggest it cannot work, will not bring savings or efficiencies and will not happen.  I listened to Deputies Noonan and Burton state correctly after they had emerged from the Department of Finance last week that nothing had been saved under the agreement thus far.  It appears as though one Minister has come up with a plan to reduce numbers in the public service by up to 5,000 that will result in savings of &euro;200 million or more a year.  The agreement should deliver &euro;1 billion in savings a year and reduce public sector numbers by approximately 20,000.  The proposal made would go one quarter of the way towards achieving this.  However, if people can only find problems in response to it, we are going nowhere.  If politicians cannot discern that this is the road forward, there is no basis for them to seek the levers of power.  Moreover, those who think it takes four weeks to make a decision should not be allowed to vote.  It seems clear that this is something that must be done.  Certain measures must be taken.  </P>
        <P>The HSE should put in place an advice line to provide advice and support on a number of issues, including taxation, social welfare and pension arrangements.  It should also arrange to <Col N="353"/>hold retirement seminars and similar stuff.  Such a mechanism must be put in place in order that people will have all of the facts available to them.  However, I ask colleagues to think about this point.  When one hears about the problems this will create, it points to what is required under the Croke Park agreement, namely, flexibility and mobility, as well as financial and quality control.  These are the measures that must be taken and they must and will be delivered in the current financial year.  That was the thinking from the outset and this proposal would take us one quarter of the way.  However, if politicians consider this to be too much, we are going nowhere.</P>
        <P>It is also a response to those who talk about the Croke Park agreement as something from which we should walk away.  If it is done properly, it can deliver savings of &euro;1 billion a year, as well as efficiencies and a reduction in numbers.  It can be done voluntarily with the support of all the partners involved.  It would be ironic were we to get that far with all of the people involved, yet at the same time fail to get political support for it.  I want to hear what other Departments have to offer at this point.  Members must support this measure rather than find problems with it.  While, of course, there will be difficulties, this is the way forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a valid form of protest.  This is a democracy and people will have a chance to show their contempt for the Government at the ballot box.  The resignation this morning of the former Minister, Deputy McDaid, is a sure sign, with four by-elections now outstanding, that the Government is coming apart at the seams.  It is interesting that the Deputy Leader is taking the Order of Business because it is being reported in the newspapers that his party is being pushed into accepting an increase in student registration fees of almost 60% or &euro;20 a week.  This will push many students out of college and onto the dole.  </P>
        <P>The coalition is also at odds on matters such as climate change legislation, despite the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s assurance that the House would see such legislation.  Moreover, although Members have also received assurances regarding legislation to hold the Dublin mayoral election, as a previous speaker noted, there is no such legislation on the Order Paper again this week.  How long can the Green Party hang in there when it is clear that it is being pushed around and not delivering on its agenda?  As Independent Members are also getting very nervy, there are clear signs the Government is coming apart at the seams.</P>
        <P>This cannot come soon enough because this morning the rate for Ireland&rsquo;s bond yields rose to more than 7.2%; the difference between Ireland&rsquo;s bond yields and those of Germany is now almost 5%.  Clearly, the international markets have no confidence in the Government.  Confidence must be restored and the only way to do this is through the provision of a fresh mandate, which would require a general election.  I speak to many people, including tradesmen, farmers and teachers, in my native county of Meath, all of whom have nothing but contempt for the Government.  They are angry with it and frustrated, but rather than take action by throwing buckets of paint over some hapless and ineffectual Minister, they must do so at the ballot box.  This should happen soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree no progress is made, particularly by a public representative, in throwing paint over anyone.  If that is the level at which local democracy is being exercised, it is a very bad reflection on the whole electoral process.  </P><Col N="354"/>
        <P>It is interesting to note the rush to calling for a general election, while we do not see proposals on the table.  What would others offer that would be so much better, directed better or guaranteed to save us from the IMF and other bodies with which we are being threatened?</P>
        <P>With regard to the Croke Park agreement, it has taken much co-operation to get us to this point.  It is important that those who signed up to the agreement realise to what they have signed up.  We, the Members of these Houses, will have to make difficult decisions in the next number of months, but they have made difficult decisions, too, and must stand over them.  Rather than sit on the fence and talk out of both sides of their mouths, they must stand over what they have agreed to.  There are many examples of where that is not happening.</P>
        <P>I ask for another debate on road safety, as we head towards the darker winter nights.  I have been talking about the dangers posed by pedal bicycles that are not lit and traffic islands that need reflective cat&rsquo;s eyes to make them visible.  These are simple measures that would save lives during the winter.  It is important, therefore, that we have a debate on the matter.  When one raises it with the National Roads Authority, one is told it is the responsibility of local authorities which state it is the responsibility of the Road Safety Authority which authority sends one off around the circuit again.</P>
        <P>I mention the tragedy that occurred in my constituency in the last 48 hours and ask others to join us in our prayers that the body of the person missing will be recovered.  That would bring closure to what is a very sad case.</P>

	<P><i>Vis-&agrave;-vis</i> what Senator Fitzgerald said, the letter is in the public domain and Deputy McDaid refers to matters of public importance.  Last Thursday morning I asked the Deputy Leader to explain why the budget could not be brought forward and he gave me an answer.  I wonder if he will give me the same answer today.  I support what Senator Fitzgerald said in that regard.  There will be a vacuum and a lack of certainty.  We know what the bond yield levels are and need to bring them down.  As I said last Thursday, the forthcoming budget will be an integral part of a four year plan and decisions will already have been made on it.  Why delay further and allow a vacuum and uncertainty to continue when so much is dependent on what will be contained in the budget?  It should be brought forward, for the sake of the country.  I will be interested to hear the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s reply today.   </P>
        <P>Over the weekend we were disturbed to be reminded by one of the Sunday newspapers of the frightful accounting and banking scandal involving the loan of &euro;7.4 billion given by Irish Life &amp; Permanent to Anglo Irish Bank in 2008.  The former chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Denis Casey, is alleging that the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance were aware of the loan in advance and that there was a certain connivance among them.  Their attitude was, &ldquo;Let us wear the green jersey, lads, because we are all playing on the one team and doing very well.&rdquo;  There is now an allegation that the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank was asked to stay on to assist politically.  I would like to hear what the Deputy Leader has to say on this matter which needs to be cleared up.  It is a huge scandal which, <Col N="355"/>presumably, is still under investigation by the Garda.  I would like to hear the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s appraisal of the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  Like him, I completely bought into the Croke Park agreement, on which we had a wonderful debate in this Chamber.  I stand with him in complimenting the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on the blueprint she has given to every Department, either before the budget or immediately after it.  Every single Member of the Seanad has sought reform of the HSE.  Before its establishment, we sought reform of the old health boards.  We have all been critical at one stage or another of how the health boards operated.  When the HSE came into play, the staff were just transferred over and there was no reduction in numbers.  Now, when we have a very good blueprint to be more lenient with that staff and to pare it back, people are pouring cold water on it.  It is not a compulsory scheme, it is optional.  People can opt into it or not go near it.  It is an excellent scheme and one that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should promote and encourage.</P>
        <P>With regard to one of Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s points, we all read the Sunday and daily newspapers.  There is a lot of scaremongering, untruth, innuendo and rumour being peddled in the newspapers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a serious Garda investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all a mirage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that more thought would be put in by journalists.  I have the height of respect for journalists and they must play their role and be responsible in what they are doing.  These are difficult times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>These are serious and difficult times and we have to try to face them in the most constructive way possible.  It is not helped by the fact the level of political discourse in this country has reached a very significant low.  There is no respect that I can see for any person connected with politics.  I listened to Deputy Michael Noonan being interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; just a few days ago.  I was horrified by the way in which he was barracked, interrupted and abused.  This is a senior former Minister and someone who will probably occupy a very important position.  That level of discourtesy is inappropriate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is time we reintroduced some measure of courtesy into our political discussions, if for nothing else than to respect the people who elected our representatives.  It is partly this kind of debasing of political debate that has led to these extreme incidents, such as the appalling example of the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, being attacked with red paint.  People could be blinded by that.  I remember that eggs were thrown at people during the last election.  There was a case in the past year where a person lost the sight of one eye through an egg being thrown.  An egg may appear to be quite a silly thing but it can do a fair amount of damage.  This is completely wrong.</P>
        <P>While I happen to disagree with the Minister, Deputy Harney, on a number of issues and I have made this plain, that is the level at which it should be maintained.  It is surprising it has taken this long to discover there was excess administrative capacity in the HSE.  This will have to be addressed very carefully and managed properly or it will backfire.  Let us at least show some degree of courtesy in our public discourse.</P>
        <P>The other matter I wish to raise is the extraordinary fact of the contradictory items contained in many of the newspapers.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i> reports that a significant academic report has demonstrated that alcohol is a more damaging drug than either heroin or crack cocaine but <Col N="356"/>the same page carries a call from the drinks industry to drop tax by 20% and abolish VAT.  I do not know from where these people are coming.  These contradictions should be exposed in debate in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Norris&rsquo;s point on levels of courtesy.  It has come to a sorry pass that people are treated so discourteously.  I read in one of the newspapers that a person intended to throw everyone from the door when the election was called.  This is terrible.  If people stand for office, they deserve a level of respect.  What is the difference between a person who stood and was elected and one who is choosing to stand for the first time?  We need to help bring a level of courtesy.  People need to think about what they are doing when they damn all politicians in the same way.  On that subject, I am not one bit surprised that Deputy McDaid is retiring.  In this game, you are damned if you do, and damned if you do not.</P>
        <P>I was very interested in what Senator O&rsquo;Toole had to say about the Croke Park agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want a discussion on anyone retiring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is one of the most critical matters we are facing.  Everyone in this House has stood up to say there are far too many in management in the health service and that we need to streamline it.  Contrary to what Senator Hannigan believes, we have a dynamic Minister.  If any of us has quarter the opportunity she has had to serve this country, and if any of us does quarter of what she has done, he or she will have a proud reputation to hold on to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>She has not delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are to be no interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has decided to move swiftly on the question of the Croke Park agreement.  While I am sure the Minister&rsquo;s schedule is tight, I am sure she has been negotiating with the unions behind the scenes on achieving change for many long months.  Change is here at last.  I ask the unions and employees to outline what the Croke Park agreement means to them and how it can deliver a modern, adaptable service that will safeguard front-line services.  We are all watching with interest to see how this happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleagues, I strongly condemn what happened yesterday to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The biggest wonder about it is not the actual event but, unfortunately, that it has taken so long to happen.  We acknowledge time and again in this House the desperate state of the economy.  Let us consider what the bond markets are saying today.  Colleagues have already touched on the fact that the bond yields have increased beyond 7%.  Today the financial markets believe there is a chance of approximately 40% that Ireland will default on its debt next year.  Those are the figures.  The fear within the financial markets is felt to the bones by the people we serve.</P>
        <P>We talk of the need for politicians to be respected.  We are in circumstances in which the political system, and the Government in particular, must regain respect.  It must do so in two ways.  First, the budget the Government is considering should be brought forward.  If the markets do not have time to understand what the budget is and how it fits in with an overall strategy, there is a greater chance of it being misinterpreted and of there being no calm deliberation thereon.  We would then end up in a perilous place in January.</P>
        <P>The second way involves the entire political system.  While I know responsibility sits with the Government, I believe that if any Member on this side of the House says he or she is against <Col N="357"/>something, he or she will have to state what he or she would do differently.  We will have to do this because the problems will not go away.  If there is a new Government in place tomorrow, a fresh mandate, of itself, will not solve the difficulties we are in.  There must be clear willingness to say what will be done differently.  Otherwise we will add to the problem rather than take away from it.</P>

	<P>Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister to the House to discuss the tendering process which seems to militate against small businesses and manufacturers?  I refer also to education.  Senator Donohoe stated a change of Government would not bring a change of policy.  I listened to an interview with Deputy Quinn of the Labour Party yesterday.  He was asked five times to state his party&rsquo;s policies on education.  He was asked if the party would increase the registration fee but he did not say whether he would.  All he said was: &ldquo;Put us in power and we will see what happens.&rdquo;  That is basically all he said.  If one wants to check the tapes, one may do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I became a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I have raised the subject of the number of administrative staff within the HSE on many occasions.  It is good that there is going to be a reduction in that number.  However, the timeframe of 17 days in which people will be obliged to make a decision on such an important issue is extremely short.  There is an element of suspicion with regard to why this process must be completed with such haste.  We do not have exact figures in respect of how many administrative staff are actually employed by the HSE.  The figure tends to vary from two for every one member of front-line <Col N="359"/>staff to seven for every such member of staff.  There is a need for a very real evaluation with regard to the actual number of administrative staff within the HSE.</P>
        <P>It will be important to ensure that an element of corporate memory is retained in areas where there is a large take-up in respect of the early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes.  We cannot allow there to be deficiencies in respect of services, particularly in instances where vacant positions will not be filled.  People will have 17 days in which to reach a decision and then a further couple of weeks will be devoted to evaluating the process.  It is simply not feasible that this can all be done within the month of December.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with what happened in respect of the Minister for Health and Children yesterday.  I do not believe offering a protest in the way we witnessed yesterday would be acceptable in any civilised society.  However, the Minister came before the House on numerous occasions to take statements in respect of the HSE and she never referred to the fact this major element of reform was on the cards.  She never discussed this matter or put out feelers in respect of it.  Neither has she given people who work in the health service time to consider what is about to happen.  The drip feeding of information relating to budgets, borrowing levels and the dire straits in which we find ourselves is very similar to the time limit that is being given to people in order that they might make life-changing decisions.  The amount of time being provided is simply not adequate.  While I fully support the Croke Park agreement, a realistic timeframe must be provided in order that a proper debate might take place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to request a debate on the subject of reducing VAT as a stimulus measure.  I am particularly interested in the reduction of VAT to 5% in respect of energy upgrades, repairs, maintenance and improvements to private dwellings.  A move such as that to which I refer is allowable under the sixth EU VAT directive.  There would be five benefits to a move of this nature, namely, it would lead to the creation of jobs, a reduction in domestic fuel bills, stimulate activity in the construction sector, be of assistance in tackling the black economy and &mdash; I know the Deputy Leader will be in agreement with regard to this aspect &mdash; enable the Government achieve its targets in respect of reducing carbon emissions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I submitted my proposals in respect of this matter to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, this morning, and to the Cabinet, this afternoon, in order that it might be debated.  I accept there is a back and forth element to discussions in this Chamber but there is no doubt that Members must put forward specific ideas and stimulus measures for the forthcoming budget.  I hope the Deputy Leader will take on board my request for an urgent debate on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Those of us who come from a business background are always surprised with regard to the length of time it takes for the Government and the public sector to move.  The Croke Park agreement came into being approximately five months ago.  In such circumstances, it seems that a long time passed before the Minister for Health and Children made her announcement to the effect that numbers in the HSE are to be reduced by 5,000.  I wish to correct Senator Prendergast who stated that people would only have 17 days in which to make a decision.  I understand that, overall, there will be a period of 30 days in respect of the acceptance of applications.</P>
        <P>A huge number of jobs in the public sector could be removed from the system.  In that context, one need only consider the number of quangos that are in existence.  Sir Philip Green was appointed by the British Prime Minister to carry out a review of government spending and procurement.  He said he could save &pound;20 billion with the number of quangos he would reduce.  There is a need for us to grab hold of things.  A sense of urgency is needed, as is a sense that we are going to move on it and can do it.  Senator Fitzgerald was correct.  The sooner we get <Col N="360"/>decisions such as the budget, the better.  I do not know if it is possible to move the budget any earlier, but the sooner we can do it, the better.  I have a concern that if there was an election, the longer it was delayed the more questions would arise as to the policies of those who will be elected.  I would love to hear the Labour Party policy and to hear it say what it will do because there will be more doubt the longer the question is not answered.</P>

I was in Cobh quite a lot and 53 cruise ships came into it last year.  They come into the centre of the town and passengers can step off into it.  The cruise ships which come to Dublin are stuck outside, far beyond the toll bridge.  It is possible to bring them in.  There may be a vested interest in asking whether they can be brought into a particular location, but it would mean that tourists on those cruise ships could come into the city.  That is something that does not cost money.  We can and should move on it immediately.</P>

Senator Feeney spoke about 5,000 people being given the choice of optional retirement in the HSE.  I once again call for people to have choice and not be forced into retirement at 65 years of age.  It is a denial of the human rights of older people that they do not have a choice.  As I have said many times in this Chamber, in my document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism, I have 28 recommendations which spell out the ambitions and the way we should treat older people.

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in welcoming the decision of the Government to introduce a voluntary redundancy scheme in the HSE.  I remind Senator O&rsquo;Malley that the Government is making it up as it goes along.  The Government has been in place for 13 years and has shrunk from and funked every opportunity to have real reform of the public service.  I ask the Deputy Leader to send a message today to the CPSU that the half hour allocated for banking should be done away with and let it get into the real world.  We are all in this together but that type of propaganda does not do us any good.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader whether the Minister, Deputy Harney, will come to the House to make a statement on her proposal.  As a proud public service advocate, it is important that she enshrines in the new deal that there will not be redeployment back into the scheme and that people who take the redundancy package cannot be redeployed in the HSE or elsewhere.  Let us have real reform in the public service.  It is important we protect the jobs which are there because, as I said before in the House, we should not have the public versus private war which certain Members of this House want to have.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also ask that we examine the possibility of bringing the budget forward.  There will be an interregnum between the publication of the four-year strategy and the budget and if one listens to the commentary today on every radio programme and reads every newspaper, despite what Senator Feeney believes, the people are afraid.  They are in trepidation.  They are also incandescent with rage.  They blame everyone, the Government in particular which has been asleep for 13 years and which has made a monumental mistake in this country.  That said, it is important to reassure not only the markets but also the people and give them hope and optimism.  The people do not see it from Deputy McDaid today, the Government and the benches opposite.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support and commend Senator Carroll on his proposal into which he has put a great deal of work.  It is innovative and creative and of the kind to which everyone in this House should be dedicated.  It is thoughtful in the context that one rarely seeks &mdash; certainly, the Department of Finance is nervous about it &mdash; to reduce VAT as a means of providing a stimulus.  The Senator has shown through his research, however, that with the use of the Sixth EU VAT Directive, such a measure is permissible and has been proved in other countries to create employment, not least in helping the environment in terms of retrofitting many buildings.  It would give adequate stimulus.  I ask the Deputy Leader to make time available in order that we can discuss its merits as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Another proposal which I have made to this House in recent times in the context of forthcoming actions in trying to deal with the economic crisis was to see whether the Government could introduce a change in order that the Irish Government bond yield rather than the German yield curve would be the valuation benchmark for Irish pensions.  Currently, pension funds are required to use German bond yields when calculating the minimum funding standard or current valuation of future liabilities of pensions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This development would bring two benefits.  First, it would create additional demand for Irish bonds from Irish pension funds.  As Members may be aware, less than 15% of Irish debt is owned by Irish sources.  Second, it would improve the solvency of specific funds by enabling them to discount their future liabilities at the higher Irish bond rates rather than the lower German bond rates.  Reports in recent weeks state this could increase demand for Irish debt <Col N="362"/>and Irish bonds by up to &euro;10 billion and, as anyone who has seen the yields this morning at up to 7.3% will testify, we certainly need that in this country.  At 15%, the amount of debt owned by Irish institutional interests is very low.  In Spain, it is expected to be 90% at the end of the year.  Rather than being ultra-conservative as it so often is, the Department of Finance needs to follow the industry and the calls of others, including by me and other Members of this House, and take the appropriate action in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children in bringing in the first set of real reforms to the public sector.  I understand what Senator O&rsquo;Toole is saying but I must say some of the unions are stretching the credibility of the Croke Park deal to a great extent.  First, SIPTU&rsquo;s demonstration on Monday night last in Letterkenny to protect the local hospital does not argue that they are in the business of structural reform which they will be required to do under Croke Park.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for the public sector unions which are putting question marks against the Minister&rsquo;s proposed reforms, let me subject them to a reality check. After the last budget, public sector workers on &euro;35,000 a year saw their salaries reduced by 4.17%.  By contrast the private sector workers in the same period on &euro;35,000 a year saw their salaries reduced by 61.7% if they were made redundant. A public sector worker on &euro;75,000 a year had his or her salary reduced by over 4%.  Private sector workers, on the same salary of &euro;75,000, thrown out of work would see their salary reduced by 78%, and they do not have pensions. When Senator Buttimer speaks about Members in this House fomenting trouble between the public and private sectors, the facts provide the trouble.  It is like when one condemns the Provos in Northern Ireland one is not contributing to the peace process. The facts show that there are very fat public sector workers and very poor private sector workers without pensions, and that is the reality.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>We should not have to beg managers who have no work to do in the public sector to reform and to move on.  When there are 400,000 people out of work, are we seriously expected to pay workers to move from one secure job to another in the public service, to pay teachers to accept an authentic performance management system and an exit process to move incompetent teachers out of the system, to pay psychiatric nurses to move from Victorian hospitals to modern health care systems and to compensate air traffic controllers for doing a job with the flexibility long ago given by the private sector?  In other words, does the private sector not have a right to demand a reality check from the public sector?</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the suggestion made by Senator MacSharry on the excellent document prepared and submitted to the Government by Senator Carroll.  I support calls to have a debate on it next week in advance of the budget.  It is an extremely well worked out document, the kernel of which is a proposal to reduce the VAT rate to 5% on the reconstruction of houses.  There is approximately &euro;100 billion in savings, some of which could be released into the system to upgrade the quality of houses.  A reduction in the VAT rate to 5% would generate an enormous amount of building work.  I compliment the Green Party and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on the insulation of houses which has been an extremely successful cam<Col N="363"/>paign which has resulted in the creation of jobs.  This is a very worthwhile proposal which should be teased out in the House.  Rewiring is required in numerous houses as what is in place dates back to the 1950s and 1960s; in fact, some houses are in a dangerous condition.  If the proposal was adopted by the Government it would create more funds.</P>
        <P>It would be worthwhile to have a debate in the House on the university sector.  As far as I can see, most lecturers spend more time appearing on RTE and Newstalk programmes than they do in lecture chambers.  It is time we looked at this.  I understand the children of all university staff can avail of free fees.  Perhaps Senator Bacik can confirm this.</P>

	<P>I agree with the overall approach adopted by my colleagues, Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Donohoe, to the announcement made yesterday by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the budgetary difficulties facing the Government and the country.  I certainly welcome what was announced yesterday.  We all wish it happened earlier and that reform had commenced sooner.  However, to use a clich&eacute;, we are where we are and I hope what the Minister for Health and Children has commenced in her Department will spread to other Departments and that the same level of flexibility and innovation which she is seeking can be entertained throughout the public sector.  There is a formula under the Croke Park agreement and it is one my party fully supported from early on.  The agreement provides for sensible and manageable reductions in numbers throughout the public sector.  Without it happening in the very near future, the country will be declared economically bankrupt.</P>
        <P>We have to listen to what the bond markets and financial markets are stating.  As late as today, there is not sufficient confidence in economic policy, or perhaps political policy from the Government or even the body politic, and it is virtually impossible now for Ireland to borrow the resources it needs.  Last week I pointed out that on 1 January or thereabouts the country would require a borrowing figure of almost &euro;19 billion to allow it to be run and managed next year.  Unless the politics and economics are corrected before 1 January, we will not get the money we need.  We are almost at the edge of the cliff.  Senator Donohoe is correct to state politicians must show realistic leadership.  We have a few weeks to turn around the ship of State.</P>

        <P>It is ironic that Senators are looking for the Labour Party policy on education when, even after 13 years in government, Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s policy on education is still not clear.

	<P>I ask for a debate on the issue of choice in primary school education, a matter on which the Labour Party has a very clear policy, unlike other parties which have done nothing to ensure diversity of patronage across the sector.  There will be a group of parents and children outside the gates of Leinster House tomorrow whose protest will take the form of a children&rsquo;s parade calling for multidenominational school places to be made available.</P>

	<P>I commend the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for the way in which she continued with her duties yesterday, despite having been treated so discourteously.  I abhor such action.  It is outrageous that people stoop so low.  I also welcome the fact that she has put in place a plan to seek 4,000 voluntary redundancies which I hope will be taken up.  However, the timescale is very short to allow people to make up their minds.  I wonder, however, why it took the Minister so long.  At the eleventh hour she is giving people 17 days in which to make up their minds.  I worry about the state of the health service when such a measure is introduced so quickly.  While I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initiative and think she is right, I worry about how it is to be implemented.</P>
        <P>A report by HIQA was issued today on St. Vincent&rsquo;s care centre in Athlone.  Such reports by HIQA are to be welcomed.  However, it has destroyed the quality of the service provided and the morale of the nursing and care staff in St. Vincent&rsquo;s care centre in Athlone.  When asked, all of the patients complimented the staff, saying they were being very well cared for and that both nutrition and the level of care provided were very good.  Nurses in the centre are run off their feet because they are expected to complete bureaucratic forms morning, noon and night.  I question the reason nursing staff face such a predicament when the role of the nurses is to care and spend time with the elderly patients.  I, therefore, question the value of HIQA.  We never again want to see another case similar to the one at Leas Cross, but it is outrageous that nurses and care staff are expected to do such work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to media comments over the weekend about third level registration fees.  The Green Party has prided itself for some time on being the party of education in government.  We are led to believe it is not willing to support an increase in the registration fee to &euro;3,000 but that it is willing to support an increase to &euro;2,500.  I ask the Deputy Leader to state whether this is correct.  I am someone who benefited from free third level fees as I do not come from a privileged background.  The imposition of such high registration fees is the reintroduction of tuition fees by the back door.  There is no doubt that for families of modest means this will be an impediment to students going on to third level education.  The Fine Gael proposal, which has been in the public domain for 12 months, is that when people qualify and get a job, they will be in a position to pay back some of the cost of their education.  Currently, we have a system where we educate people to a very high standard in our third level institutions but we export them all over the world and there is no return for the State from the investment it makes and that is most unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>Something highlighted to me a couple of weeks ago by students was the similarities between the University of Edinburgh and University College Dublin.  They are very similar in terms of size and yet in UCD, the percentage of the budget spent on salaries and pensions is 72% compared with 34% or 35% in the University of Edinburgh which is a shocking difference between universities that deal with largely the same number of students.  There is something wrong there.  Before we look at imposing huge increases in registration fees, which will mean people from modest backgrounds will not go on to third level education, we should look at reducing that 72% figure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point on quangos.  Senator Donohoe raised the issue of the budget.  When publishing its four year strategy later this month, the Government should look at the possibility of bringing forward budget day to give, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has <Col N="366"/>said on numerous occasions, certainty to people who are anxious about what will be contained in it but who want some degree of hope and leadership for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Fitzgerald asked several questions which were followed through by other Senators.  She asked about the lack of legislation on our weekly cl&aacute;r.  It is a matter of ongoing concern that we cannot free up legislation but I am confident we will be able to do so in the next number of weeks.  We have two Bills on our Order Paper due for Committee Stage, namely, the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 and the Coroners Bill 2007.  The Bills require amendments to be brought forward by the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice and Law Reform, both of which are entertained on other matters.</P>
        <P>Major legislation will go through the other House in the next week or so and I am confident they will come before this House in a matter of weeks, one of which is the Dublin Lord Mayor Bill 2010, about which Senator Hannigan inquired.  Second Stage of that Bill will be debated in the other House this week.  The other Bill is the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which is going through Committee Stage in the other House.  They are both major Bills which I expect to see very soon in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Fitzgerald also spoke about the economic and political uncertainty caused by other events and the decisions of other people.  As the Cathaoirleach pointed out, it is not our place to talk about how the other House runs and its future.  Such decisions are disappointing in that we have very difficult decisions to make.  As Senator Donohoe said, at a time when we require level heads and a certain amount of moral courage, that requires people being present when those decisions must be made.  I hope when those decisions are made that we will have the moral courage required.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Coghlan, Donohoe and Bradford mentioned budget day.  As of now, budget day has been pencilled in for 7 December but a definitive decision has not been made as to whether that will be the date or whether it needs to be brought forward.  Obviously, the Government will take into account how it must react to international sentiment.  In terms of moving the date too far forward, we do not want to see a repeat of what happened with a budget which was brought forward precipitously and was not the budget it should have been.  That happened only a few years ago.  We must be very cautious with this budget above all others.  I ask for a certain amount of patience on Members&rsquo; part in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Hannigan, Phelan and Bacik asked about the likely increase in the student registration fee.  The choices to be made in this set of Estimates and the budget in seeking additional income and curbing expenditure in all Departments will be difficult.  I am bemused by the attention the registration fee issue is receiving.  The registration fee has been in place for several years and increased year on year, including last year.  The equation of registration fees with tuition fees is very far off the mark.</P>

	<P>In 1980 I was offered a place in University College Cork to undertake an arts degree.  I did not qualify for grants and the fee for the course was IR&pound;3,000.  Thirty years on if people believe the registration fee is anywhere close to the economic value of a course tuition fee, they are not living in the real world.  There is heavy subsidisation of third level education.  That must be the focus of the debate on this matter.</P>

        <P>Senator Fitzgerald also spoke about the proposed referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  We had a debate on the report released last week.  To be fair to the Minister of State, he made a relatively definitive comment on the matter when he said the holding of such a referendum was closer than it had ever been.  I do not take that comment as being negative.</P>

	<P>The necessary work must and will be done to allow a referendum to be held early in the new year.  We should all dedicate ourselves to that task.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of the Croke Park agreement and the HSE redundancy package offered, on which Senators Feeney, Norris, Harris and Buttimer followed up.  Some Members have questioned why the HSE redundancy package is to be implemented in such a short timeframe.  Having a narrow window is necessary as we have had a poor experience of open-ended voluntary redundancy packages.  We need to know how many are interested in the package offered and what savings can be made on foot of it in the quickest possible time.  We need a slimmed down and more effective &mdash; especially a more cost effective &mdash; health service and this is a move in the right direction.  In general, Members have welcomed the redundancy package.</P>
        <P>On a related matter, Senators Hannigan, Keaveney, Norris, O&rsquo;Malley, Donohoe and Harris spoke about the unwarranted attack on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, yesterday.  I add my voice to theirs.  It is particularly sad that it was a local public representative who was involved in a protest of this nature.  Those of us who are privileged to be involved in public life, whether at local or national level, need to know we have a mandate to honour and that mandate can only be honoured through the force of argument in seeking to bring about change.  An inane stunt that had all the sincerity of a teenage prank did nothing to further any policy goal.  It is welcome that Members have chosen unanimously to condemn the action.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan asked about climate change legislation.  Both he and Senator Bacik should be pleased to note that we will debate the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security this week when a definitive statement will be made on the state of the Government&rsquo;s Bill.  I look forward to the Senators and others contributing to the debate on Thursday.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan also raised the issue of bond yields, as did Senators Donohoe, Coghlan and Bradford.  The question stems from uncertainty.  Those who crave a general election before a four-year programme is agreed and the budget is introduced in December risk adding to that uncertainty.  In a general election political parties may gain a political advantage.  The two <Col N="368"/>parties to which I refer which do not hold a common position on public sector reform, taxation and where and how we can curb public expenditure would do nothing to give certainty to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

After that, anything should be open to political discussion.  However, given the point we, as a country, are at and the decisions we have to make, cohesion, consistency and honesty are required from all those involved in public life.  It saddens me that at this vital time some individuals and political parties want to make political capital.</P>

	<P>Senator Keaveney raised the matter of road safety which warrants a further debate in the House.  This has generally been a successful years in terms of a reduction in the number of road deaths.  However, I note with sadness that in my local area of Cork, of which Senator Buttimer will be aware, there have been too many accidents recently.  A debate on the matter might point to where the strategy is working and where it needs to be further refined.  </P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney asked about the action to be taken in the light of the fishing boat tragedy in County Donegal.  All Members share her views.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan raised a number of issues related to the ongoing banking scandals.  The work of a tribunal into these matters, headed by a former secretary general of the finance Department in Finland, Mr. Nyberg, is ongoing.  The House should welcome a recent statement by the Garda Commissioner that by the end of the year he expects a file to be passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions and action to be taken on many of the matters raised.  All Members agree that there is a need to identify those who have committed acts of economic treason against the country.</P>

	<P>We will await the findings of the tribunal and the Director of the Public Prosecutions.  I am confident that action can and will be taken in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly spoke about job creation and the tendering process.  There is a commitment in this regard in the programme for Government.  We are awaiting a report on green tendering which will help matters in respect of the businesses about which Senator Daly spoke, small and <Col N="369"/>medium-sized enterprises, and to clear unnecessary blockages in the system.  I look forward to our having a debate on the report when it becomes available.</P>
        <P>Senator Carroll, backed by Senators MacSharry and Leyden, spoke about a proposal to reduce the VAT rate for retrofitting.  It is certainly an interesting one.  If an EU directive allows it to happen, it is something that should receive active consideration.  There has been a difficulty about zero rating, or moving from one VAT rate to another, or creating new VAT rates.  The House might benefit from having a debate on the proposal made by Senator Carroll.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn talked about the need to eliminate quangos, the number of which must at least be reduced.  This must form an important part of the budget when presented to both Houses.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White has reminded us that there are 1 million people over the age of 60 years on the island.  The structure of policy must be informed by how we should deal with not only that number but the increasing number of who will reach that age in the decades to come.  Those who find themselves in that age category should not be viewed, as happened in the past, as a burden but a real resource.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry talked about linking Irish pension funds with an Irish yields benchmark.  This proposal has value, but I hope there will not be a vested interest in keeping the yields particularly high because it is something we want to reduce in as short a time as possible.</P>
        <P>I believe I have covered all of the points raised but, if not, I will try to address any matters I have overlooked by other means.</P>

        <P Just="Left">An m&eacute;id sin r&aacute;ite, caithimid glacadh go bhfuil an geilleagar i mbaol agus nach bhfuil na hachmhainn&iacute; c&eacute;anna againn a thuillleadh.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann s&eacute; liomsa, caithfimid bualadh ar aghaidh leis an gcuid is m&oacute; den strait&eacute;is nach bhfuil costas airgeadais ag baint leis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; molta&iacute; sa strait&eacute;is agus in&aacute;r dtuarasc&aacute;il at&aacute; ciallmhar agus praitici&uacute;il agus a dh&eacute;anfadh maitheas don teanga i gcoitinne.  T&aacute; an t-am ag sleamhn&uacute; uainn agus muna nd&eacute;anann an Taoiseach agus an Rialtas cinneadh maidir leis an strait&eacute;is t&aacute; an baol ann go rachaidh an strait&eacute;is agus an tuarasc&aacute;il isteach sa ch&oacute;fra ch&eacute;anna ina ndeachaigh na c&eacute;adta foilseach&aacute;in at&aacute; d&eacute;anta leis na blianta maidir leis an nGaeilge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute;im ag lorg comhartha d&oacute;chasach &oacute; mo chomhghleachaithe os mo chomhair go bhfuil an toil sa ghl&uacute;in seo buille a thabhairt ar son na teanga sula gcaillfimid an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht go deo.</P>
        <P>It is a pity I cannot make my entire address in Irish.  I am a product of bad learning.  I was a bad student, even though I did honours Irish in the leaving certificate examination.  T&aacute; suim mh&oacute;r agam i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; cult&uacute;rtha.  This is an innovative report which is worthy of debate in the House.  It is important that we put our language and culture and the people of the Gaeltacht ahead of everything else.  We are a proud people.  That is why it is important we never lose sight of the fact that our nationalism set us apart in Europe.  We should be proud of our Irishness and our language.   In these difficult economic times I hope we can command a space for our language and the people of the Gaeltacht who are both innovative and proud.  I was in Ballingeary recently on my way to Gougane Barra where the people are very resourceful.</P>
        <P>I again welcome the report and hope the Government will not be found wanting.  I compliment all those Members who were involved in the sub-committee and thank the Minister for his address.</P>

Nobody in the gaelscoil movement in the North would speak to me because I took a practical approach to languages.  Ceann de na ruda&iacute; a chuireann isteach orm nach raibh sa Good Friday Agreement n&aacute; nach raibh aon duine s&aacute;sta go mbeadh polasa&iacute; amh&aacute;in don teanga don oile&aacute;n ar fad.  What I have seen in respect of the Irish language is a partitionist approach by all the parties, including, as I have informed its members on many occasions, Sinn F&eacute;in.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i bhf&aacute;bhar go mbeadh Gaeilge toilteanach or voluntary and available in the North but compulsory in the South.  That is not an all-island approach to developing a policy.  My view is that people who begin their education in one language should be able to continue to communicate in that language.  The Reverend Ian Paisley agreed with me and did not have a difficulty in that regard.  He stated he was not prepared to support the erection of Irish language signs in Belfast city centre but that he did not have a problem with supporting the establishment of gaelscoileanna &mdash; or Irish schools &mdash; in parts of the North where people were in favour of their development.  Bh&iacute; sin thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.</P>

Seo an deacracht is furasta a fheiscint.  Sna Gaeltachta&iacute;, if somebody who cannot speak Irish comes into the company of a group of people who are speaking the language, everyone else begins to communicate in English because that is the mannerly approach to take.  In Dublin, the opposite happens.  If somebody who can communicate haltingly through Irish joins the company of people who are already communicating through the language &mdash; I must be careful how I describe these individuals because when I used a particular phrase to describe them on a previous occasion, I was apologising for two months afterwards &mdash; they tend to speak faster and use more difficult words in order to ensure the former does not understand what is happening.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>When considering my contribution today I considered a number of options.  One was to read a prepared script as Gaeilge which I would have been able to do quite competently.  Another was to preface my speech with a c&uacute;pla focal along the lines of, &ldquo;T&aacute; &aacute;thas m&oacute;r an corn seo a ghlacadh&rdquo;, as we often hear in public speeches, but I decided, given the nature of the competency of my language, I would speak in English because I believe that any strategy which aims to foster an increase in the use of the Irish language must be aimed particularly towards citizens like me.</P>
        <P>As to our willingness and ability to use language, a number of fair points have been made during the debate.  Too often, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has said, Irish has been used as a weapon.  We need to ensure the use and love of the Irish language is an issue of cultural rather than political importance.  We need to learn from the example of nations such as Wales which has managed quite successfully to increase the use of its language in a way that we have avoided doing.  There have been some improvements in recent years, such as the success of TG4 and the passing of the Official Languages Act, and they point in the right direction, but the strategy also must be about reviewing where such Acts may not have been as positive in their intent as they might have been.</P>
        <P>For instance, the requirement of the Official Languages Act to have annual reports in Irish and English is something which needs to be reviewed, certainly in printed form.  With information technology there is no difficulty in having Irish and English versions of annual reports but the cost involved and the level of usage of the reports are putting an unnecessary burden <Col N="381"/>on their production.  It is money which need not be spent and it is not doing anything to encourage the use of Irish as a language.</P>
        <P>There has been progress in how the language has been taught in schools.  The requirement to have 40% on an oral test will be of great use in the future.  My inability to speak, despite the fact that my father was a native speaker and that I was born in the United States, has something to do with most people&rsquo;s conditional reflex &mdash; I use the term on purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator is like de Valera.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>People are more concerned with an tuiseal ginideach and the modh coinn&iacute;ollach than speaking the language freely and competently.  My concerns about making a speech like this in Irish are that issues such as tenses, plurals, the use of pronouns, the way the Irish language puts in letters just for the sake of it a lot of the time and the fact that it is a language which is from another language family from the predominant language in the country make it even more difficult for people.</P>
        <P>That said, our inability to teach Irish effectively and use the language in a more everyday sense can also be linked with our failure as a nation to properly address the use of other languages.  There must be a link between the failure to teach Irish properly and our failure to speak different languages effectively.  We share that laziness with our near neighbours in the United Kingdom and not the approach of our cousins on the European mainland where the speaking of three, four or five languages is a matter of course.  If their education systems can structure a system of language development and usage in that way, then very big questions need to be asked as to why we cannot do it here.  The strategy is an honest attempt at least to address those inconsistencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for the four scenarios outlined in the strategy, there is an onus on the Government to point us in a particular direction, whether that is an independent agency, a new office within the Department, developing existing bodies such as Foras na Gaeilge or trying to reconfigure &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which has a cultural and economic brief.  We need clarity, if it is a 20-year strategy, on which approach we should take.  I do not know what the Minister would think about my preference but, given the times we live in, we are moving away from the type of Government where we thought specialisms and parcelling out roles to quangos was the right approach.  We need to bring Government back to the centre in terms of making such policy decisions.  We need to use the type of skills that are in the public sector to which Senator Harris referred.  I also acknowledge the point he made, namely, that the work on developing the Irish language is as much about minority cultures as the prevailing ethos in the country.  The fact that from the late 19th century there was a Bible and Book of Common Prayer in Irish for the Church of Ireland while the Roman Catholic Church was still saying mass in Latin says something about who owns, loves and tries to promote the language.</P>
        <P>The real challenge is to divorce the development of Irish from being a political goal and make it a cultural goal.  I am confident that in the future when I have the time and ability to do so I will be able to speak with none of the three options which I outlined at the start of my speech.  I may have a combination of more confidence and Irish content, and confidence that we are going down the right road in encouraging a sense of ownership of the language among all our citizens.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Taca&iacute;m leis an g&aacute; le bearta chun cur le l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; sna cheantair Gaeltachta.

Labhair m&eacute; sa Teach an tseachtain seo chaite ar an gh&aacute; at&aacute; le Gaelscoil a fhorbairt i Rath T&oacute; i gContae na M&iacute;.

Nuair a d&rsquo;iarr m&eacute; ar an T&aacute;naiste aitheantas a thabhairt don scoil, d&uacute;irt s&iacute; liom go raibh &aacute;iteanna ar f&aacute;il i scoileanna B&eacute;arla i Rath T&oacute; agus go raibh caighde&aacute;n na Gaeilge sna scoileanna sin an-mhaith.  Iarrfaidh m&eacute; ar an Aire athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gceist seo, mar i mo thuairim is soil&eacute;ir gur bealach amh&aacute;in iad na Gaelscoileanna gur f&eacute;idir linn an sprioc de 250,000 cainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la a shroicheadh.  M&aacute; ligtear d&uacute;inn Gaelscoil a bhun&uacute; gach bliain le haghaidh 30 p&aacute;iste, tar &eacute;is 20 bliain, beidh 600 daoine f&aacute;sta l&iacute;ofa sa teanga.</P>

Faoi l&aacute;thair, de r&eacute;ir daon&aacute;ireamh 2006, t&aacute; thart ar 1.7 milli&uacute;n duine a bhfuil eolas acu ar an nGaeilge.  Sin thart faoi 30% de dhaonra na h&Eacute;ireann.  Cheap mise gur c&eacute;atad&aacute;n maith &eacute; sin ar dt&uacute;s, ach ansin d&rsquo;fhiafraigh m&eacute; d&iacute;om f&eacute;in c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go raibh an c&eacute;atad&aacute;n chomh h&iacute;seal nuair a d&rsquo;fhreastal gach duine sa St&aacute;t ar scoileanna ar feadh 13 bliain ar a laghad agus Gaeilge &aacute; fhoghlaim acu go laeth&uacute;il iontu.  Caithimid a r&aacute; gur theip ar ch&oacute;ras oideachais na h&Eacute;ireann sa ch&aacute;s seo, mar n&iacute;l aon Ghaeilge ag 70% d&aacute;r ndaonra, c&eacute; gur chaith siad 2,000 uair ag foghlaim na teanga ar scoil.  Rinne m&eacute; roinnt taighde <Col N="383"/>ar an gceist seo agus c&eacute; go mbraitheann foghlaim teanga ar an duine, ba ch&oacute;ir l&iacute;ofacht a bheith ag duine tar &eacute;is 1,000 uair a chaitheamh ag staid&eacute;ar.  N&iacute;l ag &eacute;ir&iacute; linn.  Mar sin, t&aacute; &aacute;thas orm a fheice&aacute;il go bhfuil b&eacute;im sa tuarasc&aacute;il ar na teicn&iacute;ochta&iacute; teagaisc a &uacute;s&aacute;idimid.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Hannigan for sharing time.  N&iacute;l ach beag&aacute;n Gaeilge agam but I welcome the opportunity to say a few words in English as somebody who understands some of the spoken language.  I would dearly love to be able to speak it fluently but I cannot, although I love the language and the way it is spoken.  It is a beautiful language.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the report and I recognised two issues at paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.  There is a common understanding that the language policy cannot be centrally regulated without the agreement and co-operation of the Gaeltacht and Irish language communities, including the voluntary organisations.  I agree with the two recommendations.  My nephews attended a Gaeltacht this year and I was very impressed with the report they brought back to me.  They were in Connemara and could have been very close to the residence of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, although they could not fully understand him.  Many people cannot.</P>

	<P>They were very impressed as no English was spoken for the three weeks they were in the Gaeltacht.  They struggled at the beginning but were delighted with their progress by the end.  This is not available to every student but it should be, and the Government should work to a position where every student would have an opportunity to go to the Gaeltacht.  Currently it is people who are better off or who have more of an interest in the language who avail of the teaching in the Gaeltacht.  This should be extended to every student and could be achieved by closing a college for a week or two weeks, with all the students sent to various Gaeltachts.  The Government and the Minister for Education and Skills in particular should consider such a move, as the lessons would be valuable.  My nephews brought this lesson home to me when they told me no English was spoken at all.</P>
        <P>There are many illiterate people in this country who can speak English.  The same is true of the Irish language, as many cannot write it but can understand it or speak it.  Much can be done in this regard.  I welcome this report and the Minister should provide the opportunity for students at some stage to go to a Gaeltacht.  This would strengthen the Gaeltachts and much progress could take place as a result.</P>

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go scr&uacute;d&oacute;idh comhalta&iacute; an Rialtais na molta&iacute; seo go c&uacute;ramach.  M&aacute; chuirtear i bhfeidhm iad, neart&oacute;idh siad an Ghaeilge agus cabhr&oacute;idh siad linn &aacute;r dtiomantas don teanga a choth&uacute; agus a fh&aacute;s.</P>
        <P>The Irish language is subject to an enormous onslaught by the media worldwide, whereby every culture is being saturated by the English language.  However, the worldwide web and modern communications technology are creative forces which we can use to exhibit the richness and value of the Gaelic culture and our consciousness.  We should not miss this opportunity.  I am confident, therefore, that the Government will carefully consider the proposals which, if implemented, will add to and strengthen the commitment to the Irish language.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of the recommendations made in the report spring to mind and on which I wish to elaborate briefly.  There is the recommendation that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta retain the primary function of developing the economy and infrastructure of the Gaeltacht.  I am not sure whether the Minister has done this, but it would be helpful to those who support the concept behind &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the wonderful work it has been doing through the decades if a statement of intent as to its future was made.  The Minister has made some comments in this regard, but perhaps he might elaborate on them with particular reference to the future role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One or two of the recommendations made caught my eye as being original.  It is proposed, for example, to locate a city and regional social centre in Dublin city with facilities for the arts, a cafeteria and other relevant facilities to aid the functioning of a social network for the youth of Dublin and surrounding counties.  It is an admirable idea, although I do not know how it would work in practice.  An infrastructure is being developed on a pilot basis in towns and <Col N="388"/>villages of youth cafes which are proving successful.  In my town of Drumshanbo a former courthouse building has been converted with the help of North Connaught Youth and Community Services and the County Leitrim Partnership and will provide facilities for the youth of the town and district.  It is an innovative idea which, even a decade ago, would have seemed like pie in the sky in a small town of 800 souls.  It is being replicated and enthusiastically embraced across the country where funds permit.  I have no problem with young people spending their leisure time in public houses, although if they are under 18 years of age, they should not be in them.  However, it is a sad fact of life that if one wants to play pool or meet one&rsquo;s school friends somewhere to have a chat, invariably it is the local public house which provides the facility in a small town or village.  In that context, this suggestion, although centred on Dublin city, is an admirable one and perhaps worthy of further consideration by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another recommendation which should be highlighted is that it should be confirmed that a policy of bilingualism will not apply in the Gaeltacht or be implemented therein by default.  I am not an expert in this regard, but there has been creeping colonialism since the foundation of the State.  It is akin to coastal erosion in that the natural and geographic hinterland of what was the Gaeltacht is being eroded.  At a time of seismic change in Irish society in the post-Famine period, Irish started to lose its place as the national language.  This was driven as much by emigration as the desire of parents for their children to learn Bearla to enable them to advance in the professions which our kind colonial masters were beginning to open up to the Irish peasantry.  By the time the State was founded in 1922, the Irish language was in decline.  It is a sad reflection on successive Governments that the policies adopted to retain, support and advance it have failed utterly to the point where it is now under threat.</P>
        <P>I strongly support the recommendation that we hold what we have.  Encroachment into the Gaeltacht happens in subtle ways.  In County Galway the council adopted a policy, although not without controversy, of ensuring those going to live in council houses in Gaeltacht areas would be able to speak a minimum amount of Irish.  That is perfectly acceptable, although it may not be to those looking to live in these areas.  If we are serious, therefore, about keeping what we have and building on its strengths, there is no room for a policy of bilingualism in Gaeltacht areas.  However, I am a strong supporter of pursuing a policy of bilingualism outside these areas.  In terms of ensuring the future of Irish in the rest of the country where it is not spoken as the first language, the best way forward for the Government is to adopt a policy of bilingualism.  I remember having a conversation on this point with Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh when he was chairman of Bord na Geailge.  He was a strong supporter of adopting such an approach and I was converted to the view that the best hope for the retention of Irish as a living language was to progress toward bilingualism and that people use their c&uacute;pla focal.</P>
        <P>I add a caveat and preface my remarks by saying I have always been treated with great courtesy and efficiency in my contacts with Departments.  However, on a number of occasions when I said, &ldquo;Dia duit, oifig an Aire le do thoil,&rdquo; I was met with bewilderment.  It might be the case that I did not speak or was not heard properly because, as 99.9% of calls are made as Bearla, people are not mentally tuned in when they hear Irish being spoken.  The usual response to my request is, &ldquo;Excuse me, what did you say?&rdquo;  I am not for one moment suggesting the telephone operators in Departments do not understand basic Irish, as I am sure it forms part of the requirements of the job in the first place because a policy of bilingualism is provided for in the Constitution and there is parity.  While I raise the issue, I am not sure what the answer is.  I am not for one moment suggesting a Taliban-type approach should be adopted and that a memorandum should be sent to Departments to ensure those who answer the telephones are proficient in Irish because I am sure they are.  This is where a policy of bilingualism can start <Col N="389"/>to flourish, by using simple language or, when addressing somebody in a letter, by using &ldquo;Pascal a chara&rdquo; iinstead of &ldquo;Dear Paschal&rdquo; and finishing by using &ldquo;Is mise le meas&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Yours sincerely&rdquo;.  These are small steps, but perhaps they might lead to a return to the culture which was part of the Irish psyche.  We have all come through the education system and spent 15 years learning the language, yet we are not in a position to speak it fluently.  Building on the basic structure in place is the way forward.</P>
        <P>I commend the report and the Minister for the manner in which he has highlighted the importance of the Irish language and his fluency in it.  The fact that he comes from County Kerry and his background as a teacher have been very helpful in that regard.  All I can suggest is that he keep up the good work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  C&eacute; nach bhfuil Gaeilge chleachtaithe agam, &uacute;s&aacute;idfidh m&eacute; c&uacute;pla focal anseo is ansi&uacute;d.  It is nice to hear Irish being spoken by so many Senators.  While I cannot speak the language as well as I should be able to, I understand it, even if I am much more familiar with Munster Irish than Donegal Irish.  </P>
        <P>The topic of the Irish language came up in a recent conversation I had with six or seven young people, all of whom were in their first or second year at university.  Notwithstanding the fact that all of them had passed Irish in the leaving certificate examination, only one or two could string two or three sentences together in Irish.  There is something wrong if, after ten or 12 years learning Irish at primary and secondary level, young people are unable to speak more than a few sentences of Irish.  I have been out of school longer than I wish to remember, but I could still string together more sentences in Irish than these young people who only recently completed their schooling.  Whether this is a result of the manner in which Irish is taught, the way in which children think of the language or some other reason, clearly there is something wrong with the system if people who have been taught it for years are unable to string together a few sentences of Irish.  I asked the young people in question how it was possible that they had passed oral Irish in the leaving certificate examination.  They informed me that one could pass the examination by learning by heart certain aspects of the syllabus.  Students practise the answers to questions they will be asked in the oral examination and, in many cases, do not understand the questions or answers.</P>
        <P>I do not know if having Irish as a compulsory subject is a turn-off.  It would probably be better if only those who wanted to learn Irish and whose heart was in learning it were taught it rather than pushing people to study the language against their will.  While it would be regrettable if students were not taught Irish for the leaving certificate, people must want to speak a <Col N="392"/>language if they are to make progress.  In that regard, the three or four weeks I spent on Inisheer learning Irish while at school were among the most enjoyable weeks of my life.  Although County Waterford has a Gaeltacht, we considered it better to travel as far from home as possible.</P>
        <P>Many of the recommendations made in the report of the joint committee are excellent, but I wonder if they will gather dust until another report is compiled by another committee in eight or ten years.  Strong support, not solely financial, should be provided for Gaeltacht areas because they do tremendous work.  Local authorities are to be commended for the positive role they have played in promoting the use of Irish.  Many of them provide Irish classes for members of staff who learn the language because they want to do so.  That is the secret of success.</P>
        <P>I oppose the requirement that local authorities and State bodies print copies of their annual reports in Irish.  This practice, provided for in law, is a waste of money.  The money required for printing could be used to promote spoken Irish rather than to print an annual report or booklet which only two or three people will request.  Surely such reports should be translated in some manner and then published on the Internet.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that students and teachers spend periods in the Gaeltacht in a manner similar to the system available for minority languages under the ERASMUS programme.  This is a good suggestion because teachers need to take regular refresher courses.  In many schools substitute teachers who are not fully qualified in Irish are instructing pupils in the language.  They are marking time, as it were.</P>
        <P>I commend the members of the joint committee who were involved in producing the report.  I agree with many of their recommendations and hope the worthwhile proposals made will be acted upon as opposed to being consigned to filing cabinets in the relevant Department.  I hope the teaching of Irish will be revamped because, sadly, the current approach is not working.  A complete rethink of the teaching of Irish is required, particularly as many students are leaving school unable to speak the language after spending years learning it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for being present for this Adjournment debate.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I attended the meeting of the joint policing committee in Cork at which I heard there had been a reduction in the number of people arrested for the possession and use of drugs.  That is welcome.  A couple of weeks ago the <i>Irish Examiner</i> published a chronological chart demonstrating the use of heroin across the country and it is fair to say we have a difficult task ahead in curbing its spread.  As the Minister said on previous occasions, the problem is encountered in all four corners of the country and across all sections of society.  It is reaching epidemic proportions, which is worrying.</P>
        <P>The number of heroin users doubled between 2002 and 2008.  It is difficult to comprehend how we took our collective eye off the ball and allowed this to happen.  Despite two national drugs strategies and giving more resources to the Garda, there has been a massive jump in the number seeking help for heroin addiction.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i>  broke down the figures by region.  In the mid-west there was a 310% increase; in the east, a 280% increase; in the south east, a 270% increase; in the midlands, a 260% increase, and in the south &mdash; my own area &mdash; a 240% increase.  The number of new treatment cases for opiates has risen from 21 to 71 in the <Col N="395"/>intervening period.  The Minister&rsquo;s adviser, Dr. Des Corrigan, has said the figures highlight the need for investment in treatment services.  However, I understand we have a difficulty with the budget.  In some regions there is a waiting list for treatment and access to methadone programmes.  While I understand we must be prudent financially, I am concerned that cutbacks will lead to a lengthening of the waiting lists and a curtailment of services and the activitiesd of local drugs task forces.  People are worried.  When the Minister was in Cork last Friday, he saw at first hand the importance of empowering local communities.  I know his background is in community work.  If we cut front-line services, we will accentuate the problem.</P>
        <P>I am glad we have recognised &mdash; belatedly perhaps &mdash; that this is not just a problem in Dublin city.  I was struck by the remarks, quoted in the article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, of Mr. Justice Murphy who said we must apply the rigour of the law.  He is right.  We must do so.  However, we must also prevent the scourge of heroin from spreading through the countryside.  If it takes root, it will create difficuties for myriad other services and communities and make further demands on them.  I am a former schoolteacher and director of adult education services.  I am also involved in the GAA.  I am worried that more and more young people are dabbling in drugs and poly-drug use.  I spoke to a couple of lads in my constituency in the last couple of weeks.  They told me readily where they could get drugs of any description, which is a concern.</P>
        <P>It is important that the education system is to the forefront in our drugs strategy.  I am worried, however, that we have missed an opportunity regarding the addiction services.  In that regard, I refer to Arbour House in Cork.  Tabor Lodge addiction centre celebrated its anniversary this year, but it needs more support.  Fellowship House in Cork city is still awaiting grant approval.  I am not being political, but we must support the provision of budgetary funding.  We spoke earlier about the Minister&rsquo;s role in the pre-budget talks on funding for the Irish language.  Equally, we must protect and assist services and people under pressure.  I commend the work of the local drugs task forces, those involved in the HSE and local garda&iacute; and hope we will not allow funding to be cut completely, as this issue is far too important.  We must fight heroin abuse.  In that regard, I hope the Minister&rsquo;s reply will be positive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  When I was in Cork last Friday, I availed of the opportunity to talk to the chairman and co-ordinator of the regional drugs task force to be updated on how things were going there.</P>
        <P>Heroin use remains a major problem.  All the indications are that while the use of heroin is relatively stable in the Dublin region, it has become more widely dispersed around the country, particularly in the major cities and towns across Leinster.  Responding to this problem is a priority under the national drugs strategy 2009-16.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to establish an accurate baseline for the prevalence of opiate use.  A report from the national advisory committee on drugs &mdash; Senator Buttimer referred to Dr. Des Corrigan &mdash; in December 2009 indicated that there were 11,807 known opiate users in 2006 but that there was considerable doubt about the number of unknown users, those who had not come into contact with the drug treatment services, hospital services or the Garda.  Similar issues have arisen in other jurisdictions.  A study is being carried out on behalf of the NACD to assess how best to estimate overall opiate user numbers.  I fully acknowledge that collecting data is very difficult.  A number of localised pilot schemes have been initiated and I hope they will provide the information clinicians and others need and that we can build on their findings in the next few years.  Given there has been some geographical spread of heroin use, an increase in the numbers seeking treatment outside Dublin was anticipated when the strategy for the <Col N="396"/>period up until 2016 was being put in place.  While there is an increase in demand, in many ways this reflects the efforts made to encourage heroin users into treatment.  Their entry into treatment at an early stage increases their prospects for positive outcomes.</P>
        <P>I fully accept the view that the provision of treatment services is vital to address the needs of problem drug users.  This is illustrated by the fact we have 9,400 people in methadone treatment, a very significant proportion of the known users.  New opiate substitution services have opened this year in Cork, Tralee and Wexford, and these will be followed shortly by facilities in Kilkenny, Waterford, Limerick, Dundalk and Drogheda.  This is being done by the HSE with financial support from my Department.  Further opiate substitution services in the midlands are being actively considered.  The methadone protocol is under review at present.  For the information of the House, I expect to have the experts&rsquo; advice shortly on that issue in regard to the recruitment of other doctors, methadone substitutes and so on.</P>
        <P>There were 464 people on waiting lists for opiate substitution treatment in October.  No people under 18 years of age are awaiting treatment.  In Dublin, 112 people are waiting for services, some of whom can access services in Dublin on demand, while the waiting time for others can be up to a month, which is in line with the target set under action 32 of the national drugs strategy.  Waiting times in other parts of the country will disappear or reduce significantly when the new services come on stream.  I acknowledge there are some areas where waiting times are unsatisfactorily long.  My office is working with the HSE to ensure those issues are addressed.</P>
        <P>My Department has also provided funding for the provision of a needle exchange and other services in Drogheda.  Services commenced there in October and will cover the north east.  Progress has also been made towards providing a comprehensive needle exchange programme throughout the country and on the expanded provision of rehabilitation services, including detoxification facilities in counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Cork and Limerick.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE has also allocated additional resources in 2010 to develop front-line addiction services, with a particular focus on those under 18 years of age.  This includes additional psychology services, counselling, outreach services and family therapy in each regional drugs task force area.  Meanwhile, an independent review of the methadone treatment protocol, which has served us well since it was put in place in 1998, is being carried out.  On finalisation of the review, I hope to see further improvements in the provision of the services in the coming years, including a greater focus on facilitating exit from methadone treatment towards rehabilitation, where appropriate, with the consequent freeing up of places for further clients.  I have referred to the need for continuing care and inter-agency co-operation.  While this is improving, there is a good way to go yet.</P>
        <P>I hope that, notwithstanding the current financial constraints facing the public service, the target of having 100% of problem drugs users accessing treatment within one month of assessment by 2012 will be achievable.  With respect to rehabilitation, the national drug rehabilitation implementation committee has developed a framework through which to address the needs of individuals in recovery.  The overall objective is to seek to enable service providers to offer a range of integrated options tailored to meet the needs of service users through individual rehabilitation care plans.  A series of pilot projects is being developed to assess the proposed integrated care pathway model with a view to informing further the protocols and agreements required to implement the model nationally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue&rsquo;s Customs and Excise continue to tackle the supply of illegal drugs, including heroin.  They are also targeting the gangland activity associated with this <Col N="397"/>supply.  I stress my determination to continue to tackle the issue of heroin use in the coming years and I am confident that the actions outlined and the broader implementation of the national drugs strategy will continue to facilitate this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank all the national, local and regional drugs task forces and all the volunteers who work with them and their co-ordinators for the work they are doing.  It is a slow and difficult task but I believe they are making progress.  I pay tribute to the journalist from the <i>Irish Examiner</i> who has repeatedly highlighted the issues, always in very well researched articles.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to focus specifically on the issue of drugs services in the north east, especially in counties Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, and how these compare nationally.  I say this having met various groups in Drogheda and the north east which have raised serious concerns with me about the treatment for drug addicts and the path for addicts into the future.  As I have explained to the Minister previously, I will be a trustee in developing a Liberties-style recycling programme in Drogheda which focuses on providing a service for addicts to help them see the light at the end of the tunnel and rehabilitate themselves.  There is confusion in providing community employment schemes dealing with addiction services for recovering addicts, which is a key issue I would like the Minister to address.  While F&Aacute;S is informing the Department that it is adding addiction scheme places, it is not focusing on community employment schemes for addicts and recovering addicts.</P>
        <P>We must address the issues.  I have met a wide variety of addicts in the course of my work as a Senator in recent months.  Some of the people I went to school with spend the time from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. looking at the four walls.  Being a recovering addict can be a very lonely place and this can be a problem in that addicts may slip back into old ways.  The investment the State makes in them initially is wasted because we do not have a follow-through path for them.</P>
        <P>I am also working with the group of Pastor Amos Ngugi who is providing rehabilitation services for the new Irish, specifically for addicts, and I helped to launch his poster campaign two months ago in the Holy Family centre in Ballsgrove, Drogheda.  Pastor Amos is focusing on the cohort of new Irish, many of whom still have not sorted out their citizenship.  They have the same problems as many addicts in that it is a long day, a long week, a long month to sit about with nothing to do.  Invariably, some fall into the trap of addiction, whether that is through alcohol or drugs, including light drugs, which often lead on to harder substances.</P>
        <P>In his previous reply, the Minister referred to the prevalence of heroin.  I am very concerned that in certain parts of the north east, as well as in other parts of the country, the problem of heroin is exploding.  People would be gobsmacked if they were aware of the problems in various provincial towns.</P>
        <P>The Minister should address what we as a Government, country and society are doing to tackle the scourge of alcohol.  We all talk the talk and say alcohol is terrible and should not be abused.  The reality is different.  I am 27 years old and when I left school nine years ago, this was a huge issue.  Whether in regard to junior certificate parties or other parties, more young people are getting into serious states of drunkenness, which has many consequential problems.  From my work and liaison with the RAPID co-ordinator in Drogheda, I know she sees at first hand the problems where parents have grown up with this as an issue.  They might get up at<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="398"/>2 p.m. and come downstairs to take alcohol or even cannabis with their children.  What example does this set for our young people?</P>
        <P>We need a serious debate.  Scandinavia has made it incredibly difficult to access high alcohol content drinks.  The two vehicles for reducing consumption of alcohol are increased price and limited access, which are the two paths we must pursue.  As a Government, we must focus on this area.  People feel it is uncool if a person says he or she does not drink, and if the person says he or she is a Pioneer, people think that person has two heads.  We must consider getting people on board who can sell our message, whether this involves sports stars from GAA and rugby or famous actors and actresses, and using them as role models for young people to aspire to.  Even sports people might believe they can train hard for a few months and then go on a drinking session for a week.  We must tackle this problem because it causes so many problems.</P>
        <P>The reality many people have refused to accept is that alcohol is the first step to many harder drugs, whether cannabis, heroin or speed, which raise a gamut of issues.  I would like the Minister to address those points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the issues that arise in the north east which are of particular concern to me.  I was in Drogheda in July and met the same group as the Senator.  I was concerned when I heard about the experiences of some of the addicts.  I compliment the Ana Liffey Drug Project in Dublin which has come to the aid of the strategy and is providing services with the help of the HSE and my Department.  We will be building on this work shortly.</P>
        <P>Solid progress is being made on the implementation of the various actions of the national drugs strategy across its five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to address problem drug use in a comprehensive way.  From the establishment of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2002 up to 2009, in the region of &euro;197 million was made available for drugs initiatives, in the main through local and regional drugs task forces.  I am satisfied that the drugs task forces are continuing to make a positive impact on the drugs problem and a further &euro;36 million has been made available by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs this year.  In excess of &euro;31 million in current funding has been made available to fund the activities of the task forces, of which &euro;21.045 million has been allocated to the local drugs task forces and &euro;10 million to the regional drugs task forces.  This funding will support some 500 initiatives that the task forces have prioritised for investment in their respective areas.  In this regard, it should be noted that the steering group for the national drugs strategy recognised the key role that the local and regional drugs task forces have played in addressing the drugs problem in recent years and &ldquo;believed that the Drugs Task Forces will continue to play a strong role in the coming years&rdquo;.  I am a great believer in the local and regional task forces.  I acknowledge that both are stretched, geographically and in terms of resources.</P>
        <P>The allocations for the north eastern regional drugs task force, NERDTF, were &euro;590,000 in 2006 and &euro;1.04 million in 2010.  The Senator will note the somewhat reduced allocations in 2009 and 2010 which reflect the pressures on the public finances.  I advise him, however, of the sustained incremental funding in previous years which facilitated, <i>inter alia</i>, the rolling out of projects and initiatives in the regional drugs task force areas, the introduction of new initiatives and responses to address cocaine usage, measures to support rehabilitation and the ongoing investment in capital projects.  These are recognised by the Government as key initiatives to support communities to address the harm caused by problem drug use and deliver meaningful solutions.  Our primary concern has been and continues to be the protection of front-line com<Col N="399"/>munity-based services delivering vital programmes and initiatives in the areas worst affected by problem drug use.  I am satisfied that the investment being made, including &euro;1.04 million made available to the NERDTF, will continue to address problem drug use in a meaningful and real way and protect front-line services to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P>In terms of a national comparison between the north-east region and the national position, from a funding perspective, total funding has more than doubled since 2006 across the regional drugs task force areas, notwithstanding the reductions in 2009 and 2010.  I understand from the task force that, given the reduced budget for 2010, following similar reductions in 2009, the NERDTF had a renewed focus on ensuring projects delivered consistent and effective services across the four counties of Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan.  In some areas, this led to restructuring of services in order that there would be a clear focus on ensuring there were small multidisciplinary teams in place in each HSE local health office area which would be able to respond to the needs of their community and work co-operatively with other key service providers.  This transformation could not have been achieved without the support of the voluntary sector addiction service providers which proved their willingness to adapt to the new requirements.  I am additionally informed by the NERDTF that it now has in place key front-line services which are able to ensure people who are experiencing difficulties due to their addictions and who are willing to address them can quickly access a range of addiction services in a localised community drug and alcohol team setting.  These core front-line services consist of the Meath Community Drug and Alcohol Response Project, the Cavan/Monaghan Drug Awareness Project and the Louth community drug and alcohol team.</P>
        <P>In addition to the work of the NERDTF which is funded by my Department, HSE addiction services in the north eastern counties are provided through a range of services.  These include an addiction service for counties Louth and Meath managed by the Louth local health office under the direction of the drug service facilitator; an addiction resource centre in counties Cavan and Monaghan, managed and delivered through the mental health services; and a methadone programme in the north east providing services for counties Louth, Meath and Cavan and Monaghan, managed through the Louth local health office.  I understand HSE expenditure on the addiction services for counties Louth and Meath was just under &euro;800,000 in 2009 and &euro;500,000 on the addiction resource centre for counties Cavan and Monaghan and that 1,111 clients from the north-east region received treatment for drug and alcohol use.</P>
        <P>My Department has also provided funding for the provision of needle exchange and other services in Drogheda.  The service commenced there in October and will cover the north east.  I look forward to continuing co-operation with all drugs task forces, including that in the north east, and greatly appreciate the work being done.</P>
        <P>Let me address the four issues raised by the Senator.  The Liberties-style initiative and the community employment scheme issue are linked.  The initiative in the Liberties is long established and based on rehabilitation, well thought through strategies and the use of community employment schemes.  There are 1,000 ring-fenced community employment schemes nationally for drug misusers.  I am working with representatives of F&Aacute;S on the oversight group on drugs which I chair.  We are working on how we can ring-fence community employment scheme places nationally to assist the rehabilitation of drug misusers.  I will be happy to discuss how we might go about doing this with the Senator.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the new Irish, the oversight group has recently produced a report on what we call communities of interest, including the new Irish.  Issues have arisen as part of the study that need to be addressed.  They will have to be incorporated into the strategy, both at regional and local level.</P><Col N="400"/>
        <P>The Senator referred to alcohol abuse.  When I was in charge of the national strategy some years ago, I started the process of trying to align the national drugs strategy with an alcohol strategy.  That process is well advanced.  A group co-chaired by the Department of Health and Children and my Department is working to prepare a draft strategy and a number of significant recommendations have been made.  The draft report is all but ready.  However, some of the recommendations will be challenging.  There are already fears among some groups, including sports organisations, that some of the traditional funding streams for sponsorship, etc., might be interfered with.  More important, we will be addressing the issue of the accessibility of alcohol and the fact that it is increasingly the gateway drug used by most people.  When I visited a treatment centre in Clare recently, I met a woman who told me she had taken her first drink of alcohol at 11 years of age.  It was given to her by her mother.  As the Senator rightly stated, the mother was smoking cannabis.</P>
        <P>I am under no illusions about what lies ahead, but I am anxious to have an aligned alcohol and drug misuse strategy in place in the new year.  There are a number of locations at which groups have come forward offering to pilot the strategy.  If the Senator or anyone else has an area in mind in which a pilot project could be rolled out, I will be more than happy to work with him or her and try to provide resources.  In County Donegal there is very good group, the North West Alcohol Forum, which does extremely good work.  It is very important that we work with local groups to determine whether we can design local solutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ana Liffey Drug Project for filling a gap in the Drogheda drugs service.  When one looks at the figures, one thinks they are very good, but one should realise much of the funding goes on wages, for example, not on front-line services.  Some believe the community employment scheme to rehabilitate drug users is bad, but it is my experience that it often provides the peer support and network required which make a big difference.  I look forward to working with the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue to which I refer relates to the proposed radiotherapy centre at Altnagelvin, County Derry, in which services for the people of the north west will be provided.  The proposed project is being undertaken on foot of discussions between the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and her counterpart in the North, the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Michael McGimpsey, MLA, and following the exertion of pressure by community groups and two cancer support groups in County Donegal to highlight the need for such a centre in the north west.</P>
        <P>The background to the project has been highlighted in detail in the past.  Patients in the north west who are suffering from cancer and require radiotherapy or chemotherapy are obliged to travel to University College Hospital in Galway and to Dublin in order to avail of the relevant services.  It is unacceptable that sick people from north-west Donegal, particularly Inishowen, are obliged to make round trips of at least 400 miles in order to receive treatment in Dublin.</P>
        <P>A service level agreement was established as part of the national cancer care programme, NCCP, which led to patients from County Donegal being able to avail of services at Belfast City Hospital.  However, this has proved to be neither workable nor realistic, particularly in the light of the difficulties in travelling to and from Belfast and a host of other factors.  I am delighted that a further service level agreement has been reached by the Ministers, North and <Col N="401"/>South, and that it is proposed to develop a new centre at Altnagelvin which will service the north west.</P>
        <P>Representatives of the cancer support group Co-operation for Cancer Care NorthWest met the Minister for Health and Children last week.  In the light of the fiscal and budgetary circumstances in the Republic and the North, I am interested in discovering whether plans to build the new centre by 2015 remain on course.  According to the business case made for the centre, provision has been made for one third &mdash; 400 &mdash; of its patients to come from County Donegal.  Will the Minister indicate whether we remain on target to meet the 2015 timeframe, what the next step in the process will be, what the current position on the North-South co-operation aspect is and whether tenders for the project will be sought in the near future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  </P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to set out the current position on the proposed radiotherapy centre at Altnagelvin and radiotherapy services nationally.  On average, approximately 23,000 new cases of invasive cancer, including non-melanoma skin cancer, are diagnosed each year.  Current trends indicate that the number of cancers diagnosed annually is likely to double in the next 20 years.  It is against this background that the HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme, NCCP, is being implemented.  The goals of the programme are better cancer prevention, detection and survival rates through a national service based on evidence and best practice.  Part of the programme is implementation of the national plan for radiation oncology, NPRO, originally agreed by the Government in July 2005.</P>
        <P>The NPRO will provide the national infrastructure for radiation oncology for the next 25 years approximately.  Phase 1 involves the construction of new facilities at Beaumont and St James&rsquo;s Hospitals, with four linear accelerators in each.  The new centres will be completed by the end of the year, at which time some staff and resources from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will transfer to them.  The two new facilities and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will then form the St. Luke&rsquo;s radiation oncology network for Dublin mid-Leinster and Dublin north east.  It will provide adequate capacity to deal with patient needs until at least 2015.</P>
        <P>Phase 2 of the NPRO will provide additional radiation oncology capacity at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont Hospitals, Cork University Hospital and Galway University Hospital, with satellite centres at Limerick Regional and Waterford Regional Hospitals.  It is recognised, however, that for patients in the north west there are particular geographic concerns which must be addressed.  For this reason, the Government also decided in July 2005 that the best way to improve geographical access to radiation oncology services for patients in the north west was through North-South co-operation.  It was decided, therefore, to facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital for patients in need of radiation oncology treatment.  A service level agreement has been in place with Belfast City Hospital for the provision of radiation oncology services for patients from County Donegal since 2006.</P>
        <P>The Government also decided that it would progress the consideration of a joint venture between North and South for the provision of services from a satellite centre in the north west that would be linked with Belfast City Hospital.  In 2008 Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Michael McGimpsey, MLA, announced that a new satellite radiotherapy centre linked with Belfast City Hospital would be established at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry as part of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s plans for the provision of radiotherapy services beyond 2015.  At the time the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, agreed to fully explore the opportunity presented for further collaboration in the delivery of these <Col N="402"/>services.  The business case for the development at Altnagelvin has been finalised and is awaiting approval by Minister McGimpsey.  The Minister for Health and Children has committed to providing a capital contribution for the project in recognition of the fact that approximately one third of the patients who will attend the Altnagelvin centre will be from County Donegal and surrounding areas.  In addition, the NCCP will contribute on an agreed basis to the operating costs in respect of patients from the Republic of Ireland who attend the service.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children and the NCCP have nominated representatives to the various sub-groups overseeing the development of the project.  The NCCP advises that the discussion of patient pathways will include an input from clinicians at Letterkenny General Hospital and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital currently involved in the delivery of radiotherapy services to patients in Letterkenny.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children is committed to the development of the radiotherapy centre at Altnagelvin and radiotherapy services nationally.
