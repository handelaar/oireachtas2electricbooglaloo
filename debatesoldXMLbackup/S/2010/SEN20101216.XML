      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on public transport, specifically Dublin Bus, when the House returns after the Christmas break.  Dublin Bus recently set about changing its routes.  I am aware of reductions in service in parts of Dublin, especially in the Lucan-Palmerstown area.  The deterioration in service being experienced by people in the area gives rise to major competition issues and the Minister must come before the House to discuss them.  A private company which operated in competition with Dublin Bus in the Lucan-Palmerstown area is no longer operating and Dublin Bus has withdrawn certain services, resulting in a significant deterioration in the local bus service.  People are beginning to use their cars again because the bus service is ineffective.</P>
        <P>In raising the Government&rsquo;s record on reform I refer specifically to recent newspaper reports and information that has emerged on appointments to State boards.  The Government talks about reforming politics, including the Seanad, yet here we have the same old story of appointments being made without a transparent process.  The Government has not acted on the suggestion of the Green Party that appointments be made by way of committees.  Approximately 300 people are to be appointed to State boards by the outgoing Government without transparency or reform of the appointments process.  This is not acceptable and I ask the Leader and Deputy Leader to exert influence on the Government in this matter and show they are serious about reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The House has debated air traffic, flights, etc., on a number of occasions recently.  I ask the Leader to walk down the road to his neighbour, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary of Ryanair, and ask him whether he misled us.  While I accept people from Castlepollard would not promulgate untruths&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. O&rsquo;Leary is the most successful man in County Westmeath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Leader is not defending him.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary promised to deliver 6 million additional passengers to Ireland if the airport travel tax was abolished.  His response to last week&rsquo;s decision by the Government to reduce the air travel tax from &euro;10 to &euro;3 was to cut six routes out of the country.  The same individual told us he would save Shannon Airport, but he cut the number of flights from the airport as soon as the publicity ended.  He also played footsie with Cork Airport and is doing the same with Kerry Airport, from which he has blocked flights.  Will the Leader ask him if he has any conscience with regard to how he does business with people?  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary believes politicians treat him contemptuously.  I felt a degree of sadness on his behalf when I read an interview with him in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers in which he states he is being got at by politicians.  I do not hold him in contempt as he is doing a fine job for himself.  He is, however, misleading people, which raises questions about the reason he repeatedly makes promises only to walk away from them. </P>
        <P>Perhaps we will have an opportunity to discuss the issue of euro bonds in later debates.  The Government should sit down the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and take her through a potted history of the past 100 years.  It should explain to her the reason the Common Market, now the European Union, was founded and tell her that everyone needs to pitch in to address Ireland&rsquo;s problems and create stability.  Euro bonds must be introduced.  If we have a single currency, we should have a single bond.  Some little Irelanders such as my colleague, Senator Ross, may be taken aback when I question the need to have 29 separate central banks in the European Union.  Would it not be sufficient to have one central bank making appropriate decisions?  The nationalist Senator Ross will have difficulties with this proposition, but we should recognise that currency matters are only one part of what we do.  Taking sensible decisions on behalf of the people would not result in a loss of sovereignty.  One such decision <Col N="626"/>would be an agreement on the introduction of euro bonds.  Another would be to recognise that we do not need 29 central banks replicating decisions across Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a personal request to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is not an appropriate forum for the Senator in which to make a request to the Leader.  He should do so in writing or consult him privately in his office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate early in the new year on four reports on special care units for children which were published yesterday by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  They make for disturbing reading and identify significant failings in four separate centres with regard to how they are managed and staffed and in the training of those running and working in them.  I accept that many good people work in such care units.  However, the State faces a severe problem.  As Jamie Smyth reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, the sad thing in reading the reports is that the children in question appear to feel more at risk in the units than they felt in the community.  That is a shocking statement which the House must acknowledge in drawing conclusions on how these units are managed and operated.</P>
        
      
        <P Just="Left">I note an extraordinary statement made by the Minister of State with responsibility for children yesterday. It was extraordinary but at a time when many extraordinary things are being done and said one often misses some.  The Minister of State responsible described the service as &ldquo;drifting and lacking leadership&rdquo;.  He shares responsibility with the Minister for Health and Children from whom we never hear about these issues.  Of course, he might have described many other matters in the present Government as &ldquo;drifting and lacking leadership&rdquo;.  Those words are not mine but his.  Clearly, there should be a debate on the issue in the House as soon as possible in the new year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer briefly to the manner in which the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill 2010 is being dealt with by the Houses, given that it has been ordered for today in this House.  Does the Leader agree it is extraordinary that, after many months of debate, argument and concern about the banking system and the wider economic crisis caused in the main by the banking crisis, only now are we debating the issues contained in this Bill and the mechanisms that need to be put in place?  There is no question that many of the items in the Bill are necessary but they were necessary months if not years ago.  Looking at the explanatory memorandum which lays out the different issues that form the basis of this Bill, one could not disagree about the need for legislation on any one of them.   However, what happened?  We have had two years of the most torrid revelations, controversy, argument and so on, yet we have none of the legislation we need.  In its dying days this Government published the Bill on a Tuesday, brought it to the D&aacute;il and passed it on a Wednesday, will introduce it to the Seanad on a Thursday and wants it to be passed.  Three days are awarded for public debate on the Bill. I heard Ms Gillian Bowler today stating this legislation will be controversial and will be debated throughout the country.  However, it will not be debated for very long in this Chamber.  Three days were given for consideration--</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of such extraordinary and important legislation.  I emphasise my point is not that the legislation is not important, rather it is the opposite.  It is so important that it is wrong that the only people who appear to have debated these issues are the Minister for Finance, the Attorney General and, presumably, the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on cancer services, focusing on prostate cancer which affects thousands of men.  It is the most diagnosed cancer in men and the statistics are worrying.  One man in six will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and the cancer is responsible for more deaths in men than any other cancer.  There is no standard screening in place and the current blood test for those who present is unreliable and does not adequately address this killer disease.  The good news is that with awareness and standard screening, especially new DNA screening, more men can be diagnosed.  Early intervention means positive results.  I call for a special awareness programme and regular screening of all men in the susceptible age category.</P>
        <P>I remind the Leader that I have sought a debate on obesity and related issues, particularly the need to improve food labelling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Fitzgerald stated today, the prospect of the stuffing of so many State boards in the dying days of a Government or of any Administration is appalling.  It is totally unseemly, does nothing to inspire confidence and is very damaging to politics.  We are in enough trouble as it is without the unseemly haste with which this is to take place.  The process is entirely lacking in objectivity, not to mention transparency.  At a minimum, it should be halted until there is Oireachtas scrutiny.   That is what should happen and, obviously, should apply also to any new Administration.  The opportunity must be given to the new Administration to amalgamate and perhaps abolish a number of these boards.  There must be less government and we must cut size.  I appeal to the Leader to allow a motion in this House to alert the Government and halt this process.</P>
        <P>I shall refer briefly to the matter raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I, too, do not wish to mention names but perhaps, as suggested, the Leader might see the individual in question over Christmas.  It is a public interest matter because a public service obligation, PSO, is involved.  What happened in Kerry is tragic.  This business cut out the opposition because its rates were so cheap. Now it has cut flights and we can see what is happening to our tourism as a result.  I strongly support the spirit of what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said regarding that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the House to discuss the Government&rsquo;s response to the decision this morning by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  The court ruled that Ireland has failed to implement the constitutional right to abortion where a woman&rsquo;s life is at risk.  I understand Ireland has always complied with the constitutional ban on abortion.  This decision taken by the court today is very serious and the Minister should respond as a matter of urgency.  Another constitutional amendment may be required that could run in conjunction with the general election next year.  It is a very important issue and I hope the Minister will give an early response in this House to this major decision by the European court at 10.30 a.m. today.</P>
        <P>I commend two very brave garda&iacute; in Cork, Garda John O&rsquo;Sullivan and Reserve Garda Peter Clifford, who rescued Mrs. May O&rsquo;Gorman in Murrough Lane, off Blarney Street.  I ask the Leader to send the best wishes of the House to the two garda&iacute; through the Garda Commissioner, complimenting and commending them for their bravery which was above and <Col N="628"/>beyond the call of duty.  They rescued the woman from being burned alive in an alleged arson attack on her home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Leyden has drawn attention to very significant news.  This is a most serious matter.  There are people with deep and profoundly held convictions on both sides of the issue.  It touches the most serious level of our life and our values as a people.  I very much hope that unlike some previous occasions when this matter was discussed, it will be done in a calm rational way with respect for divergence of opinion and that whatever solution may be arrived at will be in the best interests of the people.</P>
        <P>Can the Leader give us any indication as to whether the immigration Bill will come before the House?  Will it be before the Government ceases to exist?  It is a complex and controversial Bill.  This morning I listened to Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy delivering her thought for the day.  She was very reflective and instanced a case which I believe we all know about of an asylum seeker who was deported on foot of a traffic offence.  That does not seem to me to be at all proportionate and the sooner we have proper legislation in this area the better.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I completely agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole about euro bonds about which I have spoken.  If the euro strengthens so will the financial community within the European Union, just as happened in the case of the development of the state of Germany out of a series of small German states,  Prussia, in particular.  A type of centrifugal force is involved.  It started as a customs unit and continued.  In my view, that progress is inevitable and we should stand together.  We have not seen much in the way of comradeship or solidarity from our European partners, with particular regard to the excessive rates being forced on the Irish people in order to pay for the speculative banking habits of some of the largest European banks.  This is wrong and intolerable.  The euro bond is a measure that should be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise again the issue of corruption in sport, on which I have been ruled out of order several times.  As recently as last night, in a football match between Motherwell and Hearts, a player was sent off.  There has now been a formal investigation into the incident by both the Association of British Bookmakers and the Scottish Football Association because of suspicious activity on the betting markets.</P>
        <P>I beg the House&rsquo;s pardon.  I cannot speak because there are so many conversations taking place.</P>
     
        <P>While we are not drawing any conclusions regarding the player at the centre of the allegation, I seek a debate on the need for an international agency to combat organised crime in sport.  Too many issues are arising right across the board in this regard.  I have had informal discussions on the subject, even with sports associations in Ireland.  I declare an interest in that I am chair of the youth and sport committee of the Council of Europe.  It has been charged with putting together a report on this matter.  If Ireland, a very good sporting nation, does not have an opinion on it, there is something seriously wrong.</P>
        <P>Perhaps it is just good luck that someone bet &euro;500 that there would be a red card and it just happened to pay off.  There was no abnormality found in the betting market but when this specific case was examined, it was concluded that there was a lot of suspicious activity.  With exchange betting, it has become easier for people to bet on small incidents within and between games, thereby opening up massive opportunities for very serious crime and very serious allegations of match fixing.  These should not go unnoticed and should be very much exposed to ensure the integrity of sport.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join Senator Fitzgerald in asking for a debate in which the Taoiseach would explain why, in the dying days of the Government, 300 people, mainly friends of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, are to be appointed to boards.  The old pals act continues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should ask a question of the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am asking for the Taoiseach to come to the House to explain why the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, in its dying days, is going to fill 300 vacancies with its pals.  Has the Government not learned anything from the mistakes in the banking sector and from the way the economy has plummeted through the lack of regulation and the cosy cartels involving members on the Government benches?  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>In the budget, debated in both Houses, the Government again missed an opportunity to reform the political system.  It funked it regarding salaries and the lavish expenses of Ministers and their entourage.  It did not have the bottle to introduce a referendum on Seanad abolition.  It has no credibility on reform.  This morning it is carrying on as if it were business as normal.  It is not business as normal.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point on Ryanair is very valid.  The Government was wrong to introduce the travel tax.  It reduced it by 70%, in fairness to it, but it still kept it.  Is the Government serious about working with the stakeholders in the aviation industry to bring tourists into this country?  If so, it will take up Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s proposition and meet Mr. O&rsquo;Leary.  More important, the Leader will arrange a meeting between Mr. O&rsquo;Leary and the Minister.  While we know Mr. O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s relationship with the Government is bad, the Leader could be a bridge builder to bring in more tourists to this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues for a very good debate yesterday on the fishing industry and thank the Leader for organising it.  Bearing in mind the fishing industry is one of Ireland&rsquo;s smaller industries, I note the great support received from my colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Even Senator Norris was very encouraging.</P>
        <P>I would like a broad debate on farming and fishing.  The fishing sector can, in the next five years, provide over 20,000 jobs, provided there is a level playing field.  Unfortunately, vessel numbers are declining.  For example, the number of vessels fishing from Castletownbere port has halved in the past decade and the number of people involved in fishing has reduced by more than half, yet the number of enforcement officers has quadrupled.  Our farming and fishing sectors are subject to more stringent compliance regimes and regulations than any other EU country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the new year, I would like to debate the provision of jobs.  The stimulus to reactivate the economy will come from indigenous natural resources, such as farming and fishing resources.  These served us well in recessions in the past and there is no doubt they will do so again.  I am absolutely encouraged by the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick, returned from Europe with a very positive package that was heralded and lauded by the fishing industry nationally.  This is positive in these recessionary times.  We must do something to encourage the development of mariculture, aquaculture and the fishing industry generally, and the development of value added products in agriculture.  Such development can serve as a stimulus in that jobs will be created if we ensure the rules and regulations are as fair in Ireland as they are in other EU countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Fitzgerald in calling for a debate on Dublin Bus services and Bus &Eacute;ireann services to the commuter towns.  Recently, during a cold snap, we saw the fantastic services these companies provide to commuters from places such as Ashbourne and Dunshaughlin.  The bus is the only means of transport to work for these commuters <Col N="630"/>when they cannot use their cars.  Another cold snap is due next week.  I am sure the bus companies will do their utmost to get people to their destinations.</P>
        <P>I would like to extend the debate to include future transport provision in the capital.  Yesterday at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport representatives told us about their proposals to meet the city&rsquo;s future transport needs.  A recent review by the institute concluded that the prioritisation of schemes should be considered.  It feels the DART extension should be considered more favourably and sooner than metro north.  This would be a very interesting debate.  I am still not convinced that the cost-benefit ratio for metro north indicates we should proceed with this project straight away.  We could benefit from a debate on this.  I ask the Leader to arrange one.</P>
        <P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in calling for a debate on euro bonds.  When we debated the Lisbon treaty some years ago, reference was made to the spirit of solidarity.  It was asked whether countries in trouble would receive help from their fellow EU member states.  We said at the time we would not send military assistance but other forms of assistance.  Now is the time for us to receive assistance from other European countries.  I invoke the spirit of Article 222.  I was glad to hear Martin Schulz, chairman of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, of which group my party, the Labour Party, is a member, state this morning he would be in favour of considering euro bonds.  Ms Angela Merkel is a member of the European People&rsquo;s Party in the European Parliament, of which party Fine Gael is a member.  Between people such as Ms Merkel, Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Schulz, we could negotiate a better deal than the one that was done last week on the ECB loan.  I encourage the leaders of the Labour Party and Fine Gael to talk to their European counterparts to determine whether we can secure a better deal.</P>

	<P>I too call for a debate on the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights this morning regarding one of the three women who took an action over her right to an abortion in circumstances where her life might be threatened.  One of the three women had her rights upheld by the court.  There has already been talk of a constitutional referendum.  I am not sure this is what is needed in this case but the court&rsquo;s findings are binding and it may place an onus on Ireland to issue guidelines to the effect that a woman whose life is threatened and who is constitutionally guaranteed the right to an abortion in such circumstances may have to be facilitated.  This would involve a huge change in how Ireland has traditionally addressed this issue and it would give rise to a major moral debate among many people.  Talk of a constitutional referendum may be previous but there is no doubt that we face a very serious debate on this most serious matter.  It has been brought into very sharp relief by the binding nature of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights this morning.</P>
        <P>I seek guidance from the Minister for Defence on the role of the Army if the cold weather returns.  In recent weeks in Dundalk, a barracks town, the Army played a very important role in keeping the streets clear.  There may be a role for the Army in outlying areas around the country.  Small businesses have been badly affected by the cold weather at a critical time of year and we need to do all we can in an attempt to keep our smaller towns open for business, where county councils may not have resources, particularly at night time.  I was contacted by a restaurateur in Ardee, who is terrified of another cold snap in the run-up to Christmas during what is the make or break time of year.  I would appreciate if the Leader could give guidance in this and seek to make use of the Army in this civil matter to as wide an extent as possible.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to convey to his party that it should consider the difference between the verb &ldquo;Is&rdquo; and the verb &ldquo;T&aacute;&rdquo;, the former being a permanent position and the latter being a contingent condition.  People put up with minor corruption when an economy is booming but the smallest bonus in the public sector arouses major public anger.  Everything must be considered in context now.  The three main parties have certain obligations to the people, who have shown in polls that they require large degrees of consensus on delicate matters such as the Northern Ireland peace process.  Resolving the matter of appointments to State boards is easily resolved.  If the Government insists on appointing people to State boards, it will find the level of public anger will be of the same degree as the anger about bonuses in the public sector and it will cost the Government parties dearly at the polls.  Common sense should tell them to think twice.</P>

        <P>I endorse the remarks of Senator Norris about taking the European Court of Human Rights issue out of the public domain coming up to a general election.  It is bad news all round.  There should be general agreement to park this away from a general election.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct in his point about this being an endorsement of the constitutional position but in the incendiary exchanges in this House, we can already see the potential for trouble.  I appeal to all parties to take it off the agenda for the election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reassure Senator Harris and others that it is the stated policy of Fine Gael, with regard to these appointments, that there is provision for an interview before Oireachtas committees.  I echo the calls of Senators Fitzgerald and Coghlan that, at this 11th hour, the Government refrains from stuffing the State boards and different agencies with political appointments and cronies.  This kind of politics has mushroomed in the past 12 years when we saw a substantial growth in the number of State bodies to which appointments can be made.  It is unseemly and I ask the Government to refrain from it before the election takes place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of this morning&rsquo;s decision by the European Court of Human Rights, I understand that the court has upheld the right of one of the applicants to an abortion based on her medical need, which is based on the decision in the X case a number of years ago.  In that case, in interpreting the Constitution, it was decided that if there was a real and substantive threat to the life of a woman, she was entitled to an abortion under the Constitution.  That is the logic used by the European Court of Human Rights.  That is already the constitutional position in this country.  I agree with Senator Harris that this issue should not be used politically in the next few months but perhaps it could be cleared up legislatively.  The Constitution already provides for this.  This morning&rsquo;s judgment is a confirmation of the position.</P>
        <P>I echo the sentiments of Senator Paddy Burke, who asked for a discussion on the funding of local authorities.  In the past ten years, a number of items of legislation have been introduced in this House with regard to how local authorities operate, how they are funded and how they are structured.  We have seen a proliferation of directors of services and extra remuneration for top management in local authorities while the functions they provide have been stripped back because funding has been cut.  It seems that the reforms of the past ten years have not worked in local government.  We must go back to a much fairer and older system of local authority management in this country.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate at the earliest possible opportunity in the new year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the stuffing of State boards with political appointees.  It is a thing of the past.  The Leader will say that in the last Fine Gael-Labour Party Government some 100 people were appointed.</P>

What is being proposed is old politics.  The stuffing of State boards with political appointees and hacks, without any scrutiny, should be a thing of the past.  Perhaps my proposal will fall on deaf ears but I ask that these appointments be halted until such time as there is proper <Col N="633"/>scrutiny of the people concerned.  That should be done and we should have reform of the political system.  It should start with this point.  The people of Ireland are sick and tired of this jaded type of politics and cronyism and it must change.  The Government should take heed of what the people want in this regard.</P>

	<P>I seek an urgent debate on mortgage debt arrears.  The Law Reform Commission recommended abolishing imprisonment for people who cannot pay fines.  This is a welcome recommendation.  The body proposes that a new, non-court system should be set up for personal debt.  This is a major issue for a variety of people, particularly over the past two or three years.  I welcome the proposal of the Law Reform Commission, which comes up with a number of good ideas over the years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another proposal concerns a debt enforcement office to help people and small businesses to reach agreement with creditors.  This is an issue the Leader knows a lot about.  The revised Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears got lost during the budget debate.  This is a huge issue for people in Drogheda and east Meath, who are concerned about their family homes.  Senator MacSharry has done a lot of work on this over recent years but protecting family homes is a priority for every Member of the House.  After the report of the Government&rsquo;s expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt, and now the new revised code of conduct, strict procedures must be introduced by the lending bodies.  That is welcome and it is up to us in the Oireachtas to ensure it is implemented.  I look forward to a debate on this issue as soon as possible.</P>

Also the extension of DART services has been suggested. I will have no difficulty in having a debate about this after the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Callely raised the issue of prostate cancer.  I certainly support his call, particularly looking at the American statistics that demonstrate one in six will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime but only one in 34 will die from it.  These are alarming statistics and we must highlight them and this is an ideal opportunity for this House to play a leading role.  I will certainly have a debate on prostate cancer on the Order Paper within the first two weeks after the Christmas recess.  He also called for a debate on obesity which I will have no difficulty in including when the Minister for Health and Children next visits the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Fitzgerald, Coghlan, Buttimer, Harris, Phelan and Cummins asked about reform to the system of appointments to boards.

I acknowledge the huge effort and contribution made by men and women down through the decades in a voluntary capacity in most cases.  From the experience of the HSE, and many of us in this House have been members of health boards, all of these appointments must be answerable.  We as politicians are answerable on an hourly and daily basis to our electorate and we must go for an endorsement every so many years.  We must have an answerable system and I have no difficulty debating this in the House because it is in the best interests of the taxpayer in the long-term and I fully support many of the calls made this morning.</P><Col N="634"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan and Buttimer spoke about the challenge laid down by the Government to Ryanair and its chief executive.  I fully support the Government in its challenge.  The opportunity is now being made available for one of the most dynamic Irishmen of all times to see how he will answer the call in the national interest, as well as in Ryanair&rsquo;s interest.  I will make the case personally to him over the Christmas recess.  I have always acknowledged the wonderful achievements Ryanair has made towards tourism over its lifetime in this country.  No one has done better than what it has done and we must increase the tourism figures and his company and Ryanair can play a serious, important role in what they can do for us to recover from the downturn in trade that we are all experiencing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Norris and Hannigan asked about euro bonds, with Senator O&rsquo;Toole asking if we needed 29 central banks.  This can be debated when the Minister for Finance is present this afternoon.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris asked about the immigration Bill and I will try to find out about this today.  Senator Keaveney spoke about corruption in sport and the need for an international commission to regulate the alleged abuses in sports.  The integrity of sport must be protected and in fairness to the Senator, she is a champion of this cause at this time and I fully support her.  We should be doing whatever we can to help and assist her.  The alternative to the abuse of alcohol, drugs and everything else is all sports related.  As I often have said, the greatest gift one can give the body is to have it fit.  I fully support anything we can do to promote sport in the country.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan spoke about the huge opportunities for job creation in the fishing industry.  I thank everyone who participated in that debate last night and supported the Minister and I too wish to congratulate him on behalf of Members for his achievements in the EU in bringing back a very good deal in very difficult times for the industry.  It is an industry where there are huge job creation opportunities and we should be doing everything we can.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Dearey spoke about the role of the Army in view of the very cold spell we are having at present, in helping and assisting those small villages and towns, particularly retailers who are on their knees because of what is happening.  The first two weeks of Christmas saw terrible weather and there was no business.  There was one weekend, last weekend, and now the weather forecast is very inclement for the next four or five days.  Our hearts go out to the people running these businesses and certainly I will pass on the strong views of this House that Senator Dearey has brought to our attention to the Minister for Defence later today regarding the wonderful work the Army is doing.  It should not just be in the large towns; the Army should reach out and help people in villages and smaller towns.</P>
        <P>Senators Burke and Phelan asked about local authority funding.  This is a huge challenge for local authorities as we all know, and there should be a return to the older ways, where the county engineer had more authority in the running of the affairs of councils, rather than the director of services system we have at present.  That is something we can discuss when we have the debate.  Matters of urgency in the funding of local authorities present an ideal opportunity this evening for discussion on the Appropriation Bill.  That is a crucial item that must and should be discussed on the Appropriation Bill.</P><Col N="635"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Carroll spoke about the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on withdrawing penalties from those unfortunate families who find themselves in arrears and are sent to prison.  I fully support the proposals of the Law Reform Commission and the Senator's remarks, particularly for the many thousands of people at this time who find themselves in such serious difficulties with mortgage arrears.  These tens of thousands of people do not have any peace of mind when they are in difficulty with their repayments and we should be doing anything we can do to help them until the downturn is finished and gone.  I welcome the report brought to the House&rsquo;s attention this morning by the Senator.</P>

	<P>For many obvious reasons, I thank Members of both Houses for their interest in ensuring the Bill&rsquo;s swift passage.  </P>
        <P>Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill amend the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 to provide that enforceable conditions can be included in the order of the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board for the conditional discharge of a person detained in a designated centre under the 2006 Act.  The Central Mental Hospital is the only designated centre under the Act.  The new section 13B to be inserted in the 2006 Act by section 8 of the Bill provides for the return of a person to the Central Mental Hospital where he or she is in material breach of a conditional discharge order.  It provides that, where a person is in material breach of a conditional discharge order, the clinical director of the designated centre must make arrangements to effect the <Col N="636"/>person&rsquo;s return to the centre, including, where necessary, with the assistance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The purpose of the amendments is to clarify the Garda&rsquo;s power of arrest under section 13B.  This matter was raised during the debate by Senator Bacik, to whom I will respond.  The amendments will ensure persons arrested under the section can be transferred by the Garda into the custody of the staff of the designated centre.</P>
        <P>The main amendment in the group is amendment No. 1; the other amendments are technical drafting amendments.  It is proposed that, under subsection (6), a garda may arrest without warrant a person whom he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects is unlawfully at large under section 13B.  The new subsection (7) provides that the person must be transferred into the custody of an officer or a servant of the designated centre or an authorised person for the purposes of effecting the return of the person to the centre.</P>
        <P>The amendments do not materially change the provision, but, on reflection and after listening to the debate in the Houses, it was deemed necessary to ensure section 13B clearly set out what should happen to a person arrested under the section.</P>

        <P>The purpose of these amendments to section 8 is to clarify that the safeguards provided under the new section 13B will apply to a person in material breach of a conditional discharge order who voluntarily returns to the designated centre just as much as they are to apply to a person who is returned involuntarily.  The safeguards ensure a person who returns or is returned will be brought before the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board as soon as possible after his or her return to have his or her detention reviewed.  They also ensure the person will be subject to all of the provisions of the 2006 Act just as if he or she was being detained under the Act for the first time.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We welcome the passage of the Bill, in particular the provision that conditional discharge orders may be made.  We thank the Minister of State for taking the time to deal with the issues raised.  I am glad that section 3 was amended on Committee Stage in <Col N="637"/>the Seanad in recognition of the point made that people should be capable of being detained in places other than the Central Mental Hospital.  This was an important Government amendment on foot of amendments tabled by the Labour Party.  I am sorry, however, that the District Court retains the power to detain.  We had a full debate on the matter and the expert advice received by the Labour Party was that the District Court should not retain this power.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is sympathetic on the most significant issue, namely, that we should not use the outdated word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; in any 2010 or 2011 legislation dealing with persons with a psychiatric illness.  Both he and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform stated they would keep the matter under review and that the word would be changed in a larger Bill.  Given the short term the Government has left, it is disappointing that it has not been changed in this Bill.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment to substitute the term &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; for &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; might have helped.  Having said this, I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their work.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

        <P>I agree with Senator Bacik that use of the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; is inappropriate, but creating new terminology will be difficult.  The Minister of State is well aware that use of the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; leaves a stigma.</P>
        <P>I thank all those involved in the Bill&rsquo;s passage.  I thank the Minister of State and his staff and my Opposition colleagues for a very fair hearing and a worthwhile debate on this issue.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators and I will respond to some of the points made.  I accept completely that in 2010, using the word, &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; gives the wrong impression.  I also acknowledge the point made by Deputy Shatter on Committee Stage when he reminded us that it has taken us 15 years to get to this point and I accept we could have done more.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a positive note, the major review of the Act begins now; therefore, whoever will be in government will have that facility open to them to make all these necessary changes which I acknowledge should have been implemented sooner.  The legal advice we received warned of legal implications which could not be dealt with at this time.  I do not use this as an excuse because it contradicts all we are doing in an effort to effect a sea-change and in the national campaign to eliminate the stigma associated with mental health.  The nationwide campaign aims to remove the stigma and the connotations associated with the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo;.  This issue will be dealt with in detail in the review.</P>
        <P>It was very clear to me that all sides of the House and all those who participated in the debate in both Houses wanted this legislation put through as quickly as possible for all the obvious good reasons, such as to give people conditional discharges which is one of the most important aspects of the Bill.  It became very clear to us the genuine commitment of people to ensure that centres other than the Central Mental Hospital should be designated and I accept the amendments in that regard.  This will all help to reduce the stigma as individuals were referred to the Central Mental Hospital when they could have been referred to other areas if this legislation had been brought forward some years ago.  There may have been better out<Col N="638"/>comes for individual lives if they were not required to attend the Central Mental Hospital in the first instance.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the points made by Senator Bacik with regard to the District Court and that the higher courts could have allowed for referrals to different centres.  With regard to the need for extra security I was not prepared to take that proposal for fear it might be the wrong direction to take.  The major review begins immediately.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Members. I thank in particular two officials from my Department, Ms Valerie Fallon and Ms Tracy O&rsquo;Keeffe, who regularly explained the most intricate details to me in very ordinary language which is much appreciated.</P>

    <Title>Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill 2010: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government statement on 28 November announcing the EU-IMF programme for Ireland included as part of the bank recapitalisation and restructuring measures the commitment to prepare specific legislation to support immediate restructuring actions.  This legislation has now been published as the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill and received D&aacute;il approval last night.  I can appreciate that some Senators take exception to the fact that the measure is being rushed through the House with considerable speed and expedition.  It went through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the same way yesterday.  However, it is important that we reflect on the nature of the crisis that emerged in the Irish financial position in recent months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position with regard to banking issues was made very clear to us with the gradual erosion of the deposit base of the banking system and the insistence by our European partners that we take immediate action to address this issue.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In respect of the fiscal position, the necessary actions were taken in the four year plan for national recovery and in the budget.  In the case of the banking crisis, the immediate actions can be dealt with under this legislation.  This is why it is urgent.  The various approaches taken by the Government to date through the guarantee scheme, recapitalisation and the establishment of asset relief through NAMA were all specifically endorsed by the EU, the IMF and the ECB.  However, if a criticism was made of us it was that we did not move with sufficient speed and expedition in these matters.  We had many leisurely debates, sometimes too leisurely, on previous banking measures.  This legislation enables us to take swift and immediate action.</P>
        <P>The detailed recitals contained in the Bill set out the fundamental rationale for this legislation.  They highlight the relentless negative effect of the banking crisis on this State&rsquo;s economy and the need in the public interest for strong measures to resolve the continued serious threat to the stability of the financial system generally.  The preamble to the Bill strongly underlines the need for the functions and powers provided under the Bill to effect a reorganisation of the guaranteed domestic credit institutions in the context of the National Recovery Plan 2011-14 and the European Union-International Monetary Fund Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, consistent with EU state aid requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Senators will be aware, the key elements of the programme include an immediate and significant recapitalisation of the banks; stringent stress testing and rigorous validation of <Col N="639"/>asset valuations, which may result in further recapitalisation, as required; and a substantial downsizing of the banking system by way of the identification of non-core bank assets and the disposal or run down over time of these assets.  The powers provided in the Bill allow the Minister for Finance to execute key aspects of the agreed support programme for bank restructuring.  Direction orders may be issued to relevant institutions to take or refrain from taking any action in support of the Government&rsquo;s banking strategy.  Transfer orders may be issued in respect of relevant institutions&rsquo; assets and liabilities to facilitate the restructuring of the banking sector.  Consistent with the terms of the support programme, subordinated liabilities orders can be made under particular conditions to achieve appropriate burden sharing by subordinated creditors in relevant institutions which have received State support.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the House to a particular policy priority under the Bill, namely, ensuring that the reorganisation and restructuring measures are recognised in other EU member states through the mechanisms available in the European Communities (Reorganisation and Winding-up of Credit Institutions) Regulations 2004, which implement the credit institutions winding up directive, CIWUD, in Ireland.  This is an important issue because many agreements entered into by Irish credit institutions are governed by the laws of other EU member states.  It goes without saying that all the powers provided under the Bill must be implemented in a manner fully consistent with EU state aid requirements.</P>
        <P>In any situation where a Minister is provided with strong powers, as is certainly the case in this Bill, there is a need for appropriate judicial oversight of the exercise of these powers.  The Bill ensures significant judicial supervision of any proposed orders that the Minister prepares.  In respect of each of the four orders for direction, special manager, transfer and subordinated liabilities, they are provided for and are to be utilised in a manner which is fully consistent with our legal and constitutional framework.</P>
        <P>Any proposed order under the Bill must be confirmed by the High Court, which must be satisfied regarding the legal process undertaken, including in relation to securing the views of the affected institutions and the reasonableness of the Minister&rsquo;s proposed decision making within the framework of the overall Bill.  Moreover, the High Court may set aside, amend or vary an order if it thinks it appropriate and an affected party can apply to the court within a five-day period to have the High Court order set aside.  These orders may be subject to judicial review or appeal to the Supreme Court.  There are restrictions on when judicial review and an appeal may be made.  This approach is in keeping, for example, with the measures adopted in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 and in planning legislation.  Therefore, the exercise of the Minister&rsquo;s powers is conditional upon High Court scrutiny and approval by way of High Court order, including through the participation in the courts of affected parties.  Importantly, court orders made under the legislation will be recognised in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The powers provided under the Bill are fully in accordance with the Constitution.  In addition, section 53 will ensure the effective operation of the Bill.  Any orders made by the court must be aligned in an appropriate manner with legislation on the Statute Book in order to avoid any actual or perceived conflict of laws.  Section 53 ensures clarity and certainty on how the strong powers provided under the Bill interact with the existing legal framework.  The purpose of section 53 is to ensure the implementation of the powers in the Bill is consistent with the technical and procedural requirements in existing provisions in any other enactment, rules or other relevant legal documents which might otherwise apply to the business of credit institutions.  This is important because any inconsistency will be an obstacle to the implementation of the orders which can be made under the Bill.  For that reason, unless otherwise provided, the provisions in the Bill have effect notwithstanding any other provisions in any other enactments, rules of law, codes of practice, listing rules, memoranda and articles of association or any other agreement.  It should be obvious that section 53 is an essential provision of the Bill. <Col N="640"/> There is no question whatsoever that it usurps the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas by enabling the Minister to make orders that make or change laws.  These powers are reserved to the Houses of the Oireachtas by our Constitution.  The Oireachtas will be amending existing enactments, rules or other relevant legal agreements in this Bill.  The orders referred to in section 53 are orders of the High Court.  While the Bill provides that the Minister can make a number of proposed orders in respect of directions, special management, transferred and subordinated liabilities, only the High Court can make orders under the Bill.  The orders that the High Court can make on foot of my proposed orders relate to matters which are clearly and comprehensively set out in the legislation.  There can be no doubt that section 53 is a necessary and proportionate provision in the Bill overall to ensure the efficacy of these orders to intervene in the business of credit institutions.</P>
        <P>I will address the key provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 sets out the definition of a number of terms used in the Bill.  A key definition in this section is that of a relevant institution.  Section 3 provides the Minister with the power to prescribe any body corporate with a registered office in the State as a &ldquo;relevant institution&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill.  Section 4 sets out the purposes of the Bill which I have already outlined for the House.</P>
        <P>Section 5 safeguards the independence of the Governor of the Central Bank.  Section 6 provides the Minister with the discretion to agree a framework to govern the relationship between the Minister and the Governor in regard to the exercise of the Minister&rsquo;s powers under the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 2 of the Bill addresses the making of direction orders.  While important powers of direction are available to the Minister for Finance under the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, it is important to strengthen the legal basis for that power of direction under the Bill.  Section 7 sets out the circumstances under which the Minister can make a proposed direction order.  Sections 8 to 11, inclusive, set out the procedures for the court to make a direction order on the terms of that proposed order.</P>
        <P>Part 3 is an important part of the Bill because it gives the Minister for Finance the power to appoint a special manager with knowledge, expertise and experience of the financial sector to take over the management of a relevant institution where the Minister believes this is necessary for the preservation or restoration of the financial position of that institution.  This is an important legal innovation because it provides a mechanism that can be used as an alternative to nationalisation.  The special manager is required to operate the institution in a manner consistent with the objectives of the Bill, thus helping to ensure the conduct of the special management is at all times underpinned by the public interest in the maintenance of financial stability.  Sections 20 to 24, inclusive, provide for the special management arrangements.</P>
        <P>Part 4 provides the Minister for Finance with powers to take certain actions in respect of the subordinated liabilities of relevant institutions to which financial support has been provided under the Credit Institution Financial Support Act 2008.  The purpose of this Part is to achieve appropriate burden sharing with holders of subordinated debt in the relevant institutions under the particular circumstances set out in the Bill.</P>
     
        <P>Part 5 gives the Minister the power to make a proposed transfer order which would transfer all or any of the assets and liabilities of a relevant institution where the Minister believes it is necessary to achieve the purposes of the Bill.  Section 38 provides for the provision by the Minister for Finance of financial incentives to a transferee but the Bill is clear that any such financial assistance is a debt due and owing to the State by the transferor.  Part 6 addresses potential existing administrative and legal requirements whose effect might otherwise impact adversely on the achievement of the aims of the Bill.</P><Col N="641"/>
        <P Just="Left">I especially draw Senators&rsquo; attention to a key section &mdash; section 48 &mdash; which provides that the overriding duty of directors of relevant institutions will now be to the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the State, to have regard to certain purposes of this Bill.  Prior to the enactment of this legislation, the primary duty of directors had been to the bank company.  Part 7 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.</P>
        <P>Section 51 provides that nothing in any enactment or rule of law can prevent the Minister for Finance from imposing any terms and conditions relating to the provision of financial support which would be desirable in the public interest.  Where the taxpayer is providing extensive support for an institution, there will be grounds for the Minister for Finance to impose conditions on that support in regard to bonuses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 52 is an important section the purpose of which is to ensure orders made under the Bill are consistent with the EU credit institutions winding up directive, as I have previously outlined.  Sections 55 and 56 are important and allow the Minister for Finance to exclude a particular institution as a relevant institution under some or all of the provisions of the Bill for a specified period or to declare that the Minister will not exercise all or any of the powers conferred under the Bill in respect of a specified institution for a specified period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 59 provides that the fact the Minister has made or proposes to make a proposed order under the Bill must be kept confidential.  Sections 63 and 64 provide for the limitation of judicial review and of certain rights of appeal to the Supreme Court.  Section 67 is required to comply with the loan agreements with the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility under the EU-IMF support programme.  Section 69 provides that the provisions of the Bill, other than sections 51 and 67, will cease to have effect from 31 December 2012, or later if decided by a resolution of both Houses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill provides for the amendment of a number of other enactments.  The building societies legislation is amended to facilitate the conversion of building societies into private limited companies.  Section 72 amends the Central Bank Act 1942 to allow the Central Bank to share confidential information to facilitate the Central Bank, the Minister, the Governor, the head of financial regulation or a special manager.  The amendment of the Central Bank Act 1971, under section 73 of the Bill, is proposed to facilitate a more expeditious transfer of a banking licence holder&rsquo;s business, including assets and liabilities not directly associated with its banking business.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the changes to the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 under section 74 of the Bill are to ensure the Minister for Finance can provide financial support other than by means of direct guarantees and assistance and, in particular, can provide financial support through the normal capital markets structures.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the amendments to the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, under section 75 of the Bill, is to limit the right of appeal to the points which the High Court certifies for appeal to the Supreme Court.  It also requires that any appeal be determined by the Supreme Court acting as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the administration of justice.</P>
        <P>Section 76 of the Bill provides for a number of amendments to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 to enable the Minister for Finance to suspend or reduce the annual contribution to the fund for the duration of the programme; to direct the National Pensions Reserve Fund to invest in Government bonds; and to direct the National Pensions Reserve Fund to make payments to the Exchequer for capital expenditure purposes for the duration of the programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of these amendments is to facilitate the State&rsquo;s own contribution to the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland over the next three years.  It is without question that the powers being provided for the Minister for Finance under the Bill are extensive.  They <Col N="642"/>are, however, targeted and proportionate to the scale of the challenge we face.  They are subject to consultation with the Governor of the Central Bank and within a clear framework for appropriate judicial oversight.  It is important to note the programme also requires us to prepare and publish bank resolution legislation of a more comprehensive and final character by the end of February.  The Governor will have a central role in that legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the current emergency, the Minister for Finance, whoever it may be, must take responsibility and be accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the substantial sums of money entailed by our commitment to this programme.  For that reason, the powers are conferred on the Minister for Finance in this legislation rather than on the Central Bank.  Those powers will lapse at the end of 2012 and much of this legislation is, in substance, resolution legislation.  Specifically the provision dealing with the assets and liabilities of banks and the power of the Minister to direct a bank to sell or dispose of assets or liabilities can facilitate very wide-ranging restructuring of the banking sector.  I am sure Senators will agree it is of fundamental importance that the Minister for Finance should be equipped with the range of legal powers necessary to continue to maintain financial stability in the State.  That is the aim of the legislation before the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House but regret I will not be in a position to hear the Second Stage contributions of Senators.  I will conduct Committee and Report Stages when I hope we can have a constructive debate in elucidating some of the sections in the legislation within the limited period of time available.</P> 
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and thank him for his contribution.  Given the reference he made to the ECB-IMF support plan for the country, I invite him to make one comment later in the day.  A growing number of people are saying that our country was bullied into accepting some form of a deal.  I hear it increasingly from young people, who I am looking to represent.  Parties on this side of the House would argue that if we formed a new government, we would have the right to go back to the authorities and look to renegotiate elements of it.  The Minister may agree or disagree with us on this point.</P>
        <P>One point on which we must be united, however, is that there is a vast difference between other authorities, no doubt acting in their own self-interest, forming a resolution in Ireland and bullying our country.  That shines no light on our country and encourages some kind of feeling of victimhood which, at this stage in our plight, is the last thing our country needs and it must be strongly rejected.</P>
        <P>I refer to the timing of the legislation.  The programme this country agreed with the IMF and the ECB states that this legislation needs to be in place by next February.  If the deadline is next February, why was this legislation brought in now?  The explanation the Minister gave was all about the need to provide a framework to accelerate and put in place further amounts of capital into our banks.  We have been putting capital into our major banks under the current legislative regime.  If the current law works in regard to the injection of capital into our banks, why is this new law required?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The shareholders can be overruled in this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  What will happen between now and early next year which will require the Minister to override those shareholders?  I would appreciate it if the Minister would come back to this later.  As I said, the injection of capital alone is allowed under the current framework.</P><Col N="643"/>
        <P Just="Left">The second reason the issue of timing is very important is that the special resolution mechanism, about which the Minister spoke, is in place in many European jurisdictions.  In the three most prominent cases where it has been triggered &mdash; Northern Rock in the UK, Fortis Bank in Belgium and Hypo Real Estate in Germany &mdash; the shareholders and the stakeholders in those banks initiated strong legal action against those governments and fought them bitterly in their legal system to ensure this mechanism was not implemented. Notwithstanding what the Minister said, that is why it is wrong to put through legislation as important as this so quickly.  As we have seen in other jurisdictions, this has been robustly challenged and has ended up delaying what the governments have sought to do in each case.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The UK implemented legislation such as this more than two years ago in February 2008.  On the one hand, we have had a long delay since the UK and other countries implemented the legislation while, on the other hand, there is a major rush to get this legislation in place, for reasons about which I am not clear, within a time period shorter than that to which we committed a number of weeks ago.  Clearly, this legislation is needed because the normal insolvency or commercial laws to deal with companies under commercial pressure will not work for a bank.  The reason, as we all know, is that the failure of a bank poses a far larger systemic threat to the stability of the economy and the country than the failure of an ordinary commercial business.  Last February&rsquo;s IMF report stated: &ldquo;The introduction of special resolution regimes in individual countries can reduce the overall fiscal burden incurred in resolution and is likely in and of itself to be conducive to more effective management of cross-border failures&rdquo;.  This type of legislation is needed and works in other jurisdictions, but it needs to be implemented with care and scrutinised carefully because it is so important.  We will be opposing the Bill in order to ask for more time to debate it.</P>
        <P>The literature on such legislation in other jurisdictions outlines a number of central features that are required.  The Bank of England produced a report on the matter last summer specifying the requirements of this kind of legislation as including clear objectives; triggers for initiating the regime; a resolution toolkit; different options; the ability to effect partial as well as whole-bank property transfers; and the ability to deal with the issue of cross-border banks.  In many cases these boxes are ticked by the Bill; however, there are some legitimate concerns that I will address on Committee Stage, but I also want to raise them now.</P>
        <P>The first concerns the nature of the relationship between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and the Minister, in particular.  In the corresponding legislation in other jurisdictions the person or body that implements it is not the Minister for Finance or the Department of Finance &mdash; it is not the Treasury in the United Kingdom but the British regulatory bodies.  Here we have gone for a very different model.  In particular, section 6 of the Bill which allows the Minister to lay down written guidelines for the Governor of the Central Bank is very strong and a unique development.  In other countries where similar legislation has been in place for some time the regulatory bodies have been capable of delivering it.</P>
        <P>The second issue I want to discuss further relates to the timing of the legislation and when it will kick in.  Equivalent legislation elsewhere offers a government the ability to intervene before a bank reaches the point where it would pose a systemic threat to the financial stability of a country or an economy.  Examples include what happens in France where the regulator has the ability to provide a special manager &mdash; as the Bill provides for &mdash; before a bank becomes insolvent and poses a threat to the stability of the entire financial system.  Similar regulations are in place in Switzerland.  Other jurisdictions such as Italy also offer the ability for a moderated form of this legislation to be used when a bank is capable of taking or about to take actions that could make it pose a grave threat to the surrounding economy and other banks.</P><Col N="644"/>
        <P>The third point relates to the purposes of the Bill and the prominence of Anglo Irish Bank and the way it is described.  I am beyond puzzled, if not intrigued and disturbed, to see the statement in section 4(<i>c</i>) that the purposes of the Bill include: &ldquo;to continue the process of reorganisation, preservation and restoration of the financial position of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited begun with the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009&rdquo;.  On what future path for the banking system are we laying out an objective that specifically includes restoring the health of Anglo Irish Bank?  Only a few weeks ago Commissioner Olli Rehn &mdash; or an equivalent in another body &mdash; said he was looking forward to and believed he would see the day when the presence of Anglo Irish Bank would be removed from the economy completely, yet we are now introducing legislation that seeks to restore the financial position of the same bank.  If we have time later, I would definitely like to tease out this matter.  We need to understand why the Government believes this is an objective worthy of inclusion in the Bill and its future banking policy.</P>
        <P>There is similar legislation in many jurisdictions.  While the Bill&rsquo;s proposals have much in common with what has happened elsewhere, there are also many important points of difference, notably the primacy of the Department of Finance, its failure to provide for intervention before a bank reaches a grave stage and the specific numeration of a particular bank with the objective of restoring it to financial health.  Even though similar legislation is in operation elsewhere, when it is implemented &mdash; the next Government, regardless of the parties involved, will need to deal with bondholders and shareholders &mdash; it will be vigorously contested in court.  With that in mind, it is imperative that we take a more careful and deliberative approach to tease out the issues involved.</P>
        <P>While the legislation allows the Government to initiate a process of debt sharing with subordinated bondholders, it does not allow this to take place with senior bondholders.  We have had a discussion about why that might be possible or not possible here and elsewhere on many occasions.  In recent weeks the weight of international and, in particular, European opinion on the matter is beginning to adjust.  Yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> quoted a very prominent former German Minister and German MEPs stating they wanted a mechanism to be put in place to restructure senior banking debt.  Mohammed el Erian who runs a large investment fund in America and is tipped to be given a prominent role in the IMF has also laid out the need to find a way to restructure senior banking debt.  We could find ourselves in a position where the weight of international opinion is moving in a different direction from that taken here, while we have legislation that confines itself only to subordinated bondholders.  That is an omission that should be accounted for and addressed later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I am glad the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was able to join us earlier and that he will be returning to take Committee Stage when other points can be made.  Senator Donohoe was very measured and eloquent in his contribution in which he made some interesting points which I am sure the Minister will address in detail on Committee Stage.  On the weight of public opinion in focusing on burning senior bondholders, I do not consider that a number of articles in the <i>Financial Times</i> or a number of individual views represent the weight of international opinion that Ireland should be a laboratory experiment to see what would happen if we were to default.  On another occasion I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, cited the example of Argentina which defaulted and decided to seize all savings in hard currency and replace them with 25 pesos in the dollar.  That is what happened when it chose to default and it still cannot get money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>

      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Senator is not.  However, he asked for a debate on the issue.  I am informing him of this point of view which is other than that of the former German Minister and the MEPs the Senator mentioned.  I would not be in favour of it.  Argentina is not able to access money on world markets and is dependent on others; President Ch&aacute;vez of Venezuela may have extended it a conditional loan.  It is not the way forward for us.  It remains the case, obviously, as the House will be aware, that senior bondholders are on the same legal basis as depositors.  If there was to be a eurozone-wide new approach to senior debt then, of course, that is something that could be debated, but at this moment I would be fundamentally opposed to us being the guinea pig to see how it might work out for others.  Just because the <i>Financial Times</i> or has beens in the political or financial world advocate it does not mean it is necessarily the correct position.</P>
        <P>The Minister has gone through the legislation before us section by section.  Clearly, there are issues with it.  Clearly, there are issues with the time being allocated to debate it.  That was an issue in the other House.  There are many hours since it was first published and there has been ample time for people to go into the various sections.</P>

	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;because it gives the people the level of control and influence in the banks for which many of us have yearned for the past number of years.  It is welcome in that regard. It vests the people's power through the Minister in controlling aspects of the banks which is much needed.  As with other measures in recent weeks, with the support from the IMF and the EU, it provides us with the basis to give us that point of inflection for which many of us have yearned for the past three years to move forward from this crisis.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Clearly, there are measures within the Bill that are Draconian.  The Minister mentioned the nature of some of them.  Clearly, there must be consultation between the Central Bank and the Minister on a number of measures, and that is also to be welcomed.  However, I am confident that for the year that these powers exist, we can move forward to restructure our banking system and finally begin to put behind us the mess which has been our banking system for the past few years.</P><Col N="646"/>
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P Just="Left">On the issue of directing the sale of assets within the financial institutions, I caution that there should be serious debate over which assets are disposed of.  There might be a concern that some good aspects of these institutions may be sold because they are more saleable at this time, about which I have concerns.  While the Minister can clearly direct this, I ask that when it arises some level of debate take place because I fear there might be a tendency to sell the family silver.</P>
        <P>I welcome the subordinated bondholders sharing of the pain.  Of course, the Bill also gives effect to the Government&rsquo;s decision during the week on bonuses for AIB, and that is also welcome.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the opportunity to contribute on Committee Stage.  I welcome the legislation as a further step in the right direction.  There is a public demand to bring some kind of closure to the banking situation.  It has been fluid.  It has had to be.  The goalposts have changed many times throughout the past couple of years.  I hope that with this legislation we can move quickly and decisively to draw that line in the sand and recreate our banking system on a level which is consistent with the needs of our economy and which, finally, caters for businesses and families throughout this country which require credit lines to function.  I hope we can move with these powers to do that quite quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not want to misrepresent him, Senator MacSharry stated that it often occurred to him that this type of legislation ought to have been introduced before now, and I share his sentiments in that regard.  He is absolutely right.</P>
        <P>On many occasions the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, have sat here in this House.  I must sit down at some stage, if I ever have time, and go through the debates because I can recall on many occasions the robust resistance from the Minister and the Government on certain policy choices which Members on this side were advocating, particularly on intervention in the banks.  I remember being told, in fact, almost to the point of being ticked off, not by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, but by others, about the extraordinary reputational damage that would be caused to Ireland, for example, by any signal that there would be substantial State intervention in the banking system at an early stage in the crisis, that this could not happen, that the reputational damage this would cause would be extraordinary, and that we were doing a disservice to the State by even talking about it or advocating it.  Sadly, many months of reputational deterioration for this country later, the Government has found itself in a position where it must make these decisions.  The difficulty is that if these were decisions that had been made in a timely fashion they would not look like decisions that had to be dragged out of the Government which, ultimately, is the way they now look for history to see.</P>
        <P>I heard Senator MacSharry speak of his understandable opposition to any notion of default, with which I agree.  I do not direct this personally at him, but I worry sometimes when people say we will not default because when certain persons say things, I am often tempted to think that in fact that is precisely what will happen.  The Minister stated there would not be intervention in the banks; we had intervention in the banks.  The Minister stated repeatedly there would not be any question of the IMF; we had the IMF.  All of the things that were never going to happen, happened.  I worry when Members on the Government side state that we will never default.  I start wondering is something going to happen that they have not told us about because often the polar opposite to what the Government states is its policy ends up being done at the end of the day.</P><Col N="647"/>
        <P Just="Left">On the content of this legislation, as Senator Donohoe pointed out, of course, resolution legislation and the kinds of mechanism that are at least signalled in the Bill are necessary.  There is no question but that the great bulk of what is in this legislation is, in fact, necessary.</P>
        <P>In case I go off the point, I share Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s point, which perhaps Senator MacSharry needs to understand.  As I understood it, Senator Donohoe was not advocating any restructuring of the debt held by senior bondholders.  He was simply stating, as certainly is my view, that there should be legislative provision for such an eventuality, not that it should be triggered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are supposed to be doing this in a comprehensive way, let us put it into the legislation.  That does not mean it will be invoked.  We all very much hope that it can be avoided.  Many respected commentators have stated not so much that they think it is a good idea, but that they believe it may be difficult down the road to avoid.  Why can the Government not speak the Queen&rsquo;s English and state that is the position, let us put it into the legislation and let us, of course, by policy means and otherwise, seek to avoid it happening?  That does not mean that because the Government does not want to mention the &ldquo;D&rdquo; word, there cannot be provision in legislation for the eventuality where there is some issue in respect of the senior bondholders in the way that the Government has now acknowledged there is in respect of those who hold subordinated debt.  It is a legislative, enabling provision, which need not be triggered.</P>
        <P>On the legislation, whereas it is important, it is not good enough for the Minister or the Government side to state we can have Committee Stage this afternoon for two or three hours.  This is comprehensive legislation.  It was published on Tuesday, as I stated on the Order of Business.  It was put through the other House yesterday and it is proposed to put it through this House today.  Apart from the disservice that does to Members in this House, and while the Minister of State may say we can speed-read it, take our advice, talk to our people etc., it does a disservice to the community because people deserve the opportunity to consider these issues over a period at least of days and preferably weeks.  There are important committees in these Houses which have a good record in addressing the detail of this type of legislation.  Why did a committee not consider this?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance stated in this House on a number of occasions that this type of legislation was in the &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo;.  At earlier stages he seemed to resist it or not think it important but in recent months he signalled that it was approaching.  When was this legislation first conceived and when was the first work done on it by the Government?  It would have been done in the Department of Finance and I presume that along the way there was advice or input from the Attorney General.  When did it start?  I do not want to know any secrets and I am not looking for the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion on this, that or the other.  I just want to know the date work started on it.</P>
        <P>It seems highly unlikely that the first work done on this legislation would have been done after the agreement with the IMF.  I presume the legislation has been in a state of preparation for some time.  Why did we not have a debate and why could we not have discussion on its contents?  What is the business of coming in on a Tuesday, publishing a Bill one day, passing it in the D&aacute;il the next day before putting it through here on a Thursday?  We are then told that we can discuss the Bill on Committee Stage.  It is not good enough for the Government in this crisis and with these issues to act like this.  We should not get too upset about ourselves and the way the Parliament is treated but the people are also treated with contempt.  This is an <Col N="648"/>issue which the people should see as being allowed to breathe in public discourse and discussion.  There is no allowance for that to occur.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>With regard to the contents of legislation, one of the areas that people have focused on is section 53.  In the spirit of the relative independence of this House and its Members, I express the view that the powers being taken by the Minister in section 53 are not unreasonable.  If there is to be a serious intervention where the Minister is fortified in what he or she is doing in these matters, the powers are not unreasonable.  I say this because I know the section has been criticised.  I take the criticism that has been made with regard to oversight of the Minister&rsquo;s powers, and the Minister explained in his speech that there was a high degree of judicial oversight provided.  The Minister explained that judicial oversight would be available.  To the extent that the Minister gives such an assurance, it is not beyond the bounds of what is reasonable that there should be very firm powers given to the Minister and the Government in contemplation of what should be done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I made the point about section 28 and burden sharing.  I reinforce the point that it seems there is nothing to stop the Government going further and simply having an enabling provision allowing it to act on other types of debt in future.  Section 4 deals with the purposes of the Bill which are at the heart of the matter.  This relates to the basic point of when this legislation was conceived, developed and written.  At the end of 2008 and in 2009 there was a need for legislation to provide for every item in section 4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There was no reason to delay and it was damaging to do so.  One could tick every box in respect of the contents of the section and none of the requirements is new.  They all were in place on the morning after 29 September 2008, if not in the weeks and months before.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry did not refer to the next point as a criticism but he is correct in saying the biggest problem with this legislation is that it has come too late and was delayed for too long.  Once it finally arrived in the week before Christmas, there was not sufficient time to carefully consider undoubtedly necessary aspects to it and to query any problems that might arise, whether in respect of section 53, as raised by some, or the confidentiality issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There appear to be many provisions in respect of confidentiality which I do not quite understand.  There is a provision in section 59 which the Minister of State might address.  Everybody understands the requirement for confidentiality with matters that are commercially sensitive but where the Minister is making key moves under this legislation in respect of making ministerial orders, why would the making of such orders be confidential?  I do not understand that as the Minister is acting in trust for the public in matters of great importance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning I attended the MacGill forum at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, where the proceedings of the summer school were published.  I made a contribution at that event on the topic of banking reform.  Senator White and others mentioned the lack of debate on this Bill.  There has not been a lack of debate on banking policy or in this House on the need to address such measures or hold open the possibility of such measures in the first place.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P Just="Left">Government policy, as it transpired, has always been based on an understanding that in so far as is possible, these difficulties should have been worked out largely within the financial institutions themselves using private market mechanisms.  As things turned out, we learned first <Col N="649"/>&mdash; despite a lack of proper information, deceit and dishonesty on behalf of many institutions and people involved in those institutions &mdash; the scale of the problem and the need for the Government to intervene at various and growing degrees in protecting national interests.  That was the sole factor behind policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would have been an error to nationalise, partially nationalise or cede large degrees of ownership in 2008.  That would have led to us acquiring more of the debt more quickly and getting ourselves into difficulties in a shorter time.  It was right to hold open the prospect which I have heard the Minister for Finance and his Minister of State mention in many debates in the House that the possibility of additional and large scale ownership of these financial institutions was still a potential part of policy.  That is the genesis of the Bill and it has already been discussed in this and the other House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If I have a criticism it is about the number of pieces of legislation we have had to introduce in this area because we are still of a mindset dealing with the effects of this crisis.  This is just another piece of enabling legislation and we must still fill in the gaps in the nature of the types of banks we will have after this crisis.  How many banks will exist? What type of banking will they carry out and how will they be directed as financial institutions operating in the interests of the economy?  It is detrimental to all of us, in this and the other House, that we have been so preoccupied in dealing with the effects of the crisis and mechanics that we are missing the larger picture.  We still have that difficulty going into 2011 and beyond.  It is something to which all politicians and political parties should make a contribution.</P>
        <P>There were criticisms of particular measures mentioned by previous speakers, including omitting senior debt and the mentioning of subordinated debt.  I do not see that as a problem because the mechanisms I see relating to subordinated debt concern writing it off totally in relevant circumstances.  I understand senior debt can be negotiated downwards at any time according to the usual practice.  Ireland has a particular difficulty, however, in that we have accepted a package in which this policy option is not available.  It may become available in the future because there is no legislative bar preventing the State, acting on behalf of the financial institutions in question, from seeking to renegotiate senior debt.  The mechanisms in the Bill provide for the writing off of subordinated debt in its entirety.  I have not heard anyone argue in favour of writing off senior debt in its entirety.</P>
        <P>The problems we are experiencing were brought about partly by comments made by Chancellor Merkel.  In raising the possibility of senior debt being renounced she sent the markets into a tailspin and the economy came under pressure.  Suggesting Ireland can somehow get ahead of the posse and operate in isolation to solve our problems lets people down because it creates false expectations.</P>
        <P>Some of the figures we have heard are inventions.  The leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, in an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today, referred to a figure of &euro;25 billion of senior debt.  He is incorrect and when such figures are placed in the public domain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the correct figure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand senior debt in all banks amounts to approximately &euro;15 billion, while subordinated debt amounts to &euro;10 billion.  These are the figures I have heard.  It is a pity people cannot make a distinction between types of debt.  It is dishonest to suggest all debt can be eliminated with the flick of a wrist.  At best, we will be able to negotiate a discount on debt.  Even to touch senior debt we would be required to first consult the European Central Bank and our partners in the European Union.  This is the position in which we find ourselves, regardless of which party is in government.  It is wrong to suggest the agreement reached with <Col N="650"/>the European Union and the International Monetary Fund can be renegotiated.  The legislation is especially important for this reason.</P>
        <P>While it may become nauseating with repetition, I must again point out, as I do each time the House passes banking reform legislation, that the frustrating absence of action against individuals whose activities, greed and avarice brought us to this point sits ill with the people.  Action must be taken to identify the individuals in question and use the judicial system to call them to account for the most serious economic crimes committed in the history of the State.  The lack of activity in this regard is driving the anger and frustration of members of the public.</P>
        <P>This legislation is necessary as it can be used for beneficial purposes to ensure the events of the past are not repeated.  In passing the Bill we must realise, however, that a more serious wound needs to be healed in the economy and society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I also compliment the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on his grasp of the various challenges facing the economy.  I have been impressed by the manner in which he has handled developments.  He appears to be in control of what is a fast-moving situation.</P>
        <P>I have found myself on a steep learning curve as I am not well informed about most of the issues that have arisen in recent times.  I have followed commentaries in newspapers and journals on the Internet to ascertain how often Ireland&rsquo;s handling of its problems has been challenged.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the Fine Gael Party will oppose the Bill on the grounds that it is being rushed through the House rather than because of its contents.  I understand the legislation will allow the National Pensions Reserve Fund to invest in companies which are not listed on stock markets.  This would allow the Government to acquire a 100% stake in Allied Irish Banks, thus wiping out shareholders&rsquo; investments and removing the bank from the stock market.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund could still be used to recapitalise the bank.  The logical conclusion is that AIB will be nationalised before the year is out and all its shares written off.</P>
        <P>Many others and I argued many months ago that Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland would need to be nationalised.  The Government was afraid of the word &ldquo;nationalisation&rdquo; and insisted the banks did not need to be nationalised.  While I was not enthusiastic about the prospect of nationalisation, the Government should have taken the step it now proposes at the outset.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to make clear what his plans are with regard to the nationalisation of Allied Irish Banks.  Is this the reason Mr. John Bruton, wearing his IFSC hat, is in the Middle East?  Is he trying to flog Irish banks to Arab sheiks or others in the region who may consider acquiring them?  If that is the case, he has a challenge on his hands.</P>
        <P>Sections 28 to 32, inclusive, appear to give power to the Minister for Finance to make debt for equity swaps with holders of subordinated debt.  The Minister appears to have come around to the idea that investors&rsquo; stakes may be swapped for shares in the banks.  Many experts argue that Ireland should also adopt this approach to senior bondholder debt.  In other words, we should swap senior bondholders&rsquo; investments for shares in the banks and allow them to take control of the banks.  They would then have good reason to ensure the success of the bank in which they hold equity.  If the Government adopts this approach, it will mark a policy U-turn by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Who pressed for losses to be taken by holders of subordinated debt?  Was it the Minister or the European Union?  Given that debt for equity swaps take place every day in the world of business, why can they not work in the case of our senior bondholder debt problem?  Some <Col N="651"/>economists argue that the honest course of action would be to pass a bank resolution Act to swap the debt for shares.  Such a debt for equity swap would remove a liability of &euro;120 billion from the national and international balance sheet.  A bank resolution Act was introduced in the United Kingdom last year and new legislation, the Dodd-Frank Act, was recently passed in the United States.  Is the Minister coming around to the idea of introducing bank resolution legislation?  Its introduction would allow us to start addressing the real problems in the economy.</P>
        <P>The <i>Financial Times</i> has just predicted that the next Government will renegotiate the terms of the bailout, in other words, it will default on some debt.  This appears especially likely, given that senior figures in the European Union have indicated that an amendment to the founding treaties is imminent to enable senior bondholders to take a hit in the future.  The Bill appears to leave the door open for later amendments to provide that senior bondholders will be treated in the same manner as subordinated bondholders.  If the Government is so concerned about the markets, is it not logical that investors would be more wary of investing in Ireland in the light of the treatment of holders of subordinated debt, as provided for in the Bill, and the possibility that senior bondholders will be compelled to take a hit in the future?  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s view on this issue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The interest rate on the &pound;3.25 billion, 7.5 year loan from the United Kingdom is estimated to be 5.9% for the first of the eight tranches to be disbursed in September next year.  This is slightly higher than the average rate of 5.8% on the overall &euro;85 billion bailout package from the European Union.  I was struck by reports that Iceland yesterday negotiated a ten year loan to repay bank debt held in the United Kingdom and elsewhere at an interest rate of 3.2%.  One newspaper, the <i>EU Observer</i>, states: &ldquo;Repayments will also be capped at a rate linked to a percentage of Icelandic economic growth, giving the country room to improve its economy rather than spend all its energy on paying back foreign debts&rdquo;.  Will Ireland have an opportunity to reinvigorate its economy rather than paying a much more punitive rate than that provided for Iceland?  While I accept that Iceland negotiated its rate with Britain rather than the European Union, could our interest rates not be linked with economic growth?  This would be the most logical solution.  We should have had much more hard-nosed and business oriented negotiators bargaining down the incredible interest rate applied to the bailout.</P>
      
        <P>I read only yesterday that the Government has injected a further &euro;525 million into the Educational Building Society.  I wonder whether the fact that AIB is to be given &euro;3.7 billion within the next two weeks has been obscured to the public by the wider EU-IMF bailout.  I have seen little mention of this injection of funds to AIB.  I also wonder about section 53.  Some legal experts say is unconstitutional as it replaces the powers of the Oireachtas with ministerial powers.  The Minister touched on this matter.  A future Minister could find himself or herself open to challenge very soon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards the bonus issue, especially the bonuses being claimed by AIB employees, it would be interesting to know the legal costs of the 90 employees taking a legal action against the bank, which is owned principally by the taxpayer.  I was interested to hear the bonuses being described as discretionary and contractual.  If they are contractual, surely they should be described as a commission.  In other words, if I sell something on commission I have a right to that commission.  That is the deal I have, as an employee.  If the bankers claim their bonuses are a commission, they would have a right to them, but if that is the case, I do not understand why the bonuses were described as bonuses.  If a bank becomes insolvent and only functions because of investment by the State and a future commitment of almost &euro;10 billion, surely such insolvency should mean there should be no payment of bonuses.  If I may be cynical for a moment, I suggest the Minister knows the Government has no control over the payment of <Col N="652"/>bonuses and is waiting until the new Government comes in and is left with that burden and embarrassment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the Minister&rsquo;s good intentions with regard to the Bill although I could argue it is two years too late.  However, it is right that we have it.  I regret it is being rushed through at such speed but that is not reason enough to vote against it.  I support it although I am disappointed by the length of time it has taken.  At least we have taken this step.  Like other speakers, I express my disappointment we did not have more time to consider the Bill and must rush it through in one session.</P>

	<P>I will make a brief contribution.  I sympathise with Senator Quinn about the level of confusion and the steep learning curve all of us are on in understanding the financial and banking situations.  I am sure that like many Members he has learned things he never knew about the workings of the financial market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Listening to the debate, I found Senator Alex White&rsquo;s contribution, in particular, to be very measured, much more so than that of his party&rsquo;s spokesperson in the other House.  That is where I have some slight confusion.  The Labour Party spokesperson in the other House spoke of draconian measures whereas Senator Alex White thinks the Bill, although two years too late, is a measure we should adopt and that the banking sector requires this support and level of intervention.   There appears to be a breakdown of communication between the Upper House and the Lower House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Indeed, but I welcome Senator Alex White&rsquo;s very measured approach to the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke of section 53.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reason I wanted to make a contribution.  I also found very valid points in Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s contribution.  It would be very useful to get a good debate going on Committee Stage about the provisions contained in the Bill.  I particularly wanted to echo the questions put by both Senators White and Donohoe, especially that of Senator White concerning preparation in the legislation of a provision for default.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has the assistance of his experts.  What would be the consequences or what would the Minister of State understand to be the consequences of providing for a default provision within the legislation?  Senator MacSharry made the point that that was what got us into trouble and that any notion of a level of ambiguity in this area is what made the markets go wild.  The one thing we need is security.  Is this a reason there is no such provision?  I would be interested to hear an answer.</P>
        <P>Equally, the point Senator Donohoe made about section 4 was very valid.  He asked whether we really wanted to restore Anglo Irish Bank to what it was.  I am interested in that because I believe what the Government has been trying to do is to move towards an organised wind down.  I am sure the intention is not to bring back Anglo Irish Bank to its previous position.  Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s point requires some clarification.  Why is this mentioned in the section? <Col N="653"/> Like him, I would be surprised to find that to be a purpose of the Bill.  Some clarification is required.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point made about constitutionality.  This is very tricky and complex legislation.  It is a fair point that we may not have enough time to go through the complexities as we would all wish to do.  As with other legislation we may find it will run into trouble.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, the Government is not in a position to advise the President to call the Council of State but I would hope the President might be inclined to do so.  It is the type of legislation that needs to be solidly and rigorously &mdash; what would one say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In supporting the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill 2010, I am certain the banks gave wrong information at committee and directly to the Department of Finance.  Whether this wrong information was given knowingly remains to be seen.  Notwithstanding that, in checking the stability of banks recently, the European Union found that all Irish banks, other than Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society, were believed to be in a solvent and solid position.  We now find that was not the case.  It was not only the Government and the Oireachtas that were misled but also the European Union.  The Government must take strong and firm action, therefore, and take a strong and direct legislative role in dealing with the banks.</P>
        <P>When we look at the banks, we must look at the context in which they operate.  If the situation is one of a permanent downward spiral we will have very severe difficulties and it will be almost impossible to reach their lowest tier.  In the last quarter the economy grew for the first time since 2007.  This is very good news because it underpins the presumption made in the budget that we would have a modest growth rate of 1.7% next year.  That is very achievable and we may even see modest growth within this calendar year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With this in mind, what else has been done to ensure the stability of the banks?  Given that they have such a dependence on property, another welcome measure in the budget is the reduction of stamp duty to 1%.  That should provide a floor in order that we would know what the losses will be.</P>
        <P>We are certain the Minister needs these powers, as will any future Minister for Finance.  These bonuses were going to be paid by the bank, albeit not willingly.  In that situation we see the old culture again.  Some people still have not fully grasped the new dynamics operating in the economy.  These are very straightforward.  The old ways are finished, there is a new way of doing business and it will not be along the ways that were in place in 2007, the year that got us into these difficulties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will see a significant recapitalisation of the banks in conjunction with the Basel requirements.  The Irish banks will have a 12% core tier 1 ratio of reserves which is a very strong backing.  It is necessary and the markets need to know it will be in place, especially because there has been a haemorrhaging of funds from Irish banks.  In addition, the international press, either deliberately or because it does not fully understand our situation, has given very bad press to the economy.  With that in mind we are underpinning the banks.  We are insisting that non-core assets will be sold off and that non-performing loans will be transferred to NAMA.  We want to have a good banking system.  It is not a case of saving the banks, as has often <Col N="654"/>been suggested by the Opposition.  It is never about saving the banks but always about saving the economy.</P>

I had an argument with the Minister during the week.  He challenged me on why I had supported a motion of no confidence in the Government.  I pointed out to him that it had very little to do with Government decisions but with the current process, structure, shape and architecture of government.  In my tending to support the main decisions of the Government in recent years, I defended them better than many in Government parties.  I refer to decisions from September 2008.</P>

	<P>He says it was too wide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There may well be a question of width, but in terms of quality, the guarantee was necessary.</P>
        <P>We are making a huge mistake with this legislation.  I have seen this happen before with rushed legislation.  I note we are amending the Building Societies Act 1989.  It was rushed through this House and caused problems thereafter.</P>
        <P>I do not understand what the Minister refers to as the recitals in the first two pages of the Bill, which I presume constitute what we used to call the Long Title.  Issues arise in this regard.  There are points in the Bill that I do not understand and on which I would like clarification.  While there is no chance of my seeing the early drafts of the recitals, I would love to.  I would love to see what was intended and how the drafts were changed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is this the third time we have seen the phrase &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo; in the Long Titles of Bills recently?  The phrase seems to have gained a legal personality all of its own.  This is new to me as a legislator.  I am not saying I do not welcome this but I would like to have it explained to me where it fits into the broader scheme.  It is very handy for our friends down in the courts to rely on this phrase when they want to make a pragmatic judgment that may not quite be in <Col N="655"/>line with their interpretation of the law as it has stood heretofore.  It is very difficult for any of our legal friends to make a finding against the phrase &ldquo;in the national interest&rdquo;, now referred to as &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo;.  What is the legal history of the phrase and how did it obtain a legal personality all of its own?</P>
        <P>When I read phrases such as, &ldquo;AND WHEREAS THE FUNCTIONS AND POWERS CONFERRED BY THIS ACT ARE NECESSARY TO SECURE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND TO EFFECT A REORGANISATION OF CERTAIN CREDIT INSTITUTIONS&rdquo;, I believe the Government is anticipating a legal challenge.  I do not know whether it is appropriate to have such content in the Long Title.  I do not have any problem with the Government anticipating a legal challenge and doing all that is required of it to meet it.</P>
        <P>What worries me most about the Long Title is the phrase, &ldquo;AND WHEREAS THE COMMON GOOD REQUIRES PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY INTERFERENCE WITH THE RIGHTS, INCLUDING PROPERTY RIGHTS, OF PERSONS&rdquo;.  The Minister is asking us to pass legislation that may stand the Constitution on its head.  There is much legislative precedent for interference with property rights.  Property rights, as dealt with in the Constitution, have been discussed many times, but one should not interfere permanently with rights.  Either one has a right or one does not.  The only place one can deal with this is the Supreme Court by way of interpretation where there is one right in conflict with another.  This is dealt with regularly and a judge must make a decision.</P>
        <P>The Minister is asking us to do something that I, as a legislator, believe is impossible.  I would be prepared to state, &ldquo;AND WHEREAS THE COMMON GOOD REQUIRES TEMPORARY INTERFERENCE WITH THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF PERSONS&rdquo;.  I could well understand that as it would make sense, but stating &ldquo;RIGHTS&rdquo; and adding &ldquo;INCLUDING PROPERTY RIGHTS&rdquo; goes far beyond what legislators are entitled or empowered to do.  It is inviting a legal challenge.  I would like to know the legal history and precedent that provide the basis for our being confident and comfortable about going down this road.</P>
        <P>I completely agree that there needs to be urgent reorganisation.  Restructuring is very difficult but I have no idea how it can be achieved.  We passed the Building Societies Act and other banking legislation to ensure people could not take shortcuts through legislation.  I would like someone to explain to me how one can include two building societies and a bank in one unit.  What is the legal process and what issues need to be dealt with?  Who will advise us on and guide us through the process?  To what kind of person does one go for advice on doing this job, however worthy the objective?  I agree with the Minister of State that the objective is good and do not want him to tell me I believe otherwise.  I am all in favour of the objective but wonder how it can be achieved.</P>
        <P>I support the need for this legislation although I have serious difficulties with it.  While I cannot go into detail, I believe we should be teasing out the legislation section by section.  It should take time.  All who spoke on this side of the House made that point.  There is far too much in the Bill to rush it through.  Problems will arise and we need to address them.</P>
        <P>Let me outline the reason for the legislation.  I hope the next Government, irrespective of its flavour, shape or colour, will have only one remaining economic variable to deal with, namely, the issue of growth.  I hope all the other problems will have been known about and understood and that we will have known our approach with regard to austerity measures in order that the new Government will be able to concentrate on growth.</P>
        <P>This legislation may land us in the courts, although the courts will ensure, in the public interest, that cases are taken pretty quickly.  We are inviting court action, court statements and prolonged legal challenges on foot of the legislation.  It is trying to do too much and our approach is not safe.  It is unsafe legislation.</P>

	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to what I consider to have been a really good debate.  I have had the benefit of sitting through the debates in both Houses.  If any issue arises in the term of the next Oireachtas on the need for and future of the Seanad and I am in a position to participate, I will certainly cite my experience of the economic debates in this House.</P>
        <P>Let me reply to Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  The Minister was present to commence this debate and will be back.  Along with the T&aacute;naiste, he is one of the most senior Ministers in the Government.  I really do not believe it is appropriate to suggest my party had any contempt for the House.  The very opposite was the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I had not the remotest intention of criticising the Minister.  I was criticising the Minister of State&rsquo;s party colleagues in this House.  I had no intention of citing the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I defend my party colleagues in this House?  They contribute a great deal to debates.  The Minister has given a particularly authoritative presentation and my understanding is that he will be here for most, if not all, of Committee Stage.  That will happen a little bit earlier than might have been anticipated.  I wish to make a few general points and then to deal with the specific points raised by Members.</P>
        <P>A key commitment in the financial support programme with the IMF and the EU is the comprehensive restructuring of the banking system.  As has been articulated by the Minister for Finance, the programme provides for the downsizing of the domestic retail banking sector to create a smaller national banking sector more proportionate to the size of the economy and capitalised to the highest international standards.  This Bill provides the broad powers needed for the Minister for Finance to act on financial stability grounds to effect swift restructuring action and recapitalisation measures as envisaged in the programme.  It is the first important step in putting in place an extensive special resolution regime that will provide for a comprehensive framework to facilitate the orderly management and resolution of distressed credit institutions.  In that context the Bill includes the powers to appoint a special manager to a relevant institution, which will only arise in limited and exceptional circumstances, to achieve the objectives of the legislation.</P>
        <P>Under the EU-IMF programme, there is a commitment providing for a comprehensive special resolution regime to be introduced to the Oireachtas by the end of February 2011, which would include the full suite of SRR powers based on international best practice and the evolving EU framework.  Depending on electoral timetables, it could be one of the first items of legislation in a new Oireachtas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Once the Bill is enacted, the powers available to the Minister would enable the substantial and significant restructuring actions envisaged in the support programme to be progressed and the provisions would facilitate the disposal of non-core assets to support the achievement of funding targets set by the Central Bank of Ireland, while allowing the Minister to provide credit enhancement that could help to support progressive reduction in the balance sheets of the domestic credit institutions through, for example, the securitisation of bank assets.  These powers would underpin the restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, as set out in the programme agreement and, as is consistent with EU state aid requirements, provide scope for appropriate burden sharing for subordinated debt and provide the Minister with the power, if necessary, to effect a recapitalisation of AIB prior to the end of the year to meet regulatory capital requirements set by the Central Bank of Ireland.</P><Col N="657"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>There was much comment in the debate about the need for senior bondholders to accept their share of the burden of this crisis.  This point surfaced in this debate.  When those who deplore the erosion of the deposit base of the Irish banking system come to reflect on it, they will see the substantial contribution made to that process by the unhelpful level of domestic discussion about this matter over recent weeks.  To be fair, there was a European dimension to it as well.  The Minister dealt with this issue yesterday in the debate on the IMF-EU support programme.  There is simply no way this country, whose banks are so dependent on international investors, can unilaterally renege on senior bondholders against the wishes of the European Central Bank.  In such circumstances the Central Bank stands behind the affected banks throughout the resolution of the crisis and those who think we could unilaterally renege on senior bondholders against the wishes of the ECB are not facing reality.  The suggestion that there are no costs associated with default is entirely incorrect.  This country is dependent to a great extent on foreign direct investment.  These companies have large funds and investments in Ireland and directly or indirectly employ 250,000 people.  Any default on senior debt and the uncertainty that would cause would undoubtedly have an impact on future investment decisions of such companies.</P>
        <P>The introduction of SRR type powers in this Bill will be a powerful instrument to secure the necessary restructuring of the Irish banking system in the context of the programme.  It will provide the Minister with a strong toolkit for dealing with distressed financial institutions.  As the Minister made clear in the D&aacute;il, however, contrary to conventional wisdom, SRR is not a panacea for minimising the fiscal cost to the State of our banking crisis, especially in light of the legal considerations in Ireland.  The major banking costs incurred by the State could only be reduced where some of these losses were imposed on creditors of the banks.  This Bill provides the powers for burden sharing involving subordinated debt by legislative means.  Voluntary exchanges in respect of these instruments already undertaken and currently under way have avoided the requirement for even more State support for the banks.  Discussions are ongoing at EU and international level on the mechanisms that may be available in future to share the fiscal costs of bank resolution with senior creditors of banks other than depositors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White raised the question of whether these powers should have been introduced at an earlier stage.  While Irish banks were still seeking to issue longer-term debt, it is very likely that the market reaction to the broad and extensive nature of the powers included in the Bill over the covered institutions would have been negative.  There would have been serious potential to provoke the scenario for which it has been necessary to adopt a programme to resolve the exclusion of the domestic Irish banks from longer term funding markets and a substantial dependence on funding from the euro system.  The scope for utilising the powers available under the Bill is enhanced by the availability of the resources provided under the programme for the repair of the banking system.  This is not to indicate that the Government intends to draw resources from the contingency fund available other than are strictly necessary to achieve the objectives of the programme.  Rather, it is unlikely to have been credible to advocate that the type of measures envisaged under the Bill would be deliverable solely within the fiscal capacity of the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The lead role and responsibility assigned to the Minister under the Bill reflects the major commitment of State resources to the banking system and the need to fully safeguard the State&rsquo;s fiscal position in moving forward to implement the programme agreement.  It is essential the Minister has wide discretion, drawing on the best expert advice, regarding the necessary steps or courses of action that should be embarked upon in seeking to resolve the challenges facing our banking system.  I note that Senator Alex White expressed some understanding of the powers in section 53.  These will be exercised by the Minister and his successor.</P><Col N="658"/>
        <P>Senator Donohoe raised the question of why the legislation is urgent.  The pace at which this legislation is being prepared and the urgency with which it must be enacted by the Oireachtas reflect three separate but related objectives.  The first is the real and tangible value of demonstrating to the external parties to the programme, the wider international community and international markets the strength of the Irish authorities&rsquo; commitment to the delivery of key elements of the agreement, consistent with the ambitious timeframe for implementation.</P>
        <P>The second is the clear benefit of having the necessary powers available to the Minister at the earliest possible stage when initiating a profound restructuring of the banking system envisaged under the programme.  The reputation of our domestic banking system and its ability to meet its funding needs from market sources will only be rebuilt by undertaking the concrete measures to bring about a substantial reconfiguration of our banking system.</P>
        <P>The third point is the imperative of empowering the Minister for Finance with the statutory authority to ensure all our institutions are in conformity with regulatory capital requirements set by the Central Bank at the end of this year.  It is also essential the Minister is in a position to progress the joint restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society while safeguarding the Exchequer.  No Senator should doubt that the Minister for Finance is appropriately equipped with the necessary legal powers to continue to maintain financial stability in the State.  That is the sole purpose of the legislation before us today and its enactment is urgent.</P>
        <P>It is not true that extensive SRR legislation is widespread.  The British legislation is extensive in scope and is regarded by many as international best practice.  It has only been used for the resolution of a small regional building society.  It was not used to deal with the difficulties in any of the larger British institutions.  It is only in recent weeks that Germany received the approval of its lower house for its legislation.  Denmark also recently published SRR legislation.  At EU level, the European Commission has been developing legislation for a European resolution framework for some time and a proposal is not expected to be published until June 2011 by the European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the specifics of the Bill have been the subject of intense work since the conclusion of the discussion with the EU-IMF authorities, as the Minister has indicated, his officials have been examining options in recent months for the introduction of an extensive SRR having regard to evolving work at international level and the emerging EU framework.  This Bill is an important bridge to the publication by March 2011 of a comprehensive SRR, taking account of developments elsewhere and being mindful of the specificities of the Irish banking system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White asked about section 59.  It is to ensure the Minister can use his powers under the Bill to make proposed orders without it being made public he is so doing.  There will be considerable sensitivities, commercial and otherwise, surrounding the exercise of these powers and it could prove detrimental to the achievement of the objectives of the Bill if this requirement for confidentiality were not in place.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn will understand there are important issues relating to commercial confidentiality and market sensitivity relating to AIB.  The bank issued a statement earlier this week acknowledging the publication of the Bill and the statement in the Minister&rsquo;s press release that it provides powers to the Minister to ensure aid meets regulatory capital requirements by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe mentioned the sale of assets in financial institutions.  AIB sold its Polish subsidiary earlier this year, raising a good deal of money.  A Polish diplomat said to me that possibly it was worth more than the market value of the rest of AIB put together.  When assets <Col N="659"/>are sold, the sale must be related to their value at the time.  If they have a high value at present, there is a value in doing so.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Boyle that it would have been an error to nationalise the banks at an earlier stage.  I do not know where Senator Quinn got his information that the Bank of Ireland should be nationalised and, even less, where he got suggestions that John Bruton is in the Middle East with a particular purpose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Iceland is not a member of either the EU or the eurozone, I do not consider it to be comparable to Ireland.  It does not accept the IMF and does not have obligations of a multilateral character to other countries in the way Ireland does.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As it irritates me at times, I must ask where the hard-nosed businessmen and bankers were during the property boom.  There is an idealisation of the private sector, that those in it are more hard-nosed than the Government.  The <i>Financial Times</i> pointed out last week that the genesis of our crisis was the private sector losing all restraint and getting itself into vast debt through over-optimistic development.  There was nothing hard-nosed about Anglo Irish Bank or any of the others during that period.  I am not saying for a second that the State sector, particularly the regulatory branch, acted perfectly; far from it.  We have gone through all the criticism appropriate in that quarter.  From my experience, negotiations between states and agencies are different from commercial negotiations and there is no evidence from around the world that businessmen are better at them just because they are good at commercial negotiation.  I simply do not buy that.  There have been examples in other countries of businessmen being brought into politics and there is no evidence that they perform any better than people who have long experience of politics, diplomacy and dealing with international financial issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I am a member of the Council of State, I will not pass comment on Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s question on the constitutionality of the legislation.  People of my generation, which is also that of Senator O&rsquo;Toole, enjoyed &ldquo;Hall&rsquo;s Pictorial Weekly&rdquo;, and phrases such as &ldquo;in the national interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo; are now resurfacing after a generation.  There is an important point, however, that the Minister, when he wants to make orders, must go to the High Court, so the existence of the preamble relates to that.  An article in the Constitution relates to the exercise of private property rights and their protection subject to the common good.  We are legislating in the context of a financial emergency.  The phrase is fully justified.  When I was a Senator, and subsequently, I have been persistently critical of the tendency to deify private property rights.  I am not accusing Senator O&rsquo;Toole in this regard.  In certain instances, it has landed the State in considerable and unnecessary expense.  A more hard-nosed approach was adopted 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  In the culture of the 1950s, if a county council wanted to build labourers&rsquo; cottages in the countryside, there was no question of paying over the odds for the land.  If anything, councils paid considerably under the odds.  Under the same Constitution governing us today, the Land Commission issued land bonds for the acquisition of estates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 13, paragraph (<i>c</i>), line 26, to delete &ldquo;and restoration&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to make a general point.  The debate on the Bill is due to be guillotined at 4 p.m. and there are many points I wish to make about various sections.  In reply to the debate on Second Stage the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, stated there were not many other examples of such legislation in other European countries.  I have two papers, one prepared by the UK Treasury and the other by the IMF, which give examples of such legislation elsewhere and the difficulties encountered.  These examples are driving the amendments we have proposed.</P>
        <P>This amendment refers to section 4(<i>c</i>).  I can understand the reason the Minister wants to include this section in looking to reorganise and even preserve the financial position of Anglo Irish Bank because its further deterioration would cause even more collateral damage to the country.  However, I cannot understand how restoring the financial position of Anglo Irish Bank can be a purpose of the Bill, given the colossal damage the bank has done to the economy and the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the phrase &ldquo;and restoration of&rdquo; in section 4(<i>c</i>) which Senator Donohoe wishes to have deleted, the purpose of the legislation is to try to ensure a High Court order under the Bill will be recognised as a reorganisation measure under the terms of the relevant European Union legal instrument.  Therefore, orders should be expressed as being made with the intention of preserving or restoring a credit institution.  The Bill follows the language used in the relevant European Union directive.  This does not bind the Minister to any future course of action.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons for the speedy enactment of the legislation is to bring about a speedy resolution of the issues that have arisen in Anglo Irish Bank Corporation and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The legislation will facilitate the merger of these institutions, together with the disposal of certain of their liabilities and the preservation of the entity solely for the purpose of working out the assets over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it really necessary to include the phrase &ldquo;and restoration&rdquo;?  What is the Minister seeking to restore?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that the object is the restoration of the financial position of the institution, not the institution itself.  We would all like to see the financial position of the banks restored in that sense.  This is a legal issue.  I am advised that it is prudent, if we wish to have these orders recognised in other European countries, to have exact correspondence between the phrase used in the Bill and that used in the European Union legal instrument.  That is the net issue.  It does not give me particular pleasure to have to explain to those who want to mislead on this issue &mdash; I do not suggest Senator Donohoe is one of them &mdash; that the phrase &ldquo;and restoration&rdquo; is used because there might be an implication which would be at <Col N="662"/>variance with the Government&rsquo;s policy which clearly is that the assets of these institutions should be worked out as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Donohoe spoke about collateral damage and in reply the Minister spoke about legal advice received.  The gn&aacute;th duine, the ordinary person, does not trust the Minister&rsquo;s legal advice, primarily because he has been wrong at every hand&rsquo;s turn, despite his earlier protestations and those of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  If the Minister wants to be fair about this, we have got it wrong about the banks every step of the way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has.  If he forgets his commentators and advisers and speaks to ordinary people in Dublin West or Cork South Central, he will learn they have no confidence in the Department of Finance, the Government or the banks and bankers.  They are absolutely petrified.  I am not a rocket scientist, but I understand the Minister&rsquo;s initial comment, way back when all of this began, was that it was the cheapest bailout in the history of the State and money well spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but I will reply in one minute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can and I will come back to it again.  Who is now dictating to us?  Is it the European Union, the IMF, the European Central Bank, Mr. Elderfield, the Attorney General or the mandarins in the Department?  Looking at the rest of the section, we have not protected the interests of the ordinary person.  We can have a debate about bondholders and other sectors, but we all accept that there is a compelling need to have a proper banking system.</P>
        <P>On Monday I went to the Bank of Ireland branch in Wilton.  The tellers have been distraught at times at the abuse they receive.  This is because of the failure of the Government to protect the interests of the people.  The Minister can respond but the reality is we have not done it.  He saw the run on money.  People vote with their feet.  Ordinary people do not have confidence because he is not explaining the matter properly to them.  They do not believe Anglo Irish Bank is central to the reorganisation of the banking system.  He has not convinced me of the need to retain that bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know where to start.  When Sweden had a banking crisis, the parties there agreed to resolve it together.  We never achieved that measure of agreement.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We initially achieved agreement on the guarantee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us be fair, we supported the guarantee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Minister to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I listened to the Senator and I am entitled to reply.  The agreement on the guarantee was welcome but thereafter we decided to quarrel and turn it into a political football.  The Senator&rsquo;s party specifically decided to raise the issue of dishonouring senior debt.  I will be clear about this matter.  If one decides to torch that house, the house next door is called &ldquo;deposits&rdquo;.  One should not be surprised that a large quantity of deposits have left the Irish banking system in the past two years.  For some time now, there has been a large amount of irresponsible commentary both inside and outside the Houses in regard to banking issues.  I <Col N="663"/>agree that confidence has to be restored to the sector but that requires us to pull together, which we have not done in the past two years.  All of us should examine our consciences in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Senator raised a political charge I dealt with previously in the media.  I never used the words &ldquo;the cheapest bailout&rdquo;.  I was interviewed on my way into a conference in Dublin several months after the guarantee was introduced and at a time when the United Kingdom Government was investing substantial sums of money in its own banks.  I simply stated that it had been the cheapest bailout so far.  The Senator can check the record of my comments.  It was a cheap bailout at that stage.  On the night of the guarantee, I indicated that we would have to go very deep into the banking system.</P>
        <P>The Senator also raised the question of Anglo Irish Bank and the political charge that somehow the Government or I have particular affection for that bank and want to preserve it.  That is certainly not the case but the collapse of the bank would have collapsed the country&rsquo;s economy.  That prospect is not understood or accepted by some who have consistently argued against it even though Professor Honohan&rsquo;s report on the guarantee specifically stated that Anglo Irish Bank was of systemic importance.  It was not systemically important in the sense that it has branches in every part of Ireland, like AIB, but because it was of such a large size that its failure would have huge implications for Ireland, the sovereign and the other banks in the financial system.</P>
        <P>I have endlessly rehearsed these arguments in the past two years but certain Opposition politicians, including Senator Buttimer, simply want to repeat the same old charges.  The Senator is not particularly bad in this regard but that has been the character and quality of the debate on this subject.  If he is in government, he will get a wake up call very quickly.  If I am a Member, my party will support Government policy and ensure they are restored.  We have to be more responsible on this issue than we have been heretofore.</P>
        <P>A national debate on default continues to take place in the media despite the fact that every schoolchild knows that one cannot stage a default without the support of a central bank.  When certain bonds are dishonoured in the United States, the Federal Reserve immediately moves in to protect the institution in question.  The European Central Bank made it clear to us in the recent negotiations that it would not countenance a default on senior debt.  That is the position of our Central Bank.  The response is that the ECB is being unfair in refusing us this easy way out but it has already loaned more than &euro;100 billion to the Irish banking system at a rate of 1% rather than 5.8%.  Our banking system has become highly dependent on that collateral but it cannot continue indefinitely.  We have to take structural measures to reform the banks.</P>
        <P>I apologise to the Senator if I seem somewhat vigorous in replying to him but he personified many of the arguments we have heard in the past two years.  These arguments have not brought us anywhere on this subject and that is why I responded vigorously.</P>
        <P>In regard to amendment No. 1, I have already explained that we are following the wording of a Community law directive because that ensures recognition by other European countries of court orders made under this legislation.  That is important because many of our banking instruments are expressed in the law of other European countries.  The more international recognition we can obtain for our court orders, the stronger and more virile these orders become.  That definitively does not mean this Government is committed to restoring Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>The Government is free to do as it pleases in this matter.  I have already outlined our policy but I will do so again for the House.  It is intended to use the powers in relation to assets and liabilities to deal with the bank&rsquo;s assets and liabilities.  It is also intended to merge Anglo Irish <Col N="664"/>Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society into a single entity and to work out their assets over time.  That is clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>As a disinterested observer, I voted for the guarantee scheme.  Knowing what we know now, I would still support the legislation if I had to vote for it again because it was the correct and only decision available to us.  However, the Minister is not completely blameless in this nor is the main Opposition party completely to blame.  Very responsibly, Fine Gael supported the guarantee legislation.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party keeps reminding us that it never supported the legislation.  Every time it reminds the Minister of that fact, he responds with the speech he just made to Senator Buttimer.  That is the wrong response.  The correct response is Professor Honohan&rsquo;s report, which explicitly states that without the guarantee there would have been a run on all the high street banks and the banking sector would have collapsed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand corrected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason he does not refer to the report is because Professor Honohan went on to suggest that the guarantee was perhaps too extensive.  As the Minister does not want to acknowledge that finding, he sticks to the other argument.</P>
        <P>Without being patronising, the jury is out on what would have happened to senior bondholders.  I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s thesis because I am not comfortable with the idea of burning the bondholders but that should be his answer.  Fine Gael was clear in its support for the guarantee and Professor Honohan was explicit on the need for one.  The Minister&rsquo;s constituency colleague should be told that the argument has already been concluded every time she raises it.  We rely on Professor Honohan for disinterested opinion in this area.  The Minister can argue his case on the other issue because nobody knows what would have happened.</P>
        <P>I understand why my colleagues tabled amendment No. 1.  Can the Minister imagine telling the Irish people that the Oireachtas passed legislation to restore Anglo Irish Bank?  The people will walk towards Senator Donohoe on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I hope they are listening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want those words to be removed because I do not want to be associated with restoring Anglo Irish Bank.  I am aware that the section deals with the financial position rather than the bank but words mean what people think they mean.  Getting rid of those words will not damage the Minister&rsquo;s intentions.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Accepting the amendment would not undermine the Minister&rsquo;s objectives.  This was a belt and braces bit added in at the end by the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is unnecessary and is tautologous.  The Minister could concede the point to Senator Donohoe or, at the very least, concede that his argument prevails but that he is not prepared to accept it, because at least that would be practical.  Senator Donohoe was right in what he said.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s dislike of having the phrase in the legislation but I never sit here as a lawyer.  I sit here as a Minister and take the legal advice I am given in a matter like this.  I welcome the fact the amendment was tabled and discussed because it gave me, as Minister, an opportunity to outline that this was not the policy in regard to Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P><Col N="665"/>
        <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 5</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised the following question, including on the Order of Business.  Does this country need a Central Bank?  What we need is regulation and a Central Bank for the currency.  Forget about the little Irelanders, as I describe them, who believe this is something to do with sovereignty.  I am just talking about operating our currency.  I presume the Minister would be instinctively in favour of euro bonds, although I am not sure whether he has offered a view on that publicly.  Do we need a Central Bank?  What we need is regulation and a democratic European Central Bank in Frankfurt to which we can send a curate every month.  Do we need a Central Bank, apart from the optics of being able to deal with those europhobes?  Do we need 16 central banks to run the one currency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole has raised a very large question which would probably necessitate a full amendment to the European Union treaties.  Every member state which participates in the euro has representation on the governing council of the European Central Bank through their governors.  That is of considerable value to Ireland and other countries.  When we linked ourselves to sterling, we had no influence with the Bank of England, although our link with sterling was only an alignment, not a currency union, whereas under this arrangement we have a voice within the European Central Bank.  It may have been a voice spoken loudly to in recent times but it is still a voice.  Likewise, the eurozone finance Ministers meet in the euro group and have access to the President of the European Central Bank in that way, which again is of value to the country.</P>
        <P>The wider question, which the Senator raised and which is a valid one, is whether the European Central Bank should be free of all political direction.  The statute establishing the European Central Bank entrenches its independence of the political system, yet questions relating to currency, valuation and the regulation of banking are all highly political questions.  As the Senator knows, different countries have different arrangements.  For example, in the United States, the mandate of the Federal Reserve is far more extensive than simply managing a currency and ensuring there is no inflation.  It extends to social and economic objectives.  There are different arrangements in different currency areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A national central bank has become a branch office for the ECB in each member state.  Essentially, that is the direction in which we have moved.  If one takes the bank support measures which are in place and the facilities being provided by the European Central Bank, the facilities described as collateral depend on the giving of security to the European Central Bank.  The relevant collateral is provided for the local institution directly from the European Central Bank.  If one looks at the emergency liquidity arrangements which apply when, essentially, the institution needs cash and does not have any further collateral to offer, that is done by the national central bank, although the currency is euro.  There is a sort of mystery in that arrangement but the risk is on the sovereign in regard to such lending to the institutions.  There is merit in Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point but there is a need for a wider debate in Europe not only about euro bonds but about the role of the Central Bank in the current crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I read something recently about whether a central bank can go bust.  It is a question which goes to the heart of the point the Minister just made.  Since we left the gold standard, central banks cannot go bust.  Quantitative easing is the proof of this.  There is a row in the United States currently.  They will print $600 billion extra and buy bonds from each other.  The role of the Central Bank has changed com<Col N="666"/>pletely.  Tier one is not even decided in the European Union but in Switzerland.  Is that not an extraordinary issue?</P>
        <P>The reason I raise this issue is that throughout this legislation, the Minister has given himself all manner of fail-safes, rights and so on.  However, this section states that we cannot interfere with the European Central Bank.  That proves my point.  We can walk over Stock Exchange rules, pay short shrift to the Companies Acts, deal with any of the by-laws or rules of any organisation or association and we can walk over the 1989 building societies legislation and the Central Bank legislation, as required by the Minister.  I do not disagree with the objectives but I say that to prove a point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This section states that nothing in the Bill prevents the performance of the Governor of the Central Bank in his or her functions in regard to obligations to Europe.  It is on that basis that I asked the question.  I recognise it is peripheral to this but it is important people realise we are passing legislation which allows us to ride roughshod over the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Long Title refers to disturbance, permanent and otherwise, of rights, including property rights.  We will come back to it.  We are giving our permission to steamroll through 200 years of legislation.  I am not saying I oppose this.  I have problems with the way it is done in a number of places, but this section is different.  We are saying we will not touch the man in Dame Street and that is why I asked the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 6</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>In a way I wish to pick up on what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said about the independence of the Central Bank from any explicit political guidance.  Will the Minister explain further what this section means?  The phrase &ldquo;may from time to time specify a relationship framework in writing to govern the relationship between the Minister and Governor&rdquo; is ripe for abuse in the future.  Section 7(2) states: &ldquo;the Minister, having consulted with the Governor&rdquo;.  That is made clear throughout the Bill.  This subsection, however, appears to give the Minister the ability to issue some form of written guidance to the Central Bank and the person occupying the role of Governor.  It is difficult to see how the ability to issue that kind of a guidance is consistent with what section 5 is about, namely, to seek to maintain the independence of the Central Bank.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the interview the Minister gave on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; during the week.  He spoke about the review of the Department of Finance and what was learned.  He referred to the economic unsustainability of the political guidance that was given to Departments and to the entire system.  Given that those kinds of mistakes were made in the past, is there not a real danger that a mistake like that could be made by allowing section 6 to stand?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A relationship needs to have two parties to it and whatever agreement is drawn up or whatever is specified by the Minister, clearly the written relationship framework would be concluded after consultation with the Governor.  The relationship framework fully respects the independence of the Governor and there is no question of the Minister trying to direct the Governor under that section.  In fact the section is placed in the Bill after the section confirming the independence of the Governor of the Central Bank.  The function <Col N="667"/>of the relationship agreement is simply to provide that when the Central Bank is giving the advice to the Department it is done in a structured and consistent way.</P>
        <P>An important and valid issue raised in the discussion is why all the powers are not simply being given to the Governor of the Central Bank in the first instance.  That was reflected upon in the preparation of the legislation.  However, the view was taken that given the scale of the emergency and the scale of funds that would be required to be deployed to address that emergency, the Minister for Finance of the day, as the person accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for public moneys, should exercise these powers.  The Senator will have noticed from the programme that it is intended to establish permanent resolution legislation for banks and the intention is to publish such legislation by the end of February.  That permanent resolution legislation will have the Governor of the Central Bank as the central person exercising powers under that legislation.  If one likes, that is foreshadowed in this legislation and as the Senator rightly points out many sections can only be operated and implemented after consultation with the Governor, but also a wider relationship should be established so the Governor&rsquo;s functions regarding advice are clarified in different ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is much of that guidance not already laid out in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, which specifies the role of the Central Bank and other regulatory bodies in our financial and banking systems?  During the debate on that Bill we discussed setting up the Central Bank Commission.  The section uses the phrase &ldquo;to govern the relationship between the Minister and the Governor [of the Central Bank]&rdquo;.  In a number of years when the wisdom of this time has been forgotten, we might find ourselves in a similar situation again &mdash; I hope it never happens and if it does it is less serious.  A future Minister might be dealing with a particular bank and there might be some allegation of intimacy between that bank and the party that is in government, but a decision would then be made.  Does having such a section in place not create the capacity for some form of guidance or if not the capacity the perception that it will be happening?</P>
        <P>I am mystified by a point the Minister made and want to explore it further.  If the Minister knows that the permanent legislation that will follow this temporary legislation will have the Governor discharging the responsibilities outlined in the Bill, why does the temporary legislation provide that the Minister for Finance should do it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe I explained that in terms of the vast amount of public money that will be invested in the institutions as a result of the programme and the need to ensure the Minister for Finance of the day will be accountable for that substantial investment to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, to which he is responsible.  That is the primary reason.</P>
        <P>The relationship framework is a very important provision that will facilitate the development of an understanding between the Minister and the Governor on the exercise of the powers.  It does not in any way undermine the independence of the Governor, which is guaranteed by the preceding section, and provides a valuable structure for developing and understanding the relative powers.  Of course, the legislation is temporary and therefore the scenario the Senator paints of some future Minister exercising powers against the Governor will not materialise; the Bill lapses at the end of 2012.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the circumstances the Minister has in mind requiring giving written notice to the relevant institution.  I apologise, I have lost my train of thought.  May I have a moment to reflect?  Perhaps Senator O&rsquo;Toole could remind me of the purpose of my amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment needs to be taken in the context of the entire section.  Section 7(4) appears to be contradictory to section 7(1)(<i>a</i>) &mdash; assuming that somebody can understand section 7(1)(<i>a</i>).  First, I will explain my understanding of that subsection and then explain how the amendment fits into that.  Section 7(1)(<i>a</i>) provides that &ldquo;the Minister may make a proposed direction order proposing that a relevant institution be directed to take ... or refrain from taking&rdquo;.  The amendment seeks to delete words that seem to contradict that.  Section 7(4) states &ldquo;unless the relevant institution concerned consents to the making of a direction order&rdquo;.  However, we have already said that it needs to put up with it &mdash; put up or shut up &mdash; but we are now saying unless it disagrees.  There is a clear conflict.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Certain writers have been famous for their periodic sentences, which go on for line after line making it difficult to work out what they mean.  However, my reading of that section makes it clear that there is a conflict.  Section 7(1)(<i>a</i>) also provides that the Minister may make an order notwithstanding any statutory or contractual pre-emption rights.  I am reading it differently from how it is written in the Bill to try to make English of it.  It is also notwithstanding the listing rules of a regulated market or the rules of any other market on which the shares of the relevant institution may be traded from time to time.  Some of those might not be Irish because banks might be dealing with various kinds of issuers.  Are we just talking about Irish-based issuers on the Irish Stock Exchange?  Irish bank shares are also listed on the London Stock Exchange.  Is the Minister asking us to agree that he can make an order notwithstanding any of listing rules of the market regulated by the London Stock Exchange?  If so, I have a problem with it.  However, this seems to be contradicted elsewhere in the section.</P>
        
      
        <P Just="Left">Section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) refers to de-listing, with which I do not have a problem.  However, I do not understand what "another multilateral trading facility" means. Is this over-the-counter share trading or what?  If it is OTC type trading, is it like National Toll Roads, for instance, which is not listed but in whose shares one can deal?  Is it that kind of system where one deals <?oasys _jy ?>directly with stock brokers without them being listed in a company, or what is the issue with those?</P>
        <P>On another point, under subsection (1)(<i>d</i>), the Minister can then make an order &ldquo;making a specified alteration to the relevant institution&rsquo;s memorandum of association and articles of association&rdquo;.  We are passing legislation that undermines entire Acts.  Maybe that is the case.  Is the Minister sure he has dotted all the i&rsquo;s and crossed all the t&rsquo;s?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The paragraph goes on to state &ldquo;(including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing,&rdquo;.  Is there somebody who can tell me what that means?  I do not know what &ldquo;foregoing&rdquo; we are talking about.  Is it the foregoing of the paragraph, the subsection, the section or the <?oasys _jy ?>Bill?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will listen to the Minister on it.  I am just confused.  It states, &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing.&rdquo; If the Minister can bring me to an understanding of it, then the next clause in it is, &ldquo;the alteration of the rights of shareholders&rdquo;.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No.  The Minister is giving power to do all of these things and this amendment seems to be supporting that, in other words, by taking a catch-all clause out of it to undermine the Minister&rsquo;s powers after the Minister had given himself all of these powers.  The Bill provides, &ldquo;(including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing&rdquo;, the Minister can make a specified alteration, including an alternation of the rights of shareholders.  Can the Minister do this?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Companies Act 1990 is one of the Acts mentioned.  I have not bothered to go back to look at it.  I would not be able to find it in that Act, it is such a big one.  The Minister is asking us to do things here with which I am deeply uncomfortable, even though I see his objective.  Can we, in fact, pass this?</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Minister&rsquo;s answer to all of those questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, can he then explain why he cannot accept Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s amendment because it seems to give the Minister that power, or else it is reflecting in his mind a doubt that he can really do all that he stated earlier?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope I make some sense to the Minister on this.  It is quite difficult to read some of the sentences in the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raises an interesting point.  Is it allowable to in a sense ride roughshod over other rights and entitlements in company law and to subjugate their authority to this one here?  It is something we raised on Second Stage about the constitutionality of the Bill.  I raise it because I sympathise with the point the Senator raises about how the Minister is compromising the rights, entitlements or provisions within company law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for stepping in.  I emphasise one point he made.  On subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), which states &ldquo;notwithstanding any statutory or contractual pre-emption rights, the listing rules of a regulated market&rdquo;, does the Minister mean a stock exchange?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand this legislation to state that notwithstanding the rules of the Stock Exchange, the Government will be able to step in to make rules and decisions on the presence of a company on the Stock Exchange.  I thought that kind of relationship was one that very much occurred only between the listing company and where it is listing, in this case the Stock Exchange.  It merely indicates to me the real tension that is at play here.  What we are trying to do is manage the impact that a systemic bank can have on the rest of the economy but there is a real tension between that and the rights of private property, and the rights of the same bank then to be present, for example, on the Stock Exchange. To compound what Senator O'Malley stated, is the Minister stating that this legislation would be able to override the rules of, for example, the Irish Stock Exchange and override the nature of a relationship a bank might have with the agency on which it is listed?</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is important to remember the context in which this power is being sought.  The power is being sought because there are circumstances in the Irish banking system <Col N="670"/>which are threats to the stability of the system and one of the threats to the stability of the system is that a particular institution might not be able to access any risk capital on the markets.  In such circumstances the Minister, in order to preserve the financial stability of the system, must be in a position to be the provider of risk capital of last resort and to be in that position the Minister must be in a position to overrule existing veto powers enjoyed by shareholders.  Were the Minister not given that power, the shareholders could reject a proposed investment and that would prevent the stabilisation of the institution concerned.</P>
        <P>Clearly, any powers being exercised under this section would be proportionate to the object to be achieved.  Were a bank well capitalised, for example, and able to access funds on the market in a credible way, it would not be possible for the State to exercise these powers to overrule the interests of shareholders.  One is talking here about an extraordinary contingency which might or might not materialise, and equipping the Minister with powers to deal with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely, by virtue of the shareholding the Minister holds now in these institutions on behalf of the State, and the moral authority apart from that, none of those institutions would dare overrule him or even if they did, would not be able to overrule him in the proper exercise of the powers he possesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan has given a good example.  Although I have a substantial shareholding, for example, in Bank of Ireland or AIB, the fact remains that there are questions about the exercise of those voting rights in a context where I am making a further investment in terms of the Stock Exchange procedures and rules that apply to takeovers etc.  I say to Senator O&rsquo;Toole, that is the purpose of the exclusion of legislation.  There must be clarity about this particular power.</P>
        <P>One of the crucial points made by the European Commission, and by the ECB and the IMF in their discussions, and one in which I personally participated in the particular discussion, was the need for speed of execution in these banking matters.  We cannot simply state that we will capitalise bank X to the extent of, say, &euro;4 billion and in two months time there will be a shareholders meeting about this.  Given the perilous condition of the Irish banking system, that is not credible on the markets.  We need a speed of execution here and that is why this section empowers the Minister for Finance simply to put money into the institution notwithstanding the various stock exchange rules, the Companies Act rules or the provisions of memoranda or articles of association.</P>
        <P>A power of this type must be exercised subject to the terms of this statute and subject to the terms of the Constitution.  Of course, judicial confirmation is required of the exercise of the power.  Even apart from that, it is always subject to the Constitution and it must always be exercised, like all powers, in a manner which is proportionate to the need to secure the objectives of the statute.  It is not a power that can be used at large or willfully against financial institutions that are thriving.  It is a power that can be used where an institution is exposed in its capital base, and the Minister can then make a variety of direction orders in these circumstances to give complete satisfaction that this matter can be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to be clear about one point, I am not querying the objective or the purposes of the Bill.  The query is a purely legislative one.  I am not arguing the case for what the Minister is trying to achieve.  I am merely raising questions on the method in which the Minister is doing it.  The questions that come up for me are the ones that I raised.  AIB, for example, is currently listed on the London Stock Exchange and I presume the issuer referred to by the Minister is the bank.  As long as it is listed it is required to conform to the rules of the Stock Exchange and must sign off on them.  The Minister is stating that this applies <Col N="671"/>&ldquo;notwithstanding anything in those rules&rdquo;.  That is an issue as I cannot see how the Minister has the authority for this.  I am not objecting to the Minister having that authority but I do not know that he could have it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The next issue may have a very simple answer.  What is a multilateral trading facility?  The Minister raised the question of shareholders.  I cannot recall the term in a building society but I believe such people are called members as opposed to shareholders.  Does this issue extend to them?  I will hold my questions on the Minister&rsquo;s points regarding shareholders until we get to section 20.  I see the Minister looking at the clock but we will get to that section all right.  Will the Minister deal with those issues?  The amendment simply considers that if these powers are vested in the Minister, there is no need to include the undermining position in subsection (4).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s point on clarity in law.  Would he not aid the speed of execution if he could ensure the non-continuance in office of any remaining so-called legacy directors?  I take his point about Stock Exchange rules and people who could put cows on the line.  We may not be playing the cleverest game on behalf of the State with the continuance of certain people in office in some of these institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a substantial amount of change and scope for further change under this legislation when it is fully implemented in the next few weeks.  A multilateral trading facility is a secondary market rather than an official market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a grey market in other words.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole also raised the question of de-listing.  There comes a point under the terms of the rules themselves where the degree of State investment and participation would result in the entity being de-listed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in that context the institution would be required to de-list.  The State has no ambition to have banks automatically de-listed from the Stock Exchange but if the terms of the exchange require it to be de-listed, it is necessary for the Minister to be able to require the bank to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question on section 7(1)(<i>a</i>).  It indicates &ldquo;rules of any other market on which the shares of the relevant institution may be traded from time to time&rdquo; but does that include Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s example of AIB shares on the British Stock Exchange?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation will give the Government the power not only to override the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange but also any other stock exchange where an Irish company is traded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and that is crucial.  There was an entertaining exchange earlier about the relevant community legal provisions.  That is why we have sought to mirror those provisions in so far as possible in this legislation.  By mirroring the provisions in this legislation, we are ensuring a degree of international recognition for the High Court orders to be made under it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but is the following the procedure as outlined?  There may be equity going from the bank to the Minister in lieu of <Col N="672"/>whatever is being given to the bank.  That is the consideration.  When the bank and the Minister make that decision and the transaction does not comply with the listing rules of the London Stock Exchange, for example, section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) would then come into effect and a de-listing would be applied for.  Is that the process?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand that, although it is cumbersome.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two other points relating to section 7, with the first being section 7(5)(<i>c</i>), which states: &ldquo;the Minister has reasonable grounds for believing that confidentiality with regard to the proposed direction order, or the possibility of the making of a direction order, would not be maintained and that the breach of such confidentiality would have significant adverse consequences&rdquo;.  What experience have we had to this point which has made the Minister deem it necessary to refer specifically to confidentiality?  To be clear, this seems to be the confidentiality between the Minister and the financial institution.</P>
        <P>The second point relates to section 7(1)(<i>d</i>) which states: &ldquo;making a specified alteration to the relevant institution&rsquo;s memorandum of association and articles of association (including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the alteration of the rights of shareholders or any class of shareholders)&rdquo;.  This is to emphasise the import of what this legislation involves.  I understand the point that this legislation is to be wielded by the Government in exceptional financial circumstances.  I hope we have this right because when the Government looks to wield this power, it should be able to do so.  This section and others should not end up leaving the entire process snared in a legal challenge.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage I made the point that when equivalent legislation was triggered in other jurisdictions, it led to immediate legal challenges.  With the broadness of the conferred power, it appears inevitable that legal challenges will be taken, although I hope they are not.</P>
        <P>My questions relate to confidentiality but also emphasise the point relating to section 7(1)(<i>d</i>).  I do not want someone to look back at the debate on this legislation in years to come, as brief as it will be given that we are discussing historic legislation, and for it to be said that this matter was not debated or picked out as something that could be challenged at some future point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Senators&rsquo; interventions on the Bill.  I should not comment on the other House but there was no such similar debate there.  On confidentiality, the Minister would not notify the institution but would go straight to court for confirmation of the order.  The purpose of the confidentiality subsection comes from the possibility of the Minister making an assessment that confidentiality will be broken, primarily within the institution itself, in order that he or she can move directly to court to deal with the matter.  As we know from what happened in some of our financial institutions in recent years, we can see the wisdom of having a power of this type.</P>
        <P>I had personal direct experience of negotiations with the former chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank shortly before the bank was offered capitalisation and ultimately nationalised.  With such discussions, could we be certain there would not be media disclosures?  There are circumstances where the system and its stability must be protected in the context of the institution being dealt with.</P><Col N="673"/>
        <P>The Senator correctly raised another query relating to section 7(1)(<i>d</i>), which relates to the question of the rights of shareholders, classes of shareholders and the alteration of their rights.  The Senator is quite right.  If a valuable shareholding was interfered with, there could be questions of legal entitlement, which is a consideration of proportionality to which the Minister must have regard in implementing this legislation.  On the other hand, if one has an institution which requires so much capital and cannot access it on the market and which has a residual shareholder class, plainly that residual shareholder class has assets of very low value, if any.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P>Sections 8 and 9 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 10</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>What urgent circumstances would result in the section being triggered?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision relates to the variation of an initial or primary order.  If there is a technical flaw in the order which requires urgent amendment, the Minister may apply to the court <i>ex parte</i> and without notice.  The purpose of the section is to allow the Minister to apply to the court to alter a direction order if he or she is satisfied that the alteration is necessary to achieve the purposes of the Bill.  It is to be expected that in an urgent application for a direction order matters may arise at a later time which require to be addressed.  While the Minister will apply <i>ex parte</i>, the court may take the view, on hearing the matter, that a party should be put on notice.  Therefore, the fact that the Minister may apply <i>ex parte</i> does not prevent the court from deciding that a party should be put on notice of the Minister&rsquo;s application.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, is it not a requirement that the Minister&rsquo;s application to the court be made on technical grounds?  Could this provision be triggered by a change in broader circumstances or as a result of new information coming to light?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The circumstances defined for an <i>ex parte</i> application are &ldquo;urgent circumstances&rdquo;.  If one has to apply with notice, one must give notice of the proceedings.  There may be urgent circumstances where a Minister may wish to apply on his or her own motion without notice to another party.  The court will then have the Minister&rsquo;s application and determine whether it is of sufficient urgency to be acceded to or whether a temporary order should be made and other parties put on notice.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Having read a substantial amount of commentary on the Bill and the record of the debate in the other House, it is clear that some of the powers provided for in section 13 have given rise to considerable discussion.  The extraordinary innovation in the Bill is the introduction of the concept of special manager, a person who may be appointed to a bank and, on behalf of the Minister, exercise the wide-ranging powers conferred by the <Col N="674"/>legislation.  A special manager will have extensive powers which will influence the destiny of the financial institution to which he or she is appointed.  What will be the relationship between a special manager and the Minister?  Will he or she report to the Minister?  How will the relationship work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not envisaged that there will be an immediate exercise of the powers conferred by this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The State has its own effective management teams in operation in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  This section was being prepared for the resolution legislation.  It is considered to be a power which is of considerable value.  It can only be exercised in exceptional circumstances or with the consent of the relevant institution.  Under section 20, the special manager takes over the management of the business and carries it on as a going concern with a view to preserving and restoring the financial position in a manner consistent with the purposes of the legislation.</P>
        <P>In some matters the special manager can, with the consent of the Minister, overrule shareholders.  He or she must provide reports and other information for the bank and the Minister.  In that sense, there is a requirement to provide information.  He or she must act in the best interests of the bank, of which he or she is the special manager.  The section provides that while a relevant institution is under special management, the functions of the directors and, with the consent of the Minister, the powers of the general meetings may be exercisable only by the special manager.  The Minister&rsquo;s written prior consent is required for a number of actions, including the winding up of the institution in question or the appointment of an examiner, an inspector or a receiver.  There must be written notice to the Minister if a party wants to enforce security against the assets of the bank.</P>
        <P>Section 20(3) makes it clear that the business of an institution under special management shall continue as a going concern and that no agreement, policy, transaction, bank account or obligation of the institution is avoided, cancelled, stayed or otherwise affected by reason only of the appointment of a special manager.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been much discussion in the House about the scope and power of public interest directors, whether they have performed well and what they were aware of at different times.  The Minister states the role of the special manager will be to act in the best interests of the bank, to which he or she has been appointed.  This is not what is required.  The purpose of the appointment must be to have someone in a financial institution who will act in the best interests of the entire financial system and ensure the institution does not end up posing a systemic risk.  It is important to emphasise this point.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes to establish a new role of special manager who may be called upon should a further dire emergency arise and who will have much greater powers than those of a public interest director.  I understand the role of the special manager will not be to serve the interests of the financial institution, to which he or she is appointed, but to protect the national interest and try to ensure the bank does not cause difficulties for the overall financial system.  We should start drawing up a panel of potential special managers because the wisdom and skill they will require appear to be somewhat lacking among those who have been performed similar roles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek clarification on a comment the Minister made on the role of the special manager.  Will the role be completely different from that of a board member?  Will <Col N="675"/>it be the responsibility of the special manager to serve the national interest rather than the institutional interest?  Will the Minister confirm that is the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I confirm that is the case.  When I stated the special manager must act in the best interests of the bank, I meant he or she must act in the best interests of the bank in the context of the legislation rather than in the context of the traditional fiduciary arrangements or Stock Exchange character of the bank.  This is made clear by section 20(1) which states: &ldquo;The special manager of a relevant institution shall take over the management of the business of the relevant institution and shall carry on that business as a going concern with a view to preserving and restoring the financial position of the relevant institution, or the whole or any part of its business, in a manner consistent with the achievement of the purposes of this Act&rdquo;.  The purposes of the Bill include the various considerations of the public interest referred to by Senator Donohoe.</P>

        <P>Sections 14 and 15 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 16</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand this section concerns an institution which has been nominated to receive a special manager because of the threat it poses to the rest of the system.  It also concerns the ability of the institution to challenge that it needs such a special manager.  In this regard, the section includes the words, &ldquo;not later than five working days after the making of the special management order&rdquo;.  The Minister made the point very well that in responding to preserve the stability of the banking system time is of the essence.  Given this, should the period in question not be much shorter than a full working week?  If an institution seeks to challenge the decision of the Government, it should be compelled to do so almost instantly to eliminate any uncertainty in the eyes of the market and of those looking at the country.</P>

	<P>Why does the Bill declare a period of six months from the making of a relevant special management order?  I understand this to mean the period a special manager will be in place.  What is the thinking behind this provision?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Perhaps it is just me, but section 20 is a step too far and I cannot take it.  There is just too much involved.  In the first place, I see the function of the special manager as that of an examiner or a person appointed to run the business for a period.  I wrote a letter to the Minister this week, although he will not have seen my name on it.  My name was not on the bottom, but the letter came from a board of which I am a member and was an excellent one of its type.  Let me paraphrase it: &ldquo;Dear Minister, we have certain information, to which we believe your bank crisis investigator doctor should have access, but, unfortunately, under section 21 of the Companies Act 2003, we find it impossible to give you this information&rdquo;.  That letter was sent from the board to the Minister within the past week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to section 20(8) which reads, &ldquo;The special manager of a relevant institution shall provide such reports and other information to the Bank and the Minister as the Bank or the Minister requests, notwithstanding any other enactment or any rule of law, code of practice, agreement, duty or obligation to any person&rdquo;.  The Data Commissioner will have a word to say about this, given that he runs riot over us on a regular basis as we try to do our day&rsquo;s work.  I only wish this power could help to achieve some of what I want to achieve.</P>
        <P>By law, the Central Bank is specifically prevented from sharing information.  After the offshore banking problem in 2000, whether certain people had information became an issue.  In 2002 I chaired the audit review group on behalf of the Government.  We found that, although Revenue, the Central Bank and perhaps another institution might have had information, they could not have shared it with one another.  We brought forward legislation that referred to constricted circumstances where there might be a conduit, in a fair, open and practical way, between these institutions.  I do not believe the two lines I read will overturn this provision and I would be appalled if they did.  Therefore, the Minister will have to find another way to do it.</P><Col N="677"/>
        <P>On the same issue, subsection (6) reads, &ldquo;A special manager may, with the consent of the Minister and the Governor, substitute his or her own decision for any decision that would otherwise be made by the shareholders, and if he or she does so, the decision shall be taken to be the decision of the shareholders&rdquo;.  That leaves us in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> territory where words mean what I say they mean.  The Minister cannot do this.  Let me provide an example from company law.  It deals with the issues that create a problem for shareholders.  The Minister has made speeches about company law, the operation of companies and the cold question of auditors.  He knows we have been looking at the position of company auditors.  The requirement concerning the appointment of a company auditor is so embedded in terms of the rights of shareholders that I cannot believe the two lines I read can make a difference.  This brings us back to our earlier discussion on section 7(1)<i>(d)</i> during which I stated I would revert to an aspect of the matter.  This is it.  I put it to the Minister that these two lines cannot possibly deal with the issue.  In regard to AGM reports, there are various requirements under company law for decisions to be taken by the shareholders.  There is a way around this in the case of the banks.  As the Minister is, effectively, the shareholder, I do not know why we have even to discuss this matter.  However, there are other institutions in which he does not have an equity stake as such.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In spite of its bad report in recent days, there is one thing the Minister&rsquo;s Department is very good at, namely, finding a new word for something.  The word &ldquo;examinership&rdquo; is an example.  When we deal with an insurance company, we do not speak about examinership but something else &mdash; a word I cannot recall.  For example, the Quinn insurance group is not in examinership.  The Department of Finance is superb at finding a new word to describe something.  The Minister is also very good at this &mdash; we had the word &ldquo;supervening&rdquo; from him during the week.  However, he will have to be a little more creative&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A supervening event.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I know what the Minister is trying to do, but this is not the way to do it.  There are other ways to do so.  If a case was taken to the Four Courts, the Minister might state his case and rely on the public interest, as mentioned in the Preamble or whatever precedes the Bill proper, but I do not believe that would hold sway or be what was required.  The Minister used the word &ldquo;proportional&rdquo; twice.  This is not proportional and flies in the face of legislation.  If the whole Bill were time bound &mdash; Senator Donohoe referred to aspects that are time bound &mdash; I probably could not have this argument and I would have to admit it only pertains to certain institutions for a short period.  However, it is not for a short period.  Given the number of references to the word &ldquo;whereas&rdquo;, it could apply until judgment day.  While I have problems with a number of sections, it would be irresponsible of me not to vote against sections 6 and 8 in particular.  They are wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to add to that and draw attention to section 4, which gives the special manager &ldquo;sole authority over and direction of all officers and employees of the relevant institution&rdquo;.  This means anybody working in the financial institution would be bound to obey the direction of the special manager in any area.  Will the Minister clarify this?  If the special manager asks an employee to carry out a particular task, legally that implies he will have to agree to doing so.  I state this to emphasise the power being confined in the special manager.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wholeheartedly agree with the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole on section 6.  What does it add to the Bill?  Is the provision not just creating the near certainty that, if the Bill is triggered, a shareholder will contend the manager does not speak for him and that he disagrees with the direction the Government is taking?  We have seen elsewhere that shareholders are sometimes willing to fight and do fight against governments when they implement measures that are <Col N="678"/>necessary to preserve the overall stability of the system.  How can we say the special manager&rsquo;s decision will be taken to be the decision of the shareholders given that we know many shareholders will be resisting some of the measures in the Bill?  It will not be in keeping with what will be happening in the real world if this Bill is ever implemented.  Is stating the decision of the special manager will equate to the decision of the shareholders not just a time-bomb that will undermine the implementation of the legislation if it is called upon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of points were raised.  Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Donohoe referred to shareholders.  Decisions on the shareholders can be taken by the manager.  That is part of the European framework that is being developed in this area.</P>
        <P>With regard to confidentiality, one must consider the relevant section in conjunction with section 72 which, in turn, refers to the Schedule.  In this regard, the Central Bank is legally able to share confidential information to facilitate itself, the Governor, the Minister, the head of financial regulation or a special manager.  It is essential&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I am not arguing with the Minister.  On foot of its investigation in 2001, the Committee of Public Accounts reported that issues of which the Central Bank was aware could not be communicated to other authorities.  That was after the passage of the Central Bank Act 1942, which the Minister quoted.  It may be the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 that provided a further conduit to the banks for sharing information.  I am not sure about that and should not be quoted on it.  The point however, is that although legislation was in place, sharing was not possible, yet the Minister&rsquo;s quotation refers to the authority.  That does not work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a specific information gateway for financial stability purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have another question.  I am deeply uncomfortable with this.  I have listened to the Minister&rsquo;s answers and know they were given to me in good faith but I believe he is being overly influenced by his objectives, with which I agree.  However, I do not believe this legislation will work.  There is no mention of directors.</P>
        <P>I nearly had to be tied down last week when I heard the debate on the &ldquo;public interest directors of a bank&rdquo;.  I believed the Minister would lecture the odd person and state there is no such animal as a public interest director.  All directors of a company have the same responsibilities and duties.  If it is the duty of a public interest director to do something, it is also the duty of the other directors to do so.  The fact that one is appointed in the public interest is neither here nor there when one takes office.  Many of us are appointed to or proposed for roles on an <i>ex officio</i> basis but when one takes up office one must act with the good of the institution in mind.  If I were a director of an institution and a special manager were appointed who did all the tasks outlined and I believed his doing so were wrong, for 24 reasons I would outline, what could I do?  There are certain requirements in the companies Acts on director compliance but, unfortunately, they have never been commenced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  What is correct for a director to do in the circumstances I describe?  In what manner have we allowed for dealing with directors&rsquo; responsibility?  A full section of the 2003 Act deals with the requirements and responsibilities of a director.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not answer my specific question and I want an answer.  I asked what the relationship would be between the special manager and an employee of one of these financial institutions.  For example, it could be the director, the chief executive officer or chief operations officer of the bank.  My understanding is that this Bill will give the <Col N="679"/>special manager the ability to order any employee of the bank to do what he deems to be fit.  Will the Minister answer my question in conjunction with that of Senator O&rsquo;Toole?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, it does.  The special manager is in the same position as the employer in the institution concerned and can issue whatever direction is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>In the light of what has been asked, I understand that when the special manager is appointed, he takes over the management of the relevant institution.  Once appointed, the functions of the directors of that institution become somewhat restricted.  Considering section 20, with some of the other sections, particularly sections 22, 23 and 24, I understand the special manager will determine the role of the directors.  Will the Minister clarify that?  What role do the directors have?  Will all functions be invested in the special manager?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The special manager takes the place of the board.</P>
        <P>Section 48 is related to the section in question and deals with the issue of public interest directors, on which Senators have had a recent discussion.  Section 48 provides that &ldquo;the directors of a relevant institution shall have a duty to have regard to the matters mentioned in <i>section 4(f)</i>&rdquo;, namely, to facilitate the availability of credit in the State, to protect the State&rsquo;s interest in respect of the guarantees given by the State under the Act of 2008, to protect the interests of taxpayers, to restore confidence in the banking sector, and to align the activities of the relevant institutions with the public interest and the other purposes of this Bill.  Those duties will take priority over any other duty of the directors in any instance where there may be conflict.  That is a very definite change.  It will apply even if no special manager is appointed.  The provisions of section 48 are very germane to the discussion we have just had.  The position in all the guaranteed institutions will be that the directors&rsquo; duties in respect of the public interest must take priority over any other duty.  If one examines the relevant provisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 22 deals with that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 4 was questioned by Senator Donohoe in respect of the powers necessary for or incidental to the special manager&rsquo;s function.  That is a normal power and a normal statutory provision.  There is nothing unusual in it.  Section 24(3) states: &ldquo;A director or other officer of a relevant institution or a subsidiary of a relevant institution that is under special management remains bound to discharge his or her duties and obligations under any enactment or rule of law except to any extent that he or she is relieved of that duty or obligation by the special manager or by a provision of this Act.&rdquo;  More generally, section 24 deals with the relationship between special managers and directors and Senator Callely drew attention to these provisions.  The special manager determines what the directors can do during the special management period.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>

	<P>Yes, with the shareholders and directors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, to the extent that they are relieved of their obligations by the operation of the special manager.  The special manager could opt to leave the board in place to perform certain functions.  There is nothing to stop the special manager doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the case, if the special manager decided to leave the board in place and the board was agreeable to stay, that they would work together?</P>

	<P>Surely that is not true.  Section 22(1)(<i>a</i>) states that all functions that would be vested in the directors of the relevant institution will be vested in the special manager.  There will be nothing left to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 24 permits the special manager to determine the role, if any, of the directors and officers in the relevant institution and its subsidiaries during the special management.  He might decide that there is a very good audit committee but a very poor risk committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my understanding that sections 23 and 24 provides that the special manager may act with the consent of the Minister.  I am sure the officials can clarify this point.  The Minister can confirm this before we conclude.  My understanding is that it must be done with the consent of the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is in respect of the removal of a director, secretary or another officer.  It does not concern the relationship between the special manager and the directors.  This is in a separate section, section 24.  Section 23 is contingent on ministerial consent; section 24 is not.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>My question concerns section 22(2).  On receivership, enforcement and claims against the financial institution, the Bill states: &ldquo;<i>Paragraphs (f)</i>, <i>(g)</i> and <i>(h)</i> of <i>subsection (1)</i> do not apply to the Bank, the European Central Bank or any other national central bank within the Eurosystem.&rdquo;  If it is necessary to say this section does not apply to other banks within the euro system, why is it not necessary to say this about the entire Bill?  I am sure there is something at the start of the Bill to say this covers only institutions threatening the financial stability of the Irish system.  Why is it necessary to have this reference in section 22 but not in other sections?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The relevant paragraphs, 22(1)(<i>f</i>), (<i>g</i>) and (<i>h</i>) deal with ministerial consent to enforcement procedures against credit institutions in the context of special management.  It is not possible to give the Minister such veto powers in regard to the Central Bank, <Col N="681"/>the European Central Bank or any other national central bank in the euro system.  This section protects what Senator O&rsquo;Toole described at the outset of the debate as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Section 22(3) gives the special manager power on a load of detailed activity that could take place in the banks, including actions concerning bank accounts and bank mandates.  Section 21 states that a special manager may appoint people to help in the discharge of his or her duties.  Would it not be better if the section also referred to people working for the special manager?  Otherwise people will need the consent of that one person for decisions on a bank mandate or the claim or debt of an individual depositor with the bank.  That appears to overload responsibility and detail on one person.  Would it not be better to broaden the definition to allow people working for the special manager to make these decisions?</P>

	<P>Section 22(3) is in place to ensure there is no interruption in the business of the bank as a going concern.  This is a precautionary section that makes clear that none of the transactions referred to under section 22(3) is voided, cancelled, stayed or otherwise affected by reason only of the appointment of the special manager.  When the special manager is appointed, it does not terminate one&rsquo;s current account or deposit account.  It does not set aside a policy or a contact one has with the bank or a right, title, claim or debt in respect of the institution.</P>

I believe that is the case and the Bill will not survive a court test.  It will be challenged and found to be unconstitutional; it sets aside rights.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to avail of the opportunity to appear before the House to discuss public expenditure and, in particular, the background to the 2010 Appropriation Bill which gives statutory effect to Voted expenditure for 2010.  However, before discussing public expenditure, it would be useful to offer some context by reviewing briefly the performance of the economy and the public finances in 2010.  I am glad to say that, following the sharp contraction of the economy in the past two years &mdash; the most severe since the Second World War &mdash; the latest data suggest economic activity has stabilised this year.  In fact, data published this morning show that both GDP and GNP increased in the third quarter.  Most analysts expect the economy to expand next year.  Initially, growth will be driven by the export sector, underpinned by significant improvements in competitiveness.</P>
        <P>As wages have adjusted and costs fallen, we have priced ourselves back into global markets for our goods and services.  Exports of goods and services increased at an annual rate of more than 13% in the third quarter, one of the best performances in the European Union.  This growth is broad-based, with the pharmaceutical, software, financial and food sectors all performing well.  With this export-driven growth, Ireland will have a current account surplus next year; therefore, the country as a whole will be paying its way.  Given the impact of the fiscal consolidation and the necessary unwinding of private sector imbalances, domestic demand is only expected to make a limited contribution to growth next year.  However, in the coming years export-led growth will gradually support expansion in the domestic economy.</P>
        <P>There are signs also that conditions in the labour market are beginning to stabilise.  It is encouraging that the unemployment rate has fallen in recent months.  Employment trends are expected to be flat next year, as one would expect, given the typical lag between economic growth and employment.  However, employment growth is expected to pick up from 2012 onwards.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the high levels of foreign direct investment Ireland continues to attract.  Almost 1,000 companies, including household names such as Google, eBay and Facebook, have chosen Ireland as the hub of their European networks.  Eight of the top ten global medical technology companies have a manufacturing base in Ireland, while eight of the top ten pharmaceutical firms have operations here.  The message must be clear that Ireland remains open for business and is still the destination of choice for many of the world&rsquo;s leading firms.</P><Col N="685"/>
        <P>The public finances have stabilised over the course of 2010, the year to which the Appropriation Bill relates.  The underlying general government deficit is now expected to be 11.6% of GDP which is in line with the forecast presented in budget 2010.  Tax revenues are expected to end the year close to &euro;500 million above target.  However, there will still be a gap between what we spend and our receipts in 2010 of approximately &euro;19 billion.  It is clear the State must reduce its level of borrowing in the coming years by aligning more closely its revenues and expenditure.  In the past two and half years the Government has engaged in a process of reprioritisation and consolidation across all areas of expenditure in order to close this gap.  The measures have reduced all aspects of Government discretionary spending, including public service pay and running costs across Departments and State bodies.  Significant revenue raising measures have also been implemented during this period, including the introduction of an income levy, the carbon tax and an increase in capital tax rates.  Based on a budgetary consolidation package of &euro;6 billion in 2011, the deficit is expected to decline further next year to 9.4%.  The key message is that both the real economy and the public finances have stabilised during the course of the year and the economy is set for recovery next year.</P>
        <P>Having set out this broad context, I want to deal with particular issues of public expenditure in 2010.    While a number of Supplementary Estimates were taken this year, the major ones were technical in nature.  Of the substantive Supplementary Estimates, the vast bulk of the additional moneys required resulted from shortfalls in receipts, rather than from increased expenditure.  In fact, the latest estimate of gross expenditure for this year shows savings of &euro;422 million against the original estimates published in the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume<i>, </i>with savings of approximately &euro;175 million in day-to-day expenditure.  In annual terms, current spending is estimated to contract by more than 2% this year, compared to an increase of more than 12% in 2007.  This major consolidation has been achieved in the face of significant fiscal pressures associated with the rising numbers in receipt of unemployment payments.</P>
        <P>Capital expenditure is anticipated to be lower than published in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2010.  This is due to a number of causes, primarily cheaper tender prices and delays in land purchases arising from landowners&rsquo; reluctance to sell at new lower values.  The 2010 capital programme remains very substantial and is forecast to represent approximately 4.9% of GNP.  This scale of investment is proportionately higher than 2007 levels and exceeds the average percentage for the five year period to 2009.</P>
        <P>Capital investment has played an important role in driving Irish economic advancement in the past decade.  The quality of the capital stock across the country gives powerful witness to progress already made.  The Government&rsquo;s capital investment priorities for 2010 and in the medium term build on what has been achieved to date.  These investment priorities are designed to drive productivity enhancements, lay the foundations for a return to export-led growth, assist in sustainable employment creation and deliver essential social infrastructure.  In this way, capital investment will be central to the push for economic renewal.  Even in these difficult budgetary times, we cannot afford not to invest in infrastructure which is needed to secure the country&rsquo;s economic future.</P>
        <P>Given the budgetary challenges of the past three years, we have had to reduce the financial allocations for capital investment set out in the national development plan at the beginning of 2007.  Like other areas of Government expenditure such as public service pay and social welfare, capital allocations could not avoid the imperative for budgetary corrections.  However, tender prices for construction have fallen considerably.  Lower prices, coupled with improvements in public sector procurement procedures such as fixed price contracts, afford greater opportunities to achieve value for money than during the boom years.  Departments have reported that they <Col N="686"/>are benefiting from these changed market conditions.  In short, we will get more for less and the infrastructure we now need will be cheaper than a few years ago.</P>
        <P>The 2010 capital programme supported the key investment priorities to help facilitate a return to growth and thereby support sustainable job creation in the longer term.  Modern transport infrastructure is vital to a modern economy.  This year we will complete the inter-urban motorway network and continue to improve the road network.  We are also providing substantial allocations for developing public transport infrastructure.  We will invest heavily in water services, not only for the obvious environmental benefits but also to provide the necessary infrastructure for industry and business.</P>
        <P>We will continue to invest heavily in our schools.  An educated workforce has been central to our previous economic advances and is an absolute prerequisite for our future economic renewal.  We are providing for the investment in science and innovation that will help to build our future success.  Significant sums are being allocated to ensure Ireland is at the forefront in using the commercial potential of innovation and technological development.  Investment in higher education will also enable Ireland to fully realise the opportunities offered by science and innovation.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland will be able to attract and support foreign direct investment.  This has been a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s past economic success and will be vital in developing an export-driven recovery.  Foreign direct investment has helped to sustain Ireland through our economic troubles and will be central to putting them behind us.  Enterprise Ireland will help indigenous enterprise to realise its potential.  Domestic enterprise will be supported in exploiting the opportunities for job creation and increasing exports as the international economy recovers.</P>
        <P>We will invest in enhancing the attractiveness of the tourism infrastructure and our attractions for overseas visitors.  Tourism provides significant employment, as well as being a significant earner of foreign income.</P>
        <P>We recognise the need for continued investment in important social infrastructure that will benefit all citizens.  Accordingly, we have continued to provide resources to meet social housing needs, support urban regeneration, particularly in Limerick and Ballymun, help maintain our national heritage, enhance and augment our hospitals and develop the network of primary and community care centres.</P>
        <P>The Appropriation Bill 2010 deals with expenditure during the course of the year.  Expenditure has been managed and controlled in a responsible way by the Government.  It is well short of target and revenue is in excess of target.  That process of responsible and prudent budgetary management will be continued into 2011, as set out in the recent Budget Statement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not had an opportunity to speak on any of the financial matters raised in recent weeks.  While I might disagree with the Minister politically, I commend him for his performance.  He is doing his best in difficult circumstances, for which I thank him on a personal level. I agree with much of what he said about the Bill.  He referred to the continued significant investment in road infrastructure.  One of the lasting benefits of the years of the Celtic tiger is that we have a national road network which is comparable to that in any other EU member state.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to invest further in water services.  Water is a costly commodity, yet almost half of the water produced escapes into the ground.  That is unsustainable.  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the need to invest heavily in schools building projects.  He is correct that better value for money can be achieved, alongside their potential to stimulate employment creation.</P><Col N="687"/>
        <P>I take a different view from the Minister on other issues.  He has suggested most economists expect the economy to expand next year.  However, a significant number of analysts do not expect such a recovery.  The Government&rsquo;s projections are based on a growth figure which a number of respected economists doubt we can achieve.  I agree with the Minister, however, that the improvement in our export position has resulted in an unexpected bonus for the Exchequer, but it is inaccurate to imply that most analysts expect the economy to expand next year.</P>
        <P>While there are signs labour market conditions are beginning to stabilise, I disagree that the falling unemployment rate is encouraging.  In my part of the world the rate is falling because people are leaving Ireland.  Looking through my telephone directory, I was shocked to see the number of my friends who had moved to London, Melbourne or Canada to ensure their economic survival.  The encouragement which the Minister claims to derive from the slight reduction in unemployment levels is false because we are losing many of our best and brightest.  That is the biggest indictment of 13 years of Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments.  We never thought so many would again be forced to emigrate for economic reasons.</P>
        <P>I concur with the Minister on the need to maintain capital spending on schools.  However, we appear to have missed the OECD report on falling education standards.  Whoever is Minister for Education and Skills next year, he or she will face a major task in reversing the rapid decline in standards.  Our educated workforce is crucial in getting out of our economic difficulties.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on tourism infrastructure.  Tourism and agriculture are two sectors in which we do well and investment in them is the key to restoring growth.  I was disappointed, however, that the Minister did not completely scrap the travel tax which I accept is now an old chestnut.  If the Government had bitten the bullet, it would have been in a stronger position to call on chief executives of the various airlines to meet their commitments.  A &euro;3 tax will not bring in substantial revenue, but it is being used as an excuse by certain individuals in attracting tourists.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s claim that the overall level of capital expenditure is higher than it was in the five-year period to 2009 is an example of how statistics can be used to prove anything.  We all know the level of capital expenditure is down, even if it is higher as a proportion of GNP.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The level of GNP is down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Everything is down.  The level of local government funding is relevant to the Bill because it deals with the funding provided for all Departments.  For whatever reason, this issue was kicked to touch in the budget, other than reducing the overall grant allocation to local authorities.  It is, however, a significant issue because we have a centralised system of local government, but we now have an opportunity to reimagine how we provide public services from top to bottom.  Much of what is done centrally is managed at local level in most other European countries.  Local authorities are being starved of funding.  I recognise the political angle in terms of giving Fianna F&aacute;il candidates in next year&rsquo;s general election an opportunity to claim local authorities led by Fine Gael and the Labour Party pushed up rates.  They will have no option but to increase them because their funding from the Exchequer is being dramatically reduced.  Most local authorities have already removed all of their temporary and part-time staff and are down to the bare bones.  We are left with the structures put in place by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in which top level managers are paid large salaries and bonuses, irrespective of whether they deserve them.</P><Col N="688"/>
     <P>The delivery of the services &mdash; the functions local authorities perform &mdash; has deteriorated in recent years.</P>
        <P>It was interesting that the Minister and the Government decided not to make any pronouncements on water rates.  I have long held the view &mdash; the Minister probably holds the same view &mdash; that water is expensive to provide.  People should pay for the use of a service which is delivered into their homes.  Most people are of that opinion but the Government decided not to touch it.</P>
        <P>The Government has indirectly approached the issue of property tax.  That is another thorny subject which will have to be dealt with in the new year.  Property tax and water charges will be the basis for the funding of local government in future.</P>
        <P>We must take a radical look at how local government operates.  We do not need as many town councils performing and duplicating functions.  Many people argue about the county council and the city council structure.  Does it need to be streamlined?  One local authority in each county area is enough.  Whether one breaches county boundaries is a contentious issue, not least in County Kilkenny where county boundaries are very strong.  We will have to examine that issue in more detail in the new year.  I would be interested to know if the Minister has some views on how we will fund and reform local government in the future.</P>
        <P>I will not support the Appropriation Bill in view of the fact we disagree with most of what the Minister has put forward which has culminated in this Bill.  It would be very hypocritical of Fine Gael to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Appropriation Bill.  The Minister has achieved the balance needed.  With all the evidence provided to us, we can see we have turned the corner.  We have expended less than we suggested at the beginning of the year.  Our income is higher than we expected but, more important, the CSO figures indicate there was growth in the economy in the third quarter of this year.  The reason for that growth is exports.</P>
        <P>I mention those of us who gave voice to the view that our situation was unique and different from that in Greece, Italy, Spain or Portugal and that Ireland was the most globalised economy in the world, bar the Hong Kong special administrative region or Singapore.  In the bad times, we were like a cork on the ocean.  Now that world economies are expected to grow by 4.5% this year and 4.5% in 2011, we are beginning to see a turnaround as this economy has placed itself at the forefront in the world.</P>
        <P>We took significant sums out of the economy in the past two years &mdash; &euro;15 billion &mdash; and we will take a further &euro;6 billion out next year, but we are still looking at growth of 1.7% next year.  It shows that the policies of this Government and previous Governments to preserve and protect our 12.5% corporation tax rate have been essential, as has an outward looking policy of looking for foreign direct investment and sending people to the European and Far Eastern markets to bring business to our shores.  They have done that very successfully and the Minister alluded to all the companies setting up in Ireland.  We are at the forefront again.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister continue research and development expenditure?  There are areas in which we could again specialise, including biotechnology and stem cell research.  I point out to the Minister that adult stem cells are beginning to bring the only advances in this area.  Ireland has another unique opportunity in this regard.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14.7- ?><P>Israel spends large sums of money on research and development and its economy has increased significantly.  Large numbers of people have gone to Israel in recent years and the population has risen from 5 million to 7 million in a very short space of time.</P><Col N="689"/>
        <P>It looks as if we have finally achieved what we set out to do.  It looks as if 2011 will be a very good year for Ireland.  It will be a good year because we can see we have turned that corner the Minister promised we would turn.</P>
        <P>The fact there are intercity motorways is very welcome and 2010 should see the finalisation of that project.  We are all dressed up and ready to go.  There are other areas in which we need investment and in which we can bring forward policies which will assist us in the future, including access to broadband.  There is a plan to include all remaining areas because that will be essential in the future.</P>
        <P>Looking at the budgetary packages for the coming year, one of the best items the Minister introduced was the reduction in stamp duty on houses.  Given our high dependence on the housing market in the past, it did not make sense to charge 6% stamp duty when a low rate or no rate would have given a floor to that market and the necessary security, which the Minister achieved in the budget.</P>
        <P>It was undoubtedly a fair budget, which is what the Minister set out to achieve.  The appropriations for next year will bear that out.  We hope we will continue to see less expenditure and extra value for the expenditure the Government makes.  We have achieved great savings.  The construction industry is competing with lower tenders, of which it is well capable, and we have achieved great results.  During the good years, we achieved a very high standard of housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Whether we are prepared to recognise it, despite having 400,000 unemployed, there are 1.8 million people at work.  Despite the fact we took &euro;8 from certain social welfare payments, ours are among the highest social welfare payments in Europe.  We started from an exceptionally high base.  Money needed to be taken out of the economy and people gave a bit according to the amount they could afford.  That was an important achievement the Minister managed in the budget.  I support the Appropriation Bill 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I listened to his speech in my office.  If I closed my eyes, I could picture him giving the same speech in any part of the world.  He is oblivious to the fact the budget, of which this is almost the culmination, was unfair.</P>
        <P>It is important for us to have a national debate on the political system.  The level of frustration and anger among the people at the political class is extraordinary.  We are fortunate we have not had an overwhelming level of social unrest.  It is important we understand what people are saying to us.  The people are not always right, because they are volatile in terms of what they want and do not want, but there is one common theme in what they are looking for and that is smaller, cheaper and better government.</P>
        
      
        <P Just="Left">I do not subscribe to the notion that the country is banjaxed.  It may be broken and in need of repair. That means a change of people in charge of the country with a new government coming in offering a new sense of hope.  What upsets me most is that the Government has divided public versus private and poor versus rich, which is wrong.  It has polarised society and allowed for a new movement of the extreme left, which needs to be put up for scrutiny in what it is offering to the people.  Whatever else about Fine Gael, we have put forward policies which, while different from the Government&rsquo;s, are fair and will get Ireland back to work.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the gateway innovation fund and the national spatial strategy.  Cork has its docklands project which has been in gestation for a long time.  The strategy report of the docklands committee has never been published and I wonder why the Minister, Deputy Gormley did not do so.  He mentioned tourism in his remarks and the city of Cork is the major city in the south.  The gateway innovation fund needs to be reviewed in the context of the <Col N="690"/>prioritisation of the Cork docklands project.  A number of weeks ago we met the Cork city manager who spoke about the importance of the docklands.  Before it leaves office, the Government should prioritise the immediate steps necessary to grant aid that project without having to hand over the seed capital immediately.  Cork City Council has all its ducks in a row and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has given permission for building the two bridges which would open up the Cork docklands.  Despite the recession and the economic difficulties we are experiencing, there are developers willing to embark upon a journey with Cork City Council and the Government in this project.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The two swing bridges at Tivoli and Water Street are fundamental to the project proceeding.  It needs commitment and support from Government to ensure this public infrastructure work will get started and completed.  I understand that &euro;100 million or &euro;120 million is a major commitment and I am not expecting that.  The green light should be given to the Cork City Council, however, and to the developers who are willing to embark on this, which would indicate the national spatial strategy and gateway innovation fund are still central to our development.  It is important the Minister for Finance would assist this project.  Already this week in Cork we had the announcement of the plans for Beamish and Crawford, which as the Minister knows closed down, but we have a very ambitious plan to develop this quarter of Cork city.  I heard Senator Hanafin speak about the unemployment figures.  While we may have 1.8 million in work, let us consider the number of people out of work and the number who have emigrated.  I am asking that the docklands area in Cork, which is strategic and attractive, should receive Government commitment and the Government should show a willingness to journey with the people in Cork.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.8- ?><P>The Minister is right in what he said about tourism and I am glad he went some of the way in reversing the daft air travel tax the Government introduced in a previous budget.  Tourism is very important and can create thousands of jobs.  A proposal has been submitted for a convention centre in the city of Cork, which I believe is necessary.  If the Minister has not been to Cork city, I invite him to visit the English Market and look at the wonderful array of foods and produce there, which can be used to fly the flag for Cork across the world.  The Government should consider supporting it through its tourism incentives.</P>
        <P>It is imperative for us to grapple with the issue of reform of the public sector as proposed by Fine Gael.  I reassure public sector workers that there is nothing they should fear in the Fine Gael proposals.  We want to have a public sector that is fit for purpose and has pride in its committed workers.  Morale in the public sector is at an all-time low.  They come to work every day and get pummelled by social commentators and by Members of these Houses.  I was interested in the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on social partnership and if I heard it correctly he was questioning social partnership and some of the decisions taken therein.  One of the biggest mistakes we made in social partnership was removing the Houses of the Oireachtas as a pillar of it.  There was no accountability or engagement with the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>We need to reform the political class.  I do not believe for a second that abolition of the Seanad and getting rid of State cars will solve our nation&rsquo;s problems, but it will send out a message of leadership.  The budget should have proposed abolishing some of the State bodies and quangos we do not need, but the Minister did not do so, which surprised me.  Equally the Government did not go far enough regarding F&Aacute;S.  Yesterday I stated that the people operating at the front line in F&Aacute;S have unfairly got a very bad press.  As with the banks, those at the top tier of management lost the run of themselves and, unfortunately, the main body of workers were demonised as well.</P><Col N="691"/>
        <P>Some 16 years ago today, John Bruton was in his second day as Taoiseach and it is now time for Government to come back to being transparent and open with its citizens.  We need to restore the link between us and the people which has been badly damaged.  The legacy of Deputy Bertie Ahern has ruined a generation of lives.  It behoves all of us to tell the people that politics is a noble profession and that we are concerned about the people and work for them, which is something the Government has not done.  I am amused when I hear members of the Cabinet claim they have acted in the national interest for the past two years.  Why did they not do it all the time?  What have they been doing for the past 13 years?  They had a slush fund they spent on an orgy of getting votes and staying in power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister made a very positive speech on the Appropriation Bill 2010.  In a radio interview last Sunday I explained that the economy is a live unit comprising people who are naturally energetic who want to keep producing, get on and find an income for themselves.  Senator Buttimer was using emotional words about the state of the economy, which is very negative.  As the Minister said in his speech, it is very important the message is clear that Ireland remains open for business and is still the destination of choice for many of the world&rsquo;s leading firms.  It seems to be going over the head of Senator Buttimer, who is now in the Chair, that Ireland is still in business and is very attractive to multinational investors and that the economy is a dynamic unit.  I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation the other evening where there were positive presentations by Mr. Frank Ryan, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, and Mr. Barry O&rsquo;Leary, chief executive of IDA Ireland.  IDA Ireland will launch its view of last year in approximately two weeks, which will be very interesting.  The Minister referred to the road infrastructure, and if a person who is interested in investing in Ireland comes for a meeting here with IDA Ireland and sees all of that magnificent road infrastructure, he or she will think it is wonderful.  It now is uplifting to drive from Dublin to Cork in less than three hours, or to anywhere in the country.  It gives a straightforward signal that this is a fabulous country with good infrastructure and an inter-city network.  The country has achieved this over the past number of years.  It is a great achievement that we have this mega-road system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We spent the money well.  There were slip-ups.  Not everything was perfect.  My party has admitted that there were mistakes made.  I listened last night to Dr. Michael Somers, who was here at the Lemass group meeting last night, who stated that the challenge is to get the money that has left the banks to come back into the country, to get the money of the large investors and the smaller investors back in and to develop and create employment to stop the outward flow of young people.  I have no issue with young people going abroad.  Many Irish people who have emigrated have risen to the top of their companies in the United States, Australia and the UK.  They create a tremendous reputation for Ireland.  People are so impressed that persons of such calibre running these large world companies are from Ireland.  Within their number are those who have no desire to be adventurous and to leave, and who want to stay here, and it is to create employment for them.  I have stated here regularly that Lir Chocolates employes 250 in Navan and it is 75% export driven.  The companies which are exporting and are innovating non-stop are surviving and doing well.  It is harder on the companies that do not export because demand is so low.  If they are relying on the indigenous market, it is difficult for them.  We must try to get people to spend more money and to keep employment in the indigenous businesses that have not yet got to the stage of exporting.</P>
        <P>I am very optimistic about Ireland.  By nature, thanks be to God, I am an optimistic person.  There are challenges facing us but there are tremendous opportunities.  An important point is <Col N="692"/>that we need to court the international media more.  There has been excessive prudence about entertaining journalists and the staff of credit rating agencies.  Dr. Somers made the point that when he was in the National Treasury Management Agency, they were constantly going to America, talking to these guys, bringing them to Ireland and spending time with them.  I made the point that we must keep that up.  It is probably not politically correct now to be hosting people and humouring them, but we need more of that such as bringing them to Ireland so that they may see how we are getting on and how we have got our act together.  It is obvious &mdash; the figures speak for themselves &mdash; that we are stabilising the economy and unemployment is coming down, but we need more comfort meetings with those who are influential around the world.</P>

	<P>On the Appropriation Bill please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an interesting time of year, politically and generally.  When we speak on the Appropriation Bill, we wander freely and easily across a broad range of Government policy and philosophy.  This year, in particular, the Appropriation Bill gives great scope for reflection, consideration and, I suppose, some degree of suggestion.</P>
        <P>I was interested in what the previous speaker stated about marketing Ireland.  It is important that Ireland strives to present a positive, vibrant, modern image abroad, particularly from the point of view of inward investment.  With that in mind, I remind the Minister of a suggestion &mdash; this possibly has nothing to do with the Bill but that is the sort of flexibility we are allowed in the Seanad &mdash; made on many occasions by one of my former colleagues in the House, former Deputy Austin Deasy, who asked that the Government consider the limited appointment of a number of former politicians to ambassadorial roles.  The argument being presented by former Deputy Deasy was that notwithstanding the supreme level of personnel available in the Department of Foreign Affairs, it could be useful for the selling of Ireland abroad and the presentation of a strong and vibrant image of Ireland abroad that former political personnel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>For God&rsquo;s sake, allow a little flexibility.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="693"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly persons who had senior political experience, be available for appointment to ambassadorial roles.  It is something we should consider.  In the efforts we all will make to try to rebuild this country, we certainly need to look at new ideas and new solutions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the Appropriation Bill, it is fair to say that the practice of politics and economics in this country in recent times has been of a see-saw nature, by which I mean that we go from periods of great spending to periods of great adjustment on the other end.  There were a number of Appropriation Bills in the past decade where the only issues we were debating were how much money was being spent.  We did not even ask how it was being spent or if it was being well spent, but merely concentrated on what it was being spent.  We have now gone to the other extreme where we are talking about how much money is being saved.  We need a debate, both from a spending perspective and a savings perspective, on what I call the how and the why.  It is not merely a question of saving money and trying to reduce public expenditure.  We must try to ensure it is done in a way that is least damaging to society and the economy.</P>
        <P>I welcome what the Minister stated on matters such as tourism, which was referred to by Senator Buttimer.  It is one of the sectors where there is enormous scope for growth and improvement.  I hope even the modest decision made in the budget to reduce the travel tax will be of some degree of help.  Much pressure was put on the Department and on all of us by the airline industry and the tourism sector in general to have this travel tax reduced or fully waived, and indications were given that if the Minister acceded to that request, it would result in significant tourist numbers coming to this country.  At least, that is something which we<?oasys _jy ?>will be able to judge and, hopefully, the tourism industry will respond to the budgetary initiative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Education, another area to which the Minister referred, is one of the significant Government expenditure programmes.  One of the issues which arises regularly in this House on Adjournment debates is school building programmes, prefabricated accommodation etc.  The Government must be a little more flexible in how we spend the funding, and on cause and effect.  Right across the country on an annual basis tens of millions of euro, which is taxpayers&rsquo; money, not Government money, is being spent on prefabricated accommodation and the rules and regulations governing school building, and the various stages involved in even sanctioning the most basic project, are so complex and so regulated and administratively difficult that projects which could be built at a relatively reasonable cost are being delayed and deferred.  Rented accommodation is being used and when the project finally comes for delivery and for building, the cost has shot up enormously.  That is a small item in which administrative blockages cost the taxpayer money and social cohesion because of inadequate schooling facilities.  I know the issue has been brought to the attention of the Minister and the Minister for Education and Skills dozens of times.  It should be possible to resolve it and, in the new environment where we will be more careful of the money we spend, it is something we must consider.</P>
        <P>The Appropriation Bill gives us the opportunity to pose questions about public expenditure.  There was a time before the Minister&rsquo;s arrival in the Houses when there was a joint committee dealing with public expenditure which did some very valuable work.  Notwithstanding the plethora of committees we have, it disappeared despite working with the Committee of Public Accounts.  We should reconsider its operation because the era has long gone when money could be treated like confetti.  Even if money at the level of the Celtic tiger is ever available again, we must ensure it is spent in a more constructive and longer lasting fashion.  Some type of <Col N="694"/>public expenditure committee or watchdog in the House, led by politicians, would be helpful in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer referred to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on social partnership.  It was a creature of the late 1980s, having been conceived in 1987.  Some 23 years later we are in a very different place which requires new responses.  There should always be an opportunity for social partners, in the broadest sense, to have a voice to be listened to in order to freely make known their views.  If we have learned anything from recent political and economic crises, it is that politicians are the people who must make decisions.  Those who are hired and can be fired by the public are best placed to make the required tough decisions.  Politicians should take the lead in this respect and although there must be a role for social dialogue, the decision making should be politically led.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House.  I know he had a long and difficult year and I know he is probably looking forward to a good Christmas break, so I will not detain him too long.  I reiterate Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s and Senator Bradford&rsquo;s comments on the travel tax.  We can achieve growth in the tourism industry and I come from a county which is strong in the sector.  There is great potential in this through activities like golf, deep sea and lake fishing and mountaineering or climbing, and we could achieve growth in the coming years.  The issue is all about such growth because if the economy grows, it would mean a cut of less than &euro;15 billion in the next few years.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister is present because I also have tabled an Adjournment matter for the next issue as well.  There is much potential in the Irish co-operative movement and the work of the National Dairy Council and Irish Dairy Board.  We can achieve growth in exports with new products, etc.  The Irish Dairy Board is seeking a change in its financial year which will make no difference to the Exchequer.  There is an obligation that the accounts be done between 1 September and 31 January and a change is sought of a number of months either side of that period.  I hope the Minister will consider that favourably in the upcoming finance Bill in January as it would greatly help the dairy board and societies.  They could proceed along with the agricultural cycle rather than within the period specified under existing legislation.  The Minister might consider this in the short term and include a provision in January&rsquo;s finance<?oasys _jy ?>Bill.</P>
        <P>There is great potential in co-operatives because they want to invest much more money in research and development.  They also want to target specific products, with a focus on export-led growth.  This would be of major benefit to the economy.  I will leave it at that and hope the Minister will consider this favourably in the finance Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senators for their contributions.  It has always been a custom of the Seanad to have a debate on the Appropriation Bill but there is not always a debate in the other House.  As it gives an opportunity to discuss general economic questions relating to this country, it is a very valuable opportunity.  Senator Phelan was concerned about the forecast made by the Department relating to GDP next year, but the forecast of 1.7% of GDP growth is in line with the latest private sector consensus forecast or the so-called Reuter&rsquo;s basket.</P>
        <P>In what was a very interesting speech Senator Phelan discussed the question of the OECD and education standards.  In the plan for national recovery the Government went to great lengths to preserve educational provision and expenditure as much as possible.  There has been <Col N="695"/>a significant return to education throughout this economic crisis and it is clear the up-skilling of individuals who find themselves out of work during this period of temporary recession is very valuable and of great long-term benefit to the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator is correct in focusing on the issue of standards, as well as financial provision.  Too much of the education debate is focused on financial provision and appropriate class sizes or provision at third level of investment programmes.  The core issue in our education system is the quality of the graduate from the school or institution concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">One of the most interesting ways of discussing Ireland abroad and explaining our position is to point out the proportion of our workforce with third level qualifications, which is the second highest in the European Union after Sweden.  Such qualifications only have value if the standard of the qualification is up to the mark.  That is a fundamental issue that will be very important for this and the next Government.  The OECD education report was very disturbing and while one can argue about methodologies in the schools chosen, the fact remains it is a warning sign that we should heed.</P>
        <P>Senator Phelan mentioned tourist infrastructure and this comment was echoed by most speakers.  Attention was also drawn by many speakers to the question of the travel tax.  There was a very substantial reduction in this to &euro;3, although there are some who argue it should be abolished.  This is a tax base that is being resorted to by an increasing number of European governments.  What is important for us is to position ourselves as a peripheral European state at the lower end of the tax rate, which we have done in the budget.  In addition, the Dublin Airport Authority has made an offer in respect of Shannon, Cork and Dublin that if passenger levels exceed certain amounts, there will be free landing charges.  These combined measures create the incentive for those who wish to carry passengers into the country to expand their numbers.</P>
        <P>Senator Phelan also raised an issue close to my own heart in the funding of local government.  This is an issue on which the outgoing government made quite a bit of progress.  The introduction of the second home tax was a very important initiative in broadening the revenue base of local government, and the tax was introduced and made a receipt of local government without any corresponding reduction in the local government fund.  Whereas there were no specific announcements on local government funding in this year&rsquo;s budget, the four year plan for national recovery sets out a very clear path on how to fund local government in future.  The introduction of the site value tax as a residential charge which will be paid to local government is a fundamental step in that regard.  The basic level of household charge will be set at &euro;100 under the plan.  An increase can then be built in based on the higher valuations of higher value properties.  These measures are targeted to raise approximately &euro;500 million under the plan during the four year period.</P>
        <P>This is a realistic way of proceeding in relation to local government.  It links the local household which receives such benefits from local government with the provision or contribution of revenue.  It also has the advantage of ensuring responsibility is imposed on every householder.  It is for this reason that a minimum level of charge is imposed on every household.  The charge is equitable in that it can be scaled up for wealthier households to achieve the necessary revenue base.  All that is required to introduce the tax is an amendment to the existing legislation dealing with second homes.  This is a credible and realistic way of making a good start on local government finance.</P><Col N="696"/>
        <P>Other areas have to be addressed, of which one is the apportionment of the local government roads fund between transport and local government.  If the Opposition parties are formulating a credible plan for local government financial reform for the general election in the early to middle part of next year, they should focus on this important issue.  The measure included in the four year plan for national recovery is credible in this regard.  The charge is not pitched at such a level that owners of property believe they will be mugged for vast sums of money in property tax.  This measure creates a highly credible funding base.  It is extraordinary that such a small charge can raise a dramatic amount of funding and lessen the dependence of local government on the Exchequer.  It is vital that we proceed with these measures.</P>
        <P>Senator Phelan raised the issue of town, city and county councils.  I concur with him<?oasys _jy ?>that there is substantial scope for rationalisation in this regard and the matter should be pursued.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin spoke about the property market, specifically changes in stamp duty.  This aspect of the budget which has not been much commented on is of fundamental importance to future reform of the property market.  Most countries that have experienced dramatic residential property bubbles similar to that in Ireland have not had a transparent pricing mechanism in place for house valuations.  This was the case in Ireland.  We know that the value of most private residences here turns on a matter of auctioneering and estate agency reputation.  If, as has been secured since budget day, one&rsquo;s stamp duty base is universal and set at a low rate of 1%, stamp duty no longer operates as a distortion in the markets and facilitates the giving of information.  One of the crucial elements of the Finance Bill will be the enabling powers to allow regulations to be adopted to publicise information on stamp duty collections in order that we will know the valuations of different house types throughout the country on an objective basis.  This will be a substantial change in how the residential property market functions.  The element of transparency is very important.</P>
        <P>The fact that first-time buyers must pay stamp duty as a result of the budget was criticised.  Stamp duty is charged at a rate of 1%.  In the current market &mdash; very much a buyer&rsquo;s market &mdash; the seller will in all probability pocket the loss through the imposition of this taxation.  Stamp duty changes in the budget effect fundamental reform in the property market.  I was delighted to hear Senator Hanafin comment on this matter.</P>
        <P>The Senator also highlighted the importance of research and development.  Under the plan for national recovery, the budgets in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation for science, research and attracting industry are carefully safeguarded.  This was an important issue in the formulation of the plan.  In the current fiscal circumstances it is difficult to ring-fence any item of expenditure.  We must, however, ring-fence the expenditures that keep open the jobs pipeline and ensure we will have sustainable job creation in the years ahead.  This will lay the foundations for full economic recovery.  The Senator stated we were a cork on a world ocean.  I have certainly had plenty of such experience.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer referred to the fairness of the budget.  It is too late on an evening approaching Christmas to open that subject.  However, if one examines the four budgets I have had the obligation to introduce, the balance of the adjustment has been heaviest on those who have the highest incomes and lowest on those who have the lowest.  What is regrettable is that those on lower incomes can no longer be exempted.  Everyone must make some contribution.  This has been a difficulty in the budgets in recent years.  Political parties which do not face up to this reality will not be able to provide an effective Government in the years ahead because the <Col N="697"/>&euro;19 billion gap between expenditure and receipts remains.  Not one cent of this sum has anything to do with the banking sector.  Irrespective of which  political party finds itself in government, it will have to address the question of how one closes this gap.  When one tries to do so, one discovers very quickly that the main drivers of public expenditure are salaries, welfare payments, transfer payments and agricultural subsidies.  These items account for the great bulk of expenditure.</P>
        <P>It is easy for an Opposition &mdash; I am not making a partisan point &mdash; to talk about administrative efficiencies and public sector reform.  When one translates this into practical fiscal reform, public sector reform means one does not pay doctors &euro;64,000 per annum for having 100 elderly patients on their medical card list and that one assesses class sizes to ascertain whether one is obtaining value for money.  While public sector reform is a mantra that has entered debate, I sense a reluctance in the political system to translate this mantra into the reality of what it represents.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer also discussed the political system.  There has been very little social unrest and people have shown an extraordinary degree of patience, courtesy, restraint and common feeling in addressing the effects of the recession.   The Senator noted that we needed a smaller, cheaper and better Government service.  These objectives are not always consistent with each other.  One feature of the current public debate that I deplore is the constant harking towards an imaginary state, people or republic.  This is a republic for which many generations made deep sacrifices to secure.  Ireland is a republic with representative institutions.  Representative democracy is the foundation of our democracy.  It is the foundation of the debates in this and the other House and the authority of the Government deriving from the other House.  Representative democracy is important.  This particular plant did not grow automatically on Irish soil.  It took generations of Irish Nationalist politicians who for many years had to sit in an imperial parliament in Westminster and later participated in the Free State and republic.  I believe a denigration of representative democracy is in progress when I hear panellists on programmes state they would not contest a D&aacute;il election but believe the country should be ruled by citizen assemblies.  These Houses are the representative institutions of the State and if we have failings, let us reform them.  Members have taken substantial pay adjustments in recent years.  The take home pay of the Taoiseach is less than &euro;100,000 per annum.  Few top executives in any company are on this kind of take home pay figure.  I know the Taoiseach does not resent this.  We have to protect representative democracy and respect it as a system.  If changes are needed in the composition of the Seanad, the size of the D&aacute;il or the accountability of Ministers, let us consider them.  Let us examine how we can bring better people into public life.  Let us ascertain how we can attract &mdash; I do not like the word &ldquo;incentivise&rdquo; &mdash; the best and the most talented, idealistic and patriotic into public life.  We should devote ourselves to this task when we consider the subject of political reform because reform that simply reduces the political class to a collection of road sweepers will not work.</P>
        <P>In regard to the gateway innovation fund, Senator Buttimer made an even more eloquent contribution.  I introduced a tax relief on this subject some years ago and I am aware of the swing bridges needed in Cork.  This is an issue that can be developed.</P>
        <P>The Senator also referred to social partnership, about which I wish to say a few things.  I am very much in favour of a public service wage agreement, which is what we have.  It is only common sense for an employer to have such an agreement with his or her employees.  In regard to social partnership, the expert group which looked at the Department of Finance made the point that although the process in itself was not wrong both social partnership and programmes <Col N="698"/>for Government negotiated by parties after elections involved entering unsustainable financial promises, took the focus from the need for proper financial discipline and focused instead on a system of delivering results which became detached from fiscal realities.  It is an important point and a lesson we have had to learn the hard way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I admire the confidence of Senator Mary M. White and thank her for her kind wishes to me.  Her main point was the importance of marketing Ireland abroad.  I discussed this with the NTMA which has stepped up its media presence around the world.  The current director general has been most insistent on that.  I do not know about the entertainment budget but it has stepped up its involvement with foreign media.  A consistent report one receives from the foreign media is that most bad news about Ireland comes out of the country from the Irish media.  This is copied abroad and does not originate in the foreign media as we are inclined to think, being a small country.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford spoke about marketing Ireland abroad and suggested that former politicians be appointed to ambassadorial roles.  Given the current state of opinion polls that suggestion should come from this side of the House.  I have no ambition to be an ambassador and wish to reassure my constituents in that regard.  The Department of Foreign Affairs provides a very competent service and represents the country well abroad but it is important that we evaluate its work in the current situation.  The focus of Irish diplomacy was very much on political objectives in the better years.  Economic and commercial objectives should predominate in whatever arrangements we may have.</P>
        <P>I believe all parties should perform a stronger role on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  I tire of the endless abuse concerning the annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visits.  It is a very important opportunity to sell Ireland and there is a case for having an all-party approach to that issue.</P>
        <P>In regard to educational expenditure and school building projects which were referred to by Senator Bradford, we have always insisted on value for money.  Some schools built in recent years were built to a fantastic design and quality which must be commended.</P>
        <P>Concerning public expenditure control, Senator Bradford mentioned there had been a joint Oireachtas committee on public expenditure.  He referred also to social partnership.  The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service examined this issue recently and produced a report, elements of which are in the plan for national recovery.  In the area of public expenditure it is very important to focus the debate on what can be secured with the expenditure we have at our disposal and that we do not assume automatically that expenditure should take place.  Under the plan, from next year Ministers will have to observe cash ceilings in their expenditure which will have very dramatic results.  It will mean, for example, that if any Minister does not have enough cash he or she will not be able to pay a certain line of grant assistance.  In order to implement that the Department will be forced to make an accurate forecast of its likely expenditure on the grant in the coming year.  It may have to reduce in overall terms the amount of any particular grant available as a result.  That measure is in the four year plan.  It is real public sector reform because it forces those who manage Departments and accounting bodies to manage within their budgets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to contribute to this very important Adjournment debate.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the nature of the Minister of State&rsquo;s departmental responsibility.  It is important that the construction of a new primary school in Ballygarvan be expedited.  The area has been waiting for a new school since the late 1990s.  There are many more than 300 pupils in the existing school which operates under very difficult physical conditions.  It is due to the perseverance and patience of the teachers, the principal, staff, parents and the board of management that the school has managed to survive this far in such substandard conditions.  We have been through this process for a long time in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and landowners in the diocese of Cork and Ross.  I want the Minister of State to commit to ensuring Ballygarvan national school will be a priority in the Estimates for 2011.</P>
        <P>The fact that funding for 2010 was &euro;579 million and funding for next year is &euro;492 million is a worry for the people of Ballygarvan.  Political will is required if the new school is to be built.  I hope guarantees can be given in this regard in this debate in the House.</P>
        <P>I understand issues arose in respect of the previous contractor.  The parents and board of management of the school have been very proactive in the process.  I seek a commitment to allow the project to go to tender in order that the pupils, staff and principal of the school will have a new school at some time in 2011.  It is important there be a commitment in this debate to going to tender and proceeding to construction.</P>
        <P>The community has shown the importance of and need for community.  It has worked very hard to ensure the project has reached its current level.  We must now proceed to the next step.  It would be deeply disappointing for all concerned if the project were delayed further.  I ask the Department to make the school a priority despite the 33% reduction in the budget allocation for next year.  There is an onus on us to protect the students and teachers at the school who cannot continue to work in and be taught in prefabs and old buildings.  These buildings are impinging on the play area of the school.  The Minister of State, who is responsible for children, knows the importance of looking after the physical well-being of students in addition to their educational needs.</P>
        <P>While we face economic challenges, it is important we commit to building a new school for the population of Ballygarvan.  A delay will be unacceptable.  It is now opportune to facilitate the smooth progression to the next stage, which involves a commitment to build a new school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the budget details for capital investment in education projects and to provide an update on the current position on Ballygarvan national school in particular.</P>
        <P>In 2011, the Government&rsquo;s overall capital allocation will be &euro;4.654 billion or 3.6% of GNP.  The Department&rsquo;s allocation from this programme is &euro;491 million, of which &euro;383 million will be available for the schools building programme.  This provision reflects the reduced allocation for such expenditure overall.  I am confident, however, that the funding available will allow for demographic needs to be met and will provide for continued improvement to the stock of educational capital, especially given falling land values and tender prices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to Ballygarvan national school, the need to provide for additional school places has already been determined and consequently the proposed project for the construction of a new 16-classroom school was one of 25 projects announced to commence architectural planning <Col N="701"/>in February 2009.  Following the announcement of the project to enter into architectural planning in February 2009, detailed designs were prepared, planning permission lodged and a tender competition held. Unfortunately, delays in securing planning permission and the acquisition by the patron of the two parcels of land required for the proposed new school building impacted on the scheduled delivery of the project.  The completion of the land transfers in September by the patron enabled the Department to enter into discussions with the preferred bidder.  Unfortunately, issues subsequently arose with the preferred bidder that resulted in a decision to re-tender the project.  The project was put out to tender again on 1 December and the new tenders are due back before Christmas.</P>
        
        <P>I confirm that the project will remain on the Department&rsquo;s rapid delivery programme, which should ensure the fastest possible delivery of this project.  Subject to no further issues arising, it is envisaged the project will progress to construction in early 2011 with a construction period of approximately 26 weeks.  Departmental officials are in contact with the school authorities who have been fully apprised of the progress on the project.  The Department will continue to liaise with the patron and the school authorities regarding the proposed project.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position on the school building project for Ballygarvan national school.</P>

    <Title>Proposed Legislation</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  The matter I wish to raise is very important.  I have raised it with the Minister for Finance who has just left the House.  He said he would look very favourably upon including some of my proposals in the finance Bill in January, if possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State may not be aware that the Food Harvest 2020 report was published recently.  It raises many interesting points that could be debated fruitfully in this House on another occasion.  It considers piloting new products, new product streams, targeting new markets, resources for new markets, market research and the Brand Ireland concept.  It also considers the smart economy, the smart research and development commitment and the commitment to partnership.</P>
        <P>The co-operative movement, headed by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, is seeking the Government&rsquo;s view on where it envisages infrastructure being put in place and funding being made available.  It is curious about the markets that could be opened up to it.  As the Minister of State knows quite well, the movement has served this country very well over the years.  Some co-operatives have become plcs but many still remain.  The way forward is to help the co-operatives on the ground such that they will lead the way in developing new products and markets if given the right assistance and if funding is targeted appropriately.</P>
        <P>There are two aspects to this topic.  The first is a proposal that would substantially help the Irish Dairy Board, the main purchaser of Irish dairy products.  It manages a highly seasonal and volatile product.  It is important its financial year match the season and the profile of the business.  To comply with the law set down for co-operatives, the board&rsquo;s year end must fall between 1 September and 31 January.  While this has not caused many problems up to now, the board would prefer to follow the agricultural cycle.  It needs such a financial year end because its accounting year fell within the quiet part of the financial year.  What it desires would <Col N="702"/>allow it to have a smaller inventory and it would make stocktaking easier.  It has many advantages and would be of no disadvantage to the Exchequer.  I raised this matter with the Minister for Finance and believe he could include a provision in that respect in the finance Bill in January 2011.  It would be of major benefit to the Irish Dairy Board.</P>
        <P>With regard to research and development, the promotion and piloting of new products and the targeting of new markets, progress could be farther down the road but it is very important to know the Government&rsquo;s thinking thereon.  The Irish Dairy Board could well set up a research and development facility.  Funding could be put in place and the board could work with some universities, significantly benefiting the country and the development of new products.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  The co-operative movement has made a huge contribution to economic and social development in Ireland over many years, not just in the agrifood sector but also in housing, rural services and community development.  The combined turnover of Irish co-operatives is estimated to amount to some &euro;12 billion annually and the sector is also a source of significant exports and employment.</P>
        <P>Most co-operatives in Ireland, especially those that undertake economic or business activities, register as industrial and provident societies under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 1978.  The principal Act is the 1893 Act.  These Acts have been the subject of periodic review since 1922 to address problems such as those relating to borrowing powers for agricultural co-operatives, the need for changes in share capital limits and the need for controls on deposit-taking activities.  The system as a whole, however, has not been subject to any comprehensive overhaul since 1893.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">In April 2009, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation published a consultation paper on the Acts.  It made clear that the immediate focus of the consultation was to identify any practical difficulties in the Acts as they stand.  Essentially, the purpose of the consultation and of the initial stage of the overall review was to identify and deal with practical problems being experienced by societies in respect of the current legislation.  The responses to the questions posed in the consultation paper, received from some 30 interested parties, have demonstrated that there is a sufficient number of such problems to justify the promotion of amending legislation.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>In addition to the responses received on the April 2009 consultation paper, representations were received from the Irish Dairy Board and the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society in July 2010 requesting a specific amendment to section 14 of the 1893 Act to provide greater freedom to societies to determine their financial year end.  In response, the Minister indicated that he agreed that societies should have greater freedom to determine their financial year end than is provided for under the current legislation.</P>
        <P>A general scheme of a Bill has been prepared in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the following regulatory improvements for industrial and provident societies.  It will ease certain financial reporting requirements, extend the company law mechanism of examinership to societies, abolish the statutory limit on individual shareholdings in societies, abolish triennial return of shares and loans and make it easier for cancelled societies to be restored to the register.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The industrial and provident societies and friendly societies (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is included in the Government legislative programme.  The Minister hopes to be in a position to obtain the necessary approval of the government for the general scheme of the Bill shortly.  It will then be a matter of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel drafting the Bill, followed <Col N="703"/>by the presentation of the Bill to the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  While every effort will be made by the Minister and his officials to expedite the legislation, it is difficult to give a definite indication of when that will happen.</P>
        <P>The agrifood industry, dairy in particular, has a vital role to play in the country&rsquo;s economic recovery.  This is identified in the Government&rsquo;s national recovery plan and is based on the potential identified in the Food Harvest 2020 report launched by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, earlier in the year.  The report sets out the strategic vision and targets for the agrifood and fishing sectors.  This vision is based on smart, green growth and will place the sector at the centre of the export-led economic recovery.  The growth targets set are exports of food and beverages by one third to &euro;12 billion annually, an increase in the value of primary production by our farmers and fishermen of &euro;1.5 billion, and an increase in the value added in processing of &euro;3 billion.</P>
        <P>The dairy sector has a pivotal role to play in delivering this growth.  The ending of milk quotas in 2015 represents an exceptional opportunity to increase our milk output, and Food Harvest 2020 has targeted a 50% increase in milk production in the next decade.  This target is ambitious but is also realistic.  However, this is not just about increasing milk production.  It is critical that all stakeholders in the sector act in a coherent way to increase efficiency and reduce costs both at farm level and at processor level.  Processors must adopt the most effective model to process the additional milk supplies, and new markets will have to be found.  There must be an increased focus on research and innovative product development to add value.</P>
        <P>The potential to increase farm level output and productivity will be realised through the increased take-up of projects such as the BETTER farm programme, the dairy efficiency programme, the one goal challenge, and the very successful animal breeding and disease reduction initiatives from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, and Animal Health Ireland.  At dairy farm level, the policy of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been to get the required volumes of milk quota into the hands of active producers, to encourage new entrants to the sector and to encourage all dairy farmers to produce with the maximum possible efficiency.</P>
        <P>Hand in hand with this opportunity for increased production is the need for development at industry level.  A coherent and structured approach from key industry players is required to achieve the necessary scale.  This will build on the progress made under the dairy investment fund.  The aim of this fund is to assist the modernisation and development of the dairy processing sector by supporting projects.  In particular, it was targeted at the efficient production of core and value added products.  A total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance of &euro;114 million which will generate an estimated capital spend of &euro;286 million.  It has been recognised for some time that the dairy processing sector must improve its international competitiveness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Smith, chairs the high level implementation group whose function is to direct and take whatever action is needed to implement Food Harvest 2020 successfully.  This group has agreed that actions are needed on production trends, product mix and processing capacity.  The Minister also established a new dairy expansion activation group.  This is being chaired by Dr. Se&aacute;n Brady and comprises dairy farmers, processors and Teagasc.  The group will shortly prepare a roadmap that outlines the specific actions to be undertaken and the key decisions that must be made.  It will also identify obstacles to implementation and how these might be overcome.  It is in all our interests to contribute constructively to this process and the Minister looks forward to significant progress being made in the coming months on the implementation of the recommendations in Food Harvest 2020.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I raise the issue of the current status and the perceived goals and aims of youth councils, specifically the youth council in Donegal which was one of the pilot zones.  I declare an interest in that I am president of the youth and sport committee of the Council of Europe.  Nationally and internationally, we spend a lot of time talking about getting young people involved in politics and getting them familiar with the democratic process.  We initiated a lot of work in the Oireachtas through outreach programmes in schools and we initiated the youth council.  The feedback and the annual reports have been very impressive.  The issues prioritised by them were spot-on from any perspective.  They have been a massive success.</P>
        <P>Other counties do not have a youth council but the youth council in Donegal is under serious threat at the moment.  Its work was suspended ten days ago because a co-ordinating post did not continue.  Some light is visible at the end of the tunnel because the co-ordinator will remain in place until March.  That is only a few months away, however, and from my perspective we need to give a clear signal if we are creating these posts.  If they are to be in existence for the long term, there should be ring-fencing of the support in order that the posts can operate at the intended level.  Brief respite has been granted in respect of this problem but I presume the official answer is that it is a matter for the county manager.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs was at the helm of youth work and youth enthusiasm in respect of politics and in respect of a range of issues connected with youth.  I am pleased, therefore, that he is responding to this matter.  The signal we give is, ultimately, the signal that will be taken back as our true intention.  If we say it is not our responsibility and is a matter for someone else, we will be abdicating our responsibility on this issue.  The youth council can be tied into a larger problem in terms of staffing, and the county manager needs to deal with this with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>In driving the great work being done and giving confidence to the young people involved who come from many parts of Donegal and work together on the national scene, and I commend the people who have been doing this work until now, I would be distraught if I thought we were not in a position to provide for the survival of the youth council in Donegal beyond March.  I hope the Minister of State can make an intervention to give effect to the long-term goal of this Government.  When this was set up, it was not to be a short-term project but would one that would last from here on out.  We need to give certainty to the youth council in Donegal and we need to expand the work being done there to ensure other youth councils coming on board are not faced with this serious instability.  The word &ldquo;suspension&rdquo; was used last week and while we believe it is back in action for a while, that is insufficient and unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will have good news for me about the expansion and development of youth councils and the maintenance of staffing levels in order that they can continue their work.  If we were to get rid of staff here in the same way as has happened in youth councils, this House would not be effective, just as a youth council is not effective when the co-ordinator does not have security of tenure.</P>

	<P>I am fully committed to the effective development of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g in all 34 city and county development board areas.  The effective development of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g is named as a Government priority in Towards 2016.  My office has the lead role under the national children&rsquo;s strategy to ensure children and young people have a voice in the design, delivery and monitoring of services and policies that affect their lives at national and local level.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na n&Oacute;g was set up under the national children&rsquo;s strategy in the 34 city and county development board areas throughout the country to give children and young people a voice in the development of local services and policies.  An independent review of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g carried out in 2005, commissioned by the then National Children&rsquo;s Office, noted that many of the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g were not engaging effectively with children and young people and were in need of significant improvement.  Based on the findings of the review, the then National Children&rsquo;s Office established the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g implementation group in June 2006 to support the operation of effective Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  The group comprised representatives of Departments, city and county development boards, local authorities, the HSE, the VECs, young people and the youth sector.</P>
        <P>In response to the recommendations made in the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g implementation group report in 2007, my office established a funding programme aimed at improving the operation of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and providing additional opportunities for young people to be involved in decision-making.  In addition, in March 2008, my office funded two national youth organisations to appoint three regional participation officers to provide training, advice and support for organisers of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  Funding has been secured for the work of the participation officer up to March 2012.</P>
        <P>Under the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g development fund, local authorities may apply for up to &euro;20,000 per annum under funding criteria that ensure meaningful participation by children and young people in decision-making at local level.  Uptake of funding has been very strong; my office&rsquo;s expenditure on Comhairle na n&Oacute;g was &euro;680,000 in 2009-10.  Funding for Comhairle na n&Oacute;g has been secured for 2011.  My office has entered into a service level agreement with Pobal which will handle administration and monitoring of the fund from January 2011.  Pobal will work in partnership with my office and the office&rsquo;s regional participation officers in managing and evaluating the fund.</P>
        <P>Since its inception in 2007, the fund has been independently evaluated.  The work of the evaluator has included getting feedback from young participants, staff in local authorities and other stakeholders and making recommendations on good practice.  The three reports on the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g development fund for 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 highlight that significant improvements in the operation of many Comhairle na n&Oacute;g have resulted from the fund and the support of my office&rsquo;s regional participation officers.</P>
        <P>The Comhairle na n&Oacute;g implementation group completed its work in 2008 and was replaced by my office&rsquo;s children and young people&rsquo;s participation partnership committee.  The National Youth Council of Ireland jointly chairs and supports the committee with my office.  The committee comprises representatives of Departments, statutory bodies, non-government organisations and young people.  It supported the development and implementation of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g development plan 2009-11 which has successfully met all targets and will be fully implemented by mid-2011.</P>
        <P>A five year strategic plan for Comhairle na n&Oacute;g will be developed as part of the new national children&rsquo;s strategy.  Work on the strategic plan has begun.</P>

	<P>I accept a lot of money is being spent, but I would like to receive a commitment from the Minister of State that he will investigate the difficulties being encountered by Donegal Youth Council because there are significant problems that are putting its future in jeopardy.  As there is feedback from participants, local authority staff and other stakeholders, the Minister of State might be able to discover the cause of the difficulty for the council and attempt to address it.</P>
