	<P>I have received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to make a statement on the proposed changes to the RAPID areas in Cork city &mdash; southside &mdash; with specific emphasis on the changes in Ballyphehane and Togher.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify when he proposes to publish the report from the national strategy group on higher education which is chaired by the economist Dr. Colin Hunt and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Arbitration Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and resume at the conclusion of No. 38, if not previously concluded; No. 2, statements on the final report on the Twenty-eight Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007, a proposal for a constitutional amendment to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights, to be taken at 3.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 5.30 p.m., on which spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons; and No. 38, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 17 on special needs assistants, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 7.30 p.m.  The business of the House shall be interrupted between 2 p.m. and 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Trust and confidence in politics are at a low ebb.  Trust in the Government and between the partners in government is also low.  It is important, therefore, that we in this House do what we can to restore trust in order that the people will have confidence in the work we do.  Tonight we will debate a motion on special needs assistants.  We <Col N="54"/>have heard many comments from Ministers that there have not been cutbacks in front-line services but people are experiencing severe cutbacks in this area.  We must discuss the issue.</P>
        <P>In terms of being relevant, many of us spoke yesterday about the need to discuss the banking crisis and job creation.  When will we have these debates?</P>
        <P>In the last two weeks &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; has highlighted the plight of women who underwent an horrific procedure known as symphysiotomy in some of our maternity hospitals, in some cases as late as the 1980s.  I welcome the decision of the Minister for Health and Children that the matter should be referred to an outside inquiry to be undertaken by the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  However, this may not be enough; an independent inquiry may be necessary.  It is critical that we learn lessons about why these procedures were carried out and the principles that determined they be undertaken because, clearly, they were not medical.  I ask the Leader to convey this view to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two other issues, the first of which is the appalling situation regarding mental health and the lack of implementation of A Vision for Change.  Will the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, come before the House to make a statement on inputs in the area of mental health?</P>

	<P>It is clear that the money which we were promised would be ring-fenced for mental health services has disappeared into the HSE&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true.  Apparently, the Minister of State is to announce a new commitment in respect of mental health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Both the Minister and the Minister of State made the same commitment in respect of financing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I request that the House engage in a debate on the Minister of State&rsquo;s new commitment in order that we might have an opportunity to discuss the relevant issues.</P>
        <P>The final issue to which I wish to refer relates to women&rsquo;s representation in political life.  It was stated that a debate on this matter would take place on 8 March, International Women&rsquo;s Day.  I ask the Leader to reply on how he expects the House to meaningfully address the issues I have raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald in congratulating the Minister for Health and Children on establishing a review of the carrying out of symphysiotomies.  The television programme on this matter was the most nauseating I have watched for a long period.  What happened to the women concerned was appalling.  I would like to know what were the values held by and instincts of those who carried out these procedures which, in many cases, were completely unnecessary.  I am sure there would be complete support on all sides of the House on the action to be taken by the Minister in this matter.</P>
        <P>I have raised the issue of industrial relations on a number of occasions.  Some Members became extremely excited a few weeks ago when air traffic controllers went on strike for a couple of hours and referred to the bad impression this would give of our country on the international stage.  It is worth noting that British Airways is facing into a major strike, that air traffic controllers and Lufthansa staff in Germany engaged in a four-day strike last week and that French air traffic controllers are due to hold a four-day stoppage.  In addition, there is complete chaos in many of the public services of other European states.  That has not happened in Ireland.  Instead of picking up on small things, people here should be taking action.  The Government has an opportunity to deal with this matter before it explodes.  What will happen is that someone is going to work to rule, someone else will get annoyed, someone else again will react to that annoyance and, as a result, someone will be sacked or suspended.  The matter will become a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> for those who want to create difficulties and it will escalate into a strike which will attract wider support and, completely unnecessarily, develop into a focal point.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames raised a particular issue on the Order of Business yesterday, the reaction to which of some Members was that those involved should either be sacked or dealt with.  I wish to outline the position on this matter.  Schools are extremely complex institutions.  It is not like the old days.  Middle management in schools is responsible for various matters.  With regard to school rolls, for example, and in the context of a system that is as awkward as some of the accounting systems used by small businesses, a member of staff is obliged to check the attendance record of each child on a daily and weekly basis.  The figures must then be reconciled <Col N="56"/>on a monthly and yearly basis.  This is a major job which in the past would have been done by school principals.  It is now done by someone promoted to the relevant middle management post.</P>
        <P>In the past schools were not obliged to have bullying or child protection policies.  As matters stand, they must ensure such policies are implemented in a comprehensive manner by staff who are properly trained for that purpose.  Also in the past schools were not required to deal with information technology, IT, issues.  Again, as with a small business, someone must ensure the proper operation of a school&rsquo;s IT system.  This is a complex business, particularly in view of the fact that the system must cover the entire school and its various classrooms and be updated on a regular basis.  These are middle management tasks and people are promoted to particular posts in order that they might carry them out.  There will be no one left to complete them.  It is not a question of sacking people for not doing this work.  If they do not do it, that is how the system will break down.  Everybody will do his or her own jobs; he or she will not pull back from what he or she is paid to do.</P>
        <P>This matter must be addressed.  Ireland is the only country in Europe which is still in a position to deal with it.  A solution must be found that will provide the Government with the savings it is seeking, that will bring about the transformation that is required and that will bring people onside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole in welcoming the inquiry into the barbaric practice of symphysiotomies.  As a midwife and nurse, I am in a position to state such procedures should not have been carried out at the time at which they were.  It is only correct that there should be a full scale inquiry into why such procedures were carried out.</P>
        <P>It has been a tempestuous few weeks in the world of politics.  We have seen conduct unbecoming of Ministers both inside and outside the Houses.  There has also been bickering and squabbling among Deputies and Senators.  Such behaviour does not lend itself to progress being made at a time when the country is going to rack and ruin.  It was alarming to watch &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; with Pat Kenny on Monday night on which so many young people displayed such disaffection with the political process.  I have no doubt that many in the audience were representative of their peers.  There is not that much wrong with the political process, it is the way it is being operated that is the problem.  There has been enough evidence of this since Christmas.  It is, therefore, no wonder that so many young people have such little regard for politics.</P>
        <P>At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children yesterday I saw another side to how young people approached politics.  Representatives from D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g provided members of the committee with reasoned and articulate views on some of the issues they rightly believed politicians should be in a position to address.  One of these issues is the subject of sex education which I have taught in many schools in the south-east region.  One of the reasons for this is that teachers find it difficult to deal with the subject and then return to teaching their normal subjects.  Those from D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g informed the committee that many pupils also had a difficulty with the subject.  Furthermore, they stated there was unequal access to sex education and that there was no standardised approach to the teaching of the subject.  In 2007 the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, launched a report on relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and stated that up to 60% of schools had no proper programme for the teaching of the subject.  Following all the public debate on the issue which dates back decades, it is ridiculous that such a simple matter cannot be addressed.  In such circumstances, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to come before the House in order that we might commence the process of dealing properly with this matter which is particularly important to young people.</P><Col N="57"/>
        <P>That brings me back to where I started.  One of the messages communicated on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; is that people are frustrated by political inaction, especially in the context of particular issues and how they relate to them.  This is a matter on which politicians must show that they can be positive and proactive.  That might lead to young people having more faith in what we do.</P>
        <P>The final matter to which I wish to refer relates to the recruitment embargo, bed closures and the curtailment of services.  The embargo is rendering the health service incapable of meeting the needs of the general public and leading to massive overcrowding in accident and emergency departments and long waiting lists.  A further 2,000 beds will be closed this year and some 1,600 more posts will be lost.  The embargo is having a particularly detrimental effect on mental health services.  Caroline McGrath, director of the Irish Mental Health Coalition, has serious reservations about a Government policy which is a crude and brutal instrument and crippling the Government&rsquo;s own reform programme, namely, A Vision for Change.  According to figures released by the HSE, 719 posts have been lost in mental health services in the past 14 months.  Any plan for reform must outline who is doing what, how they are doing it and when.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise three issues.  Is the Leader aware of any plans to amend existing legislation in order to assist subcontractors who cannot obtain payment for work done?  I suggest the introduction of a benefit clause, in respect of circumstances where materials and labour are supplied but not paid for and where a third party derives a benefit from the provision of such materials and labour, be explored.  Some element of responsibility for discharging a debt should rest with the benefiting party.  In other words, the debt associated with the provision of materials and labour should travel with the end product while it is still in use until the debt is discharged.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the continued and ongoing anger of members of the public regarding the perceived attempts by the Catholic Church to manage and exert damage control on the situation regarding the recent reports on child abuse.  That anger comes from a belief that the church and its hierarchy just do not get it.  I was impressed by the observation by one bishop at the weekend that what happened and how incidents of abuse were managed reflected a deficit that was brought about by an insufficient role of lay people, especially women, in the church.  I suggest this is only a partial insight and that it is not just about a lack of specific people, it is about a lack of humanity.  I call on the bishops and the Pope to look into their hearts and remember what lies behind their vocation and what the real work of their church is.  I call on them to state they are sorry they got it so wrong and that people were so hurt but that they need help in carrying out the work of their faith and that this can be done by everyone together.  Let the Pope ask the victims themselves for their forgiveness and not discuss it with his bishops.</P>
        <P>With regard to mental health and the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, it is very clear that we are in a landmark year for mental health.  We have money that will be very clearly ring-fenced.  He has given a commitment that A Vision for Change will be implemented within its stated period.  Many times on the Order of Business we have been asked what has happened to the briefings that the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, promised us on electroconvulsive therapy and mental health.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of those briefings was held yesterday.  I appreciate that Members are very busy but there were not very many Members of the Oireachtas at the briefing which was attended by interested parties.  A second briefing is scheduled for 9 March. <Col N="58"/> I know how busy people are, but if it is possible to attend, I know it would be appreciated by those making the presentations.</P>

	<P>If there was a proper ordering of business and we had a reasonable amount of time for this part of the business, this would not happen.  I am disgusted by it.  I would not care if we had two hours on the Order of Business.  It is the only part that is ever covered anywhere.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a very urgent and necessary debate on the tourism industry.  It has been accepted wisdom for a number of years that the one industry in Ireland that we could depend on to continue sustaining and increasing jobs was tourism.  We have all the right ingredients for a tourism industry and I do not propose to go through them.  The debate is particularly urgent in light of the fact that we had 1 million fewer visitors last year than previously.  There are a number of obvious contributing factors to that but one that we cannot deny is the airport tax.  It was a mistake to introduce the extra airport tax.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is a tax on tourism and I call for its removal.  Will the Leader bring forward a debate on tourism in order that we can discuss how we can highlight and heighten our tourism business and link with the Irish Diaspora abroad in the lead-in to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, thus building our tourism business on a number of fronts?  We have the heritage, the physical features and the musical and cultural traditions to do so.</P>
        <P>As I did not get an opportunity to do so yesterday, with the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s permission I welcome Senator Dearey to the Seanad and I wish him well.  His good wife Laura is a neighbour of mine from home and I know her family very well.  In fact, her brother was in my class at school.  That is bad news for my friend and colleague Senator Paul Coghlan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We all heard the debate in recent weeks on the creation of jobs.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on recent statements by the new US envoy, Mr. Kelly, with regard to promoting Northern Ireland only, rather than promoting the island as a whole?  The Border areas should be as well treated as Northern Ireland in this case.  I appeal for a debate on the progress of this.</P>
        <P>This morning, we all received two e-mails about the George Mitchell scholarship fund which we debated yesterday.  These contradictory e-mails were received from Niall O&rsquo;Dowd and Ms Vargo.  Will somebody examine this matter to establish which has the real story?  This is not in <Col N="59"/>the best interests of promoting the country.  I hope that what is suggested in one of them with regard to the actions of the other is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This House is being increasingly treated with contempt and a classic example was last night when I raised a very significant matter about the economy of the country and serious violations and infringements of liquidity regulations in a consistent, deliberate and repeated manner.  The answer I received from the Minister of State was that there was no ministerial responsibility.  If there is not, why did the Cathaoirleach allow it because that is the test it must pass?  That was a lie.  I impugned the reputation of the Office of the Financial Regulator and it was suggested to me that I should bring it up with the regulator.  What kind of puerile nonsense is this?  It is an insult to the House and I demand that this sort of behaviour should stop.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald about the symphysiotomy situation.  It is appalling.  It is a cruel, barbarous and inappropriate treatment.  I was shocked to hear on both programmes that it was motivated by sectarian religious impulses and I would like to know a little more about that.  If it is true, it needs to be explored further and exposed.  I would like to know more about Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Every time there is a scandal or a risk to health it seems to be at the centre of it.  Why?  Let us have an inquiry into that.</P>
        <P>I was not impressed by the representative of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Some years ago, it was asked by the same Minster for a report.  It gave one page which was as contemptuous as the way in which this House was treated last night.  It dismissed everything, and it was incorrect for it to do so.  It was wrong about it.  This operation has not been current in any other European country since 1944 and since the discovery of sulphonamide drugs.  It is practised sometimes in sub-Saharan Africa in the bush because of difficulties such as a lack of medical supervision and so on.  It is appalling to think that 1,500 operations were carried out.  It is not a matter of one or two operations.  It was a deliberate and consistent practice which was known and ignored by the professional body and now we are sending it back to them.  They are not fit to be charged with this.  It should be a fully independent inquiry.  Every spokesperson on both programmes defended the practice in some&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because every section of the House wants it and there is one person standing up against it and it is the Leader of the House, Senator Donie Cassidy.  If we had two hours every day it would be absolutely appropriate and I want this matter taken up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I suppose I can speak now.  A report in a newspaper over the weekend dealt with the very important issue of health insurance.  Many people here will recall the Minister&rsquo;s attempt to introduce equalisation into health insurance, which is essential for our growing elderly population.  The Judiciary saw fit to rule it down.  I will continue to be critical of the Judiciary getting involved in what should be a decision of the Executive.  These Houses should determine policy and the law should be interpreted by the Judiciary.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will reopen and re-examine this particular issue.  It is essential in order that people can access affordable insurance.  If we fail to do this, quite a significant proportion of the population will find themselves unable to secure that insurance.  I would like to think the House will support the Minister in her efforts.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Normally, I find Senator Fitzgerald to be extremely fair in her comments but the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, since he assumed office and responsibility for mental health, has shown himself to be genuinely committed to tackling the unacceptable conditions of our mental health institutions.  I heard him set out his plans in this area on three occasions last week &mdash; in response to a motion tabled before our parliamentary party by Senator Corrigan, in this House and on television.  The proceeds from the disposal of certain properties have been made available to him to deal with this important issue.  It is unfair to suggest we are not moving in a direction about which we can feel pleased, even if we were ashamed of our failure to tackle the issue in the past.</P>
        <P>In response to senator Prendergast&rsquo;s comments, I would not take guidance from &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo;.  The broadcaster involved rouses his audience and encourages its members to let their anger grow.  On a recent programme one audience member accepted that invitation by attacking the broadcaster over his approach and salary.  That does nothing for reasonable and constructive debate on important issues.</P>

	<P>I did not have an opportunity to contribute on the Order of Business yesterday and I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to speak today.  I join my colleagues in calling for a debate on banking.  In this regard, Professor Honohan gave me some encouragement when he spoke about jailing the bankers involved in criminal activities.  Today, however, I read that AIB which has been bailed out by the State to the tune of &euro;3.5 billion is to discontinue switcher mortgages at a time when people are down on their luck and need to be able to avail of lower interest rates.  It is an absolute outrage that it can suddenly decide to stop offering such mortgages merely to suit its coffers.  In the future it will only take on new business.  The director of the Irish Mortgage Corporation, Mr. Frank Conway, has said people need to be able to switch from one company to another.  As a result, there will be a closed shop, with only two lending institutions continuing to offer switcher mortgages.  The other banks will be able to increase their rates as they choose, regardless of what is happening <Col N="61"/>elsewhere in Europe.  It is an outrage that the bankers are laughing at us and making a fool of this country.  It is time the Government stood up to them because the vulnerable people at risk of losing their homes need to be looked after.  I, therefore, urge the Leader to set a date for a debate on banking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on banking.  On previous occasions I sought a structured debate on the financial and economic situation.  As we proceed through 2010, there will be more difficulties for the banking industry.  Halifax has already indicated it is pulling out of Ireland and others may follow.  I, therefore, urge the Leader to facilitate a structured and meaningful debate on finance and the economy.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader to clarify the position for those who have applied for medical or GP cards and have been waiting months to hear whether they have been approved.  I understand anybody who does not hear from the HSE will continue to enjoy the benefits of their cards.  There is significant anxiety among people waiting to learn whether they will continue to be covered.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of legislation to create the office of mayor of Dublin.  It is important we ensure the office will have the necessary powers to develop our capital city in terms of infrastructural requirements, job opportunities, security and protection of the environment, economic renewal and competition from other European capitals.  Will the Leader indicate whether we will hold a debate on the powers of the new mayor?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I, too, would like to hear from the Leader on the banking crisis, an issue we raised so vociferously yesterday and today because the ongoing problems are appalling.  Only this morning we learned about the allied issue of mortgage provisions.  Some time ago I proposed that the Leader invite the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, to come before the House.  I suggest we also invite a senior representative of the Irish Banking Federation, as serious issues arise for the economy.  I apologise, a Chathaoirligh, I was distracted by friendly fire.</P>

These plans have been languishing in Brussels since November or December.  If the Leader cannot give us the information we need, we would accept it from a Minister of State.  We appreciate that the Minister for Finance was unable to meet us yesterday because he had to take Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2010 but it is within the Leader&rsquo;s power to facilitate the House on this extremely urgent matter.</P>

	<P>I did not have an opportunity yesterday to welcome Senator Dearey to the House.  As a former colleague of his on Louth County Council, I have always known him to be very articulate and motivated.  He will be a good and able Member of the House.  It is weird that, despite being two and a half months in the Seanad, I am the fourth newest Member.  At this rate of turnover, there will be 40 new Senators in two years&rsquo; time.</P>

	<P>I offer a word of warning to Opposition Senators that eight Fine Gael and two Labour Party members of Louth County Council are coming to get them. </P><Col N="62"/>
        <P>I ask the Leader to facilitate two debates, the first on the smart economy and research and development, an issue raised yesterday by Senator Mary White.  On Monday the Louth economic forum announced its plans to create 10,000 new jobs in the county in the next ten years, focused on research and development, pharmaceuticals and internationally traded financial services.  These jobs are essential for the entire country because, as we know, our recovery will have to be export and research and development-led if we are to be immune to future recessions.</P>
        <P>The second issue on which I seek a debate is the announcement by Vodafone that it intends to hold onto unused credit in its customers&rsquo; accounts.  As was the case with dormant accounts in banks, there is an opportunity for a big company which has done very well in the Irish market to allocate the credit to charitable organisations.  We should seriously consider this proposal, on which I urge the Leader to communicate directly with the Ministers for Finance and Social and Family Affairs and Vodafone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on overseas development aid, as I fear the targets we set may be lost as we begin to become selfish about ourselves.  In 2005, 15 European nations set a target for overseas development assistance of reaching a figure of 0.51% of GDP by 2010.  At 0.52%, Ireland has surpassed that figure which a number of other countries have also reached.  Among the countries which have not reached it are France and Germany, two countries in which, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, there have been long strikes in recent times.  Our ability to meet targets set in the future will depend on how we run the country and achieve what we set out to do.  The Famine took place 160 years ago but it continues to occupy a place in our memories.  Every night 1 billion children go to bed hungry.  The Famine was very bad but what is happening now in the rest of the world requires that we maintain our aid levels.  We must avoid the danger that we will tear ourselves apart, which is why I worry when I hear about the many clashes and people ask why the Government does not do something to solve this or that problem.  We ourselves can handle a large number of the challenges we face.  Let us not ask for someone else to solve those problems.  Let us ensure we do it ourselves.</P>
        <P>Another statistic I noted yesterday was that every minute a woman somewhere in the world dies giving birth.  Problems such as 1 billion people going to bed hungry every night are solvable.  We have the talent, ability and skills to do that.  Let us not tear ourselves apart and damage the economy by infighting.  Let us ensure we put that high on our agenda.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I had the privilege of meeting members of the Irish Thalidomide Association who attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Some of us remember first-hand the tragedy that struck those innocent victims within the womb when their mothers unwittingly took the drug, thalidomide, for morning sickness in the early 1960s.  It was a drug that was wholly untested yet licensed for sale in this State.  Many babies did not survive the pregnancy and many others died in infancy, leaving a legacy that spreads much further than the tiny number of 32 survivors.  They are survivors in the true sense of the word.  It is extraordinary how many of them have made such valiant efforts to lead normal lives.</P>
        <P>I listened to the four representatives speak yesterday.  Believe it or not, because some of the thalidomide children were not able to be catered for in their own homes or in schools, they were sent to industrial schools.  Two of the thalidomide survivors who spoke to the committee yesterday were sent to industrial schools.  Maggie Woods cried as she told us what she had to <Col N="63"/>go through.  This month, the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the North, Michael McGimpsey, gave a package of &pound;1.1 million to the 18 survivors of thalidomide there.</P>
        <P>The compensation at the time was very small because the State did not believe that the children would survive.  The representatives of the thalidomide victims asked if they could come to the Seanad to speak.  I explained that we do not have that facility but that I would speak on their behalf.  I call on the Government to give a decent financial package to the survivors of thalidomide.  Their bodies are ageing much faster than ours.  They have exerted themselves so much physically and emotionally, they are getting diseases in their 50s that people would not normally get until their 70s.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, should come to the House.  The members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children promised yesterday that we would do everything we could on behalf of the Irish thalidomide survivors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in particular in raising the issue of industrial relations.  It is time that we engaged with the public sector unions in a meaningful way.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s policy and intention to force the unions to take industrial action and to suspend and sack members who do not perform their duty?  Does the Government want chaos, mass protests, lack of action, no work and a complete malaise in the public sector?  Is that what we want?  If it is not, then the Government is going about things in the wrong way.  The Government is going to follow the Ronald Reagan model and that is a recipe for disaster.  It is imperative that we have a debate on industrial relations in this House as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also join Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s call for a debate on tourism.  A total of 6.9 million tourists came to this country last year, the lowest level since 2005.  The Government has pursued a failed policy on the aviation travel tax.  Senator Boyle will be aware that a number of airlines have reduced their services in Cork Airport, thereby affecting people in the south and south west, the tourism capital of Ireland.  We need the tourism industry.  Last year was a catastrophic year and so far we have seen no blueprint or plan from Government.  I do not know where the Green Party stands on the aviation travel tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I hope the Leader of the House will convey to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the members of the Green Party in Cabinet that this tax is hurting employment and the regions and, more importantly, it is not flying the green flag of Ireland abroad.  It is failing to attract visitors to this country and it must be reversed immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>The political turbulence of recent weeks is distracting from the main issues that affect people&rsquo;s daily lives.  Thousands of people are still in danger of losing their homes.  Hundreds of thousands of people have no jobs.  There is much confusion and anger because the issues that concern people are disappearing from the radar.  The Government has taken determined action where that was necessary.  As a result, we still enjoy international confidence which is so vital to economic recovery.</P>
        <P>It might be presumptuous of me to paraphrase what Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole said, but I understand him to have said that the time is now opportune to revisit social partnership.  He made a strong point in that regard, namely, that we are in a far better industrial relations position than most other countries and that is why social partnership can still work.</P><Col N="64"/>
        <P>We also have to admit that the trade union movement has demonstrated a degree of restraint, and that has to be recognised.  My understanding is that certain talks are ongoing in the background.  I agree that they are preliminary but I suggest that they should be expedited.  I have no doubt that given the action the Government has taken, the restraint which the trade union movement has demonstrated and the acceptance of reality by the general community, now is the time for social partnership to give leadership.  If decisions are taken, they will be accepted by all.  We have to look to the future, not to the past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the case made so sensitively by Senator Mary White.  Her presentation to us proves the importance of liaising with all such groups that contact us, although we cannot always attend the presentations.  I hope her suggestion will be taken on board.</P>
        <P>I agree with the comments about social partnership and the need for dialogue.  We have often debated the matter in the House previously.  Everyone must work together to turn around the economic state of the country.  The difficulty with the previous model of social partnership was that a very small number of people, excluding most elected politicians, negotiated the country&rsquo;s economic policy behind closed doors.  It would be a positive first step, both from the perspective of social partnership but more importantly from the perspective of the perception of this House, if the Leader were to organise hearings in this House, as I have requested previously and which we could do with an appropriate amendment to Standing Orders, whereby we would listen to and debate with union leaders, employers, farmers and those representing the other pillars of social partnership.  We need to listen to those people but they also need to listen to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We agreed that previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because in our own way we speak for the public.  Social partnership must be held in the open, not behind closed doors.  This House could play a useful role.  Will the Leader please consider the possibility of arranging those hearings, which we can do if we have the political will?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am beginning to find &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; quite dull compared with some of the exchanges in the House.  I am sure we cannot wait for live transmission of these proceedings.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator Dearey, as I was not present yesterday to do so.  When thinking about Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s resignation, I recalled the words of Cecil Rhodes to Parnell during this controversy when he advised him to resign, marry and return.  It would be a sign of maturity in our political process if when good people sometimes slip and make errors of judgment, the Deputy could return as a Minister at some point in the not too distant future.</P>

	<P>As I said last week, the culture of looking for heads and taking people down not only is taking us nowhere but also is driving people down paths of dishonesty where they go into denial because of the sanction they know they will have to face if they are found out.  Deputy Sargent did the honourable thing.  He recognised the wrong in what had happened but far from making him a bad person, it affirms he is a human person prone to error like others.</P>

	<P>A question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Given all the discussion about the lack of confidence in our political process, could we have a debate on building confidence in it?  Such a debate could touch on issues such as these scandals, how they are investigated when allegations are made and what intermediate processes are in place whereby parties and Oireachtas committees can look into what happened.  We could then arrive at a finding in a more sane way rather than engaging in the tribal politics that emerges the minute a person gets some dirt on somebody from the other side.</P>
        <P>I support the calls for further inquires into the matter of symphysiotomy.  I found the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary difficult to watch and it is odd that if there is to be an inquiry, it would be left to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists alone.  While the institute has good people, when the profession of good people is involved, they can be prone to be defensive.  Given everything we have learned from various scandals, it would be good if there was something not too emotive where patients and their doctors are listened to respectfully and where we try in an honest way to come to a precise assessment of what happened and an understanding of the reasons behind what happened without undue recrimination.</P>

	<P>As I did not get the opportunity yesterday, I also welcome and congratulate our newest Member, Senator Mark Dearey, and wish him well in his time in the Seanad.  As this is national eating disorder awareness week, I again ask the Leader whether he can organise a debate on the issue of eating disorders.  I note a new clinic opened yesterday to treat young people who are suffering with anorexia.  Second, I was thrilled to hear three male Members raise the issue of symphysiotomy and its terrible effects.  I have met many of the women who have been scarred and marked by the practice by which their children were delivered and was sickened to the core when I watched &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; one week ago.  I was even more sickened last night when watching &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, on hearing the former obstetrician gynaecologist, Mr. Neary, who now has been struck off the medical register, state the women concerned only pursued this matter in the interest of money.  I concur with the comments of my colleague, Senator Mullen, that this matter cannot be left to the small cosy cartel that is <Col N="69"/>the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists but must be opened up further.  I agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s comment that this was a barbaric religious practice.  However, it was no such thing because when Mr. Neary performed Caesarean hysterectomies, he also attributed this to religious beliefs although it had nothing to do with the religious beliefs of the women he had butchered.  I do not use the word &ldquo;butchered&rdquo; easily but he did butcher them.  I know this because I sat listening to the medical inquiry into the matter for three years.</P>

	<P>Briefly, I agree with Senator Mary White&rsquo;s request to examine the case of a small group of sufferers who were the thalidomide babies and who now are in their late 40s or early 50s.  The issue of symphysiotomy also pertains to a small group of women who have been badly affected by medical malpractice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join other Members in welcoming Senator Dearey to the House.  I hope he has a fruitful period in the Oireachtas and at the rate things are going, he may become a Minister within the next couple of weeks.  I agree with and commend Senator Mary White on her comments with regard to the thalidomide survivors.  The request of the Leader to have such a debate in the House, if possible, is a good idea.  While I do not often echo the sentiments of Senator Feeney within the House, although I do so outside of it, she is absolutely correct, as are Members on this side of the House, to raise the issue of symphysiotomy.  The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme broadcast by RTE last week was fantastic.  It was one of those programmes which appalled one while watching it and, having thought about it subsequently, was even more appalling.  A full debate should be held in this House on this matter and a proper investigation should be carried out.  It should not simply be carried out by the professions involved in this sector but should be a public inquiry.  I also wish to record my disgust at the comments of Mr. Neary to the effect that those involved were in it for the money.  These people were abused and deserve to have their rights vindicated, even at this late stage.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to have a debate on banking today on the conclusion of the scheduled business.  This issue has been raised by a number of Members, including Senator Regan, who mentioned banking issues and Senator McFadden, who noted that AIB is pulling out of mortgage switching.  The regulator should have a role in this regard.  A number of years ago, Members were told that people could switch mortgages between financial institutions and I thought this would be a routine matter.  Consequently, it is not good enough for AIB to make such a statement now.  Moreover, Members are familiar with events over the weekend and last week in respect of Bank of Ireland, the State&rsquo;s investment therein and the &euro;250 million rebate that should have been paid but which has not been received.  This proposed debate on banking should be held before the adjournment of the House this evening.</P>

	<P>I again thank Members for their kind remarks this morning.  While I had expected all of that to finish yesterday, long may it continue.</P><Col N="70"/>
        <P>I wish to address the issue of the Border economy.  I call for a debate on an assessment of the impact the small reduction in VAT has had to date.  I acknowledge that I might be slightly previous in this regard as the figures may not yet be available but it is an important issue to address.  I am a great believer that if one creates the correct environment for business, businesses will get on with it.  While one can create all sorts of mechanisms and incentives, it is all about creating a good and level playing surface between North and South, while recognising the exchange rate issue is ever present and can affect matters badly.  There is a serious degree of asymmetry between the cost of doing business North and South.  The issue pertaining to the VAT rate has been partially addressed and I wish to ascertain what impact this has had and whether such an assessment should encourage Members to consider lowering the VAT rate again to bring this jurisdiction more in line with the North.  I believe everyone can win from this because anecdotally, although the haemorrhage has stopped, there still is a bleed northwards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe this can be dealt with by dealing further with the existing asymmetries, which incidentally also include matters such as local government charges.  The debate could be widened to include giving local authorities a more flexible hand when dealing with small businesses and the collection of rates. The local authorities are hidebound by the statutes governing the collection of rates.  This means that frequently, in the case of willing retailers or small business people who wish to pay on a staggered basis or according to their present means, such an offer cannot be made because of the manner in which rates must be collected by the local authorities.  In addition to the initial issue regarding VAT, I also seek a wider debate on creating a cost base that allows local and small businesses to get on with it.</P>

In respect of banking, the Finance Bill will be before the House by the second week of March.

        <P>Senators Fitzgerald and Corrigan referred to mental health issues and the &euro;43 million in the budget of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, during difficult financial times.  All Senators agree on the wonderful work being done by him.  He is highlighting and championing mental health issues and his attitude, background and expertise as a former member of a health board for many years cannot be beaten.  I look forward to his return to the House.  As Senator Corrigan stated, he needs our fullest support.  When briefings are being given, colleagues should make themselves available.  He is a Minister of State for change and we should give him our fullest support.  We already do, but it is impossible to be everywhere.  However, the next briefing will be on 9 March and we should all be there to help him in every way we can to ensure he receives the necessary &euro;43 million in funding to which the Government committed in the budget.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Buttimer, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Bradford discussed the responsibilities of trade unions.  We want to help our trade union colleagues with the responsible way in which they are acting and are trying to lead their members during these difficult times.  Social partnership must return.

Senator Bradford&rsquo;s suggestion was good.  Perhaps more good suggestions made during parliamentary party meetings over the next week or two could be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Its Chairman, the Cathaoirleach, will have them debated in a bid to determine how to take the Seanad forward.

        <P>Senator Prendergast referred to the Joint Committee on Health and Children and called for a debate on sex education.  I support her call and will try to arrange for that debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Corrigan called for a change in legislation on subcontractors.  This matter should be raised during Second Stage of the Finance Bill in the second week of March.  I support her opinions in this regard.  She also referred to the reports on recent activity in the church, including the Holy Father&rsquo;s meeting with the Irish bishops in Rome.  Certain attitudes must change and everything that is decent and honourable must be respected.  I fully support the Senator&rsquo;s comments and, if necessary, we can have a further debate on the matter.  I hope the Holy Father accepts the invitation to attend the Eucharistic congress in 2012 and to speak to the people.  I look forward to his letter, which is due in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Reilly, Buttimer and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for an urgent debate on tourism.  It is one of the three cornerstones on which we will rebuild our economy.  Tens of thousands of people are employed in the sector.  Like everything else, it is experiencing a difficult time, but we are at our lowest point.  The figures for March, May and June are pretty good and competitive rates are being offered by hotels across the country.  On a Friday or Saturday night in Cavan, Athlone, Mullingar, elsewhere in the midlands or Tullamore in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s area, hotels are experiencing growth because they are now giving value for money.  We need an all-afternoon debate on tourism, which I am endeavouring to hold during the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis mentioned Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s appointment as the representative of the US to Northern Ireland.  I agree with the Senator concerning the Border areas, but why not apply the same to the BMW region?  We are discussing the hidden Ireland and the Border areas.  Whatever occurs in the North, we in the BMW region feel its effects.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh discussed health insurance and the executive&rsquo;s decision, particularly where affordable insurance for the elderly was concerned.  We can take this matter up with the Minister for Health and Children when she is in the House.  I fully support the Senator&rsquo;s call.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely asked whether customers who do not hear from the HSE can assume that they are still covered by their medical cards.  I will make inquiries and revert to the Senator this afternoon.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for a debate on the new Dublin mayor.  Given the proposals and Bill being laid before the House, I have no difficulty in setting aside time to discuss the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely also asked about the progress being made by NAMA.  Senator Coghlan asked what progress Brussels has made in making a decision in this regard.  One Member of the <Col N="73"/>House might have highlighted the issues with the decision taking longer than expected, but it is hoped that there will be an official response from Brussels during the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Carroll, a young Member, outlined the smart economy to the House and mentioned the 10,000 proposed jobs for his native County Louth.  The latter is good news and I look forward to the younger Members of the House tabling innovative ideas.  I will discuss the matter with the Senator after the Order of Business.  I have no difficulty in this regard, but the issue could be discussed during the debate on the Finance Bill.  I fully support him in his call.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn discussed world development aid and the Irish contribution, which is the sixth largest in the world per head of population.  He also mentioned the &euro;10 million collected during the past seven weeks for Haiti.  The Irish have been generous for decades.  Missionaries have given of their lives and every fibre of their bodies to assist the underprivileged, whether through education or religion.  We are an exemplary nation and should congratulate ourselves on doing something well.  It is something of which we can be proud.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment, if financially possible, will be forthcoming to allow us to do everything possible to support the poor in the developing world</P>
        <P>Senators Mary White, Bradford and Leyden raised the matter of the Irish Thalidomide Association, the 32 survivors and the &pound;1.1 million in compensation for the 18 survivors in the North.  I will call on the Government to do whatever it can to support the 32 survivors.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan discussed the Dublin docklands report.  As I stated yesterday, the report is with the Attorney General, so we must wait.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called for a debate on head shops.  We had a lengthy debate on the challenges facing the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, in this regard.  I understand that he is at an advanced stage of having a debate take place.  After the Order of Business, I will discuss with the Senator how to keep this issue to the fore.  Whatever can be done, I will support fully.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney called for a national eating disorder week.  I have no difficulty in arranging a debate in that regard.  I also support everyone involved in the organisation, which is doing so much good in trying to help those who are badly affected by eating disorders.</P>
        <P>Senator Dearey called for a debate on the Border economy.  It is a worthwhile suggestion, given the cross-Border challenges faced by many counties North and South from time to time, the VAT implications and exchange rates.

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It provides for a streamlined system of arbitration in Ireland.  The best practice in this respect is the United Nations Com<Col N="75"/>mission on International Trade Law &mdash; Model Law.  It is important that it is incorporated unadulterated or modified to ensure we are seen to have legislation in this country which conforms with world standards and best practice and that Dublin can generate business as an arbitration centre.</P>
        <P>I asked on the previous occasion whether the Minister could outline any initiatives the Government would take on foot of the passing of this Bill to promote Dublin as an arbitration centre.  We have set a high standard in terms of the commercial court.  Many multinationals operate in this business and many financial institutions are based in the IFSC.  This Bill, when enacted, will play a fundamental part in providing an alternative resolution procedure to the courts and Dublin can play a big part in that.  Perhaps the Minister of State will refer to that point in his concluding remarks.</P>

	<P>I welcome the passage of the Bill and add my voice to that of Senator Regan in my party&rsquo;s welcome for it.  We decided in the Labour Party not to table amendments to it.  However, I raised a number of concerns on Second Stage which the Minister of State indicated he would take on board.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is welcome that we are streamlining arbitration procedures.  It is extremely important that we would generate the notion of Dublin as a hub for international arbitration.  On the previous occasion I raised a concern expressed by some arbitration practitioners that &ldquo;if ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo;, but I believe, on balance, there is a strong argument to be made for implementing and applying this international model here across arbitrations.  I hope there will be sufficient protections in this legislation for the consumer in terms of the small contracts to which arbitration will also be applied from now on.  I welcome the Bill.  I thank the Minister of State for his time in dealing with it.</P>

        <P>I thank the House for passing this Bill.  I thank the Minister of State for dealing with the matter in a swift and efficient manner.  While I welcome balanced remarks on issues, amendments and objections raised by Members opposite, when Bills come to the House that are not contentious and overdue, such as this one, I respect and appreciate the magnanimous manner in which my friends on the other side of the House, Senators Regan and Bacik, have dealt with this Bill in an appropriate way.</P>

        <P>I wish to respond to one or two points raised but, first, I will formally respond to the debate on the Bill now that we have concluded our work on it.  I will return to the issues raised by Senators Regan and Bacik.  I thank the Senators for the support they expressed for the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is essentially an exercise in the consolidation and modernisation of our current arbitration law which, especially in the domestic sphere, has remained largely untouched since the enactment of the Arbitration Act 1954.  The Bill will provide a single reference point for arbitration within this jurisdiction.  It does that largely by giving the force of law to the Model Law of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law which is widely recognised as setting the standard for arbitration law.</P>
        <P>The most important question to ask is what changes will occur in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s influence and what advantages will be gained on foot of enacting this Bill? We must make it clear that this is an attempt to give an assurance that there will be non-governmental intervention or involvement in this area.  That is the first point to make.  While it is not enough simply to rely on that, it is important our embassies promote the fundamental change provided for in this Bill.  Ministers when they travel abroad on economic issues should promote this measure at every advantage.  The process of attracting international arbitration business to this country is no different from the process which is dependent upon attracting other forms of mobile investment.  The issue here relates to mobile investment.</P>
        <P>It should be made clear that while international arbitration welcomes government support, it does not welcome government interference.  That is the most important aspect of this Bill.  To be fair, Senators across the House made this important point, namely to get the message across to the international community that this is change for good and that it will rely on arbitration in its purest sense.  Quite clearly, there will be no government involvement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In practice, and this is evident from other jurisdictions, it is the case that a certain amount of the promotion work has been done by those who are practitioners in the field.  We have to rely also on practitioners.  Such practitioners will be actively engaged in any arbitration work which takes place in Ireland.  They will already have an innate understanding of the arbitration industry in Ireland as it stands now and, as such, I venture to say they are ideally placed to promote Ireland as a suitable venue for large-scale arbitrations.  I understand that informal contacts have already taken place with relevant professional bodies in other jurisdictions which are aimed at forging the links which will help to channel arbitration business to this jurisdiction. On the passing of this legislation, it is up to the Government to ensure that in all promotional work, economical or otherwise, the change in this area is pointed out.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised a point on the previous occasion of the exclusion of certain types of employment disputes from the scope of this Bill.  Section 30, which replicates section 5 of the Arbitration Act 1954, excludes arbitration under agreements relating to the terms and conditions of employment.  An example of this exclusion would be provided under the consolidation arbitration schemes of the type which are common in the public service and which are sector specific.  Also excluded is the arbitration under section 70 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  That section empowers the Labour Court, with the consent of the parties, to refer an actual or apprehended trade dispute back to arbitration.  To elaborate on that, a particular reason for the exclusion at the time was to ensure the various review mechanisms envisaged by the High Court would not apply in the case of such arbitration.  The exclusion also recognised the fact that certain categories of labour dispute were catered for by the statute-based schemes of dispute resolution which had their own established specified codes or were governed <i>de facto</i> by their own established practice and procedures.</P><Col N="77"/>
        <P>When the Bill was being developed, advice was sought from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as to the appropriateness or otherwise of maintaining this particular exclusion.  The Department was of the view that the application of the general framework of arbitration legislation in the type of case mentioned, which is covered in section 30 of the Bill, would lead to unnecessary confusion.  It was also noted that, notwithstanding the exclusion, alternative dispute resolution methods have now become an important source of experimentation within the employment dispute area.  The distinctive character of employment disputes and grievances and the related public framework for dispute resolution which exists were together seen as justifying the continued exclusionary provision contained in section 30 of the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Report of Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children: Statements. </Title>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The publication of the third and final report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children has been widely welcomed.  The constructive approach taken by members of the committee to the serious and complex legal issues under consideration created an environment in which political consensus could be arrived at.  The building of political consensus was the first challenge facing the committee and without a common approach, I doubt we would be here today discussing the next steps and the likely process the Government will now enter.  In this respect, I pay tribute to the Chairman, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, for her stewarding of the work of the committee in the past two years, all of the members, and in particular the Members of this House, all of whom played a very active role in drafting, amending and finalising the three reports the committee has published.  It is only appropriate that any discussion of the work of the committee in this House should recognise the contributions of Senators Corrigan, Feeney, Fitzgerald and Alex White.  I was in the strange position of being a member of the committee during its deliberations and I am now charged with taking the report to the Cabinet where it will be considered.</P>
        <P>Dr. Ursula Kilkelly, the family law expert, wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week that &ldquo;Ireland has come late to children&rsquo;s rights&rdquo;.  It is hard to argue with that assertion when we consider that the need for constitutional change in regard to children was first voiced by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness almost 20 years ago in her capacity as chairwoman of the Kilkenny incest inquiry.  In writing the report on that case she stated &ldquo;the high emphasis on the rights of the family in the Constitution may consciously or unconsciously be interpreted as giving higher value to the rights of parents than the rights of children&rdquo;.  The matter was subsequently addressed by the Constitution review group which, in its 1996 report, recommended that the Constitution be amended to include the welfare principle and to provide an express guarantee of certain other rights for children deriving from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, in examining Ireland&rsquo;s first report on the implementation of the convention in 1998, stated &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the rights of the child appears to be somewhat fragmented&rdquo;.  The committee reiterated the need for constitutional change, having outlined its concern that Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;welfare practices and policies do not adequately reflect the child rights-based approach enshrined in the convention&rdquo;.<i>  </i>It recom<Col N="78"/>mended in favour of the accelerated enactment of the Constitution review group&rsquo;s recommended reforms.</P>
        <P>The 1997 to 2002 programme for Government contained a commitment that the issue would be referred to an all-party committee on the Constitution.  That committee reported in 2006 and recommended an amendment to Article 41 to include a new section on the rights of children.  It was in this context that the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, undertook an article by article review of the Constitution to examine the status of children.  There was recognition of the need to insert in the Constitution an article to expressly set out the rights of children.  The publication of the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007 provided, for the first time, a form of wording that sought to enshrine in the Constitution rights that would accrue to children as a distinct group, not simply as human beings and individuals or members of a family unit.  For the first time, this article singles out children as a discrete group possessing rights.  The Government&rsquo;s policy is intent on pursuing an amendment to the Constitution and threefold.  It would provide a clearer and more direct acknowledgement of the rights of children within a constitutional presumption that the best interests of children are served within the family; a restatement of Article 42.5 which would, <i>inter alia, </i>extend the provision to all children; and a statement which would permit the adoption of marital children and children in care.  It was accepted that, if the amendment was to have any chance of political success, political consensus was a must.  Consequently, the 2007 programme for Government contained a commitment to &ldquo;establish an all-party committee to examine the proposed constitutional amendment with a view to deepening consensus on this matter&rdquo;.  At this point, the joint committee came into being and set about its work.</P>
        <P>Prior to turning its attention to the specific matter of children&rsquo;s rights, the committee published two reports, the first dealing with soft information and the second with the issue of strict and absolute liability.  It was unanimously agreed that, in the case of soft information, a constitutional referendum was not required to effect the desired change.  A majority of the committee decided that absolute liability should not be reinstated in respect of defilement and statutory rape cases and as such, a referendum was not necessary.  That the committee was able to deal with these two very complex issues separately and disentangle them from the wider question of the rights of the child was a major achievement.  In addressing the specific issue of children&rsquo;s rights the committee faced a challenge to balance the rights of families, children, marital and non-marital parents.  This delicate balancing act took place against the debate on whether the barrier to State support should be lowered to allow the State to intervene with the family at an earlier point where evidence of family failure first presented.</P>
        <P>Having met on 62 occasions, the 118-page report from the committee recommends inserting a new Article 42 in the Constitution, reiterating the bulk of its current provisions on education but adding several new sections.  The new provision begins with a restatement of the oft-quoted phrase from the 1916 Proclamation that &ldquo;the State shall cherish all the children of the State equally&rdquo;.  Ironically, the signatories to the Proclamation were not referring to &ldquo;children&rdquo; as we understand the term but the need to recognise and be tolerant of minorities, both religious and political.  The newly proposed Article 42.1.2&deg; clearly states the State has a duty to vindicate the rights of children and affirms that children enjoy human rights that the State is obliged to uphold.  The provision reads: &ldquo;The State recognises and acknowledges the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children, including their right to have their welfare regarded as a primary consideration and shall, as far as practicable, protect and vindicate those rights&rdquo;.  Reflecting wording included in section 3 of the Guardian of Infants Act 1964, the newly proposed Article 42.1.3&deg; incorporates the right of children to have their welfare regarded as a primary consideration.</P><Col N="79"/>
        <P>It has been said the requirement to take a child-centred approach to such issues is strengthened by this article which would require that the welfare and best interests of the child be the first and paramount consideration in areas concerned with family law decision making such as guardianship, adoption, custody, care or the upbringing of a child.  The paramountcy principle is thus not just confined to judicial proceedings, but extends to &ldquo;the resolution of all disputes&rdquo; including determination of the broad issues of care and upbringing.  The child&rsquo;s voice must also be heard in any proceedings affecting him or her, having regard to his or her maturity.</P>
        <P>According to Dr. Kilkelly, when these two provisions are taken together, they will ensure that:</P>
        <P LI="1">decisions affecting children are focused, first and foremost, on their rights and interests.  This mandates a genuinely child-focused approach to the treatment of children by all organs of the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Article 42.2 steers a new course by proposing to require the State to recognise and vindicate the rights of all children as individuals.  Under the terms of the proposed wording, children accrue rights as individuals independent of adults.  Some experts who made presentations to the committee advocated a full incorporation of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child into the Constitution.  I think it is fair to say that the committee took the approach that it did not want to recommend inserting in the Constitution provisions that the State was not in a position to guarantee.</P>
        <P>Where criticisms of the report have been aired, attention has been drawn to the newly proposed Article 42.4.  Some have suggested that any reduction in the threshold that allows for State intervention in the family should be resisted.  This is construed as an attack on the integrity of the family; that in some way by giving rights to children we are taking them away from the family.  This was not the intention of the 2007 Bill nor is it the intention of the current proposal.  The newly proposed Article 42.4 sets a new threshold, based on proportionality.  It is not a case of granting the State extra powers enabling social workers to wade into a family and remove the child or children.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the rapporteur to the Oireachtas on child protection, stated last week that the wording contained in the proposal makes clear that removal of the child from the family is a last resort, and by providing for early intervention, the likelihood of the child being taken into care is significantly reduced.  He stated that proportionate intervention means minimum intervention to secure the child&rsquo;s welfare and safety.  The removal of the child is only countenanced when all other interventions have failed.</P>
        <P>The removal of a child from the family is a very sensitive matter and is likely to be highly contested during the course of any referendum campaign.  It is my firm belief that the best interests of the child are served in a loving family unit.  However, not all families and parents discharge their responsibilities to children in a proper fashion.  Due to external factors, some parents cannot nurture and care for a child in a manner that satisfies the child&rsquo;s requirements.  I believe that the increase in the number of children taken into care last year owed more to increased awareness of child protection generally and an increase in babies born to mothers addicted to drugs or alcohol in some areas, than a decline in family income.</P>
        <P>The provisions relating to adoption do not stray too far from the original wording and the intent of the 2007 Bill.  The desire in 2007 to liberalise the domestic adoption framework has been restated in the report.  The Government is expected to publish any legislation that would propose change in advance of any referendum.</P>
        <P>Having dealt with the Adoption Bill 2009 in this House some months ago, Senators know that adoption is a critical form of alternative care.  The committee examined the proposed provisions that were intended to improve the prospects of adopting children of married parents, <Col N="80"/>which are currently extremely limited, and also allow for the voluntary placement of children for adoption.  Out of the 5,694 children who are in care today, approximately one third are in long-term foster care and might benefit from the stability of adoption.  The State will be able to remove them from their parents but is unable to provide for adoption, which may be preferable in some circumstances to foster care.  For the adoption of children of marriage to take place, the court must be satisfied of the following: there has been a failure in the duty towards the child for physical or moral reasons for the previous 12 months; the failure is likely to continue without interruption until the child is 18; and the failure constitutes an abandonment on the part of the parents of all constitutional rights.  Moreover, the failure must be total and must arise for physical or moral reasons.  It must be a joint failure by both parents.</P>
        <P>According to Dr. Shannon:</P>
        <P LI="1">For a significant number of children in long-term foster care, rehab with their natural family is an unobtainable goal.  These children, although they no longer have access with their natural family, nevertheless legally belong to them and are not free for adoption.  They can only be freed for adoption if it can be proven that the married parents of the child have so comprehensively abandoned their parental duties in such a manner as indicates that the child is unlikely ever to receive even minimal care from them.  Of necessity, then, due to the Constitution these children live in a twilight world between a family that cannot fully care for them and a family that cannot fully have them.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The new Article 42.5 enables provision to be made by law for the adoption of any child where the parents have failed in their responsibility for that child for such a period as may be prescribed by law, and where the best interests of the child so require.  The committee proposal aims to enhance the prospect of decisions being based more readily on what is best for the child, having regard to the importance of continuity of care.</P>
        <P>The second proposal on adoption will make it possible for married parents to agree to the placement of a child for adoption.  The committee considered that the Constitution should set out specific rights for children and noted the potential for inequality under the current constitutional provision.  Reference was made last week to a recent High Court decision of Mr. Justice Sheehan, wherein he stated that children of non-marital families have lesser rights to proper provision and accommodation than children born to a marital family.  We would all agree this is unsatisfactory, given the State&rsquo;s attempt to remove any distinction between marital and non-marital children in the Status of Children Act 1997.</P>
        <P>The Government will now consider the report in some detail, and as the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il last week, the Attorney General will be asked to examine the constitutional ramifications arising from the proposals contained in the report.  There have been calls to commit immediately to a timeframe for a referendum, but I remind all interested parties that the committee took over two years to get to its current position.  The Government will need a little time to consider the full import of the proposal before committing to any timeframe.  Having said that, it is my intention to bring the report to the Government in the very near future and begin deliberations.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  The American journalist Bill Moyers, who has written extensively on the essence of politics and democracy, once said that &ldquo;Ideas are great arrows, but there has to be a bow, and politics is the bow of idealism&rdquo;.  There should always be room for idealism in politics.  Without idealism, politics would be a shallow and utterly pointless pursuit.  Those of us who are parents always strive to create the ideal home environment for our children, though we may not always succeed.  Those <Col N="81"/>of us who are involved in community activism strive to create communities that are vibrant and inclusive, and again we may not always succeed.  I also believe that the vast majority of us who have chosen politics as a career have done so in the hope that we can play our part, no matter how small, in shaping the ideal nation, a nation of which we can all be proud.  While our idealism may often be diluted by the cynicism of others or by a lack of resources, it should still be the reason we get up every morning to do the work we do.</P>
        <P>Just over 20 years ago, the UN General Assembly adopted a far-reaching and idealistic treaty that would dramatically alter the way the world looks at children.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, developed after years of intricate negotiations, offered a vision of a world in which all children survive and develop, and are protected, respected and encouraged to participate in the decisions that affect them.  Based on the four core principles of non-discrimination, the best interest of the child, the right to life, survival and development, and respect for the views of the child, the convention made it not just wise and just, but legally imperative for governments to recognize and uphold children&rsquo;s rights.  Twenty years later, it is clear that the convention has inspired a global movement for children&rsquo;s rights and that laws have been changed to protect children better.  Since 1989, the convention has been ratified by 193 countries.  More than 70 countries have incorporated children&rsquo;s codes into national legislation, as part of law reform efforts based on the convention&rsquo;s provisions.</P>
        <P>Here in Ireland, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance is a coalition of over 80 NGOs working to secure the rights and needs of children in this country.  It aims to improve the lives of all of our children through securing the necessary changes in Ireland&rsquo;s laws, policies and services.  The vision statement of the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance is immensely powerful in its simplicity and brevity.  It states that Ireland will be one of the best places in the world to be a child.  It is just one simple sentence, almost childlike in its formation and I suspect it is deliberately so.  We should be ashamed that following years of unprecedented wealth, Ireland is not already one of the best places in the world to be a child.  The alliance is equally succinct in proposing how to reach that goal.  Its mission statement also contains only one sentence, one ambition and that is to realise the rights of children in Ireland through securing the full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every healthily functioning and meaningful democracy requires an underlying ethos, a philosophy which guides us in making decisions that affect the lives of our citizens.  Here in Ireland, that ethos is contained in our Constitution.  The new constitutional article published two weeks ago by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Referendum on Children, if accepted by the people in a referendum, would transform our constitutional ethos and would result in the Constitution for the first time expressly acknowledging a child&rsquo;s individual humanity and rights.  Rather than usurping the role of parents in a child&rsquo;s life, the new proposed article instead recognises and respects that role.  While requiring the State to intervene where children are truly at risk, it ensures that any such intervention must not only be effective but must also be proportionate.  The new article also holds out the possibility of adoption to approximately 2,000 children currently in long-term care, mainly long-term foster care, who have no realistic prospect of being brought up by one or both of their biological parents for the rest of their childhood.  As the Minister of State pointed out, they are living in limbo.</P>
        <P>We as politicians are often accused of being overly partisan and incapable of putting aside our political differences to work for the greater good.  The valuable work done by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Referendum on Children should help to dispel that notion and I congratulate all members of the committee, including our Seanad colleagues Senators Fitzgerald, Corrigan, Feeney and Alex White, on their contribution.  I also congratulate the Minister of State for being so proactive with this issue.  I hope he will make the referendum a priority.  I am encouraged by the fact there is &euro;3 million set aside in this year&rsquo;s Estimates for a <Col N="82"/>constitutional referendum and I very much hope that such a referendum will be held this year.  It would be fitting for the Minister of State to be able to look back and say he was at the forefront of the campaign for such a referendum.</P>
        <P>The publication of the Ryan and Murphy reports last year brought a new urgency and impetus to the issue of children&rsquo;s rights in this country.  Both reports illustrated starkly what can happen when children&rsquo;s voices are ignored and deliberately stifled.  We heard the harrowing accounts of the horrific abuse that children can be subjected to when they are relegated to a low priority in our society.  That is what this amendment is about, rebalancing our priorities and for the first time making a positive statement of the rights of children as individuals to have their welfare regarded as a primary consideration.  For example, the proposed new article 42.1.2 requires that the State recognises the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and undertakes, as far as practicable, to protect and vindicate those rights.  This clear statement that the State has a duty to vindicate the rights of the child is a welcome affirmation that children, just like adults, enjoy human rights which the State is duty-bound to uphold.</P>
        <P>As we move ever closer to a referendum on this issue, the debate will intensify over the need for such a referendum and I would like to take a few moments to address a few of the issues that have arisen in recent discussions.  The debate will certainly not be helped by a sensationalist approach such as that employed by journalist John Waters, when he wrote recently that the only &ldquo;equality&rdquo; provided by the amendment would be the equal right of all parents to have their children &ldquo;snatched by the State&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Mr. Waters and others argue that this amendment will somehow undermine the status of the family unit and allow for inappropriate or disproportionate intervention on the part of the State.  This is not the case.  These concerns are met by the proposed wording, that State intervention shall be &ldquo;by proportionate means, as shall be regulated by law&rdquo;.  The emphasis is on supporting families in their responsibilities to their children, and the removal of children from their parents will be a last resort.</P>
        <P>Also, Article 42.4 addresses the concerns with the existing Article 42.5 by setting a new threshold, based on proportionality, for State intervention in the family to protect children.  The provision makes clear that children are entitled to State support regardless of their family status and represents a major advance in the relationship between children, their parents and the State.  Rather than bringing more children into care, this provision suggests that the removal of a child from the family should only occur where a no less invasive measure would suffice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is worth noting that in her most recent annual report, children&rsquo;s ombudsman Emily Logan remarked that out of the 810 complaints received in her office in 2008, not one of them emanated from a conflict between the best interests of the child and the rights of parents.  Ms Logan very much supports the proposed amendment and is not looking for the State to supplant parents but to respond &ldquo;in a proportionate way, one that will support, not punish families in difficulty&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The new amendment is a substantial improvement on the amendment originally contained in the Government&rsquo;s 2007 Bill.  With all-party support in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the support of groups, organisations and individuals who daily and with extraordinary commitment work to help and protect children, it can be successfully incorporated into our Constitution with substantial public support in the required referendum.  I urge the Minister of State and indeed his Government colleagues to make the holding of this referendum a priority for 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an ethical obligation on us as law makers to put the interests of our children at the very heart of the Constitution.  Bringing about such a change to the Constitution requires a certain amount of idealism on all of our parts.  Without such idealism we have no direction, we <Col N="83"/>are just angry and disillusioned people doing nothing more productive than complaining.  Some of us cannot imagine a future without strife and so cannot develop a map to guide us there.  We now have in our hands the map to a better place for our children at least and we should have the courage to take our children there as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on the fine speech he made on this most important issue.</P>
        <P>On 16 February, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children issued its final report.  The discussions of the joint committee took place against the backdrop of the numerous reports that have highlighted the lack of constitutional provision for children&rsquo;s rights.  As the Minister of State noted, Dr. Ursula Kilkelly, the family law expert, writing in <i>The Irish Times</i>, stated that Ireland has come late to children&rsquo;s rights.  It is hard to argue with that assertion when we consider the need for a constitutional change with regard to children was first voiced by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness almost 20 years ago in her capacity as chairman of the Kilkenny incest inquiry.  In writing the report into the Kilkenny incest case, Mrs. Justice McGuinness stated that the high emphasis on the rights of the family in the Constitution may consciously or unconsciously be interpreted as giving higher value to the rights of parents than the rights of children.</P>
        <P>In the past, the absence of a constitutional provision to ensure that decisions about children take into account their interests led too often to their rights being ignored.  To address this problem it is vital we pursue the opportunity to introduce the necessary constitutional reform.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Constitution contains two pivotal provisions concerning children.  The first of these, Article 41, recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society.  This provision is untouched by the recommendations contained in the joint committee&rsquo;s report.  The proposed constitutional amendment relates to the second provision to which I refer, namely, Article 42.  Under the new Article 42.1.2&deg;, the State recognises the rights of all children and undertakes as far as practicable to protect and vindicate their rights.  The provision proposes to incorporate as a constitutional principle the right of children to have their welfare regarded as a primary consideration.  This provision is strengthened by Article 42.1.3&deg; which states the welfare and best interests of the child must be the first and paramount consideration in the resolution of all disputes concerning the guardianship, adoption, custody, care or upbringing of a child.  The proposals express the State&rsquo;s duty to recognise and vindicate the rights of all children as individuals.  These rights include the right of the child to care and protection and education.  They also include a child&rsquo;s right, having regard to his or her age and maturity, to have his or her voice heard in any proceedings affecting him or her.</P>
        <P>The final provision of note is the replacement of Article 42.5.  The proposal in this regard suggests that the wording will emphasise the need for the State to support parents who have difficulties in fulfilling their duties towards their children.  The Minister of State put it so succinctly when he indicated:</P>
        <P LI="1">However, not all families and parents discharge their responsibilities to children in a proper fashion.  Because of external factors, some parents cannot nurture and care for a child in a manner that satisfies the child&rsquo;s requirements.  I believe that the increase in the number of children taken into care last year owed more to increased awareness of child protection generally and an increase in babies born to mothers addicted to drugs/alcohol in some areas than a decline in family income.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Any intervention in the family must be proportionate, provided for by law, and ensure equal treatment of all children regardless of their parents&rsquo; marital status.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>These proposals reflect a new approach to the treatment of children and a rebalancing of the responsibility of the State and parents.  The recognition of the voice of children and of their rights as individuals is necessary to ensure that Ireland meets its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  These proposals represent a bold step forward in our commitment to enshrining the rights of children in Irish law.  They have received widespread support from those who work with children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reform of the Constitution would be the greatest memorial to the tens of thousands of children who were abused while in the care of the State and whose stories were so succinctly outlined in the Ryan and Murphy reports.  I wish the Minister of State well with regard to the reform of the Constitution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on the important work he has done.  I have some reservations with regard not to what is contained in the joint committee&rsquo;s report but rather in respect of what is missing from it.  I wish, therefore, to make two significant points &mdash; I know the Minister of State will take them on board &mdash; and ask two questions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is stated in the report that under the Constitution children have a right to free primary education.  That is factually incorrect.  If there is such a right, it is certainly not stated in the Constitution.  Appendix 5 to the report refers to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, one of the articles of which refers to making primary education compulsory and freely available to all.  We have a responsibility to ensure that the substance of that article is reflected in the Constitution.</P>
        <P>One of the most important items of case law relating to primary education is that involving Crowley <i>v</i>. Ireland, which arose in 1980.  As it happens, I had a great deal to do with that case.  Judge Kenny&rsquo;s judgment in the case reflected the contents of the Constitution, which says that &ldquo;the State shall provide for free primary education&rdquo;.  The Irish version of the Constitution is equally unclear in this regard.  It states, &ldquo;N&iacute; fol&aacute;ir don St&aacute;t socr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chun bunoideachas a bheith ar f&aacute;il in aisce&rdquo;.  The Constitution does not in any way impose upon the State responsibility to provide free primary education.  We are being presented with an opportunity to change Article 42.4 in order that it might state &ldquo;The State shall ensure that all children have compulsory and free primary education&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the issue of the State and the family.  I asked a simple question of three members of the joint committee but I could not obtain a straight answer.  The Constitution states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It also states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social.</P><Col N="85"/>
        <P FLI="0">If they choose to educate their children, parents are, therefore, responsible for their physical education.  Parents may decide not to educate their children and send them to school.  The latter is what most parents choose to do.</P>
        <P>Why is physical education excluded from what the State must provide?  There is a school on the South Circular Road, which was opened amid great hoo-hah and which was supposed to reflect the fact that ours is a great pluralist society, where girls are not allowed to pursue the full programme relating to physical education.  When the Constitution was being drafted, Archbishop John Charles McQuaid and Eamon de Valera, one of the founders of the Minister of State&rsquo;s party, were of the view that the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; related to how women&rsquo;s bodies worked and that it would be terrible if they were given information relating to their bodies during lessons at school.  They also held that girls might be exposed to the odd fact relating to birth control, which would be even worse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is still the position with regard to the Constitution.  I asked three members of the joint committee why the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; was dropped from the report.  I presume the joint committee obtained all sorts of legal advice.  I do not believe the church would even argue that physical education is an important aspect of children&rsquo;s overall education.  I am concerned about this matter because the clause was often used to argue against the introduction of sex education to primary schools in the 1980s and 1990s.  People stated at that time that sex education should not be taught in such schools.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to take away from the work of the joint committee, which is extremely good and important.  I welcome what the joint committee has done and I congratulate its members, particularly those from this House who have made a solid contribution to its work, its Chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, and the Minister of State.  However, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is not properly reflected in the joint committee&rsquo;s report.  In that context, we should once and for all include in written form in the Constitution the State&rsquo;s responsibility to provide children with compulsory and free primary education.  We must also ensure that where the State is educating a child and is responsible for exposing him or her to certain minimum levels of education, this should also include exposure to physical education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing time and I welcome the Minister of State.  Tributes are due to the joint committee in respect of the hard work it has done.  I hope we will have more than one debate on this matter in the coming weeks and months.  In light of the importance of this topic, the time allocated is too short to allow Members to tease out the relevant issues properly.  I will be asking the Leader to schedule further debates on this matter. Let us consider this to be an opening opportunity to debate the issues involved.  </P>
        <P>In paying tribute to the committee, I note that it was unanimous in making its recommendations.  However, we should not confuse this with an idea that there is cross-party support.  We need discussion within the parties on what has been proposed by the committee.  While the proposal contains much that is meritorious, there are certain key issues that will have to be addressed and changed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that the main thrust of the proposed amendment dealing with the rights of the child is to give the State more interventionist power.  However, we know from previous case law dealing with the educational needs of disabled and homeless children that the State has sat on its hands; I am thinking of the Sinnott case and the case of T.D. <i>v</i>. the Minister for Education and others.  This is not to forget the all too easily forgotten reality that recent revelations show that the State is in a poor position to take the moral high ground when it comes to child welfare.  This is not to rule out, <i>a priori</i>, the possibility that the constitutional threshold for State intervention is too high.  If a case was suitable as a justification for this contention, it would be the heel prick case, although even in this instance, one would not have to try too <Col N="86"/>hard to imagine how State intervention in medical decisions affecting children could quickly shift from being &ldquo;proportional and reasonable&rdquo; to arbitrary usurpation of parental authority.</P>
        <P>There are legitimate concerns about the issue of children in the custody of their married parents.  I welcome in general terms the desirability of providing for the greater potential of the State to intervene in cases of abuse and also in certain situations involving the adoption of children of married parents.  The very well documented abuse cases quoted in recent days are covered by existing constitutional provisions as thousands of children are taken into the care of the State each year.  This view is accepted by eminent persons such as Gerard Hogan who recently stated he disagreed with the suggestion that current constitutional provisions for the protection of children had not worked well, did not strike the right balance or were in some way responsible for many modern ills.  He saw this as a grotesque misstatement and misunderstanding of the constitutional provisions.</P>
        <P>Turning to the specific provisions of the proposed amendment, I am struck by the rather novel concept of &ldquo;children of the State&rdquo; in the first paragraph of the article.  I note the Minister of State has referred to the 1916 Proclamation and the fact that it refers to all of the children of the Gael, not only minors.  More to the point, the Proclamation refers to children of the nation, not to children of the State.  When one shifts the course of a ship by one or two degrees, it may not make much difference at the outset but at the destination point it may make quite a difference.  That is precisely the type of issue we need to tease out very carefully in the coming weeks and months.  The idea of &ldquo;children of the State&rdquo; suggests the concept of the State as parent.  I am not sure that is the appropriate way to look at its role, even if, on occasion, it must be required to take the place of the parent, which is a different idea.  I wonder about the implications this concept could have for the courts, without wishing to be definite about the implications it might have.  Could it exclude the possibility of non-citizens enjoying certain categories of rights?  Would the provision establish the idea of the State&rsquo;s children and, as such, are we looking at a rather dramatic transfer of rights and responsibilities from parents to the State?  A strong case can be made for eliminating that part of the proposed amendment, as it is too vague and rhetorical and its relationship with the more specific statements on the duties of the State and parents is completely unclear.</P>
        <P>This is not the only example of potentially problematic ambiguity in what is proposed.  The third paragraph deals with the resolution of all disputes concerning the guardianship, adoption, custody, care or upbringing of a child.  I wonder whether, on the basis of consistency, we should ask whether, in the context of the consideration of divorce proceedings, the principle of paramountcy should also apply, whereby the child&rsquo;s best interests would be paramount and the first consideration.  We are all in favour of ensuring the best interests of the child but there is something of a mother and apple pie dimension to this, as Gerard Hogan stated.  However, we must ask ourselves, when we speak about ensuring the best interests of the child, who will decide what these are and how it will be done.  We are only scratching the surface of this issue today and as such, I would not like anything I state at this point in such hasty circumstances to be regarded as conclusive of my views.  We need to tease out these matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I find it strange, given that Article 41 is so strong on the family, that there is no mention of the family in the proposed Article 42.  I wonder whether there is a need for an amendment to the effect that there would be a presumption in favour of a child&rsquo;s welfare being best supported within the family, although I suspect Article 41 already provides for this.  I also wonder whether, in the light of the social and scientific data, there should be an acknowledgement that, while we seek to treat all children equally regardless of their family circumstances, if we really care about the welfare of children, we should also seek to enshrine a presumption or assumption by <Col N="87"/>the State that generally a low conflict marital lifelong relationship between the natural parents is in a child&rsquo;s best interests, if one takes an honest look at the data.</P>
        <P>We have further to go on this matter.  I hope we will have a very respectful debate in the coming weeks and months and that we will have robust exchanges because these are very important issues.  If we are united on the aim of genuinely seeking to protect children, particularly the most vulnerable children in our society, we will surely arrive at the right answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a line in the famous work by the Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran who wrote <i>The Prophet</i> which suggests our children are not our children but a part of life&rsquo;s longing for itself.  The nature of this debate is about the role of children in modern Irish society; not that they are owned or are chattel or that they are part of a particular unit of the State, but that collectively we have a responsibility to ensure their physical, emotional and education needs are met and that they are provided with whatever support they require to become fully functioning adults in society.  Modern social history has tended to put this aside where children tended to be seen but not heard.  We have evolved to the current state of affairs where an Oireachtas committee with representatives from almost every political party has come to the conclusions before us today which will eventually be put before the people and which provide us with a definition of the role of the child in modern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Other Senators are correct to state we must treat this debate with the utmost seriousness.  We must also acknowledge that as a state we have very much failed in this, the reasons for which are that we invested too much in concepts taken for granted as the natural home for the upbringing of children but from which many children were taken for very spurious and social policy reasons that we cannot defend in this century or the modern era.  While the family is the preferred model for the upbringing of children, it is not always the ideal.  We must legislate constitutionally and in statute to take account of those circumstances where the well-being of the child cannot be met through the conventional structures in which we hope such needs are met.  In the past the problem was not caused by a failure to meet these needs; it was a failure of the children, through no fault of their own, to fit into that conventional structure.  Children were removed from unmarried or single parents or where parents did not conform to an overriding religious ethos.  Because of this we created an institutional culture which had a side-effect of institutional abuse, with which society is still dealing.  That is why this is important and why we need to have a reasoned and considered debate.  I am glad the committee has dealt with this in a detailed and considered way and in a way which invites the wider discussion we need to have as a society.</P>
        <P>We must also take into account that, surprisingly enough, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann is one of the oldest written constitutions in Europe.  Our nearest neighbour does not have a written constitution and the constitutions of most European countries were formed in the aftermath of the Second World War.  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann defined its vision of Ireland in 1937 and needs to be considered in a modern context.</P>
        <P>The committee has done valuable work in terms of deciding how that should apply when defining the status and rights of the child.</P>
        <P>We also have to comply with our international obligations and while the committee is only today presenting its report for our consideration, we have singularly failed as a State to live up to the original UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which we signed up to 20 years ago.  We cannot take pride in the fact that it has taken us two decades to arrive at our current position.  However, as we say in all good political and economic debates, we are where we are.  We have to address this issue because it can no longer be put on the long finger.</P><Col N="88"/>
        <P Just="Left">The commitment shown by the committee, the Minister of State and the original and revised programmes for Government demonstrate this issue is being treated with the utmost seriousness.  The degree of consensus reached among politicians and political parties will help the national debate.  For these reasons I welcome the report of the committee and look forward to the wider debate that will take place.  We are debating the ability of the State to recognise children as evolving adults who need to be listened to and protected.  Their voice cannot be put aside nor their rights diminished.  If we want to live in a modern Ireland which offers protections equal to those of other progressive societies, we need to make this amendment to the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State on the occasion of the publication of this extremely important report which is founded on a high level of consensus across the political divide.  I endorse the comments of my colleagues regarding the input of all parties into the report.  In particular, I commend the Minister of State on his consistent engagement and regular attendance at committee meetings.  The commitment shown by Senators in the committee&rsquo;s deliberations was exemplary and undermines any argument that might be made for abolishing this Chamber.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This issue is characterised by complexity and, often, the presumption of disagreement even where there is none.  People assumed on the basis of history that certain things cannot be changed but when we began to examine in detail what words actually mean, it was funny how quickly we were able to progress towards agreement.  The Minister of State clearly outlined the achievements made in terms of the proposed wording.  If this amendment is implemented, we would have a Constitution which protected children as the holders of autonomous rights.  It would be a misnomer to say we are putting children&rsquo;s rights into the Constitution for the first time but we want to ensure they have rights in and of themselves and not just mediated through their membership of families.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has regular dealings with all the organisations engaged with children&rsquo;s rights and advocacy, including the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and Barnardos.  These organisations offered significant support to the committee and in some cases made multiple submissions.  Their universal welcome for the outcome of our deliberations is in itself a measure of the extent to which progress has been made in the course of our work.</P>
        <P>In regard to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks, it would be more accurate to say the committee proposes to revise Article 42 rather than insert a completely new article because some of the existing wording is retained.  This may give rise to confusion in some quarters during the debate.  The provisions dealing with primary, physical, moral and intellectual education which are already in the Constitution are simply lifted into this new proposal.  The committee debated whether we should unpick the provisions on education or include a right to secondary education.  Several colleagues even argued for the inclusion of a right to third level education.  However, members did not feel the terms of reference of the committee extended that far and I believe we reached the correct conclusion.  The Bill published in 2007 delineated to a considerable extent the work of the committee.  A major debate remains to be had, not least in the context of the Constitution, regarding the right to education but it was not within our remit to make proposals in regard to the sections we lifted from Article 42.  We have not dropped the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; because the provision in question was simply left unchanged.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen made the rhetorical point that the State does not have the right to occupy the high ground all the time because it cannot always be relied upon to be the best agent for vindicating the rights of children.  He makes a fair point when he puts it that way.  Our proposal does nothing to change the basic presumption that a child&rsquo;s welfare is best served within his or <Col N="89"/>her family but we cannot ignore the fact that, unfortunately, the family is not always the safest place for children.  We have seen terrible examples in recent years, culminating in the reports we all have read.  The 1937 Constitution itself provides a basis for intervention on the part of the State, albeit in exceptional circumstances.  I doubt if Senator Mullen or anyone else would say that there ought never be a basis for the intervention of the State.  That seems to me an absurd suggestion and one that could not be justified.  The question is when, how and under what circumstances and controls this ought to be permitted to occur.  That is simply what we were wrestling with.</P>
        <P>I was not sure initially about the notion of proportionality and that it would be the basis upon which intervention would take place but I found myself convinced that it is a useful concept to consider.  I cannot say what proportionality would mean to a court but to me it would mean that intervention would take place only when it is necessary and only in so far as is necessary.  It is not something that happens very easily or automatically.  It is something that is required to occur under particular circumstances.  A test of proportionality is the appropriate one.  I hope those who might have problems with this proposal would discover that they do not have as many problems when they read it and that they might agree that proportionate intervention is the right way to proceed.</P>
        <P>I listened to what Senator Mullen had to say on the question of cherishing all the children of the State equally.  We know that the phrase comes from the Proclamation and, as the Minister of State pointed out, the signatories and those who wrote it were not talking about children in the sense in which we are talking about them.  They were talking about something much more political in the sense of people of different traditions and backgrounds and that irrespective of one&rsquo;s background or religion one would still be cherished by the State.  That was a declaration of intent and a hugely resonant and important one historically for Irish people.  We are familiar with the phrase.  There is no problem with that kind of phraseology being drawn on in this report.  In a sense that proposal is a proclamation as well, that the State should cherish all the children of the State equally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legal content is open to debate but it seems that the rest of the proposal which deals with actual specific rights being accorded to children for the first time, such as the right to be heard, the right to have one&rsquo;s welfare regarded as a paramount consideration, and all the specific rights set out in the amendment, are the terms the courts will be required to consider if there is a necessity to analyse what we are proposing if the people were to adopt it.  That overarching proclamation of cherishing all the children of the State equally is an appropriate one.  Even if it is just simply rhetorical in that kind of historical sense, it is one that will resonate with people.  I see no reason we would not consider putting that into the Constitution in this particular context.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to Ursula Kilkelly&rsquo;s response.  It is the only academic response I have seen in the past week or ten days to this proposed amendment.  It is fair to say it is a positive one on her part.  She is someone who has a track record in analysing the performance of the Government and the State on the nature and appropriateness of laws relating to children.  The way I read it, she has given a strong endorsement of the work that has been done by the committee.  I find that gratifying, not because I am looking to academics to tell us whether we are performing well but because she is someone who has analysed this incredibly complex area and found that the wording comes up strongly from any analysis done on it.</P>
        <P>She makes the point that the committee neatly sidestepped the issue of Article 41 by replacing the reference to the family in Article 42 with a reference to parents.  Senator Mullen was critical of the wording on that basis also.  However, he fairly acknowledged that he believed that the continuation in being of Article 41, untouched by the work of the committee, should <Col N="90"/>give a considerable degree of comfort to those who, like him, take the view that there ought to be no change in that regard at all.  We might be criticised in other quarters for not having addressed Article 41.</P>
        <P>The test in regard to proportionality is an important advance.  We have noted in the course of our work that a test of abandonment, which is essentially what is in place at the moment, has been interpreted by the courts in an onerous sense.  By that I mean that abandonment has been interpreted as meaning, essentially, that the abandonment of the child is likely to continue up to the age of 18 and that it has no way of being repaired or temporarily abated.  That test is too onerous.  What we have done is navigated the complexities of the issue and come forward with a set of proposals that will win widespread agreement across the community.  I certainly hope it will.</P>
        <P>If the past ten days is anything to go by in terms of criticisms of what we have done, the arguments have not been particularly compelling.  Senator Cannon referred to one such criticism by John Waters that the proposal could be reduced to a sense in which all parents of the State would now be equal in terms of the likelihood or possibility of their children being snatched from them.  That is so absurd in the context of this debate as to be ignorant of the issues that are being dealt with here.  I hope the debate does take place at a higher level than that.  I think it will and that the contribution we have made in the committee in the past two years will go a long way towards leading that discussion and, I hope, bringing about a much better state of affairs constitutionally for the children of the State and of the nation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>We are having an interesting and good debate on the proposed amendment.  I speak from the perspective of being a father and what I would look for in terms of providing shelter, education and various supports for my children.  The committee has got this bang on.  The proposed amendment is a good document.  As a parent I accept that safeguards have to be in place.  There is no question that some homes are dangerous places for children.  We have to recognise that.  There are families who do not bring up their children to the standards to which I aspire.  Families expect the Government to support and provide for children up to a certain standard and benchmark.  The aim of the amendment is to provide support.  I commend the committee on that.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State on his work in ensuring the child is to the forefront in anything that we do because our children are the most important people in the country and we have to ensure we look after their welfare.  The family home is the best place for the protection of children.  Fostering and adoption are the other two areas in which we can ensure children are best served.  In the past we let ourselves down badly.  The State handed over the responsibility for the care of children.  We saw the result of that in the Murphy report.  We were badly served.  We moved away from the most important unit, the family, including those involved in foster care and adoption, and the children were badly abused in commercial schools.  We must protect our children from such a scenario.</P>
        <P>Our children should receive the best education possible.  The State has an obligation to ensure a good standard of education is available to them.  The Minister for Education and Science is moving in the right direction this year by providing a free preschool place for one year for children.  That will pay huge dividends in the years to come.  Investment has also been made in parks, playgrounds and other recreational facilities.  We must not forget the recreational aspect of bringing up children and helping them to develop before they enter their teenage years and adulthood.</P>
        <P>The State cannot intervene all the time to overcome the problems encountered in the system.  This cannot become a nanny state.  It must be ensured families will take responsibility for their <Col N="91"/>children.  The onus is on every member of a family to ensure he or she takes this responsibility seriously.  It is important that legislation does not take anything from families and that it provides them with the support necessary to make sure children have access to the best education and recreational facilities.</P>
        <P>Deputy Andrews is the second Minister of State to be appointed with responsibility for children.  I was a member of a health board for eight years and can recall the lack of regulation and support in this area.  Services for children were rarely mentioned but now a Minister of State has responsibility for such services which are where they should be.  In so doing, high standards will be ensured and good support provided for children to ensure they will develop in the normal way.</P>
        <P>It is crucial that we all learn from the Murphy report.  It is an important document and shows clearly that when responsibility is handed over to a different organisation, support must be provided for children.  Child abuse has also been uncovered within a number of sports organisations, including those responsible for swimming.  Unless the appropriate safeguards are in place and no matter how good legislation is, it has to be policed to ensure the best results.  That is all we can do in this legislation.  It is vital that it be well debated in the House.  There is a high standard in this House of teasing out legislation, which is why it is an important chamber.  Members have the time and expertise to examine legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank the committee for its hard work and simplifying the legislation.  People will criticise it but the simpler things are kept, the better.  The legislation will do what is required and, with all-party consensus, I am confident it will be passed without much difficulty.  The Minister of State will have an important role to play in the referendum and I am sure he will get his message across clearly, as will each of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue.  I also welcome the Minster of State, as he played a key role in the committee&rsquo;s work in the past few months.  It has been an extraordinary experience to be a member of the committee.  I pay tribute to the Chairman, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, because, as Senator Alex White said, it was complex gathering together all of the work that had been done previously, examining the Constitution, considering how it should be amended, which is such a significant move, examining the balance that needed to be maintained and working out final recommendations regarding the various articles.  Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke presided over the committee with great patience and tenacity and ensured we arrived at a point where we could publish with all-party agreement, on which I compliment her and the members of the committee.  The members with legal experience played a unique role, particularly Deputy Shatter and Senator Alex White.  We also had a superb legal team.  Self-praise is no praise but to arrive at a point where we had consensus among all the political parties on such an issue was important.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and the Government have a unique opportunity to implement the report and put the matter to the people in a referendum, assuming the seismic changes in politics of the past few weeks do not continue.  If the Minister of State has the opportunity, he should grasp it with both hands.  He has been given an unique opportunity to bring forward watershed legislation and a watershed referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  I know he wants to do this and hope he will not be stymied by the Attorney General and that he will get the support he should receive.  So much time and work has gone into this that the goodwill and good intentions of the committee in the final set of recommendations must be accepted.  The public will accept that the committee sought to strike the correct balance between protecting the family and protecting the rights of children.  Proportionality is an important term in the recommendations and the proposed amendment to the Constitution.  The recommendations at which we have arrived grasp that balance well and elegantly and in a way that is protective of the <Col N="92"/>family and children.  That is what the people want.  They do not want the family unit to be undermined; they want children&rsquo;s rights to be recognised in order that children will not be neglected in the way they have been for such a long period.</P>
        <P>If one considers the history of children&rsquo;s rights in Ireland over a long period, the Murphy and Ryan reports contained strong evidence that children&rsquo;s rights were not central.  This also was evident with the Child Care Act, when it took 100 years to replace an old English Act with the new children&rsquo;s legislation that was introduced in the 1990s.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is extremely important to consider the highly positive response of groups and individuals to this report and I believe one should not go into a referendum campaign assuming there will be a high degree of conflict because there is absolutely no need for it.  This measure has all-party support and as Senator Alex White noted, there has been an extremely positive response from those experts in the area who have examined it in detail.  Moreover, all the existing children&rsquo;s rights organisations have expressed their support for the work that has been done.  As Senator White observed, such organisations have heavily influenced this work by repeatedly appearing before the joint committee to amend work that had been done.  This places the Government in a unique position to bring forward children&rsquo;s rights, to change the Constitution and to ensure the balances are better than has been the case over a long time.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution referred to Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and the Kilkenny incest report, which was when consciousness was heightened in respect of children&rsquo;s rights, the failure of the Constitution to protect them and the plight of children in incestuous situations.  Other children were in care or had parents who were alive but were not in contact with them.  While they were being brought up in institutions, they could be adopted by a loving family were the Constitution different.</P>
        <P>I perceive this report to be hugely supportive of the family.  While there have been a few comments to the effect that it could lead to inappropriate interventions in families, I do not believe this to be the case.  I noted an example being given on television recently that the State will seek to interfere in cases involving obese children.  I thought this diminished the work put into the report regarding the balances that were carefully arrived at and demonstrated a simplistic attitude to the highly complex work the joint committee was trying to carry out.  Were this referendum to be passed, judges who came to interpret these proposals would be obliged to weigh up a careful balance between what happens to the individual child and to the family.  Furthermore, there is no question of snatching children from families.  The recommendations are written in too nuanced and careful a manner for this to be the outcome.  From a public perspective, the Murphy and Ryan reports, as well as the kind of information that has entered public consciousness over the past year or two in particular, have heightened people&rsquo;s awareness and levels of information about what has happened to children.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to make a rapid decision in this regard.  It has both all-party support and that of all the organisations with respect to the report&rsquo;s contents.  However, a strong informational campaign for the public will be needed in order that they understand the recommendations and I ask the Minister of State to examine this proposal.  One should recall what happened in respect of the Lisbon treaty referendum, when people did not understand, became confused or thought it proposed one thing rather than another.  Members will recall the efforts they were obliged to make to provide detailed explanations and to clear up any misunderstandings and consequently should ensure there will be no misunderstandings about these proposals or that there will be no glib comments about it destroying families.  Instead, Members should communicate to the public what it actually proposes, which is that for the first time, the Constitution will expressly acknowledge a child&rsquo;s individual rights.  In addition, it will recognise the central role of parents in the development of a child but will note the State must intervene <Col N="93"/>when children are truly at risk.  Equally, however, it will ensure that such interventions must be proportionate and effective and will hold out the possibility of adoption for the approximately 2,000 children who are in long-term care and who have no realistic chance of being brought up by one or both of their birth parents.  In the course of two years of hearings, there have been 62 meetings and the joint committee has received huge input to arrive at this position.  I wish the Minister of State well when he takes this report to the Government and I hope he will receive strong support.  I am confident he will and that he will continue to receive the all-party support that emerged at the joint committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the highly important report before Members and welcome to the House the Minister of State, who I note has been present for the entire debate, which is a significant reflection of his commitment to the work that must be done in this regard.  In particular, I welcome the reasonable debate that has occurred in this Chamber this afternoon.  As other colleagues have observed, a substantial amount of work has been undertaken by this all-party committee, which commenced with a proposed wording that sought to address several different aspects.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the joint committee&rsquo;s Chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, and to all its members, including my Seanad colleagues, all of whom are present in the Chamber, namely, Senators Fitzgerald, Alex White and Feeney.  The two interim reports and the final report are a demonstration of how politics can be done and how it can be both constructive and effective.  This is to be welcomed, particularly in the context of what has occurred in the last couple of weeks.</P>
        <P>The background to the establishment of the joint committee was the desire to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations with regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as the strong public desire to ensure no constitutional impediment existed to ensuring the strongest possible protection for children.  The interim reports, to which the Minister of State already has referred, addressed the issues of soft information and absolute and strict liability.  This final report and its proposed wording for a referendum on amending the Constitution addresses a number of issues.  Very importantly, it acknowledges the right of children to be treated as individuals and to be heard in any judicial or administrative proceedings affecting a child, subject to his or her age and maturity.  This has long been sought and reflects the contents of more recent legislation to come before the Houses.  It acknowledges the right of children to be treated equally, regardless of the marital status of their parents and acknowledges their right to an education.</P>
        <P>Significantly, the report before the House and the proposed wording address a number of obstacles that had prevented the opportunity of adoption being available to some children, such as, for example, the voluntary adoption of children of married parents.  In the course of their work on the joint committee, its members became aware of the cases of hundreds of children who are in foster care at present and who have had happy and fulfilled development within those settings.  As those children reach the age of 16, 17 or 18, the families with whom they are living seek the opportunity to adopt them but because they are children of married parents, this is not possible.  I welcome in particular the report&rsquo;s addressing of this obstacle.</P>
        <P>Throughout its work, the joint committee also heard from a number of people and organisations of increasing concerns that the bar for the State intervening in child protection cases required a threat of imminent death and therefore made difficult any intervention by the State to protect a child&rsquo;s welfare and best interests on some occasions.  I believe the recommendations to address this issue are generating the most concern regarding this report and the proposed wording.  The joint committee was conscious of the sensitivities of the issues raised and did not seek in any way for this debate to become polarised or to be centred on the rights of the family versus the rights of the child.  The joint committee stressed clearly that in the vast majority of <Col N="94"/>cases, it considered that the best interests of the child are served within the family and it gave recognition to this point by not seeking to change Article 41, as well as by making an explicit reference in the proposed wording to the rights of the family to determine the education of the child and, if they felt fit to so do, to provide education in their own homes for their children, as well as to the right of the family to determine moral and religious upbringing.  Where intervention is deemed to be necessary, the joint committee has recommended that it be proportionate.  As other colleagues have remarked, this is a particularly vital inclusion.  Initially, it is a question of seeking to provide added protection and support for families.  The Minister of State clearly outlined the intention that the removal of a child from a family is the last resort.  The goal is early intervention to support the family and the child and to avoid the necessity for the child&rsquo;s removal arising.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In my experience, families are the strongest advocates for children.  In some of the cases that recently appeared on the national stage regarding realising the rights of children, it was the families that took court cases on behalf of children in nearly all instances.  This is an important point we must keep in mind.  Therefore, in strengthening and acknowledging the rights of children, we are strengthening the family&rsquo;s armoury in seeking to have children&rsquo;s rights realised.  It is important that the rights of both should not be perceived as being incompatible or mutually exclusive.  That perception is not helpful and has not been the situation in the majority of the cases taken in recent years.  In many instances, a child&rsquo;s rights would never have been realised if not for the advocacy and campaigning of his or her family.</P>
        <P>When one listens to the concerns and arguments tabled by people who are worried that the acknowledgement and strengthening of the rights of the child will take away from the rights of the family, one realises that fear and anger over the current system as it relates to cases on child care, child protection and child custody lie at the heart of their concerns.  I refer in particular to the rights and protection for fathers.  We must take some responsibility.  The practice of not recording decisions has resulted in only anecdotal accounts and accounts of the most extreme nature being available for our information and consideration, especially in child care cases.  This has left us exposed to some accurate accounts but also to some myths and fears about what is occurring.  Most seriously, it has left us without a sound and reliable evidence base of what is actually occurring in such cases.  The committee recognised this as a deficit for future plans, considerations and developments.  Therefore, I welcome the final report&rsquo;s recommendation that a mechanism should be developed to enable the reporting of such cases without putting in jeopardy the anonymity and privacy of the parties involved.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear.  The State is not looking to take children from their families.  Policies across all areas of care are focused on keeping the individual, be he or she a child or vulnerable adult, in his or her own home.  However, we cannot be intimidated by people who seek to scare us into turning a blind eye to unsafe situations in which children are in danger.  As a country, we already have a shameful history in this regard.  There is no honour, humanity or Christianity in so doing.</P>
        <P>The final report is a genuine effort of an all-party group to provide a better situation in terms of the rights and safety of all children.  I urge Members to consider this intention and to make constructive suggestions and comments that will enable us to realise this legitimate goal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and applaud this decision.  Partial though it is, it is an improvement.  We are starting from a low base.  The Minister of State in his speech rehearsed criticism from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  When reporting on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1998, it stated <Col N="95"/>that our approach to children&rsquo;s rights seemed to be somewhat fragmented.  This was diplomatic language for saying that we had done a bad job.  The committee also indicated that our welfare practices and policies do not adequately reflect the child rights-based approach enshrined in the Constitution.  In fact, matters are worse than that.  It is not just that the old Victorian idea about children being seen and not heard was widespread, an idea that children were, in some sense, the property of their parents and were treated as such, just as women were treated as chattels.  Rather, it is also the appalling situation in which both church and State stood deeply condemned for their complete dereliction of their responsibility for looking after the welfare of children.  Children were not regarded as significant or as having any right to a voice.  They were serially abused, degraded, humiliated, physically tortured and interfered with sexually.  This is the base from which we are starting.</P>
        <P>A number of years ago in the House, Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I advocated the Stay Safe programme to protect children in schools.  We were attacked widely by elements in society, the voices of which are still being heard.  The reason for the attack was that the family, as an institution, was regarded as some kind of sacred shibboleth, the interests of which were placed above those of the child.  This was an horrendous absence of any type of moral value.  It is always wrong to place an institution above an individual.  The individual feels, bleeds and suffers.  The institution is created for the welfare of the individual.  I go right back to the Bible for this point.  Christ was reproved for just grinding an ear of corn between his fingers.  The self-righteous hypocrites of the New Testament, who are still with us, accused him of working on and breaking the Sabbath.  He made the point that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.  This is why it is so important that we recognise the humanity of children, which has been done in this amendment to the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I compliment our former colleague in this House, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, who was a forthright and clear Leader of the Seanad.  With great skill, she moderated the committee&rsquo;s discussions.  It is a tribute to her and all the committee members, some of whom are present, that an agreement was reached on a sensitive matter.  It is useful that the agreement has the strength of the support of a committee drawn from all the political parties in the Houses.  I welcome this development.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has indicated that voices such as those to which I referred are still active in our community.  I would quote him if I could find a copy of his speech.  The copy I have is not mine.  He referred to people being concerned about the intervention of the State and the lowering of the threshold at which that takes place, thereby infringing the rights of the family in some way.  I have also heard these opinions, but I deplore them and those who expressed them.  I question their representative nature.  I have heard representatives from the so-called Iona Institute speaking on this subject and advocating the rights of the family and the parent.  I heard similar people when we raised the issue of fathers sexually abusing their children, at which time we were told that we were in some way interfering with the family.  The family needs to be interfered with in those circumstances.  It is right and proper that it should be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Iona Institute has every right to exist and express its view.  However, let us be clear.  It is an unelected, unrepresentative group of reactionary, right-wing, religiously motivated people.  They have an undue prominence in this debate. Contributions to this debate should be proportionate.  It is most unwise to give oxygen, in the media and other places, to this very nasty view.  When I heard one of their spokespeople on the radio the other day I had an instant sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  I was thinking of my wonderful old friend and inspiration, the late Dr. No&euml;l Browne, the mother and child scheme and the way in which the church in this country objected to the sustenance given out to nursing mothers and their children because it thought this was an interference and an undermining of its authority.  Once again, the church did not give a damn about the welfare of the mothers and their children.  It was interested in its own power.  I would <Col N="96"/>like to think those days have gone from this society and that we will bravely support the rights of children.</P>
        <P>We have had a number of cases like the Kilkenny incest case.  In 1993 the Honourable Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness asked for this kind of referendum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would welcome the suggestion implicit in the wording that we would insert in the Constitution that glorious phrase from the 1916 Proclamation that the State cherishes &ldquo;all the children of the State equally&rdquo;.  I understand that is one suggestion and I hope it is taken on board.  As most citizens of the country believe the phrase is already in the Constitution, let us satisfy them and put it there.  Let us also remember that the word &ldquo;children&rdquo; did not mean people under a certain age.  It meant all the people of the State because we are all the children of the State.</P>
        <P>We need also to take our courage in our hands and look at Article 41 and this constrictive definition of the family.  It does not suit the 21st century.  We should look at that again, particularly if it inhibits the application of the proposal.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of adoption, I hope the disgraceful moral ignorance and neglect of the Government in the civil partnership legislation, where the rights of children of gay couples are ignored totally, will be addressed with the support of this proposed amendment.  It will give the children some rights, at least.  I know I am speaking to a sympathetic audience in this House, and in particular to the Minister of State whose decency I well understand.  The Minister of State and virtually everyone in this House must agree with me that it is a nonsense that gay people can legally adopt children as single individuals, whether they are biological parents or not, but if the adopting parent dies the child is left with no rights whatever.  Perhaps this will be some kind of half measure to address that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Civil Partnership Bill comes to this House I will be attempting to amend it in order to protect the rights of children and I will be calling the bluff of the Government to make sure it is serious when it says the rights of children are paramount.  It is not the rights of parents, gay or otherwise, but the rights and welfare of children which are important.  I can say that with some background because I was responsible for the section of the Child Care Act which introduced the guardian <i>ad litem</i> principle, in the aftermath of the Maria Colwell case, in order to give a voice to children, who must be heard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Like other speakers, I am delighted to see this day when we are in the House with the Minister of State to debate this wonderful report.  I feel a little out of place now because at this time on Wednesday Senator Alex White and I used troop off to a meeting, of which there were 62, of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  I find I am at a loss these Wednesdays.  I do not know what to do with myself.</P>
        <P>The report was published a week ago and it is timely that we are already here to discuss it with the Minister of State.  I commend him for the great interest he has in his brief.  I have had numerous chats with him about various matters, one as recently as this morning.  It always comes across to me that deep in his heart he has children&rsquo;s interests first and foremost.  Even before the interests of parents he sees the child&rsquo;s interest as paramount over all else.  Not everyone might have taken the interest he has taken in this brief.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other speakers have dealt with the legalistic aspects of the report.  That is one area of our committee meetings I will not miss.  There were times when they were so legalistic that one <Col N="97"/>wondered what one was doing there, yet one was compelled to be there because it was such an interesting committee.  I am proud to have been asked to serve on the committee and of everyone&rsquo;s work on it.  We had a wonderful Chairman in Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  She was humorous and hard-working and kept us all on our toes.  She was so inclusive that she included every single member.  There were days when one felt that if one kept one&rsquo;s head down she might not ask for one&rsquo;s opinion but she always asked for everyone&rsquo;s opinion.  This was good because it made us work hard.</P>
        <P>The work was two years in process but the two years were well spent.  A mature approach was taken by the whole committee.  No one came with fixed ideas.  Everyone had an open mind.  Last week at the launch of the report, Deputy Brendan Howlin said the work of the committee and the way in which we reached a consensus was a blueprint for how committees should work.  There was much arguing and party lines were followed but they were then thrown out because every member of the committee had the interests and protection of children to the front and to the centre of what we were doing.</P>
        <P>This report comes on the back of the Murphy report.  There is a huge desire for change and now is the time to make it.  I hope we see a referendum at the back end of 2010 and that the report does not have a chance to gather dust.  I am glad to see we are looking after children.  I hope we will see the end of long-term fostering and that every child in the State will have the experience of knowing what it is to have parents.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Feeney for sharing time.  Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister of State and pay tribute to the work and dedication of the committee.  As the report has taken two years to produce I am sure its recommendations were not arrived at simply or quickly.  Therefore, we need a long discussion about the legislation to be drafted and the referendum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every time a constitutional referendum is proposed I realise how out-of-date is the Constitution.  Rather than have amendment after amendment we should have a total revamp of the Constitution.  Today we are discussing a referendum on children.  We could equally discuss the whole issue of the family, as Senator Norris and other Members have recommended.  What is meant by the family?  What was meant by the family in 1937 is no longer relevant today.  We need to recognise this and update the Constitution.  Members of the Oireachtas are not required to take an oath to uphold the Constitution but Ministers are.  Therefore, I hope what I am proposing is not sacrilege.  The Constitution is out of date and no longer serves the required purpose or the people.  It certainly does not serve the children of this country.  That is why I welcome the recognition of the rights of children.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White surprised me when he said children do not have rights in court.  I thought they did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise.  I thought the Senator said that this will guarantee them rights in hearings on custody issues or other such issues.  I misunderstood the Senator.  I understood children had these rights.  This is something which is long overdue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I endorse something Senator Norris said.  We need to be careful in regard to civil partnerships.  Words and platitudes are all very well but unless they have real meaning, what good are they?  While we all purport to give equal rights to children, Senator Norris pointed out where those rights will be strongly challenged in legislation.  This is an opportunity for us to show that this is a modern society &mdash; I do not know whether it is appropriate to call it a pluralist one &mdash; that we have nothing to fear and that we will give all children and families, whatever that <Col N="98"/>word means, equal status and equal rights in the Constitution.  I propose to support whatever amendment Senator Norris plans to table to the civil partnership legislation.</P>
        <P>We can no longer pretend all children are equal while some are more equal than others.  Either they are all equal or they are not.  This forthcoming legislation will give us the opportunity to show what we mean.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris is an example of someone who has been the subject of prejudice.  While I listened to him, I thought that it was a pity he was not a woman because women&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution would have changed much more quickly because he was able to stand up for the rights of the minority he happens to represent.  We need to be cognisant of that.  Senator Norris has highlighted an issue in regard to children and where they might be subject to prejudice, to which I would like to alert the Minister of State.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed I did not have the opportunity to hear Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s comments but I am sure they would be fully laudatory of every aspect of the Government&rsquo;s performance.  I thank all Senators for the valuable contribution they made.  As always, it is a great pleasure and honour to be in the Seanad.  I wish to mention the wide-ranging views expressed in this House and the engagement all Senators have had with what is a very important document produced in such a short period under the chairmanship of Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.</P>
        <P>To the best of my ability and in the short time available, I will address my comments to the specific issues raised.  Senator Cannon spoke about trying to create a monument to past failures.  That is a very fair point and one which was very much expressed in the contributions of members of the committee throughout the sittings.  Senator Mary White made a point about Article 41 remaining <i>in situ</i>.  We had a considerable amount of debate about that and were determined that it was important that the presumption that a child&rsquo;s place is best served in the family, which has been expressed many times in the Supreme Court as an interpretation of Article 41, would not be interfered with.  What we wanted to do for the first time was to place a specific and discrete article in the Constitution that referred to children&rsquo;s rights and not dilute the importance of the family in a child&rsquo;s life and development.  We were absolutely clear about that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised specific issues in regard to the exclusion of the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; in what is described as the general education of a child.  It was quite interesting that he raised that because only yesterday, D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g made a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in which they expressed their disappointment that relationship and sexual education is available on the curriculum in only 27% or 28% of senior cycle schools.  They found that it was generally associated with religion teaching in so far as it was available.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s points were very well made and I would say in all honesty that they had not occurred to me in our deliberations.  The legal advice we received in regard to the second point was that free primary education is a constitutional obligation.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen made some very important points, which I respect.  He articulated views widely held throughout this country, if not in this House, so one must consider them very carefully.  He said the Government did not come to this argument with clean hands because of previous failures and has let children down in the past.  He is right about that but that should not be used as an argument not to make an effort to improve in the future.  It could be an <Col N="99"/>argument for the Government to excuse itself in the future from any type of proper radical reform in the area of children&rsquo;s rights.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen referred to the concern about the phrase &ldquo;children of the State&rdquo;.  Senator Alex White also referred to this first sub-article of what is proposed.  We had a wide discussion on whether this should be included.  I was not aware at that time that, historically, this was supposed to refer to children in the widest sense and not just minors.  The general view of the committee was, as Senator Alex White mentioned, that it should be something of a proclamation itself, aspirational as it were, in the way it is expressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would say to Senator Mullen that it is absolutely the case that there is a presumption in the Constitution, which we propose to maintain, that a child&rsquo;s best interests are served within the family.  That has been a Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution on a number of occasions.  We do not propose to dismantle that in any way.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White referred to the fact that this, for the first time, affords children rights in their own right.  That is a very good phrase to use to describe what we sought to achieve.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Butler spoke about some of the practical achievements we have made and referred to the free pre-school year which was only introduced last month.  It is true to say that while the Constitution represents the highest declaration of the legal position in the State, it is also by 1,000 smaller things that we really give expression to children&rsquo;s rights.  It is appropriate to refer to the progress made under various programmes introduced by the Government in the past ten to 15 years.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald spoke about the consensus achieved by the committee in such a short period, which I acknowledge.  I submit that may have had much to do with the fact that committee meetings were held in private for the most part.  It allowed everyone to proceed in perhaps a much more frank way than would ordinarily be the case and, on my part as a Government representative, perhaps in a less defensive way.  It is an excellent piece of work and great credit is due to the Chairman, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.</P>
        <P>I would argue a little with what Senator Fitzgerald said about the Murphy and Ryan reports.  I deliberately had not associated this proposal with the failures in regard to clerical child sexual abuse because it is not about church-State relations but about families, individuals and children, regardless of religious issues.  I would not put it in the context of a church-State type of argument, on the contrary.  I am not saying that is the way the Senator describes it.  I deliberately avoided saying we had our failures in the past in regard to clerical child abuse and, therefore, we should vote for this.  It would be unfair and unwise to try to limit it to that.</P>
        <P>Let us not forget that 90% of child sexual abuse is carried out by family members.  That is as much as we need to know when we talk about the Murphy and Ryan reports.  It is about a lot more and it is more significant than that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that clarification.  Senator Corrigan spoke about the lack of information in the District Court.  As she knows, the report made a recommendation that a study be done to elicit information on judgments and decisions made in regard to the child care legislation in order that we would know what issues are raised in terms of the limits on the ability to support families where children are at risk and, of course, referring to the crucial issue of proportionality.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris mentioned the Civil Partnership Bill, a matter for debate on another day, and also referred to the right of a child to have his or her voice heard.  One of the recom<Col N="100"/>mendations made in the report published last week is that this be one of the few enumerated rights included in the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney said there should be no long-term fostering.  However, I argue that long-term fostering is appropriate in certain circumstances.  Adoption breaks a child&rsquo;s ties with his or her siblings, not only with his or her family.  It will not suit everybody, but there will be a role and place for long-term foster care for some children.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley spoke about the need for a total revamp of the Constitution which, again, is probably outside the bounds of this debate.  She said that if Senator Norris was a woman, women&rsquo;s rights would have been advanced much more quickly, having regard to how much he has argued for on behalf of gay people; however, women are not a minority group.</P>

I am committed to bringing the report to the Government as soon as possible.  It is clear that this is a determined piece of work by a committee which was very focused.  I want to establish form on the issues involved.  Two other reports were published by the committee and their recommendations were acted upon.  Legislation is in preparation on foot of them.  I hope the report on this issue will not gather dust.</P>

        <P FLI="0">On behalf of Fine Gael, I am happy to move this motion on special educational needs.  The Minister is welcome.</P>
        <P>I note that Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary is appearing before the Joint Committee on Transport, but this is the House the focus should be on such is the impact the cuts in the area of special educational needs are having on children&rsquo;s lives.  Before I go into detail, I would like to speak in general terms about the Minister&rsquo;s Department.</P>
        <P>While we fight many battles, we are here for the good of children, the good of students and, ultimately, the good of the nation because education is the great builder and of strategic importance.  However, the Minister is dismantling bit by bit our education system.  There is a crisis in the teaching of science and mathematics in our schools.  There have been cuts in teacher numbers in the sciences.  Half of our teachers do not have a qualification in mathematics, yet it is meant to be the cornerstone in building the country into a knowledge and innovation economy.  The NUI office has been abolished, which will affect our iconic brand internationally.  One in six children leave school early.  The cut in teacher numbers has led to an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio which is affecting all our children, including those with special educational needs who have been placed in mainstream classes.  The non-replacement of teachers in key posts at middle management level has been widely publicised.  It means essentially that our schools will be made unworkable.  In addition, there is the third level funding crisis.  Most of the constituency issues with which I am dealing concern grants for students.  All of this is undermining the education service available to the customer &mdash; the child.  The child with special educational needs is the most vulnerable of all.  That has led to the motion before the House.</P>
        <P>In 2006 the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, stated &ldquo;the current support framework, in almost all its manifestations, is unable at present to provide the necessary levels of support for inclusion in our primary schools.&rdquo;  What has happened since?  The answer is that the position has worsened.  The economic downturn has led to the Minister starting to make cuts.  Last year over 500 children with mild learning difficulties were placed in mainstream classes.  I am keen to hear how these children are getting on and what the Minister knows about the matter.  He must account for how children with special educational needs can function in mainstream classes without adequate supports, a special needs assistant or resource teacher hours, all of which are being cut.  It seems vulnerable children are paying for the sins of Fianna F&aacute;il in government.  This should make it very uncomfortable for the Minister, as to have vulnerable children paying the price and all these teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am being very accurate.  I do not even need to listen to the Minister&rsquo;s comments.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Currently there is a threat that 1,200 special needs assistants, SNAs, will be withdrawn from schools throughout the country.  The NCSE office told me this morning that, after the completion of reviews in 1,000 schools, 300 SNAs had already been withdrawn, with resource hours.  The Government&rsquo;s policy of inclusion will fall apart completely, unless it provides a level playing field for children with special educational needs.  The idea behind providing SNAs as part of the Government&rsquo;s policy on inclusion was to provide the child with special needs a level playing field to give him or her a reasonable chance to keep up in mainstream classes.  I ask the Minister to indicate how this can happen in the absence of an SNA or without the provision of an adequate number of resource hours.  It is fine if he takes them away but other supports must be put in their place.  It is not fair to expect a teacher to cope alone.  Some teachers have three or four children with special needs in a mainstream classroom.  This will cause teachers to reach breaking point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke to staff in a few schools today.  I remember a teacher who came to see me a year ago from a school in Galway city.  He had a class of 30 pupils, six of whom had special educational needs, with one borderline case.  Three of the children had Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome; two had associated disorders; another had a speech and language disorder; two had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and one had borderline general learning difficulties, for which, as the Minister knows, there is no diagnosis.  The class in question had 1.5 SNAs and I asked the teacher how he managed.  I made a case for the appointment of an extra teacher, as did many others, but he did not receive one.  How did he manage with 23 children in the normal spectrum and a number with special educational needs?  He told me he had to split the class into two, each with 15 pupils.  Having added the resource hours, the principal found the class was due 26 hours.  He took a resource teacher away from resource teaching and made that teacher teach in the classroom.  This was creative work done which the school could not declare to the Department because if it had been so declared, the teacher would not have been able to manage.  Chances are, such a process would have been knocked on the head.  That is the process with which schools, teachers and kids are grappling.  I asked the teacher about the ongoing SNA review and he told me it was a hatchet job on our children.  The principal of another school said the same.  As far as she was concerned, it was all about numbers.  Cutting numbers seems to be the main concern in the review.  Special education needs organisers, SENOs, are wondering what can be cut.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In one school there is a child who runs away a lot.  It is a DEIS band 2 school, with 20 children in each class, a very good pupil-teacher ratio.  The eight year old in question regularly runs away from school such that if the teacher was to follow without an SNA in the classroom, the other 19 would be left unattended.  I grant that the case is unusual but when it was put to the SENO, the school was told to put more locks on the doors.  How about that for behaviour <Col N="103"/>modification?  A child in another school in Galway city climbs trees and walls and the solution of the SENO was to cut down the trees.  Will the Minister follow up on such advice from special education needs organisers?  It does not address the problem.  There is more concern for cutting numbers.  Many other speakers will say the same today.</P>
        <P>The biggest problem is that children&rsquo;s educational rights have been infringed.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and the Minister&rsquo;s Department, in particular, have not yet implemented the EPSEN Act.  Nothing is legally binding, despite the Act being in place since 2004.  The failure to implement it has maimed children in an educational sense because they have no rights in law.  When will the Act be implemented in full?  This morning I spoke with a staff member at the NCSE office and was told very little of the Act had been implemented, that major parts remained untouched.  The individual education plan, IEP, is not yet a legal requirement.  Until each child diagnosed with a special educational need has a legal right to an IEP, his or her rights remain unprotected.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s plan in that respect.  I was also told it was very difficult to allocate resource hours for children with multiple disabilities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have no problem in doing so.  Last year the Minister abolished 120 special needs classes, with over 500 children being placed in mainstream classes.  Some of these children even had to be toileted.  Some of the schools in question are now at risk of losing further SNAs and resource hours.</P>
        <P>I have learned that schools are finding it more difficult to get help from the NCSE because, unless needs are obviously extreme such as the need for toileting or a child has no speech, there are no appropriate supports available. I was given a clear example by a school principal.  He told me that children with speech and language difficulties may also have difficulties in the playground.  They may not be able to relate to those around them and may not understand the rules of the game.  If they do not have an SNA to help them understand the rules, children dump them and throw them out of the game because that is the way children are.</P>
        <P>We need to look very carefully at this review.  Has the Minister seen the report that is due out at the end of March?  What number of SNAs do we expect will be cut?  When will the Minister implement the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act in full?  When will he increase the number of psychologists available to schools?</P>

        <P>It is very wrong of the Minister to come to the House and accuse Senator Healy Eames of raising this issue for publicity reasons.  That is far from the truth.  She is raising this issue because these questions on special needs education are on everybody&rsquo;s lips, as the Minister well knows.  People are asking the question raised by my colleague.  If we are to have a policy of inclusion for children with special needs, why are the resources being rolled back?  How will these children survive in mainstream education if they do not have these supports?</P>
        <P>Everyone is aware of the economic situation and realises the pressure under which the Department finds itself.  However, the questions raised by the row-back on special needs education are immense.  They affect children and families throughout the country.  It is reasonable <Col N="104"/>for Senator Healy Eames to ask how children are going to cope in mainstream education, how diversity is managed and how language is to be managed if there are to be cutbacks.  She also asked how schools will be managed if there are cuts to SNAs.  How is the Minister planning to deal with this?  Will there be other supports?  She asked about the withdrawal of such supports and the impacts these will have on the overall quality of education.  She asked when the advice of the National Council for Special Education on the issue will be published and about the timeframe for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.</P>
        <P>She is not raising these questions for reasons of publicity.  These are real questions about the future of our education system and the future of mainstreaming children with special educational needs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>These people have had to fight really hard over a long period.  I already pointed out that there are cutbacks, and most of these parents are not looking for more resources at the moment.  They are trying to maintain what they have.  We have seen repeated examples of a row-back on special needs supports in schools.  The fact that 120 classes were cut last year adds to the worry of these parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have been told there will not be cutbacks in education following the Green Party renegotiation, yet we are seeing cutbacks against the most vulnerable.  Cutbacks are one thing, but there is an information problem and a lack of communication on the plans for special needs.  People are not clear about the policy being followed by the Government.  There is a need for more information and more communication, which may well be part of the problem.  If the Minister published the advice from the National Council for Special Education on special needs provision, perhaps that might clarify the situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A parent rang me the other day whose child with special needs had come home from school, asking why his school had been closed down and why he could not go out and play in the school yard anymore.  The truth is that there have been cuts in the number of special needs teachers.  The Department carried out a review of that school and stated that the work done there is very good.  Even though there has been a positive review of that school, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Special School in Tallaght, the staff complement is being cut by two thirds.  The number of teachers is being reduced from 16 to six and the number of special needs assistants is being reduced to five.  Parents and teachers are saying this will destroy the school, make it impossible for it to function at a basic level and make it impossible for the children with special needs to do the course work they have been doing with the ratio that has applied until now.   This story has been replicated throughout the country.  What will the Minister say to the parents of chil<Col N="105"/>dren in a school such as St. Joseph&rsquo;s which lost four staff this week, is due to lose another four and another four after that?</P>
        <P Just="Left">How are schools meant to cope with this abandonment?  Is the Minister going to implement the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act?  I appreciate there are resource problems.  I recognise that increased resources have been put into this area by the Government over the past ten years.  These resources were needed and they were invested, but I am focusing on what is happening.  What alternative supports will be given if SNAs are to be taken away?  If children with special needs continue to be integrated into mainstream education, as is the policy and as it should be, then how will the schools cope?  What is the process in place for parents to appeal decisions on SNA posts?</P>

	<P>Will there be an appeals system?  Can there be one?  Is the Minister open to listening to parents and teachers about the impacts of these cuts?</P>
        <P>I am delighted Senator Healy Eames has tabled this motion.  We want to reflect the questions being asked and we want to highlight the pressures on individuals and families and the potential deterioration in the progress of children who have special needs.  I do not deny that there are resource problems.  However, there are also resource problems if we do not implement the kind of programme we are talking about.  If we do not give these children the kind of supports they need, they will end up in residential care, not fulfilling their potential and being a much greater cost to the State than if we continue the kind of progressive regime that has been put in place over recent years and which needs to develop.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We had a debate two weeks ago on college places.  The media ran with many stories that every two students would be fighting for one college place.  We came to this Chamber and we got the facts that there was a ratio of 1.6:1.  When I was doing my leaving certificate, I applied to the CAO with no intention of going to college in this jurisdiction as I always intended to go to the North, but I had to cover my bases.  There is a real story in the statistics, but the real statistic of 1.6:1 is no different from the 6% increase in the number of people applying for college places the previous year and is in line with other trends.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I welcome the fact that the Fine Gael Party has tabled this motion in order that we can acknowledge the great work that has been done on special educational needs.  However, I must go back to the point from where we should start &mdash; facts.  The headlines last week caused great tension among people doing their leaving certificate.  If we do not put the facts in context, we will put pressure on families.  I was called to a meeting of the iCARE group.  It is an exceptionally hard working group that supports autistic children on the Inishowen Peninsula.  I attended a meeting on 15 February and it started with a claim that the group had to deal with these awful Government cutbacks before they touched it.  Donegal went through this process earlier than everyone else because we had a problem and an issue with the special education needs organiser.  The Department and the special education council had to intervene to look at how the SENO was carrying out evaluations.  As a result of the review, many of the SNAs were put back in place.</P>
     
        <P>I understand the pain of those involved in the process.  What we never had, we never miss, but when we have had something, we do miss it.  It is important the Minister has the opportunity to put the facts straight, that there are no cuts, that schools are being looked at if they were assigned an SNA for a child who has moved on out of school, meaning the SNA is no longer assigned to the original pupil.</P>
        <P>I agree that we move on beyond that to look at the children who are left behind to see what their care needs are and to ensure there is support for them.  The Government is committed to SNAs and special needs and there are issues we should be debating rationally.</P><Col N="107"/>
        <P>I taught in Derry and had pupils with not just care needs but educational needs and people were in the room with me teaching.  I always found it great to have a person assigned to a weaker student.  There would be three students in front, three behind and two on either side of the care assistant, who was really an educational needs assistant.  This was not just one person being helped, it was a cycle of people.  While we are dealing with care needs, that issue of educational needs arose.  Not only were six or seven people kept in tune in the classroom, it was a happier classroom because if six or seven people do not understand what the teacher is doing while he or she is trying to teach more than 30 students, those who cannot keep up will play up, leading to a more difficult class.</P>
        <P>The Minister has categorically stated that the scheme has not been changed and the criteria for allocating SNAs remain the same.  There are people with children who have toileting needs, dyspraxia and who are a danger to themselves, as Senator Healy Eames mentioned.  There is a sense that many of these children will grow out of it or that they can be trained.  I want to ensure the child with toileting needs, dyspraxia, a physical disability or who is a danger to himself is not expected to grow out of that without reference to the particular circumstances.  A child with autism or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome will not grow out of it.  When the Minister says the criteria have not been changed for SNA allocations, I assume that means that anyone with a need will have it met.</P>
        <P>The move to incorporate the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, is very important.  Links between health and education cannot be overstated.  A teacher said to me recently that for a child who does not keep up in the classroom, either with a care need or an education need, knowing that they are unable to keep up has a mental health effect.  The link between the two Departments is vital.  The Department of Transport should also be involved, unless school transport is already covered by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>People are terrified by what they read in the national press.  That is why it is important to debate this and state the facts.  We must look at a panel for the SNAs who are moved from a school because the children have moved on.  In my area, SNAs would love the security of a place on a panel.  They have built up a lot of experience and they deserve that support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree that there should be greater communication between the NCSE and parents.  The special education needs organiser will come in and look at the child in the classroom.  The child will be on his or her best behaviour for the duration of the stranger&rsquo;s visit.  As soon as he is gone, the child will be swinging off the back of the chair.  The manner the SENO comes in and how long he spends in the classroom is an issue.  There is a feeling that they are trying to trip the SNAs up when they talk to them instead of trying to get information from them.  It has become an interview process.</P>
        <P>The National Council on Special Education should be the guardians of special needs children.  We should do all we can to ensure that is what it does.  In future, the concept of a health check at two and a half for every child would mean resources could be allocated from then on.  The child who shows symptoms at two and a half may later be the child with autism or dyspraxia.  To be able to plan ahead is important.</P>
        <P>The Minister is doing a lot of good work and his heart is in the special needs area and will continue to be so.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and congratulate Fine Gael for tabling it.  I also welcome the Minister.  We have soldiered for many years in various fora, both for and against each other.</P><Col N="108"/>
        <P>I stress to my colleagues on the Government side, particularly the new Green Party Members, that while the Government is always presented as speaking with one voice, it does not mean there are not different views within the Government.  I suspect the Minister would seriously welcome the Green Party using its leverage to secure more for education.  The current Minister would have no difficulty with such an approach.</P>

	<P>It is about strategy and getting a result.  That is what should be done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Much has been said about SENOs that I would like to go into.  They are not the ones who do the assessments and there are problems arising from the involvement of SENOs in many cases.  I spoke on every section of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and dealt with every part of it.  When it was passed, I went around the country, at my own expense, to discuss and explain it.  It is a serious disappointment that it has not been moved on to the extent it should.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am, however, a practical man and I recognise there are financial problems.  We should come out straight and admit the money does not exist to fulfil the implementation and commencement of the sections of that Act as we would all want but we should also assign a budget in order that we can sit down and identify the priorities.  There was mention of some priorities in the Government amendment.  That would be a helpful process.  Those of us who have been raising this issue would like to see it happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act was going through, I had been dealing with special educational needs for 40 years, working at it from all sides.  If the Minister had asked 20 years ago for a paper outlining what I wanted to see in special education provision, the Act would cover it, that is how good it is written.  The problem, however, is that unfortunately it is not operational.  The Minister should recognise that.  Although we all fought for rights-based education needs, and although it is correct to say the Act is not rights-based, it is as close as makes no different to that.  A child might have a problem that is found by a teacher or parents.  The child is then, through the school principal, sent for assessment.  As written in the Act, the assessment must come back within a certain timeframe.</P>
        <P>What is equally good about the Act, in the context of the way it is written, is the way in which the terms of the assessment are set out.  There are major difficulties in this regard.  People want to know what is being assessed and what should be the nature of the response of the assessor and the educational psychologist.  All of this is supposed to be determined but it has not yet proved to be the case.  Therefore, the process falls down at the first hurdle.</P>
        <P>Every aspect of the EPSEN Act is subject to appeal.  Parents can appeal against the assessment or state they do not want their children to be assessed in the first instance.  Teachers and principals are also in a position to do the same.  There are all sorts of appeal structures built into the Act, which is extremely democratic in that regard.</P>
        <P>Following the assessment, the needs of the child are outlined in an independent educational plan.  The resources attaching to the plan and the way in which it should be delivered are then decided upon.  The plan may be drawn up by the teacher, the principal or, on some rare occasions, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  It is then put in place and assessed on a regular basis with the total co-operation and involvement of teaching staff.  It may require the provision of an SNA in the classroom, etc.  I will not discuss the detail in this regard because I do not have time to do so.</P><Col N="109"/>
        <P>At the end of the year the final assessment of the plan is carried out, mainly by the class teacher.  He or she will assess whether the child has made progress.  The Government amendment refers to measurable progress in this regard.  If the plan is not working, those involved with its implementation will recognise that fact and state there is a need for a new plan or the provision of a different set of resources.  It will usually be stated the plan put together with the involvement of a certain teacher, an educational psychologist, the principal and a child&rsquo;s parents does not meet the needs of the child and that special support is required from the NCSE.  That is how it works and it is a simple outline of how the system is meant to operate.</P>
        <P>A decision is required in respect of every step of the process I have outlined.  If a teacher, even one with X number of years&rsquo; experience, is asked to produce an individual educational plan, he or she must receive some training in respect of the approach that needs to be taken, the issues that must be considered, how the plan should be put in place and the boxes which must be ticked.  In such circumstances, there is a need to put a training programme in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor asked the NCSE to produce a report on the implementation of the EPSEN Act.  It is a credit to the NCSE that it produced what I consider to be the best report ever carried out on the implementation of a measure relating to education.  The report contains 42 action points and lists the name of the body or person responsible for their implementation and the relevant date for completion of said implementation.  We are way behind as regards implementation of the Act.  I do not want to make political capital out of this; I merely want to progress the issue.  The level of implementation is way behind because the necessary resources are not being invested.  That is the case because there is a lack of resources within the State.  I will not argue the point with the Minister in that regard.  I will, however, do so on another occasion.  The report also provides details of the costs involved with regard to implementation and outlines the amount of money that will be required.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to recognise that the important parts of the Act have not been commenced.  It will not be difficult for him to do so.  I also request that he force us to recognise that he does not have access to the level of resources required.  He should then indicate the resources that will be invested, outline how progress will be made and state the areas to which priority will be given.  He can then state it is not possible to do more than this.  When he does so, I will be the first to criticise him and argue that what is being provided is not enough.  That is my job.  It is his to provide a counter-argument.  Ultimately, this will not drive us apart because we know the route we must take.</P>
        <P>The NCSE&rsquo;s extraordinary report on implementation of the EPSEN Act outlines the way forward on a step-by-step, euro-by-euro, month-by-month basis.  If parents were able to see the road ahead, it would be similar to what they can see in respect of schools building projects.  Even though the resources might not be available, if they could be sure they will be provided next year, for example, they would be much calmer.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to take on board some of the points I have made.  I ask our fresh, new colleagues from the Green Party who are extremely interested in this issue to begin to exert pressure in respect of this matter.  The Deputy from Lucan should again be let loose in respect of it.  He and the Minister for Education and Science interact well with each other.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government recognised many years ago that education for children with special educational needs could only be delivered through consistent and ongoing multi-annual investment in teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, assistive technology, specialist equipment, adapted school buildings and special school transport arrangements.  We have also recognised the professionals who teach children with special educational needs may need guidance and support.  They certainly require training and professional guidance.</P>
        <P>We have done more than merely recognise these challenges.  In the past ten years the Government has prioritised investment and delivered a full range of supports for schools and students.  We now spend over &euro;1 billion in this area of education alone.  That figure represents one ninth of my Department&rsquo;s entire budget.  There are over 8,600 resource and learning support teachers and over 10,000 SNAs in our schools.  In conjunction with the teachers in special schools and special classes, there are over 20,000 adults supporting children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>In addition to teachers and SNAs, we have provided and will continue to provide assistive technology, specialist equipment, adapted school buildings and special school transport arrangements.  Resources must be targeted at those children who require them.  If resources are left in areas within the school system that are not in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s criteria, this means that such resources are not available for other deserving areas.</P>
        <P>The Senators opposite made reference to the withdrawal of SNA support in schools.  I will be crystal clear on this point because I want to emphasise what is really important.  The SNA scheme has been a major factor in ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support for pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.  The scheme will continue to be supported.  The terms and criteria for the scheme have not changed.  Schools which have enrolled children who qualify for support from an SNA will continue to be allocated such support.  This is happening.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been processing applications from schools for SNA support all year and this will continue to be the case.</P>
        <P>Where the criteria are met, SNA posts are being allocated.  There is no question of posts being removed from schools which meet the criteria for the scheme.  However, there is also no question of posts remaining in schools indefinitely, particularly in circumstances where they are deemed to be surplus to the care needs of pupils or where the relevant pupils have left.  I am confident that the criteria governing the allocation of teaching and care supports enable schools to provide for children with special educational needs in both mainstream and special school settings.  Senators will be aware that my Department requested the NCSE to review all SNA posts in schools.  It had become clear that a number of SNA posts remained in a number of schools where the care needs of the pupils in these schools did not justify such an allocation.  In some circumstances, the relevant pupil had moved on but the SNA remained in the school.  My concern must be to ensure there is a consistent application of policy in the allocation of special needs supports.  That is all that is happening.</P><Col N="111"/>
        <P>As Senators are aware, the purpose of SNAs is to support the care needs of children with disabilities, not to create dependency.  Therefore, a child with a disability coming into junior infants at the age of four or five years will be different from one in fourth or fifth class aged ten or 11 years.  He or she will be extremely different from an 18 year old leaving school.  Many children with disabilities develop independent living skills as they grow and mature.</P>
        <P>I fully recognise that some children with disabilities will always need support in school.  However, are Senators really asking the NCSE to leave SNA posts in schools where the children for whom the posts were allocated have left?  Are they asking the NCSE to leave SNA posts in schools where the children&rsquo;s care needs have diminished?  All that is being done at present is to remove posts where children have left or their care needs have diminished.  I want to emphasise that we want, with the SNAs, to develop those children towards independent living.  It is fair to ask whether that is what any parent would wish for their special needs child.  Let me repeat that the scheme and the criteria for support have not changed.  In line with previous years, the NCSE will continue to allocate SNA posts this year to schools which have enrolled pupils who meet the criteria.</P>
        <P>Special education is a priority for the Government.  Despite the ongoing economic difficulties, and in spite of competing demands for funding, the renewed programme for Government announced in October 2009 commits to further investment in the development of services for pupils with special educational needs.  This is a significant achievement at a time of reduced public spending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The renewed programme commits to the expansion of the number of psychologists employed directly by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, to 210.  Ultimately, this will allow for the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to every primary and post-primary school in the country with particular emphasis on special needs units, classes and special schools.  There are 157 psychologists employed within the service, which is an increase of 30, from 127 psychologists at the start of the current Government&rsquo;s programme.  In the meantime, the Government continues to ensure that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the assigned NEPS psychologist or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments that is administered by NEPS and which supports the cost of assessments provided by a panel of private practitioners.</P>
        <P>In addition, and I emphasise this point, the level of training available to teachers has improved significantly and this will continue to be built on.  The establishment of the special education support service to provide expert support, professional development and training opportunities in special education for school staff has been very significant.  Senators suggested that not enough teachers are being trained.  Last year alone, 23,602 teachers availed of training places; that is nearly half the teachers in the country.  This training is designed to ensure a quality teaching service in our schools, one that promotes inclusiveness, collaboration, and equality of access for students with special educational needs to educational opportunities.  In addition, more than 300 teachers availed of places on postgraduate teacher training programmes related to special educational needs.</P>
        <P>My Department is also enhancing the capacity of the National Council for Special Education to co-ordinate the provision of services to children with special educational needs.  In the past year, the National Council for Special Education appointed 12 senior special educational needs organisers, SENOs, to co-ordinate the work of the locally based SENOs.  Sanction has also been given to recruit further SENOs to improve the service the NCSE provides to schools and parents.</P>
        <P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act was mentioned by a number of speakers and I want to outline the Government&rsquo;s commitment to its implemen<Col N="112"/>tation.  A significant number of sections of the EPSEN Act have been commenced, principally those establishing the NCSE and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.  The Government is committed to the full implementation of the EPSEN Act at the earliest possible date.  In the interim, we are committed to developing a costed multi-annual plan, for which Senator O&rsquo;Toole called, to implement priority aspects of the EPSEN Act.  We will focus on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs.  This process will require consultation with the education partners as well as the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully aware of the need to co-ordinate disability services for children across both departmental and agency lines.  For the first time, the Government has established an office, headed by a Minister of State, which has specific responsibility for disability and mental health.  An integrated approach has been adopted by the education and health sectors under the auspices of a cross-sectoral team to target additional resources to areas of greatest need.  This co-ordinated approach will ensure delivery of the most effective response for children living with disability and special educational needs on a daily basis.  The HSE will continue to work with funded specialist providers and in co-operation with the education sector to address the health-related needs of children with special educational needs in the context of the resources available.  Progress is being kept under review by the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and the cross-sectoral team.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note that Senator Healy Eames referred to my decision to suppress a number of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability last year.  Senators are aware that, as with all teaching posts, allocations are made in line with pupil numbers.  The decision to close a number of special classes was taken on the basis that enrolment numbers were insufficient to retain the special class teacher.  However, I remind the Seanad that the Department did consider and review all appeals of this decision by schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fact that only 49 of the 119 schools lodged an appeal is telling in itself.  Some schools advised that as some of the pupils enrolled in these special classes did not have mild general learning disabilities but had other disabilities, they were inappropriately placed; three classes were retained and redesignated for the new category of disability; and 11 classes were retained on appeal.  In other situations, my Department advised the schools to contact the NCSE to apply for additional resource teaching hours where this was appropriate.</P>
        <P>Senators are aware that the remaining pupils have access to the additional learning support or resource teaching service already in place in all primary schools and which is provided through the general allocation model of resource teaching support.  However, let me state again that at a time of constrained resources we must ensure public resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  Resources left in areas within the school system that are not in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s criteria mean that these resources are not available for another deserving area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators made reference to my apparent failure to publish advice from the NCSE on special needs provision.  I assume they are referring to recent research relating to the role of special schools and special classes which was funded by the NCSE.  The NCSE has not as yet sent me a copy of this research.  I understand that the NCSE expects to be in a position to send me a copy of the research in the near future.  I am pleased to advise the Seanad that the NCSE fully intends to publish this research on its website and is working with publishers on this matter.</P>
        <P>The Seanad may wish to know that, while the NCSE has provided funding, responsibility for the contents of the research, including any errors or omissions, remains with the authors.  The <Col N="113"/>NCSE has clearly stated that the views and opinions contained in such reports are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the council.  The Seanad will appreciate that I am not in a position to publish research I do not have but I am pleased that the NCSE will shortly publish this research on its website.  This research will be one of many strands of evidence the NCSE will consider when formulating its advice to me on the future roles for special schools and special classes.  I expect that once received, advice from the NCSE will assist the Department with policy formulation in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I express my support for special schools and special classes and my belief that they will continue to have a significant role in the education of pupils with special educational needs. I am anxious to examine the ways in which special schools can co-operate with mainstream primary and post-primary schools to provide enhanced services for pupils with special educational needs and their parents. </P>

	<P Just="Left">The renewed programme for Government makes a commitment to avoid increasing the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools over the lifetime of the Government and provides for 500 teaching posts in the next three years over and above additional posts that will arise due to demographic increases.  I am pleased to advise Senators that 100 of these posts are being used to improve the learning support service in post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s investment in special needs provision speaks for itself.  It has transformed the ability of schools to provide for all children.  This investment will continue to be made because the Government is committed to ensuring that as many children as possible can receive an appropriate education in their own communities and alongside their peers.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities places a strong obligation on governments to provide inclusive education for all learners.  It requires states to ensure that persons with disabilities are not excluded from the general education system on the basis of disability and can access inclusive, quality and free primary and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the communities in which they live.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has ensured that additional supports for children with special educational needs are put in place in schools all over the country.  Our policies and levels of investment have delivered additional teachers, special needs assistants, specialist equipment, assistive technology for children with special needs and specially adapted schools.  Children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, will continue to allocate teaching and special needs assistant resources to help schools support pupils with special educational needs.  I am proud of these achievements.</P>
        <P>In a period of just over ten years, the Government has driven a complete transformation in educational policy for children with special educational needs.  Whereas ten years ago most parents of children with significant special education or care needs had no choice but to send them to a special school, three distinct choices are now available.  Their children can choose between attending mainstream classes in their local schools with additional supports as required, a special class in a mainstream school or a special school.  Clearly, the needs of students can change as they mature.  The system now in place provides a continuum of education and options to enable students to move from one setting to another in line with their changing needs.</P>
        <P>I had the pleasure at a recent conference to meet a young girl who had special educational needs but is now living independently and studying for her master&rsquo;s degree in NUIG.  I <Col N="114"/>appointed her to the national body in order that her voice could inform future policy because I believe she can make a significant contribution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will continue to prioritise investment and ensure that additional teaching and care supports are provided in order that schools can welcome pupils with special educational needs.  We will continue to expand the educational psychological service in order that every school in the country has a direct service.  We will work with the NCSE to ensure that services for children with special educational needs are provided in a co-ordinated and effective manner.  We will fund the provision of expert support, professional development and training opportunities in education for all school staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask Senator Healy Eames whether she really believes that a child who is developing independence and confidence should continue to receive support he or she does not need.  Might that inhibit the child&rsquo;s further development?  It may not challenge him or her to learn to live independently in later life.  Support is aimed at enabling people with special needs to develop their independence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a parent, I completely understand the concerns of parents of children with special needs.  My niece had special needs along the way.  Everyone wants what is best for his or her child.  This is understandably an emotive issue and one which we have to be sensitive in addressing.  That is why I find it difficult to understand why Senator Healy Eames and the other Fine Gael Senators who support the motion would use parents and their children as a political football.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The most disappointing aspect of the recent budget in the area of education was the lack of progress on the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  I think this is scandalous, and the Disability Federation of Ireland agrees.  In its special budget 2010 newsletter, that organisation stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department of Education and Science decision to reduce the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) budget by &euro;2.3 million (21% of budget) targets special education needs and demonstrates yet again the lack of commitment to implementing the EPSEN Act 2004</P><Col N="115"/>
        <P LI="1">DFI believe that children with disabilities have already been unfairly targeted by the closure of 128 special classes in 2009.  This decision disproportionately affected some of the most vulnerable children in our society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The 2004 Act deals with children who have special educational needs.  It aims to enhance the rights of children with disabilities to avail of and benefit from an appropriate education.  The Act provides for a range of services which must be provided within a certain timeframe and, most importantly, in constant consultation with the student and his or her parents or guardians.  Such services include assessments, individual education plans and supports and a process of mediation and appeals where needs are not met.  Individual education plans allow for appropriately focused education supports to be put in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Children with special needs may regress significantly if intervention is not made from an early stage.  The Act is progressive in giving children with special needs the right to attend mainstream schools with appropriate supports.  The implementation of the Act is eagerly awaited by parents, advocates and everyone working in the area of disability.  What is the point of enacting legislation and creating an expectation if it is not implemented?</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education, which was set up by the Act, drew up a plan for implementation which was sent to the Department of Education and Science in 2006.  The plan outlined the resources needed and set out a timetable for all sections of the Act to be completed by 2010.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government told us that the Act would be completely rolled out.  The revised programme for Government states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We are committed to the implementation of the Education for People with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act.  To achieve this we will develop, in consultation with stakeholders, a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of EPSEN focussing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I do not see any reason for hope in this statement.  Are the programmes committed to implementing the Act or merely priority aspects of it?  Not only is the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act not being progressed, class sizes have got bigger as well.  We all, including the Government, know that bigger class sizes are bad for children, but especially so for children with special needs because they get less of the one-to-one attention they so badly need.</P>
        <P>What is the reality on the ground for parents of children with special needs?  The feedback from parents and advocates is that they are finding it very difficult to keep their children in education.  We hear that children are being put on restricted days.  They are being removed from the classroom and put sitting at a desk in a hallway, sometimes being monitored by an SNA and sometimes being left on their own.  Those children are typically under ten years of age.  Children are being put behind partitions in classrooms.  They are being expelled from schools for behavioural issues.  Children have to share an SNA even though they have been sanctioned a full-time SNA by the SENO.  In some cases children are not given an SNA although one has been sanctioned.  There are insufficient or no school places for children with autism in many areas, including part of my area, Balbriggan.  Children as young as four years of age are travelling on buses to schools for children with autism for over an hour in the morning and again after school.  Parents are being asked to remove their children from schools for a number of weeks.  Where stand the rights of those children and their parents?</P><Col N="116"/>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is the statutory body established under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special education needs.  One of its main functions is to deliver a local service through a national network of special education needs organisers, SENOs, who interact with parents and schools and liaise with the HSE in providing resources to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE&rsquo;s budget has been cut by 21%.  Where is the commitment in that to special education?  Hundreds of SNAs have been let go and it is expected that approximately 1,200 will be let go by the end of March.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs are being abandoned by the Government.  Children with physical and emotional problems are being left to fend for themselves.  The NCSE review, which began last April, and is due to complete its work by the end of March, is not focusing on educational needs.  The focus is on physical care needs without consideration of the effect on pupils or their classmates of the loss of SNA support.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, stated that he does not regard the reduction in SNA numbers as cuts but merely the removal of inappropriately employed people from the system.  What utter nonsense.  The recruitment of all of those people was approved by the Department of Education and Science in the first place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The needs of those pupils do not diminish, as the Minister put it.  He also argued that because parents have been given adequate notice that it is somehow okay.  An bord snip nua recommended last summer that 2,000 SNA posts be cut to save &euro;60 million a year.  The Minister, in following that advice almost to the letter, is behaving as an accountant might do rather than as the Minister for Education and Science that he is who should primarily consider the associated negative educational outcomes and impacts.  What is going on is totally unacceptable.  Shame on the Minister.  Shame on the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Healy Eames.  It is one of the most crucial debates we have had in this House in a long time.  It is vital that we look after those in society who have the greatest difficulty.  I have a son in a special needs, ABA, school.  It is crucial we consider educational needs from the point of view of the child.  It is the child who must come first.</P>
        <P>It must be acknowledged that we have made progress in this country in recent years.  In 1997 we had as few as 300 SNAs in this country.  It is unfortunate for speakers in a debate simply to focus on the number of a particular type of staff allocated to an area at any given time.  Special needs require to be considered in a holistic way.  Special needs cannot be considered purely from the point of view of education because health is a factor also.  The presence of the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, disability issues and mental health which involve the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children is helpful.  It is important we use joined-up thinking on this issue.</P>
        <P>All parties need to work together to progress matters in tandem with the community and parents and carers.  I pay tribute to carers, especially parents of children with special educational needs.  Prior to the 2002 general election in which I was involved, I attended a huge meeting in Galway of the Galway Alliance of Parents &amp; Carers.  One does not often hear of politicians being moved genuinely to tears but the stories we heard on that night moved politicians from all parties to tears.  It was a difficult meeting.  Senator Healy Eames was at that meeting.  I am sure she would agree it was a most harrowing meeting to attend.  We need to acknowledge that things have moved on since then.</P>
        <P>I very much believe in a rights-based approach to special needs but I accept that the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act is largely getting there.  The Act, which was put in place in 2004, is fantastic.  It is a bible of best practice and what we have to move towards in terms of special educational needs.  In these difficult economic times we could consider a community-based approach.  We should examine how we can involve the community and parents.  Schools could take interesting initiatives in terms of employing speech therapists and occupational therapists.  Unfortunately, a number of people qualified in those areas are on the dole at the moment.  That is not acceptable because some people cannot access proper speech therapy or occupational therapy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Or music therapy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Music therapy was also mentioned.  There are many other types of therapy and I am just giving those as examples.  We need to consider programmes whereby we can allow people who wish to help children to do so because there is a need.  Many parents, including me in the past, have struggled enormously to get the basic services.</P>
        <P>Early intervention was mentioned in the context of individual education programmes.  That is crucial in the special educational needs area, especially for autism.  There has been improvement in that respect but there is a way to go in terms of early intervention.  We need to ensure it is not just those who can afford it that get early intervention.  Unfortunately, many people choose to go private in terms of getting their children assessed.  We need to up our game in that regard.  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act provides the framework for doing that.  I pay tribute to the Irish Autism Action group in particular.  It is a tremendous group of parent advocates.  The parent-based approach has done much to move things along in this country.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to compare the situation here with that in Germany.  A total of 60% of children with special needs are educated in ordinary schools in this country but in Germany only 16% of such children are educated in ordinary schools.  There are different approaches to <Col N="118"/>this area.  The crucial thing with special needs is to accept that each child is an individual and that each child is special.  The definition of such a child is he or she is special and he or she has particular needs.  It is not the case that one size fits all.  Options need to be provided for parents.  For example, ABA does not suit every child but it suits many children.  ABA is not necessarily appropriate for children for the duration of their lives but it can improve the abilities of a child in order that he or she can be mainstreamed.  It is important to adopt a programme that can examine all these actions.</P>
        <P>If early intervention is ensured and the problems are diagnosed at an early stage, it will help us to save a great deal of money in the long run and to help children.  We have got to move in this direction.  The EPSEN Act must be implemented fully.  It is not simply a party political issue.  This issue affects all of us and it is a measure of how we should judge ourselves as a society.  I welcome the motion but, at the same time, the Government amendment is clear and realistic about the current position.  It contains many good points but we need to move together on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I acknowledge the 73% increase in the number of SNAs between 2003 and 2008 who were employed in post-primary, primary and special schools.  That is an impressive investment but prior to 2003 there had been no investment and the Minister cannot take this wonderful quality service that they have become used to and need from our schools and children.  It is not logical.</P>
        <P>If a child has a significant disability or behavioural problem, he or she qualifies for an SNA.  The Minister referred to children outgrowing their need for an assistant but an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday referred to a child with a medical need.  Her skin blisters on contact and she needs an SNA to help her stand up, sit down, reach for her pencil and so on.  She needs care 24-7 and it is a little disingenuous of the Minister to say children can outgrow their SNA.  The mother of the child in the article stated she would not apply for an SNA if the child did not need one.  There is not a parent in the world who would want this for his or her child.  Every parent wants his or her children to function independently and the Minister was insensitive about diminished requirement.  He referred to &ldquo;surplus posts which do not meet the current criteria&rdquo;.  That is a broad statement and when one is dealing with children who need to be toileted and fed, it is insensitive.</P>
        <P>The article also reports on a principal teacher in Newbridge who described how SENOs go into a classroom and spend half an hour watching a child before saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; all the time.  It is my experience following representations that I have made that they say &ldquo;No&rdquo; all the time.  The child on behalf of whom I made representations was delayed entering second level because the SENO did not believe the child needed an SNA in the secondary school, which is an outrage.  The principal in Newbridge stated he has to obtain expert opinions on a child from doctors, psychologists and occupational therapists and then the SENO comes into the classroom and observes the child for half an hour before saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That completely diminishes the authority and professionalism of all the other experts and that must be discussed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The INTO general secretary, Sheila Nunan, has raised another issue.  I commended the Minister regarding the increase in the number of SNAs but the INTO is concerned about the reduction in numbers this year.  The union says the inclusion of special needs children in schools requires adequate staffing to meet both the education and care needs of the children.  One teacher said the children will lose out because the SNA hours have been reduced or the children may have lost their SNA.  The other 28 children in the classroom will also lose out because the teacher will be unable to teach the full curriculum because he or she will have to look after the child who is unable to stay quiet in the classroom or bring a child to the toilet who is unable <Col N="119"/>to go to the toilet unaccompanied.  A total of 1,000 SNAs will be axed and parents are nervous and anxious because of that.  I have been approached by them.  The Minister said he will continue with the review, which will be completed at the end of March, and he maintains that any child who needs an SNA will get one.  If so, why are their positions being axed?  I accept if a child has moved on, the SNA should stay with him or her but if a school has 200 pupils, I do not accept that no child will have special educational needs.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I refer to the NEPS.  I welcome the increase to 210 in the number of psychologists employed but that has not been my experience as a member of several boards of management.  The assessment of a child is based on the enrolment of the school in a particular year and the waiting lists are so long that children do not undergo a psychological assessment.  That is a dramatic statement and I may be accused of being fanatical and of raising anxiety levels but that is the reality.  I welcome the increase in the number of psychologists from 127 at the start of the current year but I am not reassured that will address the waiting lists.  They are so long that children will still not be assessed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The review is being use for a cull.  Schools are living in trepidation.  One principal described herself as scavenging for hours for children in her care.  I appreciated the comment by Senator Keaveney when she asked that the Department should act as guardian angel to our children.  This is how our children should be cherished, especially those with special needs.  I commend Senator Healy Eames on her forthright and honest motion and the manner in which she has conducted herself.  I resent the personal attack on my colleague which I consider to be an outrage.</P></Speaker>

        <P>I am delighted this motion has been tabled as it affords a great opportunity to try to put to bed some of the misinformation that has been circulating in communities throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I also have an educational background.  In common with everyone else in this Chamber, I do not have a monopoly of what constitutes right and wrong but I will do my best to reflect the views as honestly as I can.  In addition, I also have concerns in this regard and understand the concerns of parents who have a child who requires special needs attention.  I used to assess children who were making the transition from primary to second level schools.  In respect of psychological assessments, we would have in place a chief psychologist, a remedial teacher, a career guidance counsellor, a resource teacher, a special needs person and the parents.  That group would decide clearly &mdash; it never became political &mdash; that if the child in question needed special attention, he or she would receive it.  I will never see, under any Government, a child with special needs being deprived at any time.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to read the last line of the Minister&rsquo;s speech and will repeat it:</P>
        <P LI="1">Let me finish by stating a fact, something the Senator&rsquo;s statements are all too often lacking.  Any child who needs a special needs assistant ... will get [a special needs assistant].</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I will let the case rest on that statement.  I would welcome a review as any new concept that has been taken on board should be reviewed.  The EPSEN Act was introduced in 2004 and I identify with the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole about the desirability of having a step-by-step procedure.  The way forward is to ensure that no special education needs organiser, SENO, will decide that a child does not require a special needs assistant.  That <Col N="120"/>is a group decision by the school, which is able to make such a decision.  The point is that one does not want special needs assistants to be in the building in cases where the child might have left the school and gone elsewhere.  The aim is to integrate the child into the mainstream as far as possible and that should be the special needs assistant&rsquo;s aim.  It is to be welcomed when a special needs assistant can do this and can try to provide independence for the child.  Moreover, it is important to note that this scheme still is in place and the criteria for the allocation of special needs assistants remain the same.  When a pupil qualifies for support, special needs assistant posts will continue.  There is no question of the special needs assistant post being removed from schools that meet the scheme&rsquo;s criteria.  Any child who needs a special needs assistant will get one.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Senator knows this as well as I do.  The Government has made efforts whereby 23,000 teachers were brought on an in-service course to be trained as resource teachers to help out in this area.  That initiative was only last year and is a huge move.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>That is huge but they are not resource teachers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should acknowledge that something is taking place.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge there was a lack of consultation.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who is present, represents the health aspects of this issue and there must be greater consultation that must start very early on.  Early intervention often comes from the health rather than the education sector because public health nurses are the first people who ascertain what is wrong with a child.  A system should be developed with the Department of Health and Children whereby the Department of Education and Science will come into play when a child is four years of age.  I am not convinced that such early intervention is working well as yet.  The Minister of State should bear in mind that a better cross-departmental approach is required on this issue that encompasses the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not want any child to be deprived and the Minister also has stated this.  The people in the Visitors Gallery who are listening may rest assured that any child who needs a special needs assistant will get one.  The bottom line is that my concern is for the child.  Such a child should have access to equal opportunities in all walks of life and I believe the communities and schools should come into play in this regard.  The school and the community should work together with parents and teachers.  The approach should be developed to have a community spirit whereby the child can be integrated both into mainstream education and the community <Col N="121"/>in order that he or she will grow in a natural way with the other development needs of other children in the area.  In this way, they will rise through the peer pressure of their own age group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I reassure the House that special needs assistance will remain for those who need it.  The present position concerns cases in which a child has moved on or where the school considers that a child does not need special assistance and has a sufficient number of trained teachers.  Moreover, this is the manner in which I wish to proceed.  I was satisfied with the Minister&rsquo;s speech this evening and I am glad he put an end to the misinformation that was extant.  It is to be hoped that as the EPSEN Act is further developed, such children will get the proper education they need, that they will be integrated and that the supports will be in place in the special schools and for those who need them.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">First, I wish to place this in a context.  At the outset of this economic crisis, I warned that the Government was completely wrong to dismantle every agency that spoke out on behalf of the vulnerable.  It did so and this kind of thing is the result.  However, I do not believe that all virtue or human feeling resides in this House and I know my former colleague from this House, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to be a decent and caring man.  This does not mean the policies always are decent or caring because they may in fact not be.  Regardless of what one might think, the loss of 1,200 special needs assistants is a quite extraordinary cull and must be explained.  It appears as though there has been an attempt to explain this in economic terms, which can be highly problematic because these are the most vulnerable people and I do not believe the full case has been made.</P>
        <P>I wish to say something in particular about St. Joseph&rsquo;s school, Balrothery, at which there has been a quite extraordinary and devastating reduction of 66%.  In his contribution, the Minister asked an extraordinary question of Senator Healy Eames.  He asked Senator Healy Eames:</P>
        <P LI="1">whether she really believes that a child who is developing independence and confidence should continue to receive support he or she does not need.  Might that inhibit the child&rsquo;s further development?</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That was a most extraordinary phrase, at which I turned round and looked at some of the parents and teachers from St. Joseph&rsquo;s school, Balrothery, in the Visitors Gallery.  If the Minister is good at reading body language, he will have read the answer.  It was a grotesque question as of course the children need it.  I was very glad that Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It would not bother me in the slightest.  I have had a lot worse said to me, I can assure the Cathaoirleach.  I am not so thin skinned.  I acknowledge the fact that people on the Government side of the House are raw because there is pressure.  This is a difficult time, difficult decisions must be taken and so on, but I like the fact that Senator Ormonde stated she will not stand over a situation in which special needs assistants, SNAs, are withdrawn from where they are needed.  If one asks the parents, teachers and professionals whether SNAs are needed, they will tell one.  It should not just be the people who are sent in by various Departments, as it depends on their expertise.  They might be sent in to take part in the cull.</P>
        <P>This is a serious situation and it was heartening that Senators O&rsquo;Toole and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in appeared to be moving towards a common ground in trying to assert pressure in support of the Minister.  Many of these moves come from the Department of Finance.  That is its remit.  However, we should all stand over a situation in which people are not forced out of their work.</P>
        <P>Had the motion been worded slightly differently and the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; not been included, accommodating it would have been easier for the Government.  It is not always helpful to discuss failure.  The motion calls on the Minister to publish the National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s advice on this issue.  Points that must be considered are that he has indicated the advice is in the process of publication independently of him and that he does not have it.  This was a reasonable comment to make and I was glad to be able to hear it.  He was then asked to provide a timeline&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing time with me on what I realise is an important subject.  I will try not to repeat any of the points that have already been made, but I want to share some of my experiences.</P>
        <P>I was contacted by a lady who had one child and was due a second.  Her first child, who was in school, was aged five years and a diabetic who was severely dependent on insulin.  The child needed insulin four times or more often per day.  The mother was going to have a planned Caesarean section because the nature of her condition required it.  In good time, we asked for an SNA to be allocated to her child because she was going to the school to administer the insulin each time a dose was required.  An SNA with specialist training was required in that instance, but I was often told that no SNA could be allocated and that the mother would have to go to the school.  As everyone knows, however, one is not covered by insurance for up to six weeks after an operation.  A dilemma was posed when the woman was asked to take her child out of the school.  Sense prevailed and we managed to get the child an SNA, but the situation was emotive and upsetting for the mother.  This was a case of a child with a different type of special need than someone on, for example, the autistic spectrum.</P>
        <P>I want to discuss SNAs I have met in Cahir, Cashel, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir in south County Tipperary who were asked questions by officials from the Department of Education and Science.  The officials told the SNAs that they were not interested in the cognitive abilities of the children with special needs in respect of whom the SNAs were in charge.  Instead, the SNAs were asked whether the children would harm themselves or others were they not present.  The SNAs needed to answer honestly, so they lost their jobs.  What kind of criterion is this for assessing needs?  Children with special needs improve in every way when someone caters for their needs and where they build interpersonal relations, trust and understanding.  I had a problem with accepting the Department&rsquo;s approach. The subject of autistic children is a wide one.  In the limited time I have, I will not discuss them, but their needs can vary throughout the day.  One-on-one help allows them to improve and manage.</P>
        <P>A lady living in Carrick-on-Suir was involved in a slightly different circumstance.  Her child was attending Scoil Cormac in Cashel because their needs required the L&aacute;mh system.  The <Col N="124"/>woman could not get transport to the school because her nearest special needs school was in Waterford.  However, her child had been assessed by a psychologist and was improving because of the L&aacute;mh system, which suited the child.</P>
        <P>I have encountered these situations while holding clinics in south County Tipperary.  They are not made up and are absolute fact.  SNAs have lost their jobs, but children are the real losers.  I again thank Senator Norris for his time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank my colleagues in Fine Gael for tabling this motion and giving us an opportunity to throw light on an important subject.  I regret that the motion, as worded, is predicated on a number of misunderstandings and errors which I will address later.  Nonetheless, the motion gives us and the Minister an opportunity to outline in a positive manner what is being done for pupils with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>We should insert a bit of balance into this debate and examine the facts, although the Minister covered many of them.  Some 10,000 SNAs are working in our schools with an annual budget of &euro;300 million.  More than &euro;1 billion has been allocated for special education this year.  The comparative figure in 2004 was &euro;468 million.  The number of support and resource teachers has quadrupled since 1998 from approximately 2,000 to approximately 8,000.  These are staggering figures.  The pupil-teacher ratio in respect of students with special needs has been enhanced.  The school capitation rates for that category of school have improved by 30% in the past three years.  The budget for the transport of students with special educational needs amounts to &euro;50 million.  There are also 45 early intervention classes for children with autism.  That all of these figures have been glossed over in the Opposition&rsquo;s motion is extraordinary, as is the negative tone of some, but not all, Opposition spokespersons.</P>
        <P>The renewed programme for Government commits the State to further investment in special education provision at a time when education budgets in Ireland and abroad are being slashed.  That there will be a psychologist for every school in the country with emphasis on those with special needs units is another significant step forward.</P>
        <P>A close member of my family had special needs 20 years ago at a time when none of these services was available.  She had the good fortune of having educated parents who were teachers and possessed the wherewithal to travel abroad to provide for my niece&rsquo;s needs.  There was nothing in this country at the time, a fact that should be borne in mind before we start attacking the Minister willy-nilly.</P>
        <P>I ask Senator Healy Eames to withdraw a stark error in the motion when she concludes, namely, that teachers have no access to proper training.  The Minister pointed out that nearly half the teachers in the country have had access to special training.  Some 23,000 teachers availed of training places last year and more than 300 teachers availed of places on postgraduate programmes.  It does the Senator&rsquo;s argument no good when she includes comments that make no sense.  Another element of the motion castigates the Minister for not publishing a report which he has not even had sight of, which is not completed and which will be on the Department&rsquo;s website as soon as it is finished.  Let us get real.  We often call for Ministers to come to the House to debate various issues, and a senior Minister of State is here.  Let us have facts on our Order Paper before we call for a Minister again.</P><Col N="125"/>
        <P Just="Left">Exaggeration does no case any good. Where did the figure of 1,200 special needs assistants, SNAs, come from?  It was plucked out of the sky by someone who wanted to make a political trade union point and has been picked up, with no critical analysis, by Senator Healy Eames.  I did my own research today and rang a number of people, including members of the National Council for Special Education and people at the coalface.  A more realistic estimate of the number is 250.  During our recent debate on CAO places the 2.65% increase in applications claimed by Senator Healy Eames turned out to be an increase of less than 1%.  She should get her facts right.</P>

	<P>May I say a final word on behalf of special schools?  I am thinking, particularly, of the Nano Nagle school in Listowel.  It has 24 SNAs for 66 pupils, which sounds excessive but one must consider the service the school provides.  It has pupils with moderate and profound learning difficulties and children with autism, epilepsy and other conditions.  The school deals with all these difficulties and provides a huge service to the region. </P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to give as much help as he can to physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  There should be more consultation with the HSE in this regard.</P>
        <P>There are many ways to access extra funding for special needs.  It is my priority.  Can small towns like my own continue to afford three secondary schools, single sex primary schools, gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools, which are all optional?  In days of plenty they are a wonderful idea but in days of want these things must be looked at.  We must prioritise our special needs students.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We have an ironic situation.  Earlier today, we discussed a proposed constitutional amendment, one provision of which is that the State would cherish all the children of the State equally.  Now we find ourselves discussing the most vulnerable members of our society.  I do not wish to play party politics or any other kind.  I recognise it is difficult in these times to make ends meet but I hope the most vulnerable in our society will always be at the top of our priority list.  The children we are talking about ought to be at the top of that list.</P>
        <P>When one sees parents and supporters of children with special needs taking the trouble to attend debates in this House one knows they are concerned.  I spoke briefly with a representative of St. Joseph&rsquo;s school in Tallaght.  They are hoping for a stay of execution while the various issues in their case are resolved.  They fear cuts in provisions which would affect their loved ones.  I hope there will be openness and dialogue in an effort to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>Various figures have been cited for the number of jobs which have been or are being cut.  I have heard it said that the Government provided too many SNAs at one time.  I do not know if that claim is true.  I do know there is no need for the funding of these programmes to be cut to the extent it has been.  That cannot be justified.  There may have been more money to go round in times of plenty.  This may have caused people to develop their expectations, but always in ways which were necessary and appropriate because they were dealing with people&rsquo;s real needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am involved with the trusteeship of second level schools through CEIST, Catholic Education, an Irish Schools Trust.  These schools say they have already seen an indirect impact on the most disadvantaged children because of the reduction in numbers of special needs assistants <Col N="126"/>at primary level.  This, in turn, will have an impact on students at second level as they are deprived of the fullest possible opportunity to develop.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have also been cuts in other areas, such as grant allocations, and increased pupil- teacher ratios in subject significant areas such as the leaving certificate applied programme, LCAP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, and the junior certificate school programme, JCSP.  All of this, taken together with what we are discussing, must give great cause for concern.  The number of special needs children is rising and we must plan for appropriate assistance for them.  The worldwide figures for autism alone have been on the rise for the past number of years, which is a matter of major concern.</P>
        <P>We must ask about the appropriateness of cutbacks in the middle of the year, when people cannot plan to deal with them properly.  Issues surround the making of special needs assistants redundant where boards of management are not responsible for making people redundant but are responsible for making redundancy payments.  We are seeing a breakdown in the system, creating all sorts of problems for good people in different areas.</P>
        <P>We must revisit the decisions taken to date.  We cannot allow children who are in need to be neglected.  We must do something to reform the budget cuts which have had such adverse effects on the lives of many children in need and on our education system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the difficulties and sensitivities in this area.  Last week, I raised the issue of special needs assistants on the Adjournment and the Minister gave a very unsatisfactory reply.  Even following that reply, serious questions remain to be answered.  We need answers.  Senators on the Government side dispute the figure of 1,200 SNA jobs lost.  My colleagues in the D&aacute;il have submitted parliamentary questions on this issue but no matter how often we ask the question, the Minister refuses to tell us how many special needs assistants have been lost in the last year.  We do not know how many more will be lost or if schools which have lost SNAs or special classes will be provided with additional special needs supports.  We do not know if additional resources will be provided for schools which have lost special needs supports or if mainstream class teachers will be given extra training to deal with the loss of those supports.  I ask the Minister of State to answer these questions.  It is important that we debate this issue with accurate facts.  The pupils, who are most affected by these cuts, as well as their parents, teachers and communities, deserve answers. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Until I have official figures I must rely on the information I have been given, that up to 1,200 special needs assistants will have been cut from the system by the end of this month.  This support is being withdrawn from children with a wide range of conditions within the autism spectrum and with ADHD and dyslexia.  We have heard of cases of cuts to services to children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  These cuts cannot be justified, especially in the context of large class sizes, some as big as 30 to one teacher.  Cuts have already been implemented, such as that to the resource grant and home-school liaison teachers.</P>
        <P>A child with a special need in a mainstream classroom without adequate support would surely get lost in the system.  To deny a child a proper chance of education and of life, all for the sake of a few million euro which could otherwise be found, is disgraceful.</P>
        <P>It is high time the Government looked at the provision of special needs assistants as more than a financial matter.  We are talking about children and not numbers.  They do not deserve to be shoved from pillar to post as an accounting exercise.  Cuts to special needs support is not only heartless.  This move will seriously impair these children&rsquo;s education for years to come and will have knock-on effects in the future.  It is another example of the Government&rsquo;s shortsighted cost-cutting measures.  Special needs assistants are not a luxury that can be cut.  They are absolutely essential and an integral part of the education system.</P><Col N="127"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Earlier, we heard reference to the 1916 Proclamation.  The leading party in the Government claims to be a republican party.  The republican message in the Proclamation, the pledge made by the leaders of 1916 to the Irish republic, was to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  That is what we are talking about in this debate.  We are talking about children and equality.  Children have as much right to a decent education and a decent start to life as anybody else.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister not to proceed with further cuts to special needs support and to reinstate the support that has already been lost.  I will support the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party and I commend it on availing of the opportunity to raise this in a formal debate.  I note that the motion does not call for the reinstatement of the cuts that have taken place, and that is where I would differ from it.  The supports which have been cut should be reinstated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where there has been significant investment in the area of special needs by the Government, it has been rightly applauded by people throughout the State, no more than it was applauded at Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheiseanna, because it was the right thing to do.  It is the republican thing to do.  However, when supports are withdrawn from vulnerable children, the right thing and the republican thing to do is to reinstate them.</P>

	<P>This motion has stimulated much debate and I thank all Senators who contributed.  My interest is the child.  I have no other interest in this.  I am not interested in making it a political issue but it is one because Government decisions are making or breaking children.  The Government side has been extremely defensive in its behaviour.  I would ask some of the Senators who threw many wild accusations my way why they do not attack the people who wrote the reports in the newspapers?  I have not written the reports about the number of special needs assistants being cut by 1,200.  However, when I contacted the National Council for Special Education, it told me that of 1,000 schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">When I contacted the National Council for Special Education, it said that of 1,000 schools, the number of special needs assistants has been cut by 300.  As there are 4,000 primary schools, if we extrapolate from that, perhaps it is from there the author got the figure because it would come to 1,200.</P>
        <P>The Government is guilty of misinformation.  The problem is the criteria.  A number of Senators on the Government side and the Minister said that any child who needs a special needs assistant will get one.  I am delighted with that statement because there will be a massive queue at their doors.  I will pass on the record to the parents who have concerns and the teachers who need that proof.</P><Col N="128"/>
        <P>The problem is the criteria.  The upshot of this is the fact the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act has not been implemented.  Until that Act is implemented, none of our children&rsquo;s rights is protected.  The reason the school represented by the people in the Visitors Gallery, who are not here at my invitation, who are here of their own free will and whom I have never met until this evening, are about to lose 12 special needs assistants and ten teachers is that it is being judged under the special education review committee report of 1993 which preceded the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act that has not yet been implemented.  The SERC report will increase their pupil-teacher ratio and, as a result, the school will lose 12 SNAs and ten teachers.  Those are the criteria and they are wrong.  The Minister cannot argue with these facts.  If the NCSE gets its way, the school will have to close because it will not be able to guarantee the health and safety of students and staff.  I ask the Minister if this a political football.  This is real.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My concern is the child&rsquo;s learning in order that he or she will grow to be independent.  These children will have no swimming, no home economics, no woodwork practicals and no certificate examinations.  These are children from four to nine years of age.  What will their future entail?  This Government, by applying these criteria, is destroying and educationally maiming these children&rsquo;s lives and it fills me with disgust.  The NCSE&rsquo;s criteria is outdated and does not take modern developments or needs into account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s special education needs organisers, SENOs, interpret psychologists&rsquo; reports, although they are not qualified to do so.  Many Senators on the Government side, including Senator Keaveney, will be concerned that the review processes which they are carrying out in schools are unsatisfactory because they do not consult the staff.  The teachers and the SNAs are not included in the consultation process.  Some teachers in schools in Galway have told me they are not consulted at all.  It is as if they have no intellect or no experience with the child.  The SENO only sits in the class for half an hour.  That review process is flawed.</P>
        <P>In the case of the school, representatives of which are in the Visitors Gallery, the speech and language and communication disorders of their children were completely ignored because the children&rsquo;s IQ was between 45 and 70.  That means that if one has a low IQ, one&rsquo;s speech or understanding does not matter.  I have been a teacher and a lecturer in teacher education and I am a parent of two young children, and that really matters.</P>
        <P>I call on the Government to publish the NCSE&rsquo;s advice and to provide a timeline and the resourcing for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act which will protect all our children&rsquo;s educational rights.  I commend the Government on enacting that legislation but it should implement and resource it.</P>

	<P>A Chathaoirligh, I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to speak about the proposed changes to the RAPID areas in Cork city, which will have specific implications in Ballyphehane and Togher.  RAPID has been of great benefit to these areas and has delivered a great enhancement of public services and the public realm.  Through an integrated and co-ordinated approach, it has provided communities with a great opportunity to participate in the strategic improvement of their areas.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The Minister has announced that he will change the boundaries for Ballyphehane and Togher.  I welcome the inclusion of Ballyphehane in the RAPID area, but we must not end up in a situation where the restructured areas are cut back, and that half of Ballyphehane and Togher are not included.  The whole area must be included.  There have been great achievements in Ballyphehane and Togher through active engagement with local networks, and through the shared delivery by community participation in programmes with Cork City Council, with educational establishments and with the RAPID team.  The Ballyphehane and Togher community development programme has pioneered innovative development work with older people, women, young people and many groups within the area in schemes like social health and active community involvement.  This service delivery is important to the community of Ballyphehane and Togher.  The communities have a track record of delivery and participation.</P><Col N="131"/>
        <P>I am worried that the Minister has decided to exclude areas in Ballyphehane that include the Ballyphehane GAA club.  I have a map that outlines the decisions the Minister made for the scheme.  I am hoping he will include the area around Ballyphehane Green, which includes the GAA club.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, delivered a letter to the area entitled, Reinvestment and Funding Opportunities for Togher and Ballyphehane, and he states &ldquo;I am delighted to inform you that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has announced the expansion of the current RAPID boundaries to include additional areas in Ballyphehane and Togher&rdquo;.  That is fine for the Minister and the Government to do that, but as an elected representative and as a former member of the RAPID area who has worked with Mr. McGann and Ms Cogan Williamson, I wrote to the Minister about the proposed extension of the scheme but got no reply.</P>
        <P>We must continue to empower people through RAPID.  It is not all about funding.  It is about giving people the ability to participate in their own area.  That has happened, but the area around the GAA club, comprising Hillview Estate, Connolly Road and the green, must be included in the RAPID area.  I am also worried that we are taking out part of rural Togher, which is still in need of a RAPID designation.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to include Hillview Estate, Connolly Road and the green in which Ballyphehane GAA club is housed, and to look at the possibility of keeping the Togher rural area in the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Minister and I would like to thank the Senator for raising this important issue.</P>
        <P>The RAPID programme was first launched in February 2001, with the aim of prioritising and co-ordinating State assistance in some of the most deprived areas.  Originally, 25 areas were targeted and this number increased to 51 as the programme gained momentum.  A recognised expert in the field of mapping deprivation was contracted to analyse data in the 2006 census across a range of socioeconomic and deprivation indicators, and to make recommendations on the criteria for inclusion of areas in the RAPID programme on this basis.</P>
        <P>As a result of this analysis, there are several conclusions about the Togher and Mahon RAPID areas.  First, communities within Togher and Ballyphehane were identified as suffering from significant disadvantage, which merited their inclusion in the programme.  These communities are mainly made up of houses built by Cork City Council in the 1940s and 1950s.  The population has a large elderly component and will benefit from the additional focus on local need which RAPID can provide.  Second, areas within the existing Togher RAPID area, which are in the south of the defined area and mostly made up of reasonably modern private housing and new developments, were identified as not meeting the expected current disadvantage levels.  In this context, I point out to the House that the local area implementation team has discretion to examine these areas and to recommend their continuing inclusion in the programme, or their removal, based on local knowledge.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that in implementing funding allocations based on RAPID boundaries, care has always been taken to ensure that key local facilities, such as sports clubs, health facilities, schools etc., are offered RAPID status based on the population they serve, not just on their geographic inclusion within the area.  Thus, for example, an area implementation team can accept the need to support a sports club which, while physically located outside a RAPID area, is actively serving young RAPID residents and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Meetings were held with all of the RAPID local area implementation teams in January this year to brief them on this process.  Each AIT has been requested to examine the proposals and <Col N="132"/>either to confirm agreement or to make suggestions for amendments, based on local knowledge.  This work is under way and a number of areas have requested amendments and these are currently being examined.</P>
        <P>While the Minister has not been formally notified that this work has been finalised by the Togher-Mahon area implementation team, initial indications are that it is in favour of the proposed changes.  Since the area implementation team is made up of representatives of the local community and local State agencies, it is anticipated that its advice on this issue will be central to the final decision taken.</P>
        <P>With the renewed commitment to the RAPID programme contained in the revised programme for Government, the Department will continue to work with other Departments and agencies to develop a more integrated approach to the delivery of services in the most disadvantaged communities.  Through the participation of community representatives, we will ensure that our work in the community benefits from the local knowledge and skills that local residents can offer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that RAPID is being extended for Ballyphehane, the area around Ballyphehane GAA club, Ballyphehane Green, Connolly Road and Hillview Estate should be included, particularly in view of the remarks about area implementation teams being able to support sports clubs outside the designated area.  I ask the Minister of State to press the Minister to include the GAA club as part of the RAPID area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise the need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify when he proposes to publish the report from the national strategy group on higher education, chaired by the economist Dr. Colin Hunt.</P>
        <P>This strategy group was commissioned over a year ago and the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il on 24 November 2009 that he expected the report to be finalised early in 2010.  We are now at the end of February but there is still no sign of the report.</P>
        <P>The report will cover many areas of higher education such as funding, resources, student numbers, registration and possibly fees.  Third level institutions, development plans and organisational structures will also be covered.  The areas I am most interested in are the roles of higher education in developing our economy in the regions and creating employment in the society it serves.</P>
        <P>I refer to two items in the terms of reference the strategy group must examine.  The second term of reference is the role of Irish higher education in modern society, while the third is to identify the operational framework of the higher education system, including the number and role of institutions within which it will be enabled to deliver on these policy objectives.</P>
        <P>I am specifically interested in the application for university status by Waterford Institute of Technology.  This strategy the group is working on will guide development for the next 20 years.  I am hopeful it will contain a commitment and a delivery timeframe for a university for the south-east region, which has a population of over 460,000.</P>
        <P>In February 2006, Waterford Institute of Technology made its university application to the Department of Education and Science.  Subsequently the Government commissioned the Port report as an interim measure and since then the national strategy group was established under Dr. Colin Hunt.  In the south east, there is a high dependence on manufacturing and construc<Col N="133"/>tion and Waterford has suffered more than most other regions with regard to job losses.  We now need a clear strategy to create employment and a catalyst for such job creation.  University designation for Waterford Institute of Technology would be that catalyst.</P>
        <P>The Government has prevaricated on this issue since 2006.  I remind the Minister of State that the Port report found the economic benefits of university designation for Waterford would, at the least, offset public expenditure.  It also found the Waterford application has great merit but, again, there has been no Government action.</P>
        <P>For the sake of education, employment and the economic future of the south-east region, I hope Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s application is acknowledged in this report and that it is recommended for university status.  The time for reports, committees and talking is over, it is now time for action.  We must create jobs in the regions and what better way than designating WIT a university?</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will have news on when the higher education strategy will be published.  The future for the next 20 years will depend on the development of higher education and its impact on the economy and society.</P>

        <P>In February 2009 the Minister for Education and Science launched a process to develop a new national strategy for higher education.  The process is being led by a high level strategy group under the chairmanship of Dr. Colin Hunt, comprising national and international expertise.</P>
        <P>The role of higher education in society has never been more important.  It is critical in enabling people to reach their full potential as individuals and as active citizens, and in creating the skilled labour force that Ireland needs to develop an internationally competitive knowledge based economy.</P>
        <P>Demand for higher education from school leavers continues to grow and in recent years we have also seen an increase in the number of mature students in higher education.  These trends are very welcome in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s objectives for developing the smart economy.  However, responding to the needs of a growing and diverse student population while ensuring the system can deliver a high quality learning experience poses a number of challenges for the sector.</P>
        <P>The development of a new national strategy for higher education affords a timely opportunity to review the environment for higher education and the challenges and vectors of change that are impacting on the sector.  The strategy process is examining how well Ireland&rsquo;s higher education system is performing, how it ranks internationally, how well existing resources are being used and how the system can be reconfigured to best meet the many challenges it faces over the next decade, having regard also to the key role it has to play in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.</P>
        <P>The key objective of this strategy process is to develop a vision and related set of national policy objectives for higher education for the next 20 years with more focused targets for the sector for the next five years.  The strategy group has met formally on nine occasions since its establishment last February and has also engaged in extensive consultations with stakeholders and wider interests.</P>
        <P>In May 2009 an open call for written submissions was advertised by the strategy group.  There was an excellent response from a wide range of stakeholders on all aspects of the higher education system.  Over 100 submissions were received from institutions, educational bodies, representatives of the enterprise community and a number of individual personal submissions. <Col N="134"/> These submissions provided valuable input for the group on a range of issues on which the development of the strategy has focused.  The submissions are publicly available on the Higher Education Authority website.</P>
        <P>Following this public consultation process, a number of independently facilitated discussion forums were held with members of the academic community, third and fourth level students, enterprise and business leaders, second level policy makers and teachers.  The material gathered in these fora also provided valuable input to the strategy group&rsquo;s deliberations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The chairman, Dr. Colin Hunt, and members of the strategy group have also met  institutional leaders from the universities, the institutes of technology, private third level colleges and colleges of education.  Bilateral meetings were also held with all the trade unions representing staff in the higher education sector.</P>
        <P>The comprehensive consultation process being undertaken by the group is time intensive.  In light of the key contribution higher education can make to the future growth of the economy and the well-being of society, however, it is critical that the strategy group be in a position to gauge and reflect the views of a wide range of stakeholders, including those working in the sector, current and potential students for whom the experience of further study will be of life-changing importance, and society in general.  It is understood the strategy group is finalising its deliberations and consultations.  It is expected that its report will be submitted to the Minister before the summer.  I note the Senator&rsquo;s comments in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology and I again thank him for raising this matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As stated, as recently as 24 November last the Minister for Education and Science indicated in the D&aacute;il that the report would be published early in the new year.  The Minister of State has just said that it will not be published until the summer.  As in the case of the crisis the country currently faces, clarity and certainty are required, especially if those in the higher education sector are to make plans for the next 20 years.</P>
        <P>By the time the report is published, some 18 months will have passed.  In the context of responding to the situation that obtains, it is not acceptable that this amount of time has been allowed to pass.  I cannot overemphasise the fact that early publication is essential.  I am sure that, like me, the authorities at Waterford Institute of Technology are in the dark with regard to the Port report which was commissioned to investigate the possibility of upgrading the institute to university status.  The Port report will be superseded by the report of the strategy group which is not now due to appear until the summer.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this matter.  I look forward to the eventual publication of the strategy group&rsquo;s report.</P>
