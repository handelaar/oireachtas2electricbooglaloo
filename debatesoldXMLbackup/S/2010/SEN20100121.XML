	<P>I have received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to verify the timeframe for delivery of the recommended extension to Calasanctius College, Oranmore, County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide approval to go to tender for Scoil Chonaill Naofa, Bunbeg, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the measures being taken to protect people from the ill effects of sun beds.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the provision of additional funding for local authorities to assist them in respect of road maintenance, resurfacing, renewal and repair following the recent damaging inclement weather.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two items, the first of which is the strike that occurred yesterday which effectively amounted to economic sabotage at a time of such uncertainty for the country and hardship for people.  It is unacceptable to see our international reputation being damaged in that way, the suffering it caused, the impact it had on people&rsquo;s arrangements and the effect it had on our exports.  The Minister for Transport should speak out more clearly on this matter than he has done to date.  While I welcome his comments this morning, there is a real imperative on the Government, in the context of this type of industrial action, to spell out clearly what the consequences of that action will be and to do everything possible to ensure it does not occur in other sectors.  There must be a role for the Government when such vital services are impacted on as heavily as they were yesterday.  The Government has a huge responsibility to spell out loudly and clearly the options and measures required to solve such disputes without the chaos we saw yesterday.  The House should have a debate on the management of these disputes in order that we do not arrive at a situation where a strike will be seen as the only option.  We hear that it is a possibility in other sectors also.  There is a huge obligation on everybody to pull together in the interests of the country and to ensure this is not the solution people will seek.</P>
        <P>The other topic I wish to raise which is more relevant to some Senators than others is the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Education and Science of the abolition of the NUI.  A number of Senators, and Senator Alex White in particular, have called for a proper discussion on the McCarthy report in this House and the need for the Government to outline the way it is approaching the recommendations in that report.  It did not do it in the budget and now we have piecemeal decision making.  As we await a report on higher education, the decision has been taken in advance to abolish the National University of Ireland.  That is another example of how not to do business.  It should be planned.  There should be rational decision making regarding the McCarthy report.  It should be transparent and open and should arise out of discussion in these Houses, with all involved getting an opportunity to put their point of view on the McCarthy report.  I ask the Leader to have a debate on the McCarthy report in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Taking up the last point made by Senator Fitzgerald, I want to be careful not to give the predictable response.  The Government made a rash, uninformed and overly quick decision on the NUI.  It was done without sufficient consultation and in the course of a review of third level education, but I will wait to see what the Minister has to add to it.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, there are a number of supposed facts which are incorrect.  As I always say, there is a difference between the facts and the truth.  The McCarthy report claimed that the dissolution of the NUI would save &euro;5 million.  The NUI did the sums on this for me some months back and it says the figure is less than &euro;1 million.  I discussed that yesterday with the Minister for Education and Science and he agrees with me and with the NUI that it is only a saving of &euro;1 million but he said that is not his motivation.  I put it to him that it was important that the NUI brand, what it has done and the route the graduates have come from should be protected.  The Minister appears to be creating some kind of over-arching body to examine the whole area of qualification at third level, etc.  What I have asked him to do, which is important, is to protect the NUI brand within that without any constraints on anybody else or on it.  In other words, it is a sub-body within a larger body rather than what it currently is, namely, a large body.  I asked that that be done.  I will come back to that but I believe it is crucial that it be done on a statutory basis.</P><Col N="91"/>
        <P>It is interesting to hear mention of the strike by air traffic controllers.  There was a 24-hour strike by air traffic controllers in France yesterday but we did not hear much about it.  They had two strikes last year and two the year before.  They have them all the time in France, the second largest economy in Europe, but we do not hear much about them because they go on all the time.  The last time we had a strike by air traffic controllers was 23 years ago, which coincides perfectly with the period of social partnership.  I ask my colleagues and particularly the Leader, whom I know worked very hard in support of some kind of a national agreement, to talk to those blusterers in his own party who, when the public sector agreed to take 12 days&rsquo; unpaid leave or whatever, described that as paid holidays.</P>
        <P>The points made by Senator Fitzgerald are correct.  There is a total lack of trust.  We should sack the managers who dismissed those workers during the week.  They knew what would happen.  They knew that laying off those people prior to the case being heard by the Labour Court would create industrial action.  They were up for it.  They decided to engage in a type of war but they now find themselves in a difficult action, which will get worse.  There will be bushfires throughout the public sector as matters go on because there is no longer any trust.  A year ago the national implementation authority would have been in contact with the various parties.  There would have been phone calls made and pressure put on unions and management to try to find a solution, and solutions would have been found, but that is not happening.</P>
        <P>Is what is happening the right approach?  Of course it is not; it is a disaster.  It is like the point Senator O&rsquo;Malley made here before Christmas.  If reform is such a good thing, why is it not happening?  Everybody thinks it is a good idea to have reform of the Seanad and it is not happening.  It is because other changes have not come into place.  More problems will arise with the public sector and the idea that the Government can legislate its way out of it is nonsense because all that will do is lead to all-out strikes, with larger groups involved, which will worsen rather than improve the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I have no difficulty saying it is wrong and unacceptable that there should be strike action in such essential public services as air traffic control.  My understanding of the position, from what I read in the newspapers, is that the union has indicated it is prepared to have this matter negotiated and dealt with in the Labour Court but in response the management has said the union must concede in advance on the very issue that would be dealt with in the Labour Court.  That is no way to negotiate or to make progress.  This issue should go to a third party such as the Labour Court today with serious efforts being made by both sides to have the matter resolved because as Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, people were suspended.  The notion that this was a wildcat strike with people walking off the job is wrong.  We must understand that people were suspended from their positions and then others, understandably, came forward to support them.</P>
        <P>Second, I support what my colleagues said on the NUI issue.  It is extraordinary that this has come almost out of the blue.  We know it was in the McCarthy report.  I notice that the author of that report, Colm McCarthy, if it is the same Colm McCarthy, is blogging today and yesterday on The Irish Economy website, essentially welcoming this decision by the Government.  It is interesting he should be doing that as he is entitled as a citizen to do so but there should be a debate in this House on the future of the NUI in the context of what the Government has in mind for third level education.  To abolish out of the blue a body which has been in existence since 1908 seems to me to be extraordinary and should not be done in the manner in which it appears to have been done.  The decision has implications, perhaps ancillary, for this institution, which I have no doubt is something in which some Members would have an interest.</P>
        <P>Third, will the Leader arrange an early opportunity for the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come into the House for a debate to assess the position on the early <Col N="92"/>childhood care and education scheme which comes into operation this month?  The closing date for applications was extended until yesterday because the Minister of State was rightly concerned that people may not have been fully aware of what was available and possible.  The bad weather over the Christmas period caused delays as well.  That was just a one-week extension and I would be concerned, given the veritable army of public relations people who have surrounded Ministers in this Government in recent years, that there has been little information put out to the public on this new scheme, which I have welcomed in principle in regard to child care.  It was in the Labour Party manifesto on the last occasion.  It was not supported by the Government then but the Government has now seen fit to introduce it, and I welcome that.  There are difficulties with it and there will be teething problems but it is the right scheme and I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the House to allow us assess its operation in its early days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In six years we will commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Rising, one of the most significant events in Irish history.  Already, plans are being put together which I am glad are progressing favourably.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When we celebrated the 90th anniversary of the Rising we saw the great outpouring of sentiment among the public and the great sense of pride as well.  It is evident in the new plan that many landmarks associated with that particular period will come centre stage, the GPO being one of them, but there is another area, namely, Moore Street, which was virtually the last stand in the Rising.  I am talking about buildings Nos. 14 to 17, and the environs.  I find it particularly embarrassing that the descendants of the seven signatories of the 1916 Proclamation, which I have here, have had to take a stand to ensure that particular landmark, which is a national monument in every sense, is not in danger of desecration.</P>
        <P>This is a matter for the city council and, to some extent, for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but it is also a matter of national interest.  I ask the Leader to take up the matter with the Taoiseach immediately to ensure there will be no dilution of the status of those buildings and the environs and that it will not be necessary in the future for the direct descendants of the seven signatories to take a stand in this case because in terms of commemorating that centenary, if the wrong action is done now, it will distract from what should be a momentous occasion for us in this nation.  I ask the Leader to treat this as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an unbelievable crisis throughout the country &mdash; County Wexford is no different from anywhere else &mdash; with regard to the state of the road network, a matter to which many Members referred yesterday.  Following his contribution at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, has lined himself up to become identified as the Minister for potholes.  He clearly stated there was no money for local authorities to repair roads.  If we do not repair them now, they will deteriorate further in the coming months.  We must deal with this problem as a matter of urgency.  If the Minister for potholes cannot do anything, the Taoiseach should be invited to come before the House to explain why the Government cannot make emergency funding available to local authorities in order that they might repair the roads.  If repairs are not carried out, certain roads will deteriorate to an unbelievable degree in the next few months and will eventually be closed.  Billions of euro have been provided for the banks because it has been stated the finance system is so important.  However, the country&rsquo;s infrastructure is equally important.  The Leader should invite the Taoiseach to come before the House to indicate why funding has not been made available for urgent repairs to roads throughout the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on the decision to dissolve the NUI, particularly as NUI Galway is located in the city in which I live.  The latter institution will be obliged to change its name if the dissolution proceeds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other matter on which I seek a debate is that relating to sail training vessels.  As Members are aware, the <i>Asgard II</i> sank in recent months.  The name &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; has hugely historic connotations.  It is time we considered building an <i>Asgard III</i>.  A number of ships were either restored or built during the Celtic tiger period, namely, the <i>Dunbrody</i> famine ship and the <i>Jeanie Johnstone</i>.  It is not acceptable for an island nation such as Ireland to be without a proper sail training vessel.  A debate on this matter is required as soon as possible and I ask the Leader to make time available for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In the first instance I wish to correct my friend, Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  The air traffic controllers were not dismissed, they were suspended.  The latter is a lesser sanction.  In addition, the technology is not completely new and the runway in question has already been used and is only being brought back into operation.  The real problem is that there is a lack of trust.  Action must be taken in respect of this matter.  I find myself in the unusual position of being in agreement with Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary.  It is disgraceful that at a time of economic difficulty well paid people are engaging in an act of gross self-indulgence.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the destruction of some historical records held by the Land Registry.  It is extraordinary that this is happening.  Several hundred thousand documents are in the process of being destroyed.  Some of these may be perfectly ordinary and bureaucratic in nature but others contain historical material.  It was one thing when the Custom House was blown up and an enormous amount of historical material and resources was lost.  This time, however, we are doing it ourselves.  The material to which I refer has not been reviewed.  We do not, therefore, know what it contains.  It should be deposited with the National Archives.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader clarify the position on No. 36, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 21, which relates to so-called &ldquo;head shops&rdquo; and which appears in my name and that of Senator O&rsquo;Toole?  I understand a commitment to the effect that it will be taken next week in the form of an all-party motion has been given.  I welcome this because there is agreement on all sides on the matter.  However, this is a significant matter and it should not be put through the House, without discussion, as a formal motion.  All Members are aware of the activities of these &ldquo;head shops&rdquo;.  I am astonished that such establishments are to be found in small provincial towns.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take a liberal attitude to, for example, marijuana.  There is a strong argument for legalising it and controlling its use.  The motion tabled by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and me would dovetail with that approach.  We need to know the nature of the substances available.  They need to be controlled, regulated and, if dangerous, banned.  This is a serious health matter.  Hospital outpatient departments are dealing with the casualties caused by use of these substances on a daily basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am astonished by the actions of the Irish Aviation Authority and the air traffic controllers.  This dispute has damaged many industries, including tourism.  One would have to be sympathetic to those who, as a result of flights being cancelled yesterday, missed appointments, examinations, etc.  All we can do is appeal to both sides to return to the negotiating table to resolve the matter.  There should be no further strikes.  The difference between this country and France is that people are not so reliant on using airports in order to gain access to the latter because there are other means available to allow them to do this.  Ireland is an island nation and relies heavily on air traffic controllers to keep it running.  Our airports are of strategic importance and we will support the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, in whatever action he deems it necessary to take in order to resolve the matter.</P>

	<P>There should be no interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It was highly provocative of the Irish Aviation Authority to suspend certain air traffic controllers.  The authority is responsible for pushing this matter to the limit.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Will the Leader make time available for a debate on the future of the vocational educational committees, VECs, with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe?  The Minister is doing an excellent job and makes himself available to discuss issues of this nature.  Before a final decision is made, will the Leader invite the Minister to come before the House to discuss the role of the country&rsquo;s 33 VECs?  The McCarthy report recommends that this number should be reduced to 22, while Deputy Brian Hayes of Fine Gael recommends that there should be even fewer.  The latter is an extremely unhelpful suggestion, particularly if we are to convince the Minister to draw up plans to retain the existing VECs which have made a great contribution to rural areas and can certainly be of assistance during this time of economic difficulty when there is a need to create alternative employment opportunities and retrain people.  I strongly recommend that the existing 33 VECs be retained because change for change&rsquo;s sake is not necessary.  The amalgamations and rationalisations carried out to date, including that which led to the establishment of the HSE, have proved unsuccessful.  I appeal to the Leader to request that the Minister for Education and Science come before the House in the next two to three weeks in order that we might engage in a full debate on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The strike involving air traffic controllers constitutes a national disaster.  As previous speakers indicated, it was an act of sabotage at a time when everyone was so concerned about the fragile nature of the economy and when people were expected to act in the national interest.  I have received information from the part of the country in which I live that this dispute has already had an adverse and knock-on effect in the context of tourism bookings.  The sooner everyone involved, including the Ministers for Transport and Arts, Sport and Tourism, takes a more proactive approach the better, particularly as we do not want everything to grind to a halt.  There is so much industrial relations machinery available to those involved in such disputes.  I do not know who is responsible for causing this dispute.  I accept that some provocative actions may have been taken but it is now time to knock people&rsquo;s heads together.  Those at the top must take a proactive stance as soon as possible.  I look forward to the Leader&rsquo;s response to Members&rsquo; concerns in respect of this matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I was chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland north west for the past few years and intimately involved with the evolving development plan on both a regional and national basis.  In that context, Members on both sides of the House have indicated that the air traffic controllers' dispute constitutes a national crisis.  I am not sure whether those involved, irrespec<Col N="95"/>tive of how the dispute arose, are aware of the impact their action is having.  Tourism Ireland will this month launch a significant multi-million euro plan to attract increasing numbers of tourists to this country.  Owing to the fact that Ireland is an island nation, access is the key element of that plan.  Consequently, emphasis has been placed on the development of regional and national airports to ensure people can access the country before travelling to the various regions.  I plead with both sides to take account of the national interest and go to the Labour Court.  I ask the Leader to use his offices to try to ensure the Labour Court would meet in emergency session if necessary because this is a matter of national importance.  While it is not in any way diluting the right of people to strike, there are certain key services, one of which is air traffic control.  Such a shutdown has an economic impact not just in Dublin, Cork and Shannon where the major airports are but also in the other areas of the country and presents a poor image.  I do not fully accept what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said about France.  Unfortunately there is a culture of the public service in France going out on strike at the drop of a hat.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that it is imperative for the Government to take a hands-on role in acquiring the properties in Moore Street.  It would be a disgrace if we did not pay tribute on the anniversary of the 1916 Rising to the descendents and the people involved.  If we allow this to pass it will be a shame on all of us.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash; to talk specifically about job creation and not competitiveness?  We have no Government policy on job creation; there is no leadership.</P>
        <P>I join other speakers in asking for the Minister for Transport to come to the House for two reasons.  We need to discuss his comments that he has no money to pay for the roads.  He also needs to make a statement to this House on the ongoing dispute in the aviation industry.  Industrial relations are at an all-time low here.  We need social partnership now more than ever.</P>
        <P>Last night in my city, Cork, we had a gangland killing of a person who was killed because of his involvement in the drugs trade.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs are fast losing the battle, and gangland warfare is becoming part and parcel of everyday life.  When it has now reached the streets of Cork, it is time for us to say that enough is enough.  The Government is hiding behind the national drugs strategy and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  He needs to give resources to the Garda and stop tying its hands.  How many more people are to die before the Government will act?  This morning in Cork city there are people in my parish who are afraid and upset by what happened.  That is replicated across the country.  It must stop and needs Government intervention and action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The action of the air traffic controllers is purely and simply economic blackmail because air traffic control is a vital service that is essential to the economy.  Damage has been done to the 20,000 travellers, tourism, our exports and the image of the country.  We have no chance to secure economic recovery unless it is on the basis of a competitive economy. <Col N="96"/> To give in to this economic blackmail would undermine any chance we have of restoring a competitive economy.</P>
        <P>When the former Taoiseach attempted to give himself and his senior Ministers a &euro;38,000 salary increase there was an outcry because the spotlight was thrown on the rewards of high office in this country compared with other countries.  That is what has occurred in this case because the benefits received by the 300 air traffic controllers in this country are totally out of line with their counterparts in the United States, Britain and France.  The equivalent of 30% of every controller&rsquo;s salary is paid towards their pensions.  They work 182 days a year, and have 137 rest days and 36 days holidays in addition to ten public holidays.  They work a 35-hour week.  They are entitled to a break of 30 minutes for every two hours worked.  They work five days and then get three days off.  I am not complaining about those benefits, but it is a bit rich to attempt to exert this economic blackmail when we know and they know the country needs this vital service.  The attitude of the Minister for Transport and his policy of non-intervention and non-interference are unacceptable.  I ask the Leader to address this question.  What is the Government going to do about this issue?  It is unacceptable that they would block the upgrading of basic technology &mdash; in many cases a Windows-based system.  We need to upgrade technology across our economy.  Taking this action when this service is vital for air safety is unacceptable.  I ask the Leader to address that issue with the Minister for Transport, who should come into this House to account for his actions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on social partnership.  When times are difficult and jobs are hard to come by even though the employers have the upper hand, that is particularly a time for a logical sequence of events to allow everybody to partake fully, not just in the good times, but also in the difficult times so that we avoid people going on strike unnecessarily.  I am particularly thinking about people who have excellent terms and conditions, as outlined in the House this morning, and who decide to strike at a time when the nation is working together, going through a difficult time and taking the burden as equally as can be apportioned to every sector.  When that is the template that is being used, it is not a time for people to go on strike.  At least people should doubly and trebly think before they consider striking.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader for a debate on the electoral systems.  In particular I am thinking about elections for the European Parliament.  We should have a debate in this House on the proposal in the renewed programme for Government to have an all-island electoral system to the European Parliament.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday a colleague on the other side went off on a bit of a rant about whether or not we were applauding the Minister for negotiating the deal on the cervical cancer vaccine.  I spoke on a local radio station welcoming the Minister&rsquo;s initiative on the cervical cancer vaccine.  However, on Monday night it emerged that second-year students in our local school were offered the vaccine at a cost of &euro;400.  I really object to that.  What is the difference between being a 13-year old and a 14-year old?  A 14-year old girl in second year is at just as much risk of getting cervical cancer.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the issue in detail.  Why can she not negotiate for second-year students to get the vaccine at &euro;100 in the same way as for first-year students?  It would mean that 90 lives would be saved.  Who knows what will happen to the cohort who missed out last year?  That matter should be a priority for the coming weeks.  Professor Frazer, who came here at the behest of the Irish Cancer Society and who has introduced and modified this vaccine, also recommends that it be given three times and should not be just a one-off dose.  While I applaud the Minister&rsquo;s initiative I ask her to extend it so that lives will be saved.</P>

	<P>On several occasions last term I called for a debate on the lack of law and order, and we failed to get that debate.  We are three weeks into the new year and already there have been eight murders, gangland crime, gun crime and knife crime.  It seems to be a plague in the country at present.  There seems to be no deterrent.  There is no fear in the law.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems incapable of addressing the problems before us.  I ask that the Minister comes to the House to address the area of law and order.</P>
        <P>Yesterday Senator Keaveney and I spoke about the car bomb attack on Peadar Heffron, the PSNI officer.  There seems to be a considerable rise in dissident republicanism in recent times.  A number of 600 pound bombs &mdash; this is larger than the Omagh bomb &mdash; have been planted, but thankfully they did not go off.  Recruitment among such dissidents in Northern Ireland has recently reached a high point, as has been commented upon by the PSNI.  My understanding, however, is that same type of recruitment among young people is going on in this State as we speak into these dissident republican gangs.</P>
        <P>I want to know whether the Garda has the necessary resources, including intelligence gathering, to tackle this problem.  It is imperative that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform addresses that issue also, in the Seanad, to keep Members informed of developments in this regard because these thugs certainly present a threat to this State and we should use all the means at our disposal to nip this recruitment campaign in the bud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to prioritise the topic I raised yesterday, namely, the assault on Peadar Heffron.  I am glad to see that he is improving slightly, but progress will be slow.  It will be a long road for him and his family, but it is in all our interests that he improves and recovers as fully as possible.</P>
        <P>I would like to believe the Seanad could foment a mutual understanding among all the people on this island.  I ask that we look, for example, at the 2016 commemorations of 1916 and expand that into the likes of Ballykinlar, the Curragh and Frongoch, so that the 1920-21 issue is addressed.  I am aware that the British Army has announced it will be withdrawing from Ballykinlar.  I declare my interest, since my grandfather spent 13 months there as an internee.  However, many families would gain from an understanding of what the situation was like there and it is very important that we address the issues of 1920-21 as well as 1916.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to bear in mind that in 1916, Ballykinlar was a British Army training ground for soldiers <i>en route</i> to the Somme.  In the context of achieving mutual understanding and adopting a multi-perspective viewpoint on history, the Seanad should be a driving force towards debating the issues.  In that context, perhaps the Leader might use my Council of Europe report on multi-perspectivity concerning how to teach history in areas of recent conflict as a starting point for a debate on the issues of how we view the so-called other.  If we do that, the topic referred to by Senator Cummins will be addressed.  We have to decide how we are going to deal with those we have traditionally perceived to be the other, because we have to live in peace and harmony and stop dissidents from getting any degree of support.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Norris, Leyden, Coghlan, Mooney and Regan all expressed shock and disappointment at the events that took place yesterday for four hours at Dublin Airport.  I welcome the support right across the House this morning for the fact that every business related decision for the foreseeable future must be taken in the national interest.  Every family in Ireland has benefited one way or another from the Celtic tiger, although some perhaps a great deal more than the vast majority.  At this crucial moment in our country&rsquo;s history, however, every decision to be made by organisations and their employees should be in the national interest.</P><Col N="98"/>
        <P>I heard the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, on the radio this morning speaking of his determination on this issue.  I do not believe that any Minister over the past 25 years has a better record in terms of carrying through a decision once it has been made.  I listened attentively to his views this morning and he invited all concerned to refer the dispute to the Labour Court as a matter of urgency.  As Senator Mooney has said, the Labour Court should make itself available for an emergency session, with which I fully agree.  The Minister emphasised that if this does not happen, measures to protect essential services will need to be summarily <?oasys _dc28- ?>introduced.  It is to be hoped common sense will prevail and we shall return to the norm pertaining on 31 December regarding the conditions for employment at that date, with the Labour Court in its wisdom seeking to achieving the consensus everyone knows must be reached.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>Air traffic controllers are highly specialised when it comes to the safety of air traffic.  Theirs is a very successful record and they have been totally committed down through the years.  The fact that there has been no major disturbance in their ranks since 1987 is an outstanding achievement.  Be that as it may, in the national interest and mindful of our exports, as an island nation we do not have the luxury other countries might have of being next door to their markets.  I said, yesterday, on the Order of Business that common sense must prevail.  I agree with Senator Mooney, who has been chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s north-west division, that resolution of the problem is essential.  One of the three planks in Ireland&rsquo;s recovery must be tourism.  It is a vital part of the services sector and is one area in which Ireland plc has an exemplary record in terms of the numbers of hours lost through industrial action.  We want this tradition to continue.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer has reminded the House that the national understanding and social partnership have been the backbone of this achievement.  They eliminated the strike culture we were familiar with in the early 1980s.  I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on social partnership this morning, and perhaps this could be another new year&rsquo;s resolution aimed at getting everyone back to reconsider such an initiative.  Based on the example of other countries facing chronic economic difficulties, the Government made the right decision in the budget, and everyone on the island, I believe, wants to get on with that.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for a debate on the McCarthy report with special reference to the Minister&rsquo;s announcement yesterday concerning the NUI.  I fully agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole about the protection of the brand name, and there is no difficulty in having this debated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White called for the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come to the House in relation to the preschool schemes.  There is no problem in having that debated.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the homes and properties of the signatories of the Proclamation, which is of some significance given that the centenary of 1916, a subject touched on by Senators Keaveney and Buttimer, is so close.  Today is an historic date, the 91st anniversary of the First D&aacute;il.  I wish well the seminar in Dublin Castle and the former Members of the Oireachtas who are attending.  I hope to get there in the afternoon to join colleagues in their endeavours to acknowledge and celebrate the sitting of the First D&aacute;il.  I have no difficulty in bringing the expressions of concern by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and colleagues to the Government's attention about the protection of the homes.  We should do everything we can to celebrate the memory of the heroes of 1916, especially the signatories of the Proclamation.  I am reading a brilliant book which details the final hours of those unfortunate men who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country in 1916.  It contains their letters and details their experiences during the last ten days before they died.  I fully share the sentiments expressed by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and other colleagues in that regard.</P><Col N="99"/>
        <P>Senator Twomey called for a debate on the state of the roads and the funding that will have to be made available because of the damage caused by the inclement weather.  I will have no difficulty in allowing such a debate to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in is seeking a debate on the provision of a training vessel, a good proposal.  I will certainly do everything I can to arrange such a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris referred to the Land Registry and the National Archives.  He is concerned about important historical documents.  I would like to see a full debate on the matter which is of great importance and which I will discuss with him after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also referred to No. 36, motion No. 21, on the Order Paper concerning so-called &ldquo;head shops&rdquo;, a debate on which I hope will take place in the next two weeks.  It is an all-party motion.  I will arrange a full debate, with the Minister present, on this terrible plague which presents a huge challenge.  I will have no difficulty in discussing the matter with colleagues after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called for the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House for a debate on the future of VEC schools before a final decision is made on the matter he raised.  I have no difficulty with this and have already made a commitment that such a debate will take place as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer expressed serious concerns about job creation.  As he knows, in a few minutes&rsquo; time, the T&aacute;naiste will be in the House for statements on employment and competitiveness, No. 1 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.  I look forward to many colleagues participating in that debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins and Keaveney referred to gangland crime.  I will have no difficulty in arranging a debate on that subject with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform present.  To say the least, events in recent weeks have been alarming.  We must ensure the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has everything necessary to face this terrible challenge.  The change in society, both in towns and cities, is mind-boggling, whether it concerns shootings or knife crime.  As Senator Cummins outlined, this is an urgent matter.  I will speak with the Minister this afternoon, if possible, to see if he can make time available to discuss it at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin sought a debate on social partnership, a timely request.  I will endeavour to have such a debate take place.  The Senator also called for a debate on the electoral system, another timely request.  One of the events being discussed to mark the 91st anniversary of the First D&aacute;il involves the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who will speak about the need for change in the electoral system and the preferred options.  It will be interesting to see what he has to say about the matter.  We can have a good debate on the issue here in order to examine what we can do about it.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden welcomed the role played by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, in saving the State millions in funding the cancer programme.  I spoke with the Minister last night about the contributions made yesterday and invited her to return to the House to update us on all aspects of the cancer programme.  She will have no difficulty in allowing such a debate to take place.</P>
        <P>I join Senators Keaveney and Cummins in sending our best wishes to Peadar Heffron.  We should all look forward to enjoying the continued peace resulting from the Good Friday Agreement.  We must do everything we possibly can to enhance and assist that process.  I will have no difficulty in arranging for the Taoiseach to attend the House, as he will do at least once a <Col N="100"/>year, to discuss matters of concern regarding Northern Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement, and all areas within his remit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to wish the Seanad the best for the year.  I also congratulate the new Members and wish them well.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the focus of the work of my Department, employment and competitiveness.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, will deal with issues of the measures we are taking to assist those who have lost their jobs, keeping the unemployed connected with the labour force, improving the skills base and giving further education opportunities.  Ireland is seeing the first signs of recovery at home and in our main international markets.  The Government has taken the necessary steps in the course of the past year to build recovery and to position Ireland to take advantage of this recovery.  The banking system has been supported and stabilised, the public finances have been brought back under control and, according to the National Competitiveness Council, Ireland&rsquo;s current trade-weighted international price competitiveness has improved since April 2008.  Exports have held up and I believe further export growth will form the core of building recovery and getting people back to work.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to set out what we have achieved and what we will deliver over the coming year to drive an export-driven recovery.  The Government has laid the groundwork for recovery, and as we are all aware reducing expenditure is a crucial part of that plan.  In order to build on that groundwork, my Department is refining, driving and implementing forward-looking policies based on targeting resources to position Ireland as a competitive, innovation-driven location in which to do business, grow employment and increase prosperity and well-being.  We are <Col N="101"/>positioning Ireland to respond quickly to international stabilisation and recovery.  We do so in light of the positive GDP forecasts for our main trading partners, the US, the UK and the euro area, for 2010 and projected global economic growth of 3.1% over the coming year.  That is our focus.</P>
        <P>While we are working in the context of an EU recommendation and timeframe to reduce our deficit, we are first and foremost taking action to improve the macro-economic climate and trading environment for our businesses and workers, driving recovery and maintaining living standards.  This is why we took tough corrective budgetary action last year, why we are working to create better-functioning financial systems, why we are taking steps to improve our competitiveness, why we are focused on maintaining and creating jobs and why we are supporting innovation.  Improved competitiveness, increased employment and world-class innovation are the policy-objectives being relentlessly pursued by the Government, and by my Department in particular.</P>
        <P>I want to outline briefly the measures we have taken to address the issue of jobs and unemployment and, in particular, to keep people connected with work.  According to the latest CSO statistics, there are over 1.9 million people in employment in Ireland.  The Government acknowledges that the current conditions in Ireland&rsquo;s labour market, particularly the live register figure, which currently stands at approximately 424,000, very much reflect the international economic downturn and our openness to events affecting the global economy, such as the international financial and banking crisis.  The Government has put in place measures to support more than 80,000 jobs in the enterprise sector under the employment subsidy scheme, as well as having doubled the referral capacity for F&Aacute;S employment supports in 2009 to 147,000 places.  In addition, we are also backing businesses through the difficult period.  The enterprise stabilisation fund has helped keep viable businesses going and people in work.  Some 148 companies were approved for funding of &euro;59 million by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the recent budget also saw the Government announce that it would introduce a new jobs stimulus measure this year.  Under the employers&rsquo; jobs (PRSI) incentive scheme, where an employer creates a new job and takes on a person who has been unemployed for six months or more, the employer will be fully exempted from liability to pay PRSI for the first year of that employment.  This will give employers an 8% to 10% saving on employment costs for each new job created.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is managing this scheme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will describe the other comprehensive measures being take to address the current labour market difficulties.</P>
        <P>I want to turn to recovery measures which will take us along a jobs and growth pathway through investment in new industries and jobs.  Our manufacturing base has changed significantly in recent years and the services sector has grown exponentially.  These factors will be reflected in the new strategies and actions which will be delivered by me and the enterprise agencies on my behalf over the coming year.</P>
        <P>Trade is the cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s economic success and Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base can take some pride in the resilience it has shown in the past two years.  While global exports in goods fell by approximately one third in the first quarter of last year, Irish goods showed a 1% increase for the same period.  While global services exports fell by almost 20% over the same timeframe, Irish services declined by just over 2%.  Indigenous Irish exporters have, remarkably, sustained growth in total exports at almost 4% between 2007 and 2008.  The latest EU trade data for the ten months to October show that Ireland has the second highest trade surplus, exporting &euro;32.6 billion more than we import, behind only Germany.  Ireland&rsquo;s exports have been virtually stable in that same ten months, falling by 2%, while in most other EU countries exports fell by over 20%.  As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my <Col N="102"/>goal is to maintain and enhance the policy environment that has facilitated this resilient performance that will drive export growth.  We know that export growth can help create the jobs required to reduce unemployment, fund public services and manage the national debt.</P>
        <P>We have seen in this recession that the companies that have invested in research and development and ensured their products or services had a competitive edge, are the same companies that have held or grown market share and employment.  This has reinforced our belief that our research and development strategy is the right one.  The IMF envisages a significant return to global growth this year of approximately 3%, which will greatly enhance Ireland&rsquo;s ability to benefit from an export-led recovery.  I remain committed to maintaining a business environment that supports enterprise and encourages further investment, both from Irish industry and foreign investors.  This will be delivered through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development, the county and city enterprise boards, through cross-Border programmes with Northern Ireland and through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  We will also extend the three-year corporate and capital tax exemption for new start-up companies in 2010.</P>
        <P>We consistently strive to diversify our export profile, exploit our talents and opportunities and guard against over-dependence on specific markets.  Our track record on this is strong and is exemplified by the Government&rsquo;s Asia strategy.  In 2005 we set specific targets to be achieved through concerted effort by the relevant Departments and agencies to develop links with eight key economies in the region.  As a result, our exports to Asian target markets have shown strong double digit growth.  My Department is devising and progressing new policies to build on the success of the Asia strategy.  The Government has committed to developing a new action plan for improving trade, investment and tourism links with fast developing markets.  We also need a new export and investment strategy that focuses not only on the new high growth markets that will deliver future dividends, but also on our key trading partners such as the European Union, the UK and the US.  This will ensure a coherent single-minded focus on driving and delivering on Ireland&rsquo;s international economic and commercial interests.</P>
        <P>Our recent export performance has been impressive in the context of the size of our economy compared to others.  We will continue to incentivise enterprises to invest further in high value research and development, to increase exports and create new employment opportunities in communities across the country.  The recent strengthening of the US dollar and sterling against the euro will also help to sustain our key markets abroad.  Exports within the eurozone, which are free from currency exchange risks, are also increasing.</P>
        <P>International investment will continue to be a key driver of employment, exports and growth.  Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax rate of 12.5%, our multilingual skilled workforce and our strategic location for serving markets in Europe has served us well in attracting investors, and will continue to do so.  Many multinational companies are restructuring their global operations, leading to global rationalisation, making it particularly important to work to retain current investment, stimulate expansion and secure new projects.  We are working to develop the opportunities for Ireland to become a key European hub for the international funds industry.  In this regard, I look forward to the proposed changes in the Finance Bill to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s competitive edge.  We will continue to market Ireland as a location of choice for the newcomer and for existing investors.  In September, I launched IDA&rsquo;s new innovation focused overseas market campaign, designed to position Ireland as the pre-eminent location for companies seeking to invest in future innovation.</P>
        <P>During 2009, we won a total of 125 foreign direct investments.  Almost 70% of these investments were from existing IDA clients who are making further investments in this country and reinforcing Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a key strategic global business hub.  In these turbulent economic times it is extremely significant that many of the world&rsquo;s leading companies continue to <Col N="103"/>invest in Ireland in a wide array of activities, including high end manufacturing, global services and research, development and innovation.  In absolute numbers, Ireland is moving up the global rankings with regard to employment in research and development, having risen from 19th to 11th place in the latest global location trends survey, testament that the strategy being pursued is the right one.  During 2010, the IDA will continue its work to capitalise on our quality workforce, our creativity, our international attitude to business, attractive incentives for research and development and our favourable tax climate in order to attract multinationals to set up a base in Ireland as a launch pad for markets in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.</P>
        <P>I am in the process of reviewing a new strategy for the future direction of foreign direct investment, which the IDA has developed and which, subject to my approval, will shortly be published.  This strategy will outline the historic performance of foreign direct investment and its contribution to the development of the economy.  It will set out some specific initiatives which the IDA will undertake to retain existing and secure new foreign direct investment.  We will be identifying new opportunities in the foreign direct investment markets while stressing the importance of restoring our relative international competitiveness if we are to maximise foreign direct investment potential.</P>
        <P>Growing exports and building investments are intrinsically linked to the framework condition in which our businesses operate.  Over the past year, we have taken a number of important steps to improve the environment in which enterprise operates.  More work will be done, particularly on competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s strategy to support businesses, improve competitiveness and sustain employment is aimed at returning to export-led growth.  Improving our competitiveness requires addressing our costs.  To move towards a lower-cost environment, a number of issues are being tackled together.  These include incomes policy, Government-controlled prices and costs, the regulatory burden and the level of competition in our economy.  The Government is acting in a concerted way and with urgency to address all of these issues.</P>
        <P>Ireland is undergoing a sharp price correction and prices and rents are dropping.  As measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, Ireland&rsquo;s inflation rate during 2009 fell by an estimated 1.7% compared with an increase of 0.3% in the eurozone as a whole.  We have also seen a decline in unit labour costs, which has a direct effect on competitiveness.  A further relative improvement in price levels is expected this year, again improving our competitive position.</P>
        <P>Further wage adjustment can drive continued improvement of the overall competitiveness of the Irish economy.  It is essential for our economy to be in a competitive position internationally to reduce the cost of doing business, in addition to taking steps to restore order to the public finances.  On the basis of European Commission forecasts, unit labour costs in Ireland are estimated to have improved by 5% relative to the euro area last year.  The ESRI has recently forecast that, given our current control of costs, productivity should grow by over 3% in 2010.  Combined with necessary, although difficult, wage adjustments, this represents a significant improvement in the overall competitive position of our economy.</P>
        <P>The most recent data from the Central Statistics Office provide further evidence that wages in Ireland are adjusting downwards and that, when the profile of job losses is taken into account, the decline in weekly earnings can be estimated to be in the region of 4% to 5%.  The pension levy has reduced public servants&rsquo; pay by an average of nearly 7%, and there were further reductions arising from the budget in December.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken steps to tackle the relatively high cost of energy for business, and energy prices have decreased.  Following double-digit energy price reductions in May 2009, from last October there has been a further significant reduction in gas prices and a modest <Col N="104"/>reduction in electricity prices for medium-sized business customers.  Gas prices are set to decrease by a further 8% this coming February.</P>
        <P>Overall, all categories of businesses, including SMEs, have benefited from these significant energy price decreases in 2009.  I will continue to work with my colleagues towards reducing costs and driving competition to bring energy costs into line with our competitor countries.</P>
        <P>We have been actively progressing recommendations to increase competition and remove anti-competitive restrictions in the sheltered sectors of the economy.  These include competition in transport, electricity, professional services, pharmacy services and the private rental sector.  Upward-only rent reviews are now banned.</P>
        <P>Preliminary information for 2010 suggests that many local authorities have either frozen their commercial rate or decreased it.  I expect this trend to continue throughout the country.</P>
        <P>My Department is leading the governmental process to ease the administrative burden that regulations can place on businesses.  The high level group on business regulation has already identified more than &euro;20 million worth of administrative cost savings for business in its first report, through cutting out paperwork, revising the rules for small businesses and making better use of on-line services.  The group&rsquo;s 2009 work programme initially contained more than 50 recommendations from businesses.  Twenty-five of these recommendations have already been progressed by the group to the satisfaction of businesses.  In 2009, my Department completed the measurement of administrative burdens in company law, employment law and health and safety law.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the high level group intends to focus on the simplifications that will help us reduce these measured burdens.  As Senators will know, we have a target to reduce business red tape by 25% by 2012.  The continuing dialogue with business is essential for the success of this process.  It is from businesses and business organisations, such as those represented on the high level group, that many of the ideas for simplification will come.  I will welcome and consider any suggestions made by Members in this context.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, the retail sector, more than most, is being severely affected by the current downturn.  Retailers have responded by reducing prices to boost trade.  This is reflected in the consumer price index which shows prices are falling more rapidly in Ireland than in Northern Ireland, the rest of the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the European Union.  This narrowing in the differential in prices is very much to be welcomed and clearly will help the competitiveness of Irish businesses, especially those in the Border region.  The Minister for Finance has reduced the excise duty on alcohol products and has reversed the 0.5% VAT increase imposed last October.  The UK VAT rate increased on 1 January to 17.5%, further reducing the price differential.</P>
        <P>One of the most important issues with which we have still to grapple is access to finance.  I have held regular meetings with the representative bodies of the SME sector and other stakeholders on access to finance.  The Government has taken a series of steps in this regard, including the bank guarantee scheme, the bank recapitalisation scheme, nationalising Anglo Irish Bank and establishing the round table on access to bank credit.</P>
        <P>I set up the credit supply clearing group which brings together the banks, business interests and relevant State bodies in an effort to build understanding and communications between the key stakeholders and to get credit to business flowing again.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, has now been established.  In this context, I welcome the new credit review system announced by the Minister for Finance.  It will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks, particularly for SMEs.  This new system will inform the Government as to what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit to Irish enterprise and, through <Col N="105"/>the publication of the analysis from the review process, help ensure the performance of the banks participating in NAMA is obvious to all.</P>
        <P>I want to highlight the prominence I have given to the ongoing process of reforming public procurement.  I fully recognise the importance of the public sector market for SMEs, particularly now that demand from the private sector has slowed.  Government purchasing, whether by the HSE, local authorities, agencies or Departments, can play an important part in driving SME growth and employment.  I recently introduced new policy guidance across the public sector to ensure a level playing field for all companies wishing to participate in public tendering and to promote greater access for SMEs to public sector contracts.</P>
        <P>When I travel abroad with the representatives of the SMEs, which are superb, they always say to me that they cannot engage in public procurement at home.  We need to strive to solve this.  We facilitate the SME sector to avail of the public procurement opportunities that exist in Ireland.  This fact did not attract the credence it deserved in the context of the new public procurement policy guidelines.  We are still spending astronomical sums of money and it should be to the benefit of our innovative companies.  I will continue to strive vehemently to ensure those companies have access to public procurement staff.</P>
        <P>One of the first points one will note in the document I launched is that the public service is risk averse.  This is natural but there are great opportunities for efficiencies in the context of providing services to the taxpayer.  I will strive to ensure further work is done on public procurement policy.</P>
        <P>While these issues are of immediate importance to Ireland&rsquo;s recovery in the near term, I am making progress on a number of longer-term issues.  For Ireland to compete on global markets for investment and for sustainable export growth to be achieved, we need to be relentless in ensuring our economy has the infrastructure, skills and knowledge to compete and win.  This means we need to re-engage publicly with the debate on productivity.  Continued progress is necessary on our long-term infrastructural needs, such as next generation network broadband, sustainable and cost-effective energy networks and suitable transport links.  These are all important to the country&rsquo;s future growth.</P>
        <P>The development of the knowledge economy and the focus on innovation are essential facets of our reputation as a creative and responsive economy.  It is in this regard that we are committed to continuing to invest in research and development, as has been clearly articulated and demonstrated.  My Department is determined to ensure incentives for businesses to undertake research and development are strong and that Ireland will continue to invest in building its reputation as a leading knowledge economy.  A renewed focus is correctly being placed on stronger commercial outputs and the efficiency of investment.  As in other areas of public spending, the State is seeking more from less in regard to this expenditure item and the Government is working continuously to ensure this happens.</P>
        <P>Supporting innovation as a driver of export growth is critical to sustaining enterprises, maintaining current jobs and driving job creation.  The budget sees the total spend on science, technology and innovation exceed &euro;593 million, with core investments being prioritised.  The allocation of &euro;297.3 million for science, technology and innovation in my Department&rsquo;s Vote compares favourably with the 12% overall reduction in the Government&rsquo;s capital allocation in the budget.  In protecting Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s funding the Government recognises the pivotal role it plays in the framework for sustainable economic renewal as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s policy document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy.  My Department&rsquo;s policy approach is focused on deriving maximum commercial benefit from the investment made to date.  The decision to create a single funding stream for science, technology and innovation will greatly enhance the efficiency of the spend and the State&rsquo;s ability to re-prioritise as economic <Col N="106"/>circumstances change when the economy recovers.  Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy and the programme for Government recognise the importance of the productive public and private investment in research and development and intangible assets.  We will shortly be examining the recommendations of the innovation task force in the context of the Finance Bill to determine how we can further enhance the incentives for research and development and intellectual property activity in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The smart economy framework emphasises our strong commitment to the pursuit of a green economy involving the transition to a low-carbon economy.  I am determined to ensure the opportunities for enterprise investment and jobs which arise from this transition will be vigorously pursued.  This vision for the development of the green economy has clear growth prospects for green enterprise to meet domestic needs and also to profit from exportable products and services.  Ireland has demonstrable competence in these areas.  I will ensure the correct framework conditions are in place to support growth in this sector.  The report of the high level group on green enterprise, launched in December, is being implemented across Departments and we will shortly see results in many areas from the measures in this green stimulus package.  This is a large and growing sector worldwide and the high level group identified the potential to create about 80,000 jobs in Ireland in coming years.  This is an achievable target and I am overseeing implementation of this strategy to drive the development of an internationally competitive green economy in Ireland.  Every other country in the world is going green.  Ireland, therefore, must use its competences and natural resources to ensure greater creativity in this area and focus on what it does well.</P>
        <P>Despite its difficulties, Ireland continues to score well in some key relevant international indices.  It was rated first for foreign direct investment and corporate taxes and fourth for ease of doing business in the OECD report, Doing Business.  It was rated 14 out of 127 in the 2009 edition of Forbes &ldquo;Best Countries to do Business&rdquo;.  Ireland continues to be a pro-business economy, with one of the lowest tax wedges in the OECD and a commitment to maintaining corporation tax at its current level.</P>
        <P>The answer to Ireland&rsquo;s challenge remains a return to export-led growth.  That is what drove the economy in the foundation stages of the boom.  In Ireland exports mean jobs.  Our export engine of high quality, competitive companies is fundamental to our return to economic prosperity.  The courage and application shown by the measures we are taking send a strong and clear message to the international community that Ireland will not hide from the challenges it faces and is positioning itself for the future.</P>
        <P>I hope I have demonstrated both the progress the Government has made to date with the economy and our serious intent to continue on this road.  We are witnessing extraordinary economic changes.  Ireland is one of the countries that have made some of the most difficult adjustments.  However, we are serious and determined about completing the adjustment, a task that is well under way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for her comprehensive address.  We could not have chosen a more opportune time to discuss the issues of employment and competitiveness.  We have just begun the second decade of the 21st century with our unemployment figure heading towards 500,000 from 180,000 in January 2008.  At the same time tax revenues have dropped by over &euro;6 billion.  The effect of the deep wound to our society inflicted by such high levels of unemployment is not just social and financial; there is also the loss of skills and entrepreneurial acumen.</P>
        <P>Over Christmas most Members will have had opportunities to speak with local businesspeople to hear what was really happening in the trenches.  Some of us involved in businesses <Col N="107"/>have spent time in those same trenches during the past few weeks.  We have seen nothing but grim despair and a real sense that things may get much worse before they get better.  We have also had time to fully digest the implications of the recent budget.  One can only conclude that it offers no real hope to businesspeople or the thousands lining up in the dole queues every week.  I do not know how we would have expected better from a Government which had created an unemployment task force which itself was unemployed for the first ten months of its existence.  The Government is now bereft of ideas and vision, while Ireland, sadly, returns to the old safety valve of emigration in an effort to lower the unemployment figure.  Against a background of having almost 90,000 people under the age of 25 years unemployed, budget 2010 simply ignored the issue of youth unemployment, made little or no effort to stimulate job creation and slashed jobseeker&rsquo;s payments to those aged under 25.  The message to our young people was loud and clear &mdash; &ldquo;Leave Ireland&rdquo;.  If they want a future, they should go abroad because there is no future here for them.</P>
        <P>One cannot blame anyone for being disillusioned, yet we must rise above the despair to offer vision and hope to our young people and the nation.  In offering this hope the Government must be convinced to make a fundamental change in its mindset.  To date, all of its focus has been on cuts in expenditure, not job creation to boost revenue.  Every job lost costs the Government &euro;20,000 extra per annum.  It is perfectly obvious that the unprecedented rise in unemployment, delivering with it the twin evils of higher welfare payments and lower tax revenues, has been the main reason for the deterioration in the public finances.  We urgently need a total refocusing on job creation to restart the economy, a challenge which has been the focal point of Fine Gael policy development in the past 12 months.  To kick-start the process of job creation, we need, first, to immediately restore the flow of credit to small and medium businesses.  Despite numerous assurances before and after the establishment of NAMA, this financial lifeline to businesses is still not in place.  Second, we need to examine how competitive Ireland is globally.  Our success in attracting foreign direct investment will soon dwindle if this issue is not addressed.  Third, we need to invest in our national infrastructure.  It requires much work to be done on it.  While many want to work, we need to be innovative in linking the two together in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</P>
        <P>Last weekend Dr. Alan Ahearne, chief financial adviser to the Minister for Finance, in a lecture at NUI Galway indicated approximately &euro;19 billion of loans would be transferred to NAMA next month, with the remainder to be transferred by the end of September.  He said that when the risky loans were taken off the banks&rsquo; balance sheets and they were recapitalised, the banking sector would be well able to meet the needs of the economy.  At a conservative estimate, this means it will be early 2011 before the banks get around to lending again to small businesses, assuming that they will begin to lend again, as there is nothing in the NAMA legislation to oblige them to do so.  Unfortunately, early 2011 will be far too late for hundreds of businesses.  Every employers&rsquo; group, from the Small Firms Association to ISME to the Restaurants Association of Ireland, continues to point to the crisis in business lending.  The Government immediately needs to take a firm hand with the banks to ensure credit lines are restored immediately, not in 12 months.  If this requires some kind of Government-backed working capital guarantee scheme, it should be seriously considered.  Such a scheme is already working in other countries and could work here.  The recapitalisation that has occurred should have led to some money finding its way to small businesses but this has not happened.  If further recapitalisation is to take place, the Government must seek far more binding assurances that lending will begin immediately.</P>
        <P>The issue of competitiveness should form a central plank of any recovery plan.  The Government needs to be more proactive in this regard and be the main driver in lowering our cost base.  Efforts with regard to banking and the public finances would collapse without the keystone <Col N="108"/>of improved competitiveness to form the bridge to recovery.  Far from being a constraint on competitiveness, the Government can be one of its key drivers.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council produced its most recent report last September and it does not make pretty reading.  It produced 130 indicators of competitiveness, colour-coding them green, amber and red.  On 40% of the indicators, Ireland is in the red zone.  If one adds the amber ratings, the figure rises to 75% in need of attention.  This is red alert territory but it has not triggered a serious response from the Government.  Our competitiveness in international markets has deteriorated by 35% during the past eight years and our export share in the markets in which we trade has fallen each year of the past six years.  In terms of goods, we have lost almost 40% of our market share.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Many policy weaknesses identified in the report have now come home to roost in an alarming performance, in particular in regard to non-pay business costs.  More than three quarters of these costs are flashing red and the remainder are amber.  Many of the chronic areas, including electricity, telephone, broadband, waste disposal and health insurance are directly in the control of Government.  Excessive professional fees also figure prominently, with accountancy, legal and IT fees all way out of line with our international competitors.  The report also concludes that wage levels in Ireland are among the most expensive in the world, substantially ahead of competitors like the US, the UK, Italy and France.  In key skills areas such as engineering, finance and IT, Ireland ranks among the most expensive in Europe.</P>
        <P>How are we to confront the challenge of competitiveness?  A focus on wage cuts alone is simply not fair.  A serious assault on competitiveness must also confront boardroom pay, monopoly profits, rents, professional fees, State charges and utility prices.  I welcome the recent change in rent policy.  We urgently need an action plan on competitiveness.  This is a real challenge where social partnership could show its worth.  The argument can be validly made that cutting earnings is in itself deflationary.  However, this is not an argument for refusing to confront our excessive costs.  Indeed, it points to another necessary element of a pact on competitiveness.  As the savings in the cost base are achieved and the cost of delivering public services is reduced we will then be able to afford to set aside more money for investment in the infrastructures which are so clearly failing us.  This allows us to attack our competitiveness problems, high costs and productivity impaired by poor infrastructure, from two sides.</P>
        <P>It is worrying to learn that in the run up to the recent budget almost every party, except Fianna F&aacute;il, included some sort of State funded stimulus package in its plans for recovery.  Even the Green Party proposed a &euro;3 billion stimulus for the green economy.  However, what should be another central plank of our recovery was omitted completely from the budget.  As I mentioned earlier, Ireland is a country in which much work remains to be done and we have a lot of people who want to work.  One can only imagine the jobs that could have been created had we decided to invest &euro;4 billion in our national infrastructure rather than investing it in the zombie bank that is Anglo Irish Bank.  This morning, we hear that the same bank, which is little more than a private investment club for the elite of this country, might require another &euro;10 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money to survive.  The argument for Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s supposed systemic importance rests entirely on a belief, frequently voiced by Government, that depositors and other creditors would have abandoned all Irish banks if even the worst of them, Anglo Irish Bank, went under, an argument which I do not believe is credible.  We have given &euro;7 billion to the banks, including Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, &euro;4 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and &euro;50 billion to NAMA.  Why can the Government not pump a miserly &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion a year into our national infrastructure over the next two years?  It remains wedded <Col N="109"/>to the idea that it must sit and wait with its hands tied behind its back for the banks to lend, which is a huge fallacy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are many areas in which thousands of jobs could be created and which are still in global demand.  There is a huge need to improve public infrastructure.  I agree with the Green Party that there are thousands of &ldquo;green&rdquo; jobs that could be created.  The Government is pouring billions of euro into research clusters yet very few of the innovative projects produced by these clusters are being selected by Government for mainstream investment and job creation simply because there is no investment capital to be had.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s NewERA plan proposes <?oasys _dc28- ?>to address this problem and to immediately kick-start our economy.  That plan has been described by Mr. Jim Power and many others as detailed, costed and relatively easy to implement.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>What we must demand of our Government is a complete change in mindset.  It must quickly realise that it is not our economic collapse that is causing unemployment and must acknowledge that unemployment is the root cause of our problems.  If the Government persists in prioritising cuts which will depress the economy further and destroy more jobs then this time next year the public finances will still be in tatters and unemployment will have hit 500,000.  We cannot allow this to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my friend and colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, and congratulate her on the overview she has given us in terms of her endeavours in regard to what lies ahead for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under her stewardship.  I wish her well in achieving same.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I usually have the highest regard for the contributions made by Senator Cannon his contribution today is a little disappointing and politicised.  It clearly did not acknowledge some of the good work done by Government.  There is no doubt that 2009 was a difficult year for the political system and structures and, in particular, the Government which faced international difficulties compounded by global difficulties and other issues in terms of our role in Europe, national financial difficulties and the need to ensure we continued to have a functioning banking system.  The initial part of Senator Cannon&rsquo;s contribution does not reflect in true fashion what was actually achieved by Government.  The Government entered 2009 with a great deal of baggage in terms of the difficulties we faced and was required to address important and crucial issues in the interests of this country.  It did so by addressing the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty and our financial situation by putting through one of the most difficult budgets in the history of this State, all of which should be acknowledged and not politicised.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the T&aacute;naiste and her colleagues, in particular the Minister for Finance, on taking what were tough, correct and brave decisions.  I would like to have heard Senator Cannon&rsquo;s contribution were he still a member of the party through which he was elected to this House.  I believe such a contribution would have been totally different from that which he made, which was clearly politicised.  Given his calibre and intellect and in terms of what he is able to offer the House, I believe his contribution today was disappointing.  I believe Senator Cannon&rsquo;s contribution would have differed greatly from that which he made were he still a Member from this side of the House.</P>
        <P>We are all aware that we have suffered a combination of international and external negative economic factors which have had a critical impact on the Irish economy during the past 18 to 24 months.  There is no point crying about from where we have come or whether a particular decision made by a particular person, regardless of the position he or she held or holds, brought us to where we are.  The public wants us to move on from that phase.  They want to hear positive contributions.  It is important that we acknowledge and learn from past mistakes and that we stomach the medicine in this regard.  We must learn from our mistakes, move on and remain positive.  We must be empowered with confidence to move forward.</P><Col N="110"/>
        <P>The good news is that the business cycle is changing.  The fundamental attraction of Ireland as a place to do business is returning.  The international economy has exited recession and recent indicators suggest that economic activity in this country is, as the Minister also indicated this morning, turning the corner.  The number of people losing their jobs has stabilised and the appalling crisis in terms of job losses which commenced early in 2009 has almost come to an end.  I support the undercurrent of the Minister&rsquo;s contribution, namely, we need to ensure that we maintain our attractiveness as a location of multinational investment, indigenous industry and enterprise and jobs and export-led growth.  It is only through doing so that we can earn our way as a country with profitable enterprise, growing employment and the means for the State to provide jobs and services for those in need.</P>
        <P>In the limited time available I want to refer to an issue also mentioned by the Minister in her contribution, namely, small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs.  Small businesses are being starved of credit and working capital.  That is the feedback.  In fairness, Senator Cannon also referred to what he had picked up on the ground during the Christmas recess.  We all are picking up the same message.  I have had the opportunity to meet representatives of some of the main banks through my membership of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and they are giving us a slightly different story from what we are picking up on the ground.  They are also being open and honest and stating that if we bring individual cases to their attention, they will have them looked at.  However, there is much more to be done than bringing individual cases to their attention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is the nonsense of whether an inquiry or an application was made.  If something is recorded, it is deemed to be an application for credit or a loan; if it is not, it is considered to be an inquiry.  We need to move from this space to the new enterprise-driven sector with a low pain threshold.  We do not want people to run around.  That is not the way we should do business.  We should help one another and be positive.</P>
        <P>I made contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to indicate that I was meeting a number of people to discuss enterprise.  However, there was not a positive reaction &mdash; that there would be a person available to feed into the discussions of this group.  This is frustrating.  We need to take a step back to look at how we react.  We should look at them with a fresh pair of eyes and be prepared to be brave and make correct decisions.</P>
        <P>The banks have overreacted because they were exposed.  If the House will excuse my use of the phrase, they are covering their asses.  That is probably unparliamentary language but that is what the banks are doing.  In some cases it is a reaction to the capital constraints but in others there appears to be an unwillingness to extend credit where there is the slightest business or trade risk.  Even though businesses may be trading properly, their credit facilities are not being renewed or expanded as was the case.  As a result, companies are at risk of failure because they cannot access credit.  This is unacceptable, particularly as the taxpayer has already contributed to the recapitalisation of the banks.  I welcome the credit appeals mechanism announced for SMEs, farm enterprises and sole traders.  I ask, however, that we ensure the mechanism works, that we bring some body of people together to ensure it does and that we provide for some asset testing.</P>
        <P>The other aspect we should welcome is the cost reductions, to which the T&aacute;naiste again referred.  The reductions in energy prices which she mentioned, among others, are welcome.  However, we must continue to reduce the cost base faced by small and large businesses and consumers.  In particular, we need to ensure there are incentives to reduce costs and increase productivity and service delivery in all areas and sectors, both private or public.  This means, for example, that State-sponsored bodies cannot be immune from the pay adjustments being <Col N="111"/>made elsewhere in the economy.  There is an enormous number of such bodies.  A clear message must be sent to them that their rates of pay, from the top down, must not be excessive, that their overheads must match their requirements and that their manning levels and procedures must be compatible with the efficient and effective delivery of services.  The message must be that all wages and salaries paid from the public purse need to be reduced in line with the reductions in pay and other payments already suffered by public servants and private sector workers.  This is the only way we can ensure strong competition in any area we need to revisit and review.</P>
        <P>There is one other matter I want to mention in support of the T&aacute;naiste, that is, the need to ensure we continue to sell the message internationally that Ireland is open for business and that we have taken the corrective action necessary.  In that regard, I want to see additional funding being provided for all of the development agencies.</P>
        <P>Unemployment is one issue on which I wanted to touch.  We are given different figures.  The one that is quoted regularly is that of the 420,000 on the live register.  I often look at the quarterly national household survey.  Its latest seasonally adjusted figure, for the period July to September 2009, indicates that there were 279,000 unemployed.  The T&aacute;naiste also mentioned the figure of 1.9 million employed in the third quarter of 2009.  In the light of what has happened, these figures are not bad.  However, there is one aspect that concerns me.  Irrespective of whether the figure one picks is 279,000 or 420,000, which figure includes seasonal and other workers, there is one sector, the community and voluntary sector which I have mentioned previously, in which we should be able to give people hope.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have run out of time, I will be happy to write to the T&aacute;naiste on the matter.  We should be able to encourage those concerned to participate in the community and help them to learn and train through voluntary activity while they are unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the T&aacute;naiste to discuss this important topic.  I apologise for not being present earlier but it was in the interests of hearing everything she had to say.  I was about to leave my office when she stood up and I said to myself it was better to wait and listen to everything she had to say rather than leave and miss a few minutes of her contribution.</P>
        <P>I want to focus on the issue of competitiveness.  Competitiveness is a function of the cost of labour, transport, rent charges, rates, service charges, utility charges, etc., but it is also a function of output and scale, in which regard it is important to be able to spread fixed costs and overheads in terms of the price of a product.  It is because Ireland is such a small country, with a small market and a small population, that exports become so important.  It is important for us to resolve the scale issue by focusing more on our exports potential and, from a public policy point of view, for the Government and the Department to facilitate companies in getting over this hurdle and exporting their products.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Annual Competitiveness Report 2009, Volume Two, which has just been released.  With the previous report &mdash; we received volume one in August &mdash; it is a welcome contributor to our understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s status when it comes to competitiveness and can be used as a driver of change in public policy.  It highlights the most important competitiveness issues facing the economy.  I am also encouraged by the statement in the Associated Press release made by the chairman of the National Competitiveness Council, Dr. Don Thornhill, that Ireland can have a bright future, provided we confront the challenges we face and exploit the opportunities to create a more competitive economy.  We must approach the challenge of competitiveness with a positive can-do attitude, otherwise we will not be successful.</P><Col N="112"/>
        <P>Our ability to recover economically and our future prosperity in terms of job creation will depend on our ability to compete in international markets.  This is something I have stated previously and I have heard the T&aacute;naiste mention it: we must improve our export performance.  We are likely to see growth in other economies with which we have traditionally traded such as the United States, the United Kingdom and countries on mainland Europe before we witness a return to growth here.  It is essential, therefore, that we can tap into this at the earliest possible time.  Productivity improvement is essential to allow us to compete in these markets again.  Competitiveness improved during 2009, as the Minister stated, and this is positive.  However, the recent report contained additional comment to the effect that this was not brought about by any structural changes in the economy but rather by the effects of the recession and that it should not give us any comfort.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The priority policy issues that must be addressed are to create jobs and tackle unemployment.  I welcome some of the comments from the Minister in terms of some initiatives she is taking.  This must be the number one issue.  The haemorrhage of jobs has been a most significant contributor to the state of the public finances.  In many ways the Government has been too focused on the issues of banking and the public finances &mdash; obviously that must be done &mdash; but to the relative neglect of the unemployment issue.  Training and education initiatives must be prioritised to enhance the skills of those in employment and increase the employability of those who are unemployed.  An emphasis on both is essential if productivity improvement is to be achieved.  We must also incentivise individuals, perhaps by way of tax reliefs, who invest in their own upskilling and education.  Many working people in low paying jobs would love to learn new skills at night but cannot afford the fees and we must examine ways to encourage this.  We must incentivise enterprise to invest in training and development, an area where Irish industry falls well below international best practice.  One of the recommendations of the Global Irish Economic Forum at Farmleigh House, was to invest at least 3% of GDP annually in research and development, a recommendation which should be pursued vigorously by the Government.  There must be a focus on innovation at all levels of our economy, a point to which the Minister referred several times in her speech.</P>
        <P>We should also put a greater emphasis on innovation through all stages of our education system, a point I have raised at the Joint Committee on Education and Science.  I believe innovative thinking can be taught.  We should examine the possibility of putting innovation modules throughout the education system including first, second third and fourth level sectors.  Another recommendation from the Farmleigh forum was to implement the innovation fund announced in the document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy, and this should be prioritised.  We must prioritise infrastructural investment to support enterprise and for its immediate employment potential.  It is essential to examine the capital programme to establish what can deliver jobs in the shortest possible time and to examine the infrastructure deficit, which must be addressed as well.  This includes such issues as broadband, energy, roads and schools.  Co-ordination of such activities must be strived for at all times to achieve savings where possible.  There is a need for world class as opposed to the third world levels of broadband that many citizens enjoy.  There are rural parts of Dublin not 15 miles from here where a broadband service is not available.  I was contacted by a constituent who informed me he is trying to work from home.  He has serious business ideas and he is set up but he lives in an area where he cannot get broadband, which is scandalous in this day and age and the matter must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to credit flow.  Credit flow from banks to viable business is essential if we are to achieve our potential for recovery.  The Government must take full advantage of the stakes it now holds in the banks to ensure this takes place.  We must improve public service <Col N="113"/>delivery through a major reform agenda.  Although the Government may have set back this potential, possibly irreversibly, in the negotiations before Christmas, the unions showed a willingness to address this issue in the right context.  It is now up to the Government to recover the trust of the unions and I wish it well in this regard.</P>
        <P>Skills shortages in our economy were highlighted in the competitiveness report, including in the food and drink sector, where process efficiency and commercialisation capability have been identified; in the medical technology sector, where there is a shortage of skills in regulation and quality control; in the chemicals and pharmaceutical sector, where skill sets are seen as being possibly too narrow; in the ICT, information and communications technology, sector, where it seems there is a lack of skilled graduates; in the financial services sector, where higher specialisation and skills in innovation are seen as lacking; in the environmental sector, where skills related to new technologies are seen to be lacking; and in internationally traded services, where generic skills, humanities and social science skills and hybrid technical business skills are seen to be lacking.  I was astonished that such skills shortages could be lacking in Ireland today, some of which would appear to be basic.  There is a serious gap which must be tackled urgently by the Government in terms of encouragement in this area.</P>
        <P>Productivity improvements can be brought about through education, training, incentivising technology and addressing capacity issues and issues of scale to which I have referred previously.  Quality improvement and a focus on doing a job right first time is important as well.  Many companies spend too much time re-doing and re-working, which adds to the costs of business.  There should be a continued focus on this area of quality improvement in Irish industry.  A continuous improvement culture will deliver continuous improvements in productivity.  Every process must be examined and waste must be eliminated from our enterprises.</P>
        <P>There are many fine, experienced people who are experts in these areas but who are now unemployed.  Such people have received thousands of euro worth of training from multinational companies over several decades.  Certain people who have worked for ten, 20 or 30 years with multinational companies are now unemployed.  There is potential to be tapped in this area and the possibility should be considered.  There should be a strategy to identify such people who may be receiving social welfare payments for doing nothing.  How can we creatively use such people?  They could be used by Departments and public bodies in activities such as process mapping, as part of a transformation and service improvement initiative that has been discussed previously.  I have spoken to some such people and they are interested in making a contribution.  This could be remarkably cost effective in comparison to the option of using consultants, the option of choice for Departments in the recent good times and a very costly option indeed.  The Minister should consider exploring the opportunities this would present.</P>
        <P>The culture at enterprise level in Irish industry has changed for the good but at too slow a pace.  Management and workers must work together and must not be engaged in combat if the potential of the enterprise is to be realised.  There is a role for trade unions in providing leadership in this regard.  I recognise there is a commitment at the top in the main unions in Ireland but that must trickle down to enterprise level.</P>
        <P>State support for productivity initiatives such as world class management, excellence through people and gain-sharing initiatives may be useful in this regard and may assist in driving productivity gains as well.  A partnership approach is essential but very often there is a lack of trust which must be addressed.  This support used to be available to manufacturing companies but I am unsure to what extent it is still available.  Such support makes a difference but it must be results-driven and funded and care must be taken that resources are not squandered.  This can take place easily if the correct controls are not in place.  The cost of doing business in Ireland, especially the costs of energy, waste and professional services must be brought down. <Col N="114"/> Energy costs in Ireland are too high.  This is the message we hear from a variety of business interests who have made submissions to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, of which I am a member.  This must be addressed urgently if we are to recover competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The report states there are positive signs in respect of the costs of doing business here but few examples are given.  One such example is that rental costs are reducing but we need more.  Local authority charges have a major impact and they are a major factor for businesses throughout the country.  In this regard I congratulate Fingal County Council, the local authority that covers my area and which is Labour Party controlled, for the double digit percentage reductions introduced this year to assist business.  This should be mirrored throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I refer to pay levels, a matter to which the Minister adverted.  The competitiveness report acknowledges there is an adjustment underway in pay levels.  Unlike previous competitiveness reports from Forf&aacute;s and the National Competitiveness Council, it is notable that this report does not call for a reduction in income levels throughout the economy.  There is no call for a cut in the minimum wage.  Many employer bodies and people on the political right in Ireland have been engaging in a campaign to reduce the minimum wage rate in recent times.  This is a campaign to which the Labour Party is inextricably opposed.  The challenge for Ireland in respect of wage costs is to focus on the other elements that contribute to productivity, not on wage rates.  The NCC has made its recommendations and many other recommendations emerged from the Farmleigh summit.  The Government is not short of advice.  It is now time to facilitate, encourage and implement it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House for this timely and necessary debate on employment and competitiveness, recognising the other demands on her time.  Issues of employment and unemployment are the most serious issues of economic concern this year.  In a very short time we have gone from a situation of full employment to unacceptably high levels of unemployment.  While these have not been and are unlikely to reach the levels feared, they are still far too high.  It is to be hoped that as they peak some time this year we can start the process of reinstating the high numbers in our workforce to match the peak of more than 2 million some years ago.  At present some 1.8 million people are in the workforce.  Within a 12-month period there has been a considerable turnover among the 430,000 who are unemployed.  For example, in 2009 150,000 of those who came on to the unemployment register found alternative employment within the year.  That indicates some healthy signs within our present economy and shows where it is heading in the medium term.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To bring about the economic recovery and subsequent increased employment levels, the first thing this Government had to do was get public finances back in check.  The 2010 budget and the Finance Bill which will be published in the coming weeks are intended to achieve that.  When we reach peak unemployment this year we will be able to start the return to previous levels of employment on the basis of policies already being implemented.   Chief among those is that we cannot go back to the employment policy that existed from the start of the past decade until 2007 and the change in economic circumstances.  For example, the number of people who were engaged in construction is not something we will see in a new economy that will employ people differently.  The emphasis must be on re-skilling and new skilling and on focusing our education system to ensure appropriate skills are given to the people entering into the workforce and re-skilling those currently in the workforce or those who need to re-enter it.</P>
        <P>There are other positive signs.  The fact that our exports are doing well, that we have a positive balance of payments and the contribution being made by multinational companies are all signs of hope.  Others, including the T&aacute;naiste, addressed the recent report of the National <Col N="115"/>Competitiveness Council.  However, I would not put forward the negative slant that was put on it by many of the Opposition speakers in the debate so far.  In my view, this report is largely optimistic.  It does not pull punches in saying where we need to improve but in general terms states we are going in the right direction and can correct what needs to be corrected quite easily if appropriate decisions are made.  The report discusses the positive nature of our exports and the fact that our competitiveness has improved.  One of the effects of the Celtic tiger economy was that we achieved wage levels that, in comparison with those of our competitor economies, can no longer be justified, especially in the aftermath of an international recession.  This means that for people on high wages difficult decisions must be made and lower wages accepted in the short term so that our economy can grow and become more competitive.</P>
        <P>Another criticism has been made regarding the Government&rsquo;s policy on job creation and reversing unemployment trends, namely, there is no Government policy.  When one considers the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s speech, that is obviously untrue.  A number of policy documents and polices are being implemented by the Government that identify the type and number of jobs that can be achieved in the next decade.  Actions to support the smart economy, purely in terms of infrastructure, envisage 30,000 jobs being created over this period.  There is a concrete proposal for an international content service centre that will support the development of 1,000 digital content companies.  This would produce a hoped-for 10,000 jobs in that period.  My party has been subject to much derision regarding our contribution to economic policy and its success but the green enterprise group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator say &ldquo;success&rdquo;?</P>

	<P>Yes, success.  If Senator Buttimer chose to listen for once&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I listen all the time.  That is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Senator opens his mouth his ears seem to close.  I encourage him to listen, at least.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am waiting, like St. Paul, to be converted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The green enterprise group has identified 80,000 jobs and the knowledge society task force has identified 30,000 to be created in the next decade.  Some 15,000 of those jobs have already been created.  The biggest contribution in new jobs has come about through green economy jobs.  The Senator might not be prepared to acknowledge that but it is the fact in respect of labour market policies in this country and I am proud it is happening.</P>
        <P>The overall number of jobs to be created through the green and smart economies over the next decade is 127,000.  The throwing out of figures can be fatuous in debates like this.  I note that Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy document speaks about 100,000 jobs being created.  Nobody seems to talk about 67 or 463 jobs being created in any particular period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Boyle spoke about 15,000 jobs a minute ago.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is somewhat fatuous to talk about exact numbers of jobs.  However, the reality is the direction in which employment policies are going.  If I may, I shall encapsulate that in terms of how we can do the little things, which is something I heard in Senator Ryan&rsquo;s contribution.  This applies even in areas such as public procurement.   The idea of green procure<Col N="116"/>ment, which is in the renewed programme for Government, is that if we buy smartly, locally and using the maximum number of inputs that are created and used in this country, we will maximise employment potential.  The Government is in the best position to do that, as are local government and State agencies.  Ultimately, it is about how we use whatever spending power we have.  It is a much diminished spending power so we must ensure we use it as wisely as possible to maximise the employment potential I believe exists in this country.  The policies that are in place are the policies to tackle.  When levels of unemployment peak this year we will manage to achieve more sustainable levels of employment in the immediate future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, to the House.  I am sorry my friend, Senator Boyle, is leaving because he is right.  We can throw out figures about jobs and proposals.  The reality is that up to 2008 we enjoyed a period of increasing competitiveness.  Why then, between 2001 and 2008, were we 20% above the eurozone average in our consumer prices?  Were our costs too high, affecting labour costs?  I agree with Senator Ryan.  I do not believe we should look at the minimum wage and cut it.  The people who are on the minimum wage are on the breadline as it is.  They are struggling.</P>
        <P>Critical to our recovery as a nation is that we restore our competitiveness.  That cannot be a slogan or a catchcall.  It must be implemented by Government now rather than later.  In requiring action, we need to look at our cost base.  I love phraseology such as Senator Boyle mentioned &mdash; &ldquo;to do business&rdquo; or being &ldquo;open to business&rdquo;.  If, as a country, we are serious about being open for business, about wanting to attract foreign direct investment and using Ireland as a benchmark or model for good employment, we need to see real action. What happened in the aviation industry this week does not help.  The Government&rsquo;s collapse of social partnership before the budget also does not help.  I repeat what I have said previously and again this morning on the Order of Business, never in the history of the State has social partnership been needed more.  However, social partnership must also have a new pillar.  It must include Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who, in the case of the Opposition and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, have been sidelined.  I appeal to union leaders and the Government to sit down again to talks and to work together to protect, retain and create jobs.</P>
        <P>We need a vision and leadership.  People speak about hope but the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s remarks, some of which I agree with, contained little vision.  Jobs and unemployment are the greatest source of worry for thousands of couples and individuals in our society today.  As Senator Cannon correctly said, people who are worried about the future or who are out of work are looking for hope and inspiration.  Senator Callely&rsquo;s remarks about Senator Cannon were disingenuous.  He should apologise to Senator Cannon for them.  Senator Cannon, in a fine address, painted a clear, cogent picture of the reality in Ireland today.  He is not tainted by being a member of the Government or with blinkered vision.  He tells it as it is, and I commend him for that.  He is right.  Our current position is the consequence of Government policy and inaction.  It would suit Members on the opposite side of the House, who are not present, to forget about the past and air-brush it, much as they did for a long time with Charles Haughey.  Fianna F&aacute;il is good at air-brushing when it suits.  Its policies have put us in this mess, and we must learn from that.  Any good business carries out spot analyses.  That is what the Government must do.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator Boyle&rsquo;s comments about the Green Party input into Government and the creation of 15,000 new jobs in the green economy.  However, it is time the Green Party stopped being the mudguard or the stabilisers on the Government bicycle and became the saddle or gears.  It should drive the Government rather than be the back seat passenger.</P>
        <P>I welcome the reduction in prices.  Unfortunately, however, some of the Government controlled or regulated prices remain high.  I refer to electricity prices, road tolls, bus and train <Col N="117"/>fares and other Government charges.  What has the Government said to the regulators and semi-State bodies about reducing costs and fares for the taxpayer?  Senator Cannon correctly said that protection and retention of jobs must be the priority.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan spoke about Fingal County Council.  My local authority in Cork city froze the commercial rate.  What can local authorities do now?  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, say that as Fine Gael or the Labour Party have control of local authorities, they can do as they wish.  They cannot.  The Government allocates a certain amount of money to local authorities but that funding has been cut.  When charges are frozen and there is a reduction in the money to provide a service, what will happen?  There will be a reduction in services for people.  There is a need to re-examine the model of funding for local authorities and how the authorities can generate income.</P>
        <P>Many of my friends are involved in small and medium enterprises.  They seek working capital but in many cases they receive little or no help from the banks and, in some cases, the Revenue Commissioners.  The banks must start assisting job creation and retention.  In every city and town one will see properties for sale, to let or lying idle.  Retailers are in serious trouble.  The property bubble is over.  Exports were replaced as the key growth promoter by the twin engines of the construction industry and consumer spending, which are now at an end.  I agree with Senator Boyle that we can never return to a situation where the construction industry is the only saving grace in the economy or where there is a property bubble in the housing sector.  That was a false situation and has led us to the current position.</P>
        <P>I hope there will be a focus on job creation, that there will be a reduction in the cost of energy and that local authorities will be assisted, given that many of them have frozen or reduced commercial rates.  We need an innovative jobs programme.  We have a great, extraordinarily well educated, young workforce.  Thankfully, we have invested in research and development, and I commend the Government to an extent in this regard.  I agree with what the T&aacute;naiste said about that.  We have done many things that are right but I wonder if we have learned from the bad decisions, so we can move forward to create employment.  That is the task.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has put forward, in its NewERA document, an innovative policy to create employment.  It has been well received by people such as the economist, Mr. Jim Power.  It is time the Government put forward a plan for job creation, which has not yet happened.  I hope there will also be a renewal of social partnership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, my county colleague.  He is a regular visitor to this Chamber and is always worth hearing.  I also compliment the T&aacute;naiste on her wide-ranging speech.  It gave a comprehensive outline of what has been achieved in very difficult circumstances.</P>
        <P>I welcome the contributions from Opposition Members.  They highlighted certain actions they believe should be taken but they also gave recognition to what has been achieved by the Government in very trying times.  The levels of employment and unemployment have been outlined.  It is disappointing that unemployment has gone so high but it is impressive that the figures have stabilised and, indeed, are on a downward trend, which is welcome.  Hopefully, this trend will continue.  I have little doubt that it will, due to the policies being put in place by the T&aacute;naiste and the Government.</P>
        <P>I received some material from the IDA which shows that it is still contributing significantly to the economy.  It is still recognised as a body that has the trust of many companies.  Client companies contribute significantly to the economy and account for &euro;110 billion in exports, or 70% of our total exports.  That is welcome.  In 2009, a total of 125 direct investments were <Col N="118"/>secured, of which almost 70% were from existing IDA clients.  We should not underestimate this as it shows that this country&rsquo;s record of tax incentives and so forth is recognised by these companies.  A total of 49% of the investments was from the research and development sector.  The number of new companies investing in Ireland for the first time was 11% more than in 2008.  That is welcome.  That is the aspect we should consider instead of always pointing out the negative things that have happened, which may continue for some time.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has run some good programmes and is doing quite a lot of work but because of recent events in F&Aacute;S it might now want to begin a new period of regulation and implementation of rules, some of which may be too strict.  I have raised with the Minister here on a number of occasions the issue of young men and women doing apprenticeships with companies that have now folded.  They were in the final phase of getting their papers in order but they could not complete that process.  If they had continued for another 20 weeks between attending college and working with the company they would have that piece of paper which would entitle them to do that.  I ask the Minister to contact F&Aacute;S and get something done about cases like that.  He should apply the new rules for young people coming into the process but it is unfair to the young people who have done three and a half years of a four year course only to find that the parent company they were with has folded and they cannot do the last phase of their work.  I know the Minister will take that in hand and try to get the matter rectified.</P>
        <P>Much has been said earlier about energy costs and a reduction in rates, both of which have taken place to a substantial degree in the past year.  The price of gas and electricity has come down, which should help the people providing employment.  There has been a reduction in rates also.  In my county there was a 2% reduction, which appears to be happening throughout the country.  It is all very well to say there has been a cut in the payment to county councils or local authorities but we must also remember that the cost of everything has come down.  Value for money is the new phrase.  What happened in the boom years cannot continue.  We now must get value for money and there are opportunities for that, whether in terms of roads projects or whatever.  Costs have come down and we must factor that in and not always say that money is not coming from central Government.</P>
        <P>An aspect of life in the west and other parts of Ireland concerns small retailers.  There is much talk about the minimum wage.  I would not like to see a cut in the minimum wage.  There should not be a thought of doing that.  I watched a television programme during the week which showed people who had been working for up to 20 years in retail companies who were still on the minimum wage.  If there was no minimum wage one wonders what they would be earning.  I do not want to hear any more talk about reducing the minimum wage.</P>
        <P>I want to refer to small businesses in local towns.  When some young people leave school they go straight into the retail sector, whether hardware shops, clothes shops or whatever.  They work in those businesses for a number of years.  A phrase often used in my part of the country &mdash; I do not know if it is used in other areas &mdash; is that one is never at a shop boy&rsquo;s funeral.  When they were good they always ended up buying their own business in another town.</P>
        <P>There is a way of getting around this problem, which I ask the Minister to examine, namely, that these people would take up an apprenticeship at &euro;5 or &euro;5.50 for the first year, which would be increased in the second year and they would then be on the minimum wage by the third year.  That would create a good deal of employment for those young people while giving them the experience they need.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and ask him to consider those suggestions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Thanks to Senator Carty I will take home the phrase that one was never at a shop boy&rsquo;s funeral, and add that to the list of seanfhocail and phrases from a particular time and place in Ireland, which say so much.</P><Col N="119"/>
        <P>Ireland is now facing one of the most challenging periods in its history.  The global credit crunch, the collapse of the property bubble, the near collapse of our own banks, and the dramatic fall in the value of the currencies of our trading partners has created a perfect economic storm which has tested the competence of Government and the confidence of business.</P>
        <P>Challenging times test leadership, and as Warren Buffett famously remarked, &ldquo;When the tide goes out you get to see who has been swimming naked&rdquo;.  The sad and embarrassing fact is that quite a number of our senior Ministers in recent years had been swimming in the nip, claiming economic competence but failing to display it.  It is not a pretty sight but, more importantly, the failures of Government have contributed to the massive growth in unemployment and to creating a climate of fear for many young families who are unsure from where the next pay cheque or mortgage payment will come.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully agree with the view of the ESRI that we can blame 50% of our economic woes on the changed international economic environment.  Even if we had been ruled by rulers with the wisdom of Solomon and the vision of Joseph we would still be facing challenging times.  The truth, however, is that the unwise profligate policies of previous Administrations have contributed greatly to the challenges we now face.  Had those Governments kept their eye on the ball we would now be in a far stronger position to face the storm we find ourselves in, with the resources to pump prime a return to growth rather than savagely cutting public spending at a time when we should by rights be increasing it.</P>
        <P>Some time ago the economist and commentator, Marc Coleman, penned an analysis piece in which he said that the oldest economic advice on record had been given by Joseph to Pharaoh.  Joseph, interpreting the Pharaoh&rsquo;s dream, recommended that Pharaoh store the grain from the years of plenty for use in the years of famine.  However, I fear that the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Governments never read the Bible for in the years of plenty they increased Government spending, helping to turn a boom into an unsustainable bubble and leaving us with no resources with which to face the years of scarcity.</P>
        <P>The increase in the cost of Government was one of the key driving factors in Ireland&rsquo;s loss of competitiveness.  When we use the term &ldquo;loss of competitiveness&rdquo; there is a tendency in some quarters to see what has happened almost as an accident.  We are led to believe Ireland lost competitiveness in the same way I lost one of my socks last week.  It seems nobody was to blame, but the fact is that we did not just lose competitiveness.  We threw it away.</P>
        <P>In a recent report Forf&aacute;s, the Government&rsquo;s industrial policy unit, demonstrated that it was 25% cheaper to operate a retail business in Belfast than in Dublin.  That is a staggering differential to have as between ourselves and a neighbouring jurisdiction.  It means that firms from the Republic have to be 25% cheaper just to compete on an equal basis.  How did that position come about?</P>
        <P>I fully accept that Ireland had a long boom and that during a boom, prices and costs will rise, but that is only part of the story.  Detailed analysis by Jim Power of the drivers of inflation in Ireland has shown that the real drivers of inflation were in Government charges or the costs of goods and services regulated by Government.  Between 2000 and 2006, the consumer price index rose by 27.5% but food prices rose by just 16.2%, well below the overall rate of inflation.</P>
        <P>What was driving Ireland&rsquo;s high rate of inflation?  Between January 2000 and October 2007, the cost of water supply, refuse and miscellaneous rose by a staggering 255%.  Between 2002 and 2008, local authority rates increased by 42%, and I note what Senator Carty said about the recent downward direction of rates but that overall rise of 42% is staggering.  Between 2002 and 2008, electricity prices rose by 85%.  Ireland went from having one of the lowest costs of electricity for business users to having one of the highest.  In saying this, I recognise the comments that have just been made to the effect that there has recently been a decrease in costs. <Col N="120"/> However, I am merely outlining the facts.  The reality is that the Government took its eye off the ball and Irish business and, more importantly, Irish workers are paying for this.</P>
     
        <P>We are where we are, however, and there is no point crying over spilt milk.  Mere wishing will not solve our problems.  While I have condemned the Government for policy failures, it is only correct that I should commend it when it takes the correct course of action.  In that context, I strongly support it in its attempts to position Ireland as a leader in the smart economy.  I also commend the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on its decision to convene the task force on the green economy.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Jargon is often a means of concealing the truth.  It is used by eager but not particularly well informed spin doctors seeking to push the latest fad on an unsuspecting public.  However, there are times when jargon describes something real and valuable.  An example is the term &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo;.  The smart economy is real, not merely a piece of empty political rhetoric or part of the spin cycle.  It describes something which is real and of critical importance to all our futures.  It is shorthand for an economy which makes full use of information technology and communications to drive innovation, research and development in a world where economic growth must be environmentally sustainable.</P>
        <P>Regardless of whether one buys into global warming, there is no doubt that the carbon age is passing.  The advent of peak oil and the emergence of the new economic superpowers, namely, China, India and Brazil, mean that we are operating in an environment where sustainability is at a premium.  The latter will give rise to a real opportunity for Irish firms.  I fully agree with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s recent comment to the effect that the green economy has the potential to create 80,000 jobs.  In that context, I urge the rapid implementation of the findings of the task force of the green economy.  As the T&aacute;naiste previously stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We have had significant success in sectors such as food, ICT, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to date.  The adoption and targeting of the environmental goods and services sector now allows us to capitalise and build on our existing skills base to capture for Ireland part of the global growth in this sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I firmly believe clean and green technology will be one of the key drivers of innovation in the high-tech sector for years to come and that it represents a major opportunity for the sector in Ireland.  I also urge the Government to act swiftly to implement the green proposals relating to the IFSC in order to position the latter as a base for global green funds and carbon trading.  The skills, capabilities and contacts are in place; all we need are very minor changes to the tax code which would be cost-neutral in nature and a major sales campaign to sell Dublin as a location for these funds.</P>
        <P>If we are to seize any of the opportunities to which I refer, we must also build a really strong, world-class research and development capability in Ireland.  Most people, including many politicians, believe Ireland&rsquo;s investment in research and development merely involves putting money into new product ideas.  However, it has much more to do with building human capacity and capabilities.  The recent Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering &amp; Technology, IRCSET, conference on &ldquo;Innovation fuelling the smart society&rdquo; demonstrated not only the potential of the smart economy for researchers, it also highlighted some of the fantastic research talent in the country.  There are more than 800 young researchers being funded by the IRCSET, many of whom are absolutely world class and their talents will help to secure all of our economic futures.  I strongly endorse Government expenditure in education and the development of Ireland&rsquo;s brains trust.  I suspect that we will get a far greater return from our investment in these young people than from our investment in NAMA.</P><Col N="121"/>
        <P>I also strongly urge the Government to implement the findings of the most recent competitiveness report.  While its past actions may have undermined Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, it must take action to restore it.  All the vision and research in the world will not create jobs in Ireland if costs here are totally out of sync with those of our competitors.  In the short term we need to slash business costs, particularly those relating to small business interests.  The best thing we could do to help small business would be cut rates by 50% in order to protect existing jobs.  We must restore competitiveness in order that there will be a strong and stable platform for renewed growth.  This will assist us in seizing the opportunities presented by the smart economy.</P>
        <P>Mar achoimre ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; gur f&iacute;or gur chaitheamar am&uacute; &eacute; ar phointe &aacute;irithe leis na Rialtais roimhe seo, go h&aacute;irithe i dtaobh na costais a bhain le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; an St&aacute;it, seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; mar leictreachas agus uisce.

        <P>I take the opportunity to wish the Minister for Finance a speedy recovery.  Following an understandably difficult start to his term of office, he swiftly and bravely rose to the challenge facing him and has provided the type of real leadership necessary to reassure international investors.  He also shown courage to take very tough decisions.  He has, in fact, set the standard for his colleagues in the Government.  I hope the latter will also rise to the challenges we all face.  I wish the Minister well in his personal battle.  I believe I can assure him that he is in the prayers of all Irish people and that they offer him their best wishes.  I have no doubt he will bring the same great courage to his current battle that he has shown in the service of the State and its people.  I look forward to his return to full health and wish him all the best at this time.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  I had some dealings with him in respect of a number of people who wished to set up business projects.  He was most helpful to those involved and gave them the confidence to proceed with their ventures.  I was extremely impressed by what he did and thank him for becoming involved.</P>
        <P>It is great to make statements on business interests of all sizes.  On their own, statements are of no value to anyone.  However, they do help to create awareness.  The best and most practical way to discover what is happening is to meet people involved in business.  I have done this during the past few months.  One of the individuals with whom I had discussions runs a shop, petrol station and caf&eacute;.  I know the man in question and he informed me how his business was doing.  As a result of what has happened in the construction industry, the level of his business has decreased.  In recent years approximately 30% of his business came from construction workers who used to purchase rolls, etc., from his shop each morning.  This trade has disappeared.  He received a letter from his local authority which indicated that his rates were being increased by 30%, while his insurance costs rose by 15%.  He was faced, therefore, with a situation where two increases had been imposed upon him by those from whom he obtained services at a time when the flow of cash into his business had decreased.  He indicated that the road outside his premises had been in a dreadful state for the past nine months &mdash; as a result of the appearance of a number of potholes &mdash; and that the local authority would not repair it.  This provided me with some idea about how difficult it was for this man and others like him to remain in business.  He approached the banks for a loan but was informed that they could not understand why he would need a loan, particularly as his was a cash business which should, <Col N="122"/>therefore, provide him with a flow of cash.  This indicated to me that the banks did not even understand what being in business entailed.  It was interesting that the individual in question was up-front in indicating the nature of his problems to me.</P>
        <P>I was also in contact with another individual who has a plumbing business and employs six people.  Unfortunately, this man contracted motor neurone disease and was obliged to let his business go because, as a result of the fact that his children are young, there was no one to take it over.  He could not obtain assistance and I discovered that he and others like him were not entitled to any form of payment from any source.  I persuaded him to approach his community welfare officer, from whom he is now in receipt of some money.  My point is that if one&rsquo;s business collapses, one cannot obtain assistance from anyone.  I will not discuss the matter in detail but there are others who get everything they seek, including houses, virtually for nothing.</P>
        <P>Small businesses do not receive adequate support or encouragement.  Many of them are closing because they are asking what is the point.  In general the overheads have increased and the number of customers has reduced.  That is a problem we need to address.  Earlier Senator Carty referred to energy cost reductions.  While that is true, those reductions have not been sufficient to keep a business afloat.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a man last week who got a small job in a factory in my area.  He told me that he did not think he would stay in the job because he would get more from the dole.  I pointed out to him that he does not get it from the dole but from his neighbour, from me and from everybody else.  That is a widespread mentality that we need to address.  I make a contrast between people who make an effort to build up a business and people who avail of every opportunity to get money from the State.  They claim that society has let them down and is not looking after them.  There is no such thing as society looking after people.  In society all men and women are accountable and responsible for themselves, and should also look after their neighbours.  The concept of society having to look after individuals is a myth that we need to eliminate.</P>
        <P>I will give an example of how people making a genuine effort in business are being hampered.  NERA officers go around inspecting hotels at night.  Last week an hotelier, who is also a member of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, made the point to me that he employs local secondary-school students aged under 16.  It gives them a bit of independence and a few bob.  They need to be let off work at 10 p.m.  He then needs to bring in someone else for an hour or two if the hotel has a dinner dance or whatever &mdash; it does not always run to schedule.  This is a very awkward situation.  He told me that NERA inspectors came into his hotel at 9.30 p.m. one night in the middle of a function looking for books and asking about people.  They took up about an hour of his time.  This is going on wholesale.  It has been talked about for quite some time, but I do not know what is being done about it.  We are overregulated in unnecessary areas.  I would redeploy people engaged in that type of nonsense to do something worthwhile to help people and not to go around hampering people in business.</P>
        <P>There is also duplication with local authority services.  Local authority officials come to restaurants and pubs to inspect grease traps.  The restaurateur or publican then needs to hire a private person to do the same thing and remove it.  It should be sufficient for the private service supplier to issue a certificate and pass it to the local authority.  These are some of the things that put major constraints on people in business, some of whom have been in business for many years.  Many small businesses that have been established over two generations are now gone because not enough is being done.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen earlier referred to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I wish the Minister well.  I admire his qualities.  I met the Minister recently to discuss local authority <Col N="123"/>rates.  The rates are based on valuations from 2005 when property values were at their highest.  As we know the Valuation Office sets the rate and passes it on to the local authorities and it is not done by the local authorities themselves, which is a crazy situation.  The Minister was doing something about it.</P>
        <P>Those are the problems.  With all those overheads it is very difficult to survive in small business.  I learned that from going around and asking people how they were getting on.  Every time I meet people in business I ask them how things are going for them.  It is the only way to find out.  We could talk in here morning, noon and night about it, but one will never know anything without going out into the arena oneself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I congratulate him on his performance in the past 12 months, which has been a very difficult time for the Government and the country.  What was required politically was straight talk, honest analysis of the problem and a willingness to prescribe the tough medicine that we all know is required.  A small number of Ministers, including the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, were willing to be honest and straight with the people, who recognise the scale of the crisis and are willing to be part of the solution provided there is leadership from Government.  We need more Ministers who are willing to come forward, as the Minister of State has done in numerous media outlets, to call a spade a spade and outline the facts of the very difficult economic plight in the country and hopefully work towards a solution.  I wish him well in his endeavours in that regard.</P>
        <P>A very interesting by-election took place in the state of Massachusetts this week.  It was regarded as a major surprise that the Republican candidate won.  However, all the analysis since the election clearly shows that as far as the people in that state and in every other state in the United States and every other country across the globe are concerned, jobs must be put at the top of the agenda.  That was the lesson from the US election during the week.  It is all about jobs and that must be the focus of our policy over the next 12 months.  We would all have to concede that the December budget, which hopefully will help to bring the country&rsquo;s finances into somewhat better shape, was necessary.  It should lay a foundation for job creation and we must keep job creation at the top of the political agenda.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the commonsense analysis of the previous speaker, Senator Brady, and his recounting of his discussions with small local businesspeople.  He was correct in the comments he made about the difficulties faced by self-employed people when their businesses fall into difficulty.  I spoke to one of those people approximately a fortnight ago.  This was a gentleman who had worked in the construction industry.  Up to a number of years ago he had employed up to 40 people.  He paid their taxes and PRSI fully.  Everything was in proper order.  Unfortunately the economic cycle turned and his business has disappeared down the tube.  He is unable to get any help whatsoever from the State.  He has two children in third level education.  They cannot get a higher education grant because he simply cannot afford to have an accountant to complete the necessary bookkeeping exercises to complete that higher education grant application, which is very sad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All his former employees, who are not in a position to obtain work, are in receipt of job seeker&rsquo;s benefit to which they are entitled and their families are in receipt of higher education grants etc.  However, here is this person who employed 40 people and whose contribution to this economy in the past five to ten years is worth millions.  Now he is the man in difficulty and no help is available.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs needs to review the issue of classification of social insurance for self-employed people.  To the best of my knowledge the only entitlement arising from social insurance contributions made by self-employed persons are to old-age and widow&rsquo;s pensions.  A self-employed person whose business collapses is not entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit or disability benefit.  That matter needs to be <Col N="124"/>reviewed.  We need to build a new generation of entrepreneurs.  We need to entice people into self-employment.  If they can employ themselves and hopefully somebody else, that is very good news for the economy.</P>
        <P>One hears reports from time to time about how self-employed people do not pay taxes etc.  Self-employed people have built up the country and employed hundreds of thousands of people.  They have more than paid their way in the vast majority of cases and we need to review the terms and conditions of how social insurance applies to such people because we need to provide a safety net for those people when they fall into difficulty.  I would like if the Minister of State could ask the Department of Social and Family Affairs to look at that.  In passing, I could hardly believe my ears to learn of a decision by the Minister of that Department, Deputy Mary Hanafin, in relation to self-employed persons who had been allowed to make retrospective PRSI payments and were then to be paid contributory State pensions.  It affected a couple of hundred people, such as farmers&rsquo; spouses, and yet last week the Minister took a decision not only to cancel the scheme but to look for the money back.  This was a project which the late esteemed Minister, former Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, had worked very hard to put in place, and then his successor abolished the whole scheme.  It is a debate for another day, but certainly I found this to be a very disappointing decision.</P>
        <P>In terms of competitiveness, this society must recognise that all of us literally lost the run of ourselves over the past decade or so.  There was a marvellous positive side to the Celtic tiger economy and the boom years, but the negatives meant that people ignored the costs, bills were paid without a second thought and value for money as a central aspect of economic activity disappeared.  We have to return to a value for money economy.  Colleagues on all sides have spoken about energy, telephone and insurance costs.  By European standards we are paying top dollar and cannot compete unless those costs are challenged.  A degree of progress has been made from an energy costs perspective, but we have a long way to go.</P>
        <P>Another issue we need to tackle is professional fees.  We all know and are friendly with accountants, doctors and dentists in particular.  When the fees charged by such professionals in Ireland are compared with those of their counterparts in other European countries, they are way over the average.  I am not sure what the solution is.  I recall having to visit a doctor in a small town in Italy, about 18 months ago and paying a fee of &euro;20 along with a prescription fee of around &euro;5.  In Ireland the fees would have been &euro;70 for the doctor and probably &euro;25 or &euro;30 for the medicines.  How can there be such varying cost levels across the same continent?  We are competing for jobs and investment with those countries and we need to look seriously at the whole level of professional fees.  There appears to be an inability to ensure there are sufficient doctors, dentists and other professionals available to generate competition.  In any event, the present cost base must be looked at.</P>
        <P>Social partnership and the many benefits that stem from it were referred to by a number of colleagues.  It is important the social partners are engaged in dialogue and debate and we take on board their concerns and worries.  However, any light to emerge at the end of the tunnel in recent months has stemmed from the Government making decisions.  It was a question of recognising that the job of Government is to govern, listen, consult and decide on the action to be taken.  We need more of such decisive Government actions over the next 12 months.  I hope the social partners will work with the Minister of State and consult the Government.  However, it is vital the Government continues to take the tough decisions necessary to turn the economy around and, from the perspective of this debate, to tackle seriously the costs and some of the sacred cows that have emerged, thus again making Ireland a competitive place in which to set up business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members of the Seanad for taking the time to discuss this vital question.  I have taken a good deal of note of the discussions, especially in the past hour.  As Members are aware, the purpose of the exercise is to discuss the measures the Government has introduced to protect existing employment, assist those who have lost their jobs and improve Ireland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness.  Earlier the T&aacute;naiste took the House through the Government&rsquo;s key policy initiatives in these important areas, when I again listened with interest to the inputs of Senators.</P>
        <P>I welcome the views of both Houses of the Oireachtas as I firmly believe that by discussing how to address these issues properly, we can best plot the course that will take us out of these difficult economic times.  Ireland is one of the world&rsquo;s smallest and most open economies.  As such, our economic fortunes are inextricably linked to the performance of the world economy.  While over recent decades we have witnessed a remarkable transformation, it must be acknowledged that this was driven not only by domestic policies but also by the strength of the global economy.</P>
        <P>We are all aware that the entire global economy is in a period of sustained and unprecedented challenge.  Virtually every economy in the developed world is struggling to cope with the global economic storm which is being exacerbated by credit constraints and prolonged by a decline in consumer and investor confidence.  One need only look at the experience of our fellow Europeans and the significant increase in average unemployment in the eurozone, which rose to 10% in November 2009.  As Senator Bradford has just mentioned, we have also witnessed the continuing struggle to improve the unemployment situation in the USA, which has had ramifications again this week.</P>
        <P>Given the openness of the Irish economy, it was inevitable that we were always going to be adversely affected by the global economic downturn.  However, it is equally true that our economic performance has been exacerbated by structural difficulties within the economy as well as by the loss of competitiveness we have experienced <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> our competitors in recent years.  The Government is determined to do everything in its power to ensure the economy returns to growth and that it is based on a more sustainable footing in the future.  To do this we first have to stabilise the current economic situation and in this regard we have introduced a range of measures to lay the foundation for a return to prosperity.  The Government has repeatedly proven itself capable of taking the necessary steps to safeguard the economy.  Over the past 14 months we have taken difficult and painful decisions that would have been unthinkable three years ago.  We took these decisions because they needed to be made in the long-term economic interests of the State.  Other countries in a similar difficult position to Ireland have struggled to show the same degree of flexibility and maturity that the Irish people have displayed in facing up to their economic crisis.</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge that these decisions have been difficult to accept, I believe they will facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s return to economic growth and place it in a strong position to benefit from any improvement in the world economy.  As has been stated, the measures introduced by Government have been recognised by the OECD and a range of other international bodies as being significant in addressing the challenges we face.</P>
        <P>We must continue to pursue appropriate policies to position the economy to benefit from such global recovery when it emerges.  We need to remove the uncertainty within the economy and restore the confidence of businesses and individuals, such as the people Senators Carty and Brady referred to earlier.  As Senator Bradford indicated, we have adopted three difficult and very painful budgets aimed at restoring the State&rsquo;s finances and this process will continue until we have succeeded.</P><Col N="126"/>
        <P>We need to adopt measures that will enable the economy and our enterprises to sustain that recovery.  I am acutely aware of the distress the economic downturn is having on individuals, families and businesses.  The negative consequences of that downturn, particularly where jobs are lost, cannot be overstated.  Our priority has been and will continue to be, to respond to the specific problems.  I am committed to supporting enterprise and job creation and providing the necessary activation measures, training and upskilling programmes, with a renewed focus on targeted delivery.  We are not simply doing the same with less.  We are doing things in a more focused manner and targeting our spend on productive thoughtful investment that will have a clear return for the Exchequer and the economy.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s discussion should be seen in that context.  Our present high unemployment rates reflect the reality that in the past we lost our competitive edge in certain areas of the economy.  In order for us significantly to address our unemployment rates we need to improve our competitiveness, which will in turn see an increase in employment creation thereby bringing down unemployment.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste spoke earlier about measures the Government has introduced to stimulate export growth, as this sector will be the key driver of our economic performance in the short to medium term.  We have already witnessed increases in our export levels and these will only increase once the world economy is fully on the path to recovery.</P>
        <P>We have also introduced the employment subsidy scheme and the enterprise stabilisation fund.  Those initiatives are designed to provide financial support to enterprises in these difficult times.  The employment subsidy scheme is designed to assist vulnerable but viable enterprises in retaining employees they may otherwise have been forced to make redundant, by providing a subsidy to them.  Applications to the second call, which closed on 23 December 2009, are currently being assessed.  It is expected that the scheme will support approximately 80,000 jobs, both directly and indirectly.</P>
        <P>In addition to providing such support directly to enterprises, the Government remains committed to investing significantly in research and development and the continued development of our economy into a knowledge-based one.  This will enable us to move up the value chain, but more importantly it will result in higher skilled jobs and will increase the demand for highly skilled individuals.</P>
        <P>This brings me to our greatest natural asset &ndash; our labour force.  For years we have had a labour force that is both flexible and highly skilled.  Successive Governments have invested significantly in the education and training of Ireland&rsquo;s labour force and as a nation we have benefited considerably from that investment.  Despite the difficult financial circumstances, this Government continues to recognise the need to invest in the skills and competency development of our entire labour force.  This investment will ensure that we possess the skills to meet the needs of our increasingly knowledge-intensive economy.</P>
        <P>Given the rise in unemployment, the Government has redeployed substantial resources towards the training and education of those who find themselves out of work.  For instance, this year my Department will invest &euro;781 million in the provision of F&Aacute;S training and work experience activation places for the unemployed.  This additional investment has enabled F&Aacute;S to expand its capacity for the unemployed substantially and it will provide approximately 147,000 training and work experience places this year.  Compared to the 66,000 places which were provided in 2008, one can clearly see the scale of the increase in my Department&rsquo;s provision.</P>
        <P>The bulk of this additional provision has been due to the increase in training places for the unemployed.  F&Aacute;S now provides modular-based training so participants can pick which modules <Col N="127"/>they most require to improve their skills and ultimately increase their employability, whilst maintaining a close link to the labour market.  In addition, we are responding to the new unemployed by delivering training courses in innovative formats such as on-line, blended learning and night courses.  In this way we will enable more people to access the services of F&Aacute;S in addition to the traditional classroom approach.</P>
        <P>Given current circumstances, it is vital that training courses being provided by F&Aacute;S meet the current and projected skills needs of enterprises.  That is why F&Aacute;S takes into account the conclusions and recommendations of our expert group on future skills needs.  The latter body advises the Government on future skills needs of the economy, in the design of its portfolio of training programmes for the unemployed.</P>
        <P>The current difficulties being experienced by F&Aacute;S are being addressed by a number of Oireachtas committees.  I am pleased to inform the House that this afternoon the T&aacute;naiste will announce a new board for the F&Aacute;S agency, which will direct its new approach to the delivery of courses.</P>
        <P>The substantial increase in education and training provision, which is a direct response to the economic crisis, is also a key in achieving the objectives of the national skills strategy, which is to upskill 500,000 people by at least one level on the national framework of qualifications.  The additional provision now being provided will enable more individuals to progress up that national framework in accordance with the national skills strategy.</P>
        <P>In addition to these initiatives, we have introduced a number of new programmes designed to assist the unemployed.  For instance, the work placement programme provides 2,000 individuals with an opportunity to stay close to the labour market while they are unemployed.  Participants on the programme gain work experience for a period of up to nine months while retaining their social welfare entitlements.</P>
        <P>The Government has announced a new labour market activation fund of &euro;20 million for which we will issue calls later this year.  This fund will be targeted at certain cohorts of the unemployed, including the low skilled, under 35s and those suffering from what is termed structural unemployment.  It will be used to support innovative proposals to provide these individuals with training that is designed specifically to assist participants in securing employment.  My Department has responsibility for the fund and will shortly issue a call for proposals from all sectors of society.</P>
        <P>The increase in training provision, work experience opportunities and the call for these innovative proposals are all designed to provide an enhanced offering of support to all of the unemployed.  Through these measures individuals who are unemployed can improve their skills and competencies, thereby assisting them in securing employment as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Over the past three budgets we have shown a willingness to take difficult and in many cases painful decisions that are in the interest of the entire country.  This Government will continue to manage the economy in a manner that is sensible, responsible and appropriate to ensure our return to prosperity.  I am confident that the decisions we have taken, and will continue to take, will restore the public finances, stabilise our banking system, provide training opportunities to the unemployed and further improve the competitiveness of the economy.  They will ultimately place Ireland firmly on the road to recovery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The opening up of the EU Internal Market in the 1990s and the other developments which increased the permeability of internal borders posed a number of problems for the European Union and its member states, not least of which was the fact that organised criminal structures set about exploiting these developments.  Subsequent events led to the realisation that terrorists could exploit this greater openness.  The imperative in these circumstances of protection of the citizens of the Union by creating an area of free movement with a high level of security for those citizens required that law enforcement and judicial authorities should improve their co-operation.  There have since been numerous initiatives to increase the level of effectiveness of co-operation.  I mention the creation of Eurojust, with its function of improving co-operation in ensuring effective prosecutions, and the European arrest warrant as just two examples.  Side by side with these have been important developments in information sharing, especially between law enforcement authorities, as a means of increasing the effectiveness of actions against organised crime and terrorism.</P>
        <P>The member states of the European Union face common challenges across the range of areas related to internal security.  There is a need to adopt common strategies and co-ordinated EU action to be in a position to meet these challenges more effectively.  One such measure which arises from the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty on 1 December 2009 is the setting up of the Standing Committee on operational cooperation on internal security, which committee is established by Article 71 of the Lisbon treaty.  The purpose of the standing committee which will be known by the French language acronym, COSI, is to ensure operational co-operation on internal security is promoted and strengthened within the Union.  The committee will also facilitate the co-ordination of the actions taken by the relevant authorities of the member states in this area.  Senators should be aware that the reference to &ldquo;internal security&rdquo; covers a range of issues related to public security and safety, covering actions against crime of all sorts, border management, customs co-operation and civil crisis management such as for natural or man-made disasters.</P>
        <P>Co-operation in the field of justice and home affairs has become an increasingly important feature of the EU landscape.  The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is a treaty objective of the European Union.  This objective has been the over-arching focus in the justice and home affairs field, involving activities covering free movement, asylum and immigration policies and the management of the Union&rsquo;s external borders.  Close co-operation has also been developed between the national police, judicial and customs authorities in the ongoing fight against crime.  A wide range of initiatives have been undertaken and are ongoing at EU level across the spectrum of policy areas relevant to internal security.  There is ongoing interaction <Col N="129"/>at operational level between the relevant authorities and services in the member states which allows for increased and more effective cross-border action and also for the development and sharing of best practice.</P>
        <P>Many legal instruments in the field of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters have been adopted at EU level, including measures to combat terrorism, trafficking in persons, child pornography, drug trafficking and money laundering.  In addition, Europol and Eurojust have been established in order to support and improve co-operation between the member states in combating these serious crimes.  EU member states are also developing common approaches to the challenges of better managing migration flows into the European Union.  Minimum standards and procedures are being set for asylum seekers. A European pact on immigration and asylum was adopted in 2008, setting out the principles behind a number of EU laws, with the aim of organising legal immigration in order that it takes better account of the priorities and needs of each member state.</P>
        <P>More effective control of the European Union&rsquo;s external borders is also a priority objective in order to tackle illegal immigration.  The FRONTEX agency was set up in 2005 to enhance practical co-operation between the member states in developing better external border security.  Another important goal is the creation of partnerships with countries of origin and transit for illegal immigration.  The aim will be to seek to improve the poor living conditions which may act as a &ldquo;push&rdquo; factor in these countries.</P>
        <P>Customs services in the Union play an essential role in the fight against international drug-trafficking and related crimes.  The EU drugs strategy, in dealing with illicit drug trafficking and supply side enforcement measures, focuses on reducing money laundering, the diversion of precursor chemicals for the manufacture of illegal drugs and effective co-operation between customs, police and prosecuting authorities in the fight against drug trafficking.  International co-operation between the various enforcement agencies charged with combating drug trafficking is absolutely essential, given the cross-border nature of these activities.  Ireland&rsquo;s Customs Service plays a full part in contributing to the protection of the European space, in co-operation with its counterparts in other member states.</P>
        <P>The co-ordination of civil protection actions among member states in responding to possible man-made or natural disasters is another very important aspect of co-operation at EU level.  A notable area of recent activity in this field has been the agreement of an action plan to enhance chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security in the European Union.  The action plan is aimed at supporting the ongoing efforts of member states to provide an improved framework for co-ordinated action between all those involved.</P>
        <P>This proposed Council decision sets out the tasks to be assigned to the new committee.  Its primary purpose, in accordance with the treaty, is to facilitate, promote and strengthen co-ordination of operational actions of the member states&rsquo; authorities in the field of internal security, principally as regards police, customs and border protection.  It will also cover, where appropriate, judicial co-operation in criminal matters relevant to this.</P>
        <P>The committee will not, however, be involved in conducting operations; these will, of course, remain within the remit of member states.  This is consistent with the mandate set down in Article 71 of the Lisbon treaty to promote and strengthen operational co-operation.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, COSI will not have a legislative role.  In accordance with the Lisbon treaty arrangements, legislation will be considered by the various Council working parties and will go from them to the Committee of Permanent Representatives and then to the Council for final adoption.</P>
        <P>It will be for each member state to decide on the appropriate representatives to attend meetings.  This will depend to some extent on the subject before the committee for discussion.</P><Col N="130"/>
        <P>The committee will also have the function of evaluating the efficiency of operational co-operation, identifying possible shortcomings or failures and adopting recommendations to address them.  This is a key aspect in ensuring that the actions which are taken can be properly targeted and that resources can be deployed to the best effect.  In addition, COSI will help to ensure consistency of action by Eurojust, Europol and Frontex, which will be invited to attend meetings of COSI as observers.</P>
        <P>The committee will submit reports at regular intervals to the Council on its activities.  The Council will keep national parliaments and the European Parliament informed of the proceedings of the committee.</P>
        <P>Copies of the proposal were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 14 December 2009.  This Council decision is a measure pursuant to Title V of Part III of the Lisbon treaty and it is, therefore, a measure to which Ireland may opt in under Protocol 21.  Protocol 21 to the Lisbon treaty provides that Ireland may opt to take part in the adoption and application of measures which are proposed in regard to the areas of freedom, security and justice.  In order for Ireland to exercise that opt-in, prior approval of the Oireachtas in accordance with Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution is required.  With the approval of the Oireachtas, this will be the first measure under the Lisbon treaty to which Ireland will opt in in accordance with Protocol 21.</P>
        <P>Senators will appreciate that the EU has an important role to play in bringing together the actions of member states aimed at promoting and ensuring the internal security of the European space.  By the same token, Ireland has an important contribution to make to those efforts, in co-operation with our fellow EU member states.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in COSI will enable us to play a full role in developing the necessary co-ordinated action among EU member states to contribute to a more secure future for all of the Union&rsquo;s citizens.  I commend the motion to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is strange that we are having a debate on establishing a committee in the European Union.  The reason for doing so seems so self-evident.  As the Minister of State said, the European Union has an important role to play in bringing together the actions of member states in this area aimed at promoting and ensuring internal security and police co-operation.  The reason we are doing this is because Ireland has chosen to have available to it the facility to opt out of these types of provisions unless it opts in.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that, under pressure, the Government committed to a review of the opt-out from the area of policing and judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  However, it is regrettable that we must take a positive decision to opt in to these types of decisions given the extent of gangland crime and criminality in this jurisdiction.  Irrespective of whether drug dealing or human trafficking is involved, there is always a cross-border element.  It is self-evident that Ireland, perhaps more than any other member state, needs the co-operation of the Union in combating these forms of crime.</P>
        <P>It is a self-evident proposition that there should be co-ordination at EU level of the forces of law and order, including policing and customs organisations.  This is provided for in Article 71 of the Lisbon treaty.  It does not undermine in any respect the competence of member states and their responsibility in the area of internal security.  It is to ensure co-ordination at EU level in the areas of policing, customs and judicial co-operation.</P>
        <P>The process began with the Maastricht treaty and the Amsterdam treaty, which was drawn up under the Irish Presidency.  The concept of co-operation accelerated from that period.  Mr. John Bruton, who was then chairman of the Council of Ministers, made the tackling of crime within the Union a priority for the Union.  Since then, there has been an acceleration of the <Col N="131"/>work of member states with regard to co-operation on policing, customs and the protection of borders.</P>
        <P>There are already a number of bodies established in this area, including Eurojust, Europol and Frontex, and they are all working very well.  COSI is very important to ensure co-operation among the different bodies.  It is important that the Government does not just participate as of form but that it identifies what it wants to achieve from this committee and others established at EU level.  It should have its own agenda and identify how the Union and other member states can assist in combating cross-border crime of the most serious kind.  Passive co-operation will not get us very far.</P>
        <P>Ireland has serious problems, particularly with its coastline being used for the smuggling of illegal drugs and because it is a gateway to the rest of Europe.  We can create an incentive for other member states to assist us in combating this illegal activity.  When opting in with respect to the committee, with which I fully agree, it is imperative that the Government sets out an agenda.</P>
        <P>The name of the committee, COSI, is somewhat unfortunate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>At least it is not a cartel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It involves reconfiguration of existing committees at Council level.  It is important that the Minister set out his agenda and that we establish what we want to prioritise through co-operation with other member states at EU level.  I fully support the choice to opt in to this decision.  We should participate fully on the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion.  It is beyond question that we should be co-operating in many areas throughout Europe, none more so than security and the prevention of crime throughout the entire Union.  This could apply to activities such as terrorism, the importation of drugs and the trafficking of human beings and goods.</P>
        <P>Ireland, particularly the south-west coast, is used as a gateway for the illegal importation of drugs.  In the past two years, we had the two largest drug seizures.  One incident, in which a boat sank off Mizen Head, involved an act of God and was a stroke of luck for the Customs and Excise, Garda and Naval Service.  The amount of drugs involved &mdash; well over &euro;500 million &mdash; was frightening.  Thankfully, those arrested are in prison, with some of them serving very long sentences.  Others who escaped from this jurisdiction have been arrested in the United Kingdom where they will face trial on this and other matters.</P>
        <P>Some 12 months after the event it was still hard to believe the audacity, arrogance and daring of those who were prepared to use Ireland as a gateway to Europe for drug smuggling.  Even then, however, a further significant attempt to smuggle drugs was detected.  Through co-operation between European agencies, the yacht in question was tracked from South America until it entered Irish waters.  In this case there was no act of God; it was a predetermined, well planned co-operation by European agencies, the Garda, Customs and the Naval Service.  The Naval Service apprehended the yacht 170 miles south west of Mizen Head and brought it to Castletownbere.  Again, the quantity of drugs seized was substantial, valued at over &euro;500 million.  In the space of 12 months attempts had been made to bring &euro;1 billion worth of high quality cocaine through south-west Cork for transhipment to the United Kngdom and mainland Europe.  I understand the yacht in the last case was not meant to land in Ireland but in Cornwall or Wales, which highlights how much of a success story it was of co-operation between various European agencies.  Recently a vessel from outside Europe was seized in County Louth carrying a large quantity of cigarettes.  Again, the county was used as a point of entry.  I believe signifi<Col N="132"/>cant amounts of drugs have been landed along the west Cork coast for transhipment to the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, which shows the need for co-operation.</P>
        <P>It is also proper and correct that there is co-operation between various European agencies in preventing human trafficking and pornography.  As a small island-state on the periphery of Europe, Ireland on its own does not have the capacity to tackle widespread crime such as the spread of pornography, terrorism, drug, cigarette or human trafficking.  It relies on international co-operation.  Anything that can be done by Ireland to improve overall security in Europe is important.  The European Union has seen its borders fall and customs traps disappear.  In this regard, the motion is proper, particularly since the European Union already knows how much our farmers grow, how much is included in the set-aside scheme and what fishermen are catching with the eye in the sky.  The improving of security and the stamping out of drug trafficking and terrorism through European co-operation are essential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to my distinguished colleague and friend, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, he is unduly optimistic when he speaks about the stamping out of drug trafficking.  It is simply not going to happen.  He was able to refer to two notable successes, on which I compliment those involved in these good examples of detection.  However, even at the time the authorities acknowledged what had been seized was only between 5% and 10% of the drugs that passed through the country.  This shows the scale of the problem.  We might as well throw our hats at it.  We will have to become adult and look at the drugs problem realistically.  That is, however, a debate for another day.  The motion will not conquer the problem, as everyone well knows from the figures.</P>
        <P>In the case of cigarette smuggling, there is much hypocrisy on the part of the cigarette companies which are using the issue to oppose increases in cigarette prices.  The major cigarette companies have been convicted of actively co-operating with smuggling activities.  Again, that is a debate for another day, as I want to concentrate on the aspect of free movement around Europe.</P>
        <P>The reason I raise this matter is largely selfish.  At the beginning of this month I came back from Cyprus through Gatwick Airport.  I followed all the signs for the international flight connections terminal, along winding corridors until I came to a box with a telephone.  Normally, there is a courtesy bus for international flight connections every 15 minutes between specific hours.  However, outside of these hours &mdash; which I was &mdash; I had to request one by using the aforementioned courtesy telephone.</P>
        <P>Duly I telephoned for the bus and the voice on the other end asked me, &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;I am going to Dublin but I do not want to take the bus the whole way as I would like to get on an aeroplane.&rdquo;  The voice on the other end said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mate.&rdquo;  I asked, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;  He replied that it was a domestic flight, to which I said, &ldquo;What interesting news?  I have been away for a couple of weeks.  When did they make the announcement?&rdquo;  He asked, &ldquo;What announcement?&rdquo;  I replied, &ldquo;That we have rejoined the British Empire.  Her Majesty is a wonderful woman and it will be so nice to be back part of this great family.&rdquo;  The man said, &ldquo;I do not know what you are talking about,&rdquo; to which I said, &ldquo;When I left Dublin two weeks ago, it was the capital city of an independent republic within the European Union.  Now, apparently, we have gone back in under the skirts of the British Empire.  Can you, please, give me some more information?&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;Hump off.  This is to do with the Schengen arrangement.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>What is the impact of this internal security arrangement on the Schengen Agreement, particularly as there are non-EU countries such as Switzerland in the Schengen area?  After visiting Geneva recently, my colleague Senator O&rsquo;Toole told me this morning that one would be driven blind trying to find where to go at Geneva Airport because of the arrangements for arrivals <Col N="133"/>from the non-Schengen area.  The easiest solution would be to go out through one door, miss the maze of tunnels, technically enter France, another Schengen country, and then come back into Switzerland.  It is absolutely insane.  As an Irish citizen I object to not being allowed to use international flight connections.  It is supposed to be about security but I have already passed through security in another EU member state.  How many times do we have to do it just because we are Irish?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Some years ago a close friend of mine, before he obtained Irish citizenship, was here on asylum papers, all perfectly legal.  He went on holiday to Barcelona and had to go through Heathrow Airport.  On the way back he was interrogated, taken aside and humiliated by the authorities there.  He was sent back to Barcelona because they thought he was trying to get into the European Union illegally.  He had to pay for an extra couple of nights in Barcelona and his return flight.  There was no redress.  As a result, a black mark was put against his name on a computer.  Some years later, coming back from a holiday he had shared with me, he was stopped again at Heathrow Airport and interrogated.  As he is a Kurdish national, he is slightly darker than most home-grown Irish people.  When the officer had the impertinence to ask him how a person like him had obtained Irish citizenship, he responded by asking how his companion, who was as black as the ace of spades, had been able to become a policeman in Britain.  This type of practice is absolutely intolerable and should be cleared up.  Britain is supposed to be a friendly country.  It is outrageous that we are prevented from using international flight connections.  Are we a separate nation or not?  Why should the Schengen Agreement be used as a defence in regard to movement between the two islands when we have been already adequately cleared by security?</P>
        <P>I raised this issue with the British ambassador&rsquo;s predecessor some years ago.  While our exchange by way of letter was cordial he denied that what I stated was happening.  I took photographs of the relevant signage at Heathrow.  I have, not in black and white but in full panavision technicolor, photographs of what they are doing.  We have the power to decide whether we want to be represented on these committees.</P>

	<P>Thank you.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure, if we are going to be part of this, this issue is taken into account and that our representatives are briefed on it in order that they can untangle it.  I am sure many of my colleagues will agree that being forced in some of the airports in London, when one is forced to land in Britain, to go outside the airport and then re-enter and go through passport and customs control and so on again is not what one expects as part of an integrated Europe in the 21st century.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to discuss this motion on a new Council standing committee on internal security, COSI.  The shift within the provisions of the Lisbon treaty to a much more genuinely European or Community approach to justice and home affairs, as opposed to the more traditional inter-governmental approach, was supported and welcomed by the Green Party.  Under the Lisbon treaty new areas, including short stay visas, residence permits, legal immigration, judicial co-operation in criminal matters, Eurojust, Europol and non-operational police co-operation, are moving from unanimity to a process of co-decision with the European Parliament all of which is positive and must be welcomed.  However, there is a danger that in welcoming this move towards a more Community based approach we will become somewhat uncritical of the extent to which, in <Col N="134"/>creating some of these new European structures, the same standards of democratic accountability and scrutiny are not available to us or to citizens of the European Union.  As national parliamentarians, whether members of Government or the Opposition, we have a responsibility to monitor these developments, to highlight any concerns we have about them and to try to have them addressed.</P>
        <P>I regret only 45 minutes has been provided for the debate on this motion.  As the Minister of State is required to open and close the debate, this leaves little time for representatives of all political parties to make statements on this important body, the structure of which will have serious implications for internal security policy within the European Union.  I believe 45 minutes is a short time within which we must discuss the establishment and remit of the committee.</P>
        <P>Under protocol 21 of the Lisbon treaty, Ireland has discretion to opt-in, in so far as it sees fit, to the communitarian approach to justice and home affairs, which is to be welcomed.  We have provided ourselves with much flexibility in this regard.  I note the incoming Spanish Presidency has stated it will give priority to the development of internal security strategy which will come within the remit of the new committee.  It is important that Ireland is from the outset a member of the new structure when the Spanish Presidency is developing policy in the area of internal security.  We are told the main objective of COSI will be to facilitate, promote and strengthen co-ordination of the operational actions between EU member states in the field of internal security, including police and customs co-operation, external border protection and judicial co-operation in criminal matters relevant to operational co-operation in the field of internal security.  We are told also that the committee will regularly report on its activities to the Council and shall keep the European and national parliaments informed.</P>
        <P>COSI will be responsible for evaluating the general direction and efficiency of operational co-operation and will also have the responsibility of identifying possible shortcomings and adopting recommendations to address them.  COSI, with the Political and Security Committee, will be mandated to assist the Council to implement the solidarity clause which provides that the EU shall be able to mobilise all the instruments at its disposal to help a member state that is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or man-made disaster, which is an important power.  It is important that Ireland, because of its unique position as a neutral state within the European Union, ensures that the implementation of the solidarity clause is worked out in a manner that is acceptable to us and the values which underpin our neutrality.</P>
        <P>I have a number of concerns to which I hope the Minister of State can respond.  Several interested parties have raised with me the composition of COSI.  Will the committee merely be advised by agencies such as security and intelligence agencies like Britain&rsquo;s MI5?  In other words, will these bodies be members of the committee or will the committee merely be advised by them?  Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to that issue.  On the European and national parliaments being kept informed of the proceedings of this committee, will the level of information provided to the parliaments make meaningful scrutiny possible?  As far as I am aware no provisions have been set out in terms of scrutiny and accountability.  Can the Minister of State assure us that there will be public access to its proceedings and documents?  My third concern relates to the concept of internal security.  Members will be aware that this concept is much wider than policing, judicial co-operation and immigration.  It encompasses all matters relating to the maintenance of law and public order and to civil and military capabilities.  Obviously there is concern in regard to the incredibly strong link that will be required between internal security within the EU and external security.  Can the Minister of State offer any reassurances with regard to the definition of that concept and the remit of the committee as a result?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="135"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in welcoming the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to debate this motion.  However, to be against an organisation called COSI seems like being against motherhood and apple pie.  I do not believe anyone could speak too critically of an organisation called COSI, a particularly strange and perhaps inappropriate acronym which conjures up images of cosy cartels and all sorts of other matters.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I support the opt-in to this committee.  Clearly all of us support the concept of increased co-operation among judicial authorities and law enforcement bodies across the EU.  It is important that there is effective co-operation to protect citizens, in particular given the types of criminal justice issues that have a transnational dimension.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to a number of these, including drug and human trafficking and so on.  I note the remit of this committee is broad.  Senator de B&uacute;rca mentioned that the definition of internal security covers matters beyond those clearcut transnational crimes such as drug and human trafficking.  It covers border management, customs co-operation and civil crisis management, which are areas well beyond the remit of criminal justice.  It seems sensible that we would have a standing committee of this type overseeing co-operation in terms of natural disasters.  I am thinking in this regard of disasters such as the earthquake in Italy and the need for us to co-ordinate responses from across the EU.</P>
        <P>As Senator de B&uacute;rca stated, it is important we are not uncritical and do not take too cosy a consensual approach to standing committees of this nature and that we scrutinise them in our contributions during debates in this House.  We must be mindful that this is part of a long project by the EU seeking greater co-operation in criminal justice matters and in justice matters more broadly.  I recall getting funding in 1997-98 from the EU under the then Grotius project, which was a project aimed at ensuring greater judicial co-operation, where we looked at differences in the conduct of rape trials across different member states with a view to improving procedures for victims of rape.  The interesting aspect was to note the differences in approach between the criminal justice system in Ireland and in England and the criminal justice system in place in the other member states.</P>
        <P>Of course this distinction between our adversarial system and the inquisitorial model used in other member states has thrown up difficulties for Ireland in signing up to measures like this that are designed to ensure greater co-operation among member states.  There has always been a caution here, and rightly so, that we must be careful about signing up to measures that will dilute our own standards of criminal justice or dilute in some way our constitutional guarantee of due process.</P>
        <P>I am mindful also of a word of warning issued by one of the pre-eminent legal academics on this island on criminal procedure, Professor Dermot Walsh from Limerick, who wrote a comprehensive review of the law on the European arrest warrant earlier this year.  The European arrest warrant was also somewhat controversial, and is now in place since we passed an Act in 2003 to implement the European arrest warrant model, but it replaced a long-standing set of procedures around extradition.  Professor Walsh, in writing about this and reviewing the operation of the European arrest warrant in Ireland, asks whether the European arrest warrant will result in individuals being surrendered for prosecution for offences which would not have been prosecuted in the surrendering state, and whether it will result in co-operative forum shopping among police and prosecutors to enhance the prospects of a conviction.  His concern is that Irish citizens are being surrendered to other member states to be prosecuted there through a criminal process which may fall below established Irish constitutional norms in some respects.  That is a word of caution from a leading academic who has done the best review I have seen of the European arrest warrant.  It is useful to bear those sort of comments in mind when we examine this standing committee model.</P><Col N="136"/>
        <P>However, I note that while COSI&rsquo;s remit is broad on internal security, it will not be involved in conducting operations or in legislation.  Clearly, its functions are limited.  It seems to be some sort of oversight committee.  Like Senator de B&uacute;rca, I think there is a lack of detail so far, for example, in the sort of representatives we will be appointing to the COSI, and I ask the Minister of State to clarify that.  I note he stated in his speech it will be up to each member state to decide on the appropriate representatives and it will depend to some extent on the subject matter.  Clearly, one would expect different officials to be present if immigration were to be discussed as opposed to something more directly related to criminal justice, but it strikes me that the danger then is that there is a rolling representation on the committee and a lack of continuity.  Will there be somebody, presumably in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who will have overall responsibility for the Irish liaison to COSI?  That would be useful to know.</P>
        <P>There is one other point that is important for us in this House to be clear about, and that is how national parliaments will be kept informed.  I am happy to hear that the Council is to keep national parliaments and the European Parliament informed of the proceedings of the committee but I wonder what mechanism will be used.  For example, will reports come to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights?</P>
        <P>Having raised these issues and concerns, I support the opt-in.  It is sensible to have a committee of this type.  There is a lack of clarity at present about what it will do in practice but we just need a little more guidance from the Minister of State on that.</P>
        <P>I suppose Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments struck a chord with all of us.  I thought of the Heathrow experience which all, Irish citizens or not, travelling to Ireland must go through.  The Irish departures lounge is like a little colony offshore of the main Heathrow terminal.  I do not know whether that can be addressed by COSI.  It might fall outside the remit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their support on this motion.  It has been characteristic of the broad cross-party support for the European Union and it has been one of the positive features of the political landscape of the European Union for many years.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate the acronym COSI is being used.  It does not sound forceful or rigorous enough for the work of a committee.  It seems a little laid back.  I understand why Senators picked up on that point.</P>
        <P>Co-operation in the area of justice and home affairs is one of the most important areas of action given that it takes up some of the most fundamental concerns of Europe&rsquo;s citizens such as organised crime, drug trafficking and trafficking of persons.  If we are to deal effectively with those, we need that co-operation from all involved.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan asked about Ireland participating.  The way I would put it, in terms of pursuing our own agenda, is there is no place for us to be passive members on this committee.  We need to play an active role, and I believe strongly in that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan reminded us of some of the successes of international co-operation.  He referred to the maritime operations in Lisbon where seven European countries, including Ireland, provide maritime analysis, and the seizures that were made off the south coast.  While we speak of the success of customs, seizures, etc., I reiterate, because often this is not acknowledged by us, that intelligence from Ireland also results in seizures in other jurisdictions.  It is a point worth noting, that the work of our security forces, be it the Garda or Customs and Excise, in gathering intelligence bears fruit in other jurisdictions.  International co-operation, as <Col N="137"/>witnessed through what happens from the maritime analysis centre in Lisbon, demonstrates clearly the effectiveness of co-operation.</P>
        <P>I sympathise with Senator Norris&rsquo;s trials and tribulations.  He raised a number of questions in the area of the Schengen Agreement.  I want to put something on the record.  He made a specific point which was not about his travels and his woes.  It was one of his earlier comments on Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s contribution.  Senator Norris stated that the drug seizures represent only 5% to 10% of the total.  There is no shred of evidence to support that.  It is a figure that is often thrown out and people involved in security would disagree with it.  In fact, UN figures would suggest that 40% is the seizure rate, not 5% to 10%.  One way or another, 10% has become a figure that is put about as though it is factual.  There is no evidence to support that figure and in many regards it is disingenuous to the real efforts and improvements because, year on year, the security forces are becoming more effective in their detection work.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca raised a number of issues.  First, I note the time for this was short.  I apologise for that but it was not of my making.  I understand that it was a decision of the House.  I would not like it to be said that we came in and rushed it through.  I was at the mercy of what the House wanted to do in that regard.</P>
        <P>On MI5 or other members who would be on the committee, it is a matter for each of the member states to address what membership would be appropriate.  The concept of the internal security is a broader one, covering not only crime and terrorism but also natural disasters.  I was asked who would have overall responsibility for this from an Irish point of view.  It will reside with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>This committee will report at regular intervals and those reports will make their way to all national parliaments as well as the European Parliament.  I thank all Senators who have supported the establishment of this committee despite its somewhat unfortunate name.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to share time with Senator Pearse Doherty, who will speak for a minute and a half or so.  Ba mhaith liom an cheist seo a ard&uacute; i gcomhairle le mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Dochartaigh.  T&aacute; na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is i Scoil Chonaill Naofa i mBun Beag, i bpar&oacute;iste Ghaoth Dobhair, ag iarraidh cead &oacute;n Roinn dul ar aghaidh leis an bhforbairt at&aacute; beartaithe acu.  This is not the first time my colleague, Senator Doherty, or I have raised the matter of the Scoil Chonaill Naofa building project on the Adjournment debate.</P>
        <P>The issue is to seek approval to go to the next stage.  I refer to the background, although I do not wish to cover what I have said previously in the Chamber.  The planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science organised workshops to brief schools and their design teams on the requirements of new contracts, including the Scoil Chonaill Naofa board of management and its quantity surveyor.  They met Department officials to discuss and revise the required documentation and to outline the timeframe for the submission of completed tender documents.  They went through this process.  The Minister for Education and <Col N="138"/>Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, with whom I have liaised many times on this project, has advised me in recent days that the Scoil Chonaill Naofa building project is included in the process.  The Department met representatives of the school on 26 November last in Tullamore.  Thereafter, the school was authorised to complete the necessary revisions to the tender documentation and the schools stage 2b submission was received by the Department of Education and Science on 18 December last, some 34 days ago.  This submission is currently under consideration according to the Minister and the school will be notified shortly of progress.</P>
        <P>The issue of concern to the school is that subsection (<i>k</i>) of the design team procedures 2007, practice note 1, states, &ldquo;where approval to go to tender is delayed more than 1 month after the submission of the Stage 2b report, it will be necessary for the Quantity Surveyor to up-date the cost-check prior to issuing tenders&rdquo;.  Given that 34 days have elapsed since the required documentation was submitted on 18 December, the school authorities and the board of management are acutely concerned that they may need to revise the costings again and that this could delay the project further.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister and his officials are currently assessing all projects under consideration for the 2010 capital programme.  I further understand it is his intention to announce the list of successful projects in the coming weeks.  I wish to ensure the Scoil Chonaill Naofa building project is included in the list when it is announced and that as part of the announcement, approval would be granted to the school board of management to seek tenders and to begin construction, which is very important.</P>
        <P>To be fair, the school board of management has been very co-operative with the Department.  It has done all that has been requested, including attendance at meetings and so on.  It has liaised with public representatives, including us.  There is a need to have in place a new, modern facility available at the school to provide for the projected, long-term teaching staff of a principal, four mainstream teachers and ancillary staff.  This development is required and all the stages have been crossed.  Time is elapsing and we are concerned about the 30 day issue, but if the announcement were to materialise the school would be posed and ready to proceed with the development immediately.  We trust that given the competitive tenders available at present, a good price, even lower than what was originally anticipated, could be attained.  This is what I wish to convey today.  l appreciate there may be no announcement today but I call on the Minister for State, Deputy Brady, to speak to the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, to underline the urgency of having the project included in the capital envelope for this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  I appreciate the opportunity to share time with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and the arrangement shows the importance of this issue in the community.  I outline my interest in this matter.  I am a former student of Bunbeg national school.  My sister teaches in the school and come September it will be the school that my eldest son will attend.  I know this school very well.  My uncle is a former head master and a cousin of mine teaches there.  As a former pupil, I recognise the difficulties and the situation in which the school finds itself.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, some other elected representatives from the area and I have attended meetings in the school.  It is possible to see the unsafe nature of the school environment.  Items are stocked in areas, basically because of a lack of space.  An electrical contractor&rsquo;s report indicates the school does not have trip switches and smoke alarms, a very serious issue in today&rsquo;s environment given there are in excess of 100 pupils attending classes.</P>
        <P>This is a matter of fairness for those pupils such that they can be given the best space available to absorb the curriculum and for the teachers to be given the space necessary to teach the curriculum.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has remarked, there are two questions at issue.  First, <Col N="139"/>the 30-day rule in the technical guidance notes should not apply in this matter.  At this stage, the 30 days is up.  We have no wish for a situation whereby the Minister will inform the school that it must re-cost the plan because of some technicality.  I understand this is the third time an application has been made.  I am aware from speaking to Department officials that the application is valid.  All i&rsquo;s have be dotted and all t&rsquo;s crossed and we cannot allow the rules to delay it further.  We seek a guarantee that this will not become an issue.  I am aware from speaking to officials this will not be an issue.</P>
        <P>Second, the school has sought this extension for the past ten years.  There are competitive prices and the works are necessary.  I believe they will take place.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and other elected representatives believe they will take place.  I recognise there has been a substantial cut in the primary school building allocation this year but this school is ready to proceed.  We can get people back to work by building the school and this is a very important matter in the heart of the Gaeltacht area of Gaoth Dobhair.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could shed some light on this matter, confirm that the technicality of 30 days will not be used as a blocking mechanism and that in the coming weeks, if not days, the Minister will make an announcement to allow this school to go to tender, as I am led to believe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who, unfortunately, cannot be present.  I thank Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Doherty for raising this matter, as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also the current position in respect of Scoil Chonaill Naofa, Bunbeg, County Donegal, roll number 18219F.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock and the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth present a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc. leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.</P>
        <P>As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  The original criteria were revised and refined in 2004.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4, the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where there is none currently but where there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band 4 project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities such as a library or new sports hall.  The proposed building project for Scoil Chonaill Naofa has been assigned a band 2.1 rating.</P>
        <P>All major projects in the Department&rsquo;s capital programme progress through the same structured process of architectural planning which is divided into clearly defined stages.  The stages of architectural planning are set out in the Department&rsquo;s design team procedures and are necessary to comply with Department of Finance guidelines which require that capital projects <Col N="140"/>be fully designed prior to going to tender.  They also ensure proper cost management of capital projects and facilitate compliance with statutory and publiic procurement requirements.</P>
        <P>There are five stages involved in the progression of major school projects through architectural planning.  This project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning and has almost completed stage 2(b) of the process.  Last year the Minister met a deputation from Scoil Chonaill Naofa.  He welcomed the cost saving proposal for decanting pupils which was presented at the meeting and it was subsequently approved by the Department following an inspection of the premises.</P>
        <P>In September a letter issued to the chairperson of the board of management, requesting the design team to begin work on revising the stage 2(b) documentation for submission to the Department.  These revisions are required in order to ensure the contract is in line with the new Government construction contracts committee, GCCC, forms of contract.  Representatives from the board of management of Scoil Chonaill Naofa and their design team attended a briefing in the Department&rsquo;s offices in Tullamore on 26 November.  The briefing was held for a number of schools at a similar stage of the architectural planning process to fully explain what was required in revising tender documentation to take account of the requirements of the new forms of contract.  Subsequently, in December, a revised stage 2(b) submission, including comprehensive tender documentation, was received by the Department and is being considered.  The Department will revert directly to the school when that consideration is complete.</P>
        <P>The Minister is reviewing the Department&rsquo;s school building and modernisation programme with his officials in the context of the allocation for 2010.  The project for Scoil Chonaill Naofa forms part of that review.  The Minister has indicated that he intends to make a further announcement on the school building programme when that review has been completed.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senators for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position on the school building project for Scoil Chonaill Naofa, Bunbeg.</P>

    <Title>Cancer Incidence. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for enabling me to raise this most important issue, the relationship between sunbeds and the significant rise in the incidence of cancer, in particular melanomas.  I might encapsulate it in one sentence.  Legislation was promised to ban the use of sunbeds by people under 18 years, but particularly by those aged under 16.  In 2006 a regulation was outlined regarding the latter group.  In 2008 a regulation was made regarding the use of sunbeds by people under the age of 18 years.</P>
        <P>One would be scared by what is now available.  When one goes to rent a video tape or DVD at some of the big locations, one can get a tan at the same time.  The necessary regulations are not in place, which means there is no foresight regarding safe levels of radiation.  While we all know there are advances in technology, the reality is that radiation levels are increasing.  Those who operate these systems are not necessarily aware of what is going on.</P>
        <P>Again, to put it in one sentence, there was to be legislation, dating from 2006.  There was a public consultation process in 2008.  However, there is now an indication that there will not be any advances made under 2011 on the promised legislation.  If that is the case, we are putting the lives of many at risk.  It is vital that this legislation be introduced, given the increased availability of and access to sunbeds and the increase in the incidence of skin cancer.  The latest data show that the incidence of skin cancer of all types, including melanoma, increased dramatically, in the order of almost 75%, in the ten-year period from 1997 to 2007.  The incid<Col N="141"/>ence of skin cancer is increasing worldwide.  This shows why legislation on the use of sunbeds is needed.  The number of melanoma cases in Ireland has increased by more than 66% in the past ten years.  According to the latest data, there were 667 new cases of malignant melanoma in 2007.  Friends of mine died from this cancer.  A small lump or bump can look so innocent but what it could do is scary.  If people discover lumps and bumps early enough, they are able to survive but a significant number of people are affected by this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although the association between sunbed use and skin cancer can be difficult to prove, what is certain is that such use is increasing and that the available tanning devices are more powerful than they were even a decade ago.  Research published in 2009 by the International Agency for Research and Cancer, IARC, found there was a 75% increase in the risk of developing cutaneous melanoma when people began using tanning beds regularly before the age of 30 years.  A ban on the use of sunbeds by those under 18 years would recognise that burns early in life are particularly dangerous and that young people might not understand or ignore the risks.  These concerns apply equally to adults.  The IARC&rsquo;s assessment was that the health warning on the use of sunbeds should be upgraded.  It finds they can be as carcinogenic as cigarettes.  That is a statement that should not and cannot be ignored.  It is also reported that lax operating procedures by tanning salons increase the risk.  It is clear regulation is needed as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>It seems any individual with no qualifications or experience can open a tanning salon.  There are no regulatory restrictions on the type of equipment that can be purchased.  The IARC in its research conducted in the United Kingdom found that 25% of the salons surveyed had beds with radiation levels intended for medical use only.  The operators did not know the levels of ultraviolet radiation emitted.  The Irish Cancer Society stated firmly to me that it was its experience that the position in Ireland was no different.</P>
        <P>In June 2006, following publication of the cancer control strategy in Ireland, the Minister for Health and Children announced that legislation to ban persons under 16 years from using sunbeds would be introduced.  In 2008 there was a public consultation process and submissions were received.  Although the legislation was progressing well in 2009, it seems it has now stalled.  That is why I decided to submit this Adjournment matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many believe that because in foreign climes we expose ourselves to sunlight lying on a sunbed for a while it will provide some protection.  That is not true.  Many think that because they use sunbeds they do not need protection when they expose themselves to sunlight abroad.  That is not true either.  Regarding vitamin D deficiency, people are told that if they use a sunbed, they will absorb increased levels of vitamin D.  They should be aware that they can absorb it better through their diet.  The practice of bringing a source of intense ultraviolet radiation to within six inches of a person&rsquo;s skin must also be questioned as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>This is not a sunny period.  Many people probably went abroad over the Christmas to revive their tans naturally.  Everybody knows the dangers of natural sunlight but it is a fact that people will maintain their tan until their next holiday by using sunbeds.  It is one thing if these are regulated but another matter if they are not.  Many people should not be near them at all.  I hope there will be good news in the Minister&rsquo;s reply with regard to expediting this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the current state of play with regard to the proposed legislation relating to sunbed use.</P>
        <P>In June 2006, A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland recommended that &ldquo;regulation of sunbed use, including restriction to use by adults only, should be put in place&rdquo;.  The Department <Col N="142"/>of Health and Children has researched this topic and sourced national and international research on the dangers associated with sunbed use.  In addition, the Department has consulted with interested parties and conducted a public consultation on the matter.</P>
        <P>In this context the Minister intends to introduce the following measures, subject to Government approval: prohibiting the use of sunbeds by those under 18 years of age; introducing measures relating to the sale or hire of sunbeds; banning commercial sunbed use where such a facility is unsupervised; requiring the placing of warning signs in prominent places on premises where sunbed services are offered to the public; requiring the placing of warning labels on sunbeds, whether for sale or use on business premises; requiring proprietors of sunbed businesses offering sunbed services to register with the HSE; introducing enforcement provision to enable inspections to be carried out and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; and allowing exemptions in respect of the use of sunbeds for medical use.</P>
        <P>It was during the course of last year that the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, which is an expert body under the World Health Organisation, WHO, reclassified sunbed use as a group one carcinogen.  This higher risk classification places sunbed use on a par with cigarette smoking.  The Department will take this development fully into account in the consideration of the measures it proposes to introduce.  The Minister&rsquo;s overriding priority is to prohibit the use of sunbeds by those under 18 years of age.</P>
        <P>Prior to the introduction of this legislation, Ireland must comply with the EU transparency directive, which requires member states to notify the EU of draft legislation which might be a technical barrier to trade.  It should also be noted that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for product safety matters generally, which includes appliances for skin exposure to ultraviolet and infra-red radiation, in other words, tanning appliances.  Discussions between the two Departments to consider product safety matters arising in the context of the proposed legislation have been initiated.</P>
        <P>The progression of the legislation in this area is continuing and will include a final round of consultations with interested parties, finalisation of the regulatory impact assessment and preparation of the draft legislation.  The Minister thereafter intends to bring a memorandum to Government for approval.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  Perhaps she would convey to the Department the wish of Members and the various cancer societies that this legislation be progressed in 2010 and not long-fingered.
