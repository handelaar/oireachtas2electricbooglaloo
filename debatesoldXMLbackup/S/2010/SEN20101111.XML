	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the importance of protecting intellectual property rights, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and all other Senators for ten minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons; and No. 2, statements on the current overcrowding levels in Irish prisons (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and conclude not later than 2.30 p.m., on which Senators may speak for eight minutes, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons.</P>

	<P>The words of Professor Patrick Honohan are listened to with great interest both in this country and abroad.  At an Oireachtas committee meeting yesterday he made some telling remarks which are worthy of debate in this House.  One of the most interesting remarks he made was about the difficulties encountered in finding a solution for householders in negative equity and struggling with huge personal debt.  He is acknowledging something of which we are all aware.  Finding a solution that people will believe is fair when householders are in negative equity and have huge personal debts and incomes are dropping will be very difficult.  He remarked that it was wrong that large developers, the individuals who got us into the mess in the first place, seemed to be insulated &mdash; I am using his words &mdash; from the financial difficulties many others were experiencing.  However, he also contradicted himself to a degree because he said wages were still too high and affecting competitiveness in the overall economy.  When asked to comment on the banks, he made it clear that we should be pushing to sell all of our banks because it appeared the nationalisation of Allied Irish Banks would happen in the coming months because of the huge difficulties it was experiencing in raising funds.  All of these issues warrant a proper debate in the House, especially when we consider what is happening in the bond markets, with interest rates exceeding a rate of well over 8% for ten year bonds and hitting 7.45% for three year bonds.  We witnessed such erratic movement prior to experiencing other difficulties in our financial system in the past two years.  If international investors are treating Ireland as a no-go zone, we should take the matter <Col N="658"/>seriously.  We should have a proper debate to discuss the reasons interest rates are increasing to these levels and the potential effect on the economy next year.</P>
        <P>We should also have a debate in this House, with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food present, to discuss what seemed to be an attempt to get rid of Ireland&rsquo;s sugar beet industry based on wrong information.  It means the Government messed up on the sugar beet industry which was profitable and good for this country.  It now seems we gave it away too easily.  That warrants an urgent debate in the House.</P>
        <P>I must mention the issue of passwords at Anglo Irish Bank.  Perhaps the Minister could comment on whether these documents can be accessed only through the passwords of the individuals concerned.  Would it be possible to bypass the passwords in some way, and can the necessary expertise be brought in to do this?  Two years after we said we would deal with the financial mess that is Anglo Irish Bank, we are still running around the country looking for passwords, and this is making us a laughing stock across the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In recent days I have sought from the Leader an indication of the Government&rsquo;s response to the motion that was passed in the House last week.  I have given this some serious consideration and have spoken to graduates of DCU and the University of Limerick.  Graduates of these institutions have been deprived of a Seanad vote for the past 30 years since the people&rsquo;s decision in the 1979 referendum.  I have had a long series of discussions with my colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, and it is my intention at this stage to seek the support of the courts in this matter.  Senator Bacik and I have considered how we can make progress on this, but it is not unreasonable to state that these people are being deprived of their right to representation, clearly perverting the will of the people as indicated in 1979.  I seek a declaration that this has been an unreasonable delay, and it is my intention to have this dealt with in the courts to push the Government into taking action, unless the Government decides to do so in light of our motion and the decision of the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The four-year plan has taken over all discussions.  I ask the Leader to go directly to the Government and say that the four-year plan, as well as dealing with the obvious, should also strike optimistic and positive notes by indicating options for growth.  My worry is that the Cabinet is so shell-shocked dealing with all the difficulties of national and international finances that its members are afraid to look outside the box.  It is important that when the plan is published, we see things we can be hopeful about &mdash; optimism, encouragement, growth possibilities.  One of these possibilities, which I propose the Leader would ask to be included in the four-year plan, is metro north.  The finances can be arranged in such a way that it will not cost the Government anything in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is important infrastructure and its construction will create up to 6,000 jobs, which will mean wages churning into the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, I ask the Government to accept the proposal from Siemens Ireland, which I mentioned to the Leader before, to install a water meter in every house in Ireland at its own expense.  This would represent a free loan of &euro;1.1 billion to the Government, which would be repaid when water charges came into operation some time in the future, and would create another 1,000 jobs.  Another proposal I would like to see included in the four-year plan is one that was raised by my colleague Senator Cannon in the House recently.  We could build on the idea he mentioned.  The Government should go to Ryanair and Aer Lingus, buy a million <Col N="659"/>airline tickets into Ireland and make them available to hoteliers, the tourism industry and communities that want to sell Ireland abroad.  Organisations could offer free transport to Ireland.  With regard to the cost to the Government, Ryanair and Aer Lingus are selling tickets for &euro;7; therefore, it could get a million tickets for &euro;7 million.  These would be available to people who want to sell their towns, their hotels or their industries.  I ask that such proposals be included in the four-year plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I see our economy and borrowing requirements are once again the lead story in the <i>Financial Times</i> today.  It is worth noting, in view of what the Taoiseach said yesterday, that it is not the Opposition spokespersons or anyone else who are putting the country on the front page of the <i>Financial Times</i>.  That newspaper is simply reporting the facts and the true position which, unfortunately, is bad news.  The Taoiseach cannot say, any more than his predecessor, that our problems are due to people talking down the economy.  The facts are there and they must be addressed, as others have said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to consider organising a debate when we get through all the legislation going through the House.  That joke was lost on him.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the debate could be organised after the budget.  It is something that would wait a few weeks.  This summer, I went to the valley of the Somme and visited the grave of a granduncle of mine who was killed in the First World War.  I am sure many people in this Chamber have a similar knowledge of people who were killed in that battle.  We are reminded of it today more than any other day.  We should have a debate in this House, and not simply about the First World War and the Irish participation in it, in view of the lead-up to the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, an iconic and important occasion during which major sacrifices were made for the country and its future.  We are reminded of that in many ways by the difficulties we are in as a nation and the question mark over our very survival as a State.  The 1916 Rising is something we should commemorate appropriately, not simply with the standard public events but in a much more innovative and lasting way.  As my party leader has pointed out, many things occurred during the period up to 1916, not least the formation of the party of which I am proud to be a member.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about things that could unite the country.  Is there a narrative that would combine both these iconic events in our history?  The anniversary of the Rising is six years away, which is not too far for us to start deciding on an appropriate way to commemorate these major events.  I ask for a debate on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The use of the phrase &ldquo;our very survival as a State&rdquo; is part of the problem we have at the moment in political discourse.  We need to pause for reflection.  Yesterday evening, the website of <i>The Guardian</i> ran a story stating that a decision had already been made that the International Monetary Fund was to make decisions for this country as of today.  Much of the information on international wire services pertains to decisions that have supposedly been made or are on the verge of being made.  We need a debate in the House on the essence of democracy in this country, how we make decisions, who makes them and on whose behalf are they made.  Regardless of the composition of the Government or the policies we independently decide upon and implement, we need to pause and decide whom we want to make those decisions.  The last people we want making such decisions are speculators, people in front of computer screens, Cockney wide boys and people whose only concern is making a quick buck on the supposed strength of a currency of which we are a member.  This goes beyond the governance of this country and the debate on policy.  We are pawns in a war centred on the euro &mdash; a situation in which we last found ourselves in 1992 with the then European <Col N="660"/>monetary system.  I ask Members, when discussing topics in the House, to hold the debate on those terms.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service will today release a report on macroeconomic policy and effective fiscal economic governance.  Those are the terms on which we should be striving to make decisions in the future &mdash; strict fiscal rules and the powers of Parliament through the mandate of the people to make the economy secure for the future.  I ask that such debates are held in this House immediately and regularly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in asking for a debate on the Government&rsquo;s four-year plan.  Senator Boyle made a good point, that we did not adhere to strict financial rules, and that is partly why we are in this mess.  I ask that, as part of the debate on the four-year plan, the Government would introduce a stimulus plan which includes the construction of the metro north and the Cork docklands regeneration project.  This is a project that could lift Cork and raise the capital of Ireland.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also important that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the T&aacute;naiste come to the House to explain why we now have no sugar industry in this country.  It is extraordinary that the European Union is now importing sugar when we have closed the Mallow and Carlow sugar beet factories.  Was it out of pure greed, to look after friends of Fianna F&aacute;il?  Who gave the advice to the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the European Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That decision was clearly wrong and the information was incorrect.  We now have another example of a bad Government decision.  It was bad Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government policy that impacted on rural areas and the towns of Carlow and Mallow.  It is important that the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the T&aacute;naiste come to this House to explain the Government&rsquo;s policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate that we refer today to the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918.  In fact, there is a commemoration today in Glasnevin Cemetery.  This country has reached a stage of maturity where people can recognise what happened at that difficult time and the number of people who sacrificed their lives for a cause about which they were very sincere.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Boyle&rsquo;s comments about the international media and the undermining of this country, its economy and the eurozone.  I received a call yesterday from a counsellor of an investor in New York who has invested &euro;1.6 million in Roscommon.  He was worried because he had heard the statement by Mr. Mark Grant, managing director of Southwest Securities, on Bloomberg TV.  It was a dangerous and damaging statement about this country which was broadcast around the world.  There are two points I wish to make about this.  First, I met the Minister last night and was reassured that under the eligible liability guarantee scheme, all deposits were guaranteed up to next year and beyond.  In the circumstances, I believe the Minister should make a state of the nation address under section 31(2) of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources could issue a directive to RTE to allow the Minister to make such a statement which would be carried worldwide.  The situation is so grave&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="661"/>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>We are living beyond our means.  He could say, like Charlie Haughey, that we are living beyond our means.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter of national importance, not something about which we can be flippant.  We must counteract the statements being made by the international media and the person to do it is either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance.  He can allay the fears of this investor in New York, a genuine Irishman who has invested money in Roscommon but who is concerned.  I am allaying his fears today and was in touch with the counsellor this morning.  However, I am anxious that the Minister should do this.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government Information Services should have a round-the-clock service monitoring what is happening.  Frankly, I do not believe the Government Information Services is doing its job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is monitoring local radio stations.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>There are more people in the Government Information Services than in the entire Civil Service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and have people who are very competent on hand to counteract the statements made in the media.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Boyle said.  It would be very useful to have a regular debate on the economy, for which I have been calling for some time.  It would be a statutory item held at least every week.  Apart from everything else, it would mean we could have these ideas discussed in a relatively unhurried manner rather than absorbing the Order of Business every day.  It is the principal thing item discussed; nothing else is placed on the agenda.  Of course, it is worrying.  Few of us thought we would see the interest rate on bonds going above 9% and apparently it is still climbing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with some of Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments.  I heard some of the broadcast from New York and some of the comments made were factually inaccurate such as that the State would run out of money within one month.  That is simply not the case, but it will cause concern in the market.  We must be as open as possible and use these economic debates.  I have been in contact for a number of years with Mr. Peter Mathews who has an almost obsessional interest, as we all have probably, in the economy.  His figures have consistently been right.  In a telephone conversation with him this morning he told me that in September alone &euro;55 billion was redeemed by the banks in bonds, in a fairly surreptitious movement, with loans from the ECB.  There was no discussion of this in either House of the Oireachtas.  I raised the matter a couple of weeks ago when Anglo Irish Bank redeemed &euro;7.9 billion.  I believe every penny put into Anglo Irish Bank is completely wasted.  However, I agree with Senator Boyle that it is important to have reasoned debate on a regular basis on the economy.  We might come up with some ideas.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has had a number of extremely useful ideas, particularly about the relevance of the metro north project.  If it is costed on a basis where we find value, it might well turn out to be sustainable.  These are the issues we should be discussing in such debates in order that other issues can be addressed during the valuable time made available on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue I wish to raise relates to something we have been discussing for months, the negative perception of the economy on the front pages of international <Col N="662"/>newspapers and the visit of Commissioner Olli Rehn this week.  Yesterday, courtesy of Senator Butler, representatives of Spirit of Ireland met a cross-party group of Members.  They pointed out that in 2015 there would be a shortage of energy supplies across Europe and the world.  Ireland has natural resources of wind and wave energy and is well placed to supply not only our own energy needs but much of Europe&rsquo;s.  It is a clean, natural, cheap and sustainable energy supply that will attract global investment to this country if we develop it.  It will supply many countries in Europe as they decommission their nuclear power plants and close their coal pits.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this proposal.  We should invite the Minister, ask why international economic observers do not recognise that Ireland will be the centre for the provision of energy supplies for all of Europe in years to come and ask him how we can progress this.  It is a win-win for the country and investment here.  We can be central to the supply of an important resource to the Continent and possibly beyond.</P>
        <P>There was an excellent documentary on RTE on Tuesday night about exceptional children.  We should have a debate on the matter.  We regularly talk about investing in research and trying to develop our highly skilled labour force.  According to the documentary, there are many highly intelligent children coming through the system, but unless their parents are wealthy enough to send them to specialist schools, they will not get the chance to reach their potential.  The matter is worthy of debate.  I urge the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to work together on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to address a specific proposal to the Leader.  At 11 a.m. today will he call for the suspension of Standing Orders to allow one minute of silence to commemorate the Irish people and all those who died in World War I?  It would be a suitable gesture.  From the inception of the State this House has had a reputation for taking particularly pluralist and broad-minded stances on a range of issues.  The Seanad was an attempt to embrace and encompass all of the cultural and identity strands of the nation  Given its history and the reason for its existence, it would be very appropriate for this Chamber to specifically honour the victims of World War I.  The Seanad should be the Chamber in which we extend recognition to the Irish men and women &mdash; it was mainly men &mdash; who went to fight in that war.  Regardless of how we look retrospectively at what they did, they went for the best of reasons.  Some of them went as a result of economic hardship, others out of a belief it would achieve Home Rule, while others went because of a range of other idealistic beliefs such as the defence of small nations.  The Seanad can be big for once and make history by being the first elected body to make a big stand.  I ask the Leader to propose the suspension of Standing Orders for one minute of silence, given that the war ended during the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agreed with the call made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole last week for a debate on the separation of powers.  He made that call in the light of the decision made to hold the by-election in County Donegal.  We have since had several examples of political grandstanding &mdash; there was an example this morning and another last week involving a political party &mdash; in looking for the intrusion of the courts in the political arena.  This is highly dangerous and, in many ways, contrasts with the almost Jesuitical approach politicians take to the separation of powers.  We need to debate the issue.  I was amazed last year when the Government decided that judges who were paid far more excessively than judges in other&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not wish to interrupt the Senator, I would like to raise a point of order.  As it is now 11 a.m., I would like to hear the response of the Leader to my proposition that we suspend the sitting of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we had no prior notice of this proposition.  I am sure the Leader would have appreciated such notice.  No, it cannot be allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, but I would like to make the proposition.  It should not require a formal proposition; it should be common sense.</P>

	<P>A debate on the issue of the separation of powers is urgently required before we end up with the courts and politics in the mire together to no one&rsquo;s advantage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday and today I listened to various Members extend sympathy with regard to those who lost their lives in World War I.  Unfortunately, many of them lost their lives because of British military incompetence.  This was a shame and should be condemned when we sympathise with the families and relatives of those who lost their lives during that war.  Yesterday Members extolled the vision of Mr. John Redmond who was from my county, but I wonder how the Members concerned feel today now that they realise the leadership of their party is trying to hatch a deal with Sinn F&eacute;in in the by-election in County Donegal.  That seems to be a contradiction and I wonder whether they are aware of and recognise this.  In other words, they are putting politics and party interests before everything else.</P>

	<P>Following on what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, I have a question on Seanad reform.  There is a serious issue with regard to the vote lost by the Government last week on which I would like to hear the Leader&rsquo;s response.  As I mentioned yesterday, Judge Curran&rsquo;s judgment in the case brought by Senator Doherty put a legal framework on the concept of democracy.  It also gave us a clear precedent on the need for representation in a democracy.  There is an issue for graduates of UL, DCU and the institutes of technology who have not been afforded the right to representation in the Seanad as envisaged in the referendum held in 1979.  There is a serious legal matter to be decided in that regard.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the report issued today on the heroin problem in Ireland.  The report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is very worrying.  It indicates that Ireland has the worst rate of heroin addiction in Europe and the longest waiting times for treatment.  We need a debate on the matter and on how best to deal with the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I suggest that for the future we should have a policy of having a minute&rsquo;s silence during the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.  We should all support this proposal.</P>

	<P>I support the proposal made by Senator Keaveney for a debate on the Spirit of Ireland proposals on wind energy.  Its presentation was one of the most impressive I had ever attended and I compliment Senator Butler on making it possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White made a significant contribution to our discussion when he suggested we should consider how we use the remaining preparatory years leading up to the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  What makes his contribution more significant is that we are in the midst of an economic crisis which threatens to swamp and overawe us as a nation.  The two issues are not mutually exclusive.  We must look back at what the leaders of the 1916 Rising wanted to achieve and consider the great sacrifices they made.  I compliment TG4 on the excellent series it produced on them.  I am convinced, as I have been saying since the beginning of the recession, that unless we bring positivity and patriotism into the debate on the economic crisis, we will not overcome our difficulties.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a good point about the four-year plan when he said it should include a stimulus package.  I am convinced the Government has deeply integrated such a package into the plan.  I suggest the same must be done in the budget, as there is a feeling doomsday is 7 December.  For several months the Leader and I have been fine-tuning a number of proposals which, if accepted, would have a major impact in tackling unemployment.  We have researched the issues, consulted and presented our proposals to the Government and I hope they will have an outing in the budget.  That is the route we must take.  We must be positive and come forward with and test proposals.</P>

	<P>I support the remarks made by Senators Twomey and Boyle.  I understood the Leader had already committed to having regular debates on the economy and the difficulties facing us.  With regard to our largest bank, Allied Irish Banks, I understood it was a <i>sine qua non</i> that the stock market quotation would remain in place.  However, there are persistent rumours that the bank has been overrun and we know it will be 92% to 95% State-owned.  Is there now a suggestion in Government quarters that it will be nationalised completely?  That would be a retrograde step, particularly following on what the Governor of the Central Bank had to say yesterday in his address to the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs when he responded positively to my question.  Civil servants are not equipped to run banks.  They are not into risk assessment, enterprise and allied matters.  The Governor stated the sooner we got out of the situation in which we found ourselves, the better.  However, we must bear with it because it will take some time to do this.  I seek an assurance from the Leader on this question, in so far as he is able to give one.  It is important, as Senator Twomey suggested, that the Minister for Finance come to the House to debate this and related issues.  As the Governor said yesterday, we need some strong banking forces.  The Government has abandoned the so-called third banking force idea.  It is important and a national concern that we have two or three strong banks.  Will the Leader give a commitment to have the Minister for Finance attend the House for statements on this matter?</P>

        <P Just="Left">I support the calls for the debate on the massive potential in exporting renewable energy as discussed by Spirit of Ireland in its presentation to Members yesterday.  We need, however, to be careful about tying ourselves too closely with one particular company or project.  The debate on the export of renewable energy should also include State-built interconnectors and overall Government policy. I agree with Senator O'Toole that we need to think outside the box in a big way.  We got behind the Ardnacrusha hydroelectric project in the past which made a huge difference to the country.  We need to send a signal to the world that we will think big like that again.</P>
        
        <P>Spirit of Ireland also raised energy storage, a point not referred to earlier, which needs to be examined carefully.  It is a key factor specific to wind-generated energy.  People do not seem to understand there is planning permission for 15 GW of wind-generated energy.</P>

The court deemed the decision taken in 2006 by the European Commission, in conjunction with the Government, was based on erroneous figures.  The tragedy is that an industry was shut down, hundreds of jobs lost, the tillage industry greatly disadvantaged and Ireland and Europe became sugar importers.  I recall raising this matter in the House on many occasions in 2005 and 2006.  Unfortunately, it now appears what we thought then was correct, namely, that the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, sleepwalked into closing this industry.</P>

The report from the European Court of Auditors raises a matter of grave importance deserving of a debate today.  We must tell the Government and the European Commission that there is a moral obligation to work with the appropriate stakeholders to see if a sugar industry can be reintroduced into Ireland.</P>

	<P>I thank all Members who attended yesterday&rsquo;s presentation by Spirit of Ireland which provided an update on its energy supply capacity and how it could help make the country self-sufficient in energy.  The number of industries that would spin-off from energy self-sufficiency would be enormous.  All parties in the Houses are in agreement on this.  Every Member who spoke yesterday after the presentation fully supported the move towards energy self-sufficiency.  This could be one of the largest projects undertaken in this country and is needed now.  I agree with the call by Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Keaveney for a debate on this matter.  Self-sufficiency should be to the forefront of this Government&rsquo;s and future Governments&rsquo; energy policies.  We all need to put on the green jersey and do this job for this country.  If we can become energy self-sufficient, in ten years &euro;60 billion in fuel imports would be saved, an impressive figure.  We could do an awful lot in health and education with that money as well as the revenue earned from exporting energy.</P><Col N="667"/>

The European Court of Auditors report showed the Government managed to sleepwalk its way into the closure of an industry.  In every responsibility the Government has been meant to discharge, it has been unable to do so.  For these reasons, the report should be debated today and a response given to the points raised by Senator Bradford.</P>

	<P>I draw the attention of the House to a speech made by Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Driscoll from Drimoleague in west Cork at a conference of other Irish chief executives.  He was stinging in his criticism of politicians but also of business leaders who took their eye off the ball.  Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll said that our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents built up this country, and he asked if we would be the generation that falls down on the job.</P>
        <P>I admire Senator Alex White but I heard his negative talk about the country&rsquo;s position and I was shocked by his extreme emotionalism.  I visited Haiti last year and was in Malawi earlier this year.  The contrast in the standard of living here compared with the past and what is happening elsewhere is stark.  Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll is chief executive of Glen Dimplex which employs 12,000 people, 2,000 of whom work in Ireland.  He boldly said that we should honour the 1916 Rising and Proclamation by reducing our costs and restoring the country&rsquo;s competitiveness. <Col N="668"/> The cost of doing business on this side of the Border is 35% higher than in the North.  How in God&rsquo;s name can companies keep going in those conditions?</P>
        <P>Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll draws an analogy with the GAA, which he says is the spirit of our country.  I totally agree with that.  He stated the &ldquo;pride, passion, vision, talent ... sense of urgency [and] winning&rdquo; by the GAA and our sporting teams should be what is driving us forward.  We must have a spirit of hope.  It is our responsibility as politicians to inspire hope in our people rather than seeing them being knocked every day.  People are gripped by fear owing to this total nonsense.  We will get out of this situation.</P>

The chief executive of one of the major Irish airlines is constantly talking about the terms and conditions of working people, including the minimum wage.  If that is the vista facing us in terms of the management of the economy, then I would much prefer the <i>status quo</i>, bad and all as it is.</P>

        <P>I agree with Senator Bradford&rsquo;s point.  Reform of the sugar beet industry was debated at length in this House in 2005 to 2006 period.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, assured this House that due to the prevailing situation this was the only exit and that there would be compensation.  Thanks to the report of the EU Court of Auditors, we now discover that the Commission was working on old figures.  That beggars belief.  Some 240 jobs were involved in sugar beet production in north Cork, as Senator Bradford can attest.  There were also other jobs in other parts of rural Ireland, not least in west Cork, that were dependent on the sugar beet industry.  What has happened here is a gargantuan political disaster.  It is ridiculous in the extreme and, on that basis, I will support the amendment to the Order of Business.  I ask the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste, not the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the House to explain this disaster for jobs in rural Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise the forthcoming postal services Bill that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is proposing to bring before this House.  A number of us have received representations from postal workers because some 10,000 jobs are at stake in this sector.  An Post provides an excellent and efficient service with a next-day delivery rate of nearly 90%.  We have suffered in the past owing to privatisation and market liberalisation.  The universal service order is in place and is being looked after by An Post.  I am concerned that rural areas will suffer if this market is opened up.  The EU&rsquo;s recycle 16 directive should be put in place in order that social considerations would be taken into account when this Bill is being formulated.  We should ensure postal services in rural Ireland are looked after in order that those services, which we appreciate but take for granted, will remain.  I ask the Leader to revert to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on that matter.  We should have consensus in this House in supporting our postal workers and the excellent postal service.</P>

        <P>I am heartened by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s statement that he and the Leader will bring forward proposals to the Minister for Finance on job creation.  Fine Gael has made several proposals concerning job creation, yet the Government has not listened or taken on board a single proposal.  This House has had several debates on the economy, but neither Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; nor the Leader have brought forward in any of those debates any of the proposals they purport to have.  If they were to do so, the Opposition could debate and evaluate their proposals.  I hope that when the next economic debate occurs in the House, they will bring forward those proposals.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise with the Leader the looming crisis in local government financing.  Many local authorities will be having budgetary debates in the coming week, some of whom are facing financial ruin.  We have not seen the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in this House for a long time.  Consequently, the Leader should ask him to attend the House as a mater of urgency.  There is a shortfall in every single area concerning the funding of local democracy and, therefore, an urgent debate is required on that subject.</P>

He is absolutely right to say it is unacceptable that the graduates of colleges, other than those of the NUI and Trinity, are not eligible to vote in Seanad elections.  We need to examine a wider reform in this regard.  Under our Constitution, it is possible to bring forward legislation governing the way in which the vocational panels are elected as well.  We must grasp the nettle in this respect.  It is embarrassing, especially when it comes to the university seats, to canvass people whose degrees are as good as anyone else&rsquo;s but who cannot vote because of an antiquated system.  It is to the Government&rsquo;s discredit that there has been no movement on this.</P>
        <P>It is becoming the fashion for Senators to have recourse to the courts or various tribunals, and that can only be a good thing.

	<P>Yes.  Does the Leader agree we should be able to get to a stage in Ireland where we can talk about remembering the fallen of the First World War?  Pope John Paul II said war was always a defeat for humanity, and it is, but sometimes people go to war for pure and honourable motives, which is true of the thousands of Irishmen who fought in the First World War.  It should be possible to remember them without feeling the need to mention immediately the men and women of 1916.  It should be possible to honour them in their own right.  That said, I do not think it is appropriate to engage in gestures that do not resonate with our traditions, such as adjourning this House.  That is not a necessary response and takes symbolism to another extreme.</P>

	<P>There is no one on an ego trip, particularly in a time of recession.  I fully support the will of the people 30 years ago which decided this should take place.  A motion was passed in this House last Wednesday week that it should take place.  It is a top priority for me, as Leader of this House, to deal with this, but we must understand that it is not politics as usual at this time.  In January, I will go to the Government to see how we can have movement on the proposal.  I give that commitment today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole made many good proposals on tourism.  In recent weeks we had a tremendous debate on tourism with the Minister present.  Many good proposals were brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention and I hope many of them will be included in the budget proposals.  Senators Boyle and Leyden referred to a debate on democracy and I have no difficulty with that.  Senator Boyle also brought a number of issues to the attention of the House which I will pass on to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden and Norris referred to the Government Information Service.  There is a serious challenge with the attention of the world media on everything taking place in Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  I will pass on the views of the Senators after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in and Butler referred to the outstanding submissions made by the Spirit of Ireland people.  This represents a window of opportunity, as Senator Butler said, where the country can make &euro;60 billion in savings in energy costs in the next ten years through new energy such as wind power and wave power.  Geographically, Ireland could be the energy country of Europe.  It is exciting and uplifting good news in these difficult times.  I will do everything I can in order that it can be centre stage on the floor of the Seanad for a debate in the future.  I have no difficulty supporting the call.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keaveney referred to children with exceptional talents who have been getting a fair chance to achieve their potential.  I fully support the Senator in her call.  Senator McFadden referred to the postal Bill which will be before the House next week.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke called for a debate on financing local authorities.  I agree with him on this point because local authorities face major challenges.  Every local authority faces a massive financial challenge because it is difficult to collect rates.  The retail sector has had its back to the walls for the past two years and a debate on this will take place before Christmas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Before getting into the main part of my speech on intellectual property, it might be timely and appropriate to discuss some issues pertaining to the recent court case which has motivated this motion to a large extent.</P>
        <P>The recent judgment by Mr. Justice Peter Charleton in the High Court case between EMI Records (Ireland) Limited, Sony Music Entertainment Ireland Limited, Universal Music Ireland Limited, Warner Music Ireland Limited and WEA International Incorporated on the one hand and UPC Communications Ireland Limited on the other is an important decision, and one that is being examined carefully.  The recording companies concerned sought injunctions against UPC, an Internet service provider, ISP, in respect of the downloading of copyrighted material via the Internet.  The court declined to grant such injunctions.</P><Col N="673"/>
        <P>The area in question is complex and encompasses issues such as the illegal downloading of copyrighted material, the treatment of ISPs in such circumstances, the obligations imposed on member states by EU law and the upcoming requirement for Ireland to transpose the 2009 framework directive on a common regulatory framework for electronic communication networks and services.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s judgment is lengthy, running to 78 pages.  His ruling ranges across the various provisions in copyright, e-commerce and national telecommunications legislation and the relevant European law in each of these areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is correct, in that the Charleton judgment goes to the heart of the issue.  If I could have a copy, it would be helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State.  He is kind and I appreciate receiving this copy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Having obtained a copy of the judgment, my Department referred it to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for advice, which we are currently awaiting.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for intellectual property, I am concerned to ensure generally that the interests of rights holders in respect of copyrights and performances are upheld and not infringed by illegal activity on the Internet or elsewhere.  However, I must also have regard to the position of our ISPs.  Articles 12 to 14, inclusive, of the European e-commerce directive provide defences to ISPs that transmit digital content, including copyrighted material, by electronic means on the Internet.  These articles have been transposed in Ireland through regulations 16 to 18, inclusive, of SI 68 of 2003.  Regulation 16 provides that ISPs are not liable for information transmitted by them in a communication network where an ISP establishes that it is a &ldquo;mere conduit&rdquo; or carrier of the information.  Regulation 17 similarly covers caching or temporary storage.  Regulation 18 deals with hosting or permanent storage.  However, these regulations do not affect the power of any court to make an order against an ISP requiring that it not infringe or cease infringing any legal right.</P>
        <P>The Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the latter under the Minister, Deputy Ryan, are in contact regarding the case, but the advice of the Attorney General on the case&rsquo;s implications is awaited.  Senators will appreciate that I am not in a position to speak further about the case or its potential implications.  The matter is a sensitive one, as I am sure Senator Norris is acutely aware.</P>
        <P>I will address two distinct issues relating to the importance of protecting intellectual property &mdash; first, the importance of intellectual property protection to business and the State supports for a strong innovation environment and, second, the importance of having a sound and balanced <Col N="674"/>regulatory environment for the protection of intellectual property.  The concept of intellectual property covers a wide range of creations of the human mind, from the inventions, symbols and designs used in industry to literary and artistic works.  The most common vehicles for protecting intellectual property rights are patents for inventions, trademarks for branding and copyright for artistic works such as books, films and paintings.  Intellectual property protection and innovation are inextricably linked.  The products resulting from innovation generally come at a considerable cost to companies in terms of human and financial resources.  It is the facility to protect the fruits of this investment with intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrighting that provides the incentive to industry to invest in research and development.</P>
        <P>Patents are one of the most valuable assets to companies seeking to protect innovation.  They are central to supporting innovative companies across the business sector in several ways.  First, they add economic value to inventions by giving them a monopoly for a fixed term.  This can help to secure funding for commercialisation of inventions and bring products to the market, which leads to profitable commercial returns.  Second, they allow for the circulation of cutting edge technological information.  In exchange for the monopoly right gained in a patent, applications are published after an initial period from their filing or priority date.  This encourages inventors and their competitors to research further developments arising from this information and often results in further technological advances and breakthroughs.  Third, patent licenses encourage inventors, investors and manufacturers to co-operate.  This particular co-operation linkage is key to innovation.  Licenses are the key means of exchange in the knowledge society marketplace for ideas and often result in furthering research and cutting the time to market.</P>
        <P>Trademarks facilitate the development of branding, enable consumers to identify a product or service of a particular company and help to distinguish one product from other similar products.  Trademarks are often associated with certain characteristics of goods or services such as taste, quality, reliability or value for money.</P>
     
        <P Just="Left">A strong trade mark associated with a successful product can ensure the continued success of the product even after a patent has expired and competing products become available.  It is important for business to register and protect their trade marks in order that quality goods and services are identified with their trade mark by their customers.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is widely accepted that a high level of copyright protection is generally essential for the encouragement of intellectual creation.  Copyright ensures the maintenance and development of creativity in the overall interests of authors, producers, consumers and the public at large.  A rigorous and effective system for the protection of copyright, and what are deemed to be related rights, is necessary to provide authors and producers with a just reward for their creative efforts and also to encourage producers and publishers to continue to invest in creative works.  In the modern world of business, the intangible assets of a company are often more valuable than the company&rsquo;s physical assets.  Identifying and protecting the intellectual property in a business can increase competitiveness and assist the business in a variety of ways such as building a strong branding strategy, providing access to capital or through profitable licensing agreements.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">It is imperative that Irish companies, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, understand the importance of protecting their innovative products and services through the use of intellectual property.  The importance of providing an environment for business in which innovative ideas are encouraged and rewarded has long been and continues to be a core objective of this Government.  Commercialisation and the transfer of technology flourish where intellectual property rights and associated know-how are guaranteed and legally enforced.  Ireland&rsquo;s legislative framework in intellectual property and in other relevant fields enables companies here to create, protect and exploit their intellectual property assets.  An additional important con<Col N="675"/>sideration is that it provides researchers in our third level institutes with the means and incentive to commercialise this intellectual property for the benefit of industry and ultimately the economy and taxpayers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years, the Government has been implementing measures that encourage the development of intellectual property, IP, by means other than intellectual property regulation, and this has included a range of supports to encourage commercialisation, technology transfer and the generation of intellectual property where possible and feasible.  There are two reasons the State provides this support: to increase the level of intellectual property transferred to industry from research in higher education institutions for the benefit of the economy; and to facilitate the development of high quality and effective systems and policies to ensure that the intellectual property is identified, protected and transferred, where possible into companies in Ireland.  These have both been identified by the recent task force on innovation as key priority areas for improving and growing Ireland&rsquo;s knowledge economy.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland provides a range of supports to encourage the generation of intellectual property.  These include specialist support to third level institutions in identifying and exploiting intellectual property, financial support for research and resulting intellectual property protection, support for emerging start-ups and linking inventions emerging from different universities where appropriate.  Enterprise Ireland also funds commercialisation specialists in the technology transfer offices.  This measure supports a network of dedicated staff placed within the commercialisation function of the universities and institutes of technology and working directly with them to ensure that best use is made of research outputs with commercial potential.  The supported intellectual property provides a vehicle that is critical to the successful licensing of academic research to existing, spin-off or campus companies and in this way encourages products based on the technology to reach the marketplace.  Ireland&rsquo;s tax system has for some time encouraged both the creation and management of intellectual property, by means of our 25% research and development tax credit, patent royalty exemption, and, most recently, our new 2009 IP tax deduction regime, along with making Ireland an attractive environment for foreign direct investment with our 12.5% corporation tax rate.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Effective IPR enforcement is an essential part of protecting the health and safety of individuals, because certain counterfeited products such as medicines, foodstuffs, body care articles and children&rsquo;s items that are produced in an unregulated environment can pose a serious health threat.  It is very important that we recognise the link between intellectual property crime and organised crime.  Organised crime groups use the trade in fake goods to generate profit and to fund other forms of organised crime, such as human trafficking, money laundering, firearms and illegal drugs. The Internet and digital technology have presented criminals with an efficient, high-speed and anonymous way to conduct IP crime across borders and continents.  Although luxury goods have traditionally been targeted for counterfeiting and piracy, today a wider variety of mass consumption goods are affected, for example, foodstuffs, cosmetics, spare parts for cars, toys and various types of technical or electrical equipment.</P>
        <P>Due to the clandestine nature of many counterfeiting and piracy activities it is difficult to accurately assess their scale.  The OECD published a report in November 2009 which confirms that counterfeiting and piracy of tangible goods is a major impediment to global trade and is getting worse.  The report estimates that global trade in counterfeit and pirated goods more than doubled in this decade to approximately US $250 billion in 2007, up from just over $100 billion in 2001.  That figure does not include goods produced and consumed within countries.  The real figure is, therefore, possibly far higher than that estimate.</P>
       <P>The international scale of the problem is also clear at European level.  The European Commission&rsquo;s annual report on EU customs actions shows an upward trend in the number of goods suspected of violating intellectual property rights.  In 2009, over 43,500 cases of such goods were <Col N="676"/>stopped by customs, totalling 118 million articles.  It is clear from even a quick glance at these issues that the nature of IP crime means it must be tackled at national and international levels.  This requires a collaborative approach between state authorities and the private sector.  A number of important initiatives at international level are under way.</P>
        <P>Within the EU there are already a number of legal instruments in place, including the enforcement directive, but in order to make them more effective the European Council adopted a resolution on a comprehensive EU anti-counterfeiting and anti-piracy plan.  This resolution endorsed the need to step up the fight against fake goods.  In 2009, the European Commission launched the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy.  The observatory is composed of members from both the private and public sectors and is intended to raise awareness and share information and best practices in enforcing intellectual property rights.</P>
        <P>I wish to say a few words about the proposed anti-counterfeiting trade agreement, more commonly known as ACTA.  The negotiating parties to this agreement include the EU, the United States and other developed countries, as well as a number of emerging economies.  The basic aim of the ACTA is to establish effective enforcement standards for existing intellectual property rights.  In this regard it should be borne in mind that, from an EU perspective, intellectual property rights account for a large proportion of the EU&rsquo;s GDP and are important to high-growth sectors.  The EU can only remain competitive if it can rely on innovation, creativity, quality and brand exclusivity.  These are some of the EU&rsquo;s main comparative advantages on the world market and intellectual property rights protect them all.  However, the means of adequately enforcing those rights in important export markets to date have been limited.</P>
        <P>The agreement aims to establish a comprehensive, international framework that will assist its members to effectively combat the infringement of IPRs.  It will not create new IP rights, nor will it define their acquisition, duration, scope of protection or registration.  ACTA countries will enforce the rights as they are defined domestically.  It will encompass a range of provisions on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, including civil and criminal measures, customs measures, Internet enforcement measures, as well as robust co-operation mechanisms among ACTA parties to assist in their enforcement efforts.  Following 11 rounds of international negotiations over two and a half years, a substantial level of agreement has been reached and almost all outstanding issues have been resolved.  While some further work needs to be completed, I expect a deal will be finalised in the near future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let me say a few words about enforcement of IP legislation in Ireland.  As Members of the House will be aware, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform is preparing a White Paper on crime.  In this regard a number of discussion documents have been prepared, the most recent of which deals with organised and white collar crime.  The discussion paper contains a section on intellectual property crime and points to the active role played by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue&rsquo;s customs service in ensuring effective enforcement of the legislation.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has adopted a proactive approach in tackling IP enforcement issues with the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, NBCI, which was established as a response to organised crime.  The anti-racketeering unit within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation provides expert guidance and support to divisional and district Garda personnel tasked with investigating the importation and sale of illicit and counterfeit goods, including cigarettes.  The sale of goods at markets is the subject of regular and ongoing monitoring by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for counterfeit goods and products.  Revenue&rsquo;s customs service enforcement has concentrated mainly on the points of importation into the State and has resulted in the seizure of growing quantities and varieties of products. In 2009 there were 1,019 intellectual property rights seizures valued at &euro;2.5 million, in addition to the seizure of 116 million counterfeit cigarettes.</P><Col N="677"/>
        
        <P>In recent decades, due to the global nature of trade and the advent of Internet trading the need for global IP protection was identified.  The World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, was established in 1967 to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world.  WIPO develops conventions, treaties and other regulations on intellectual property protection through co-operation among member states and in collaboration with other international organisations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most important single source of rule making in IP is now the European Union.  Many of the provisions included in Irish primary and secondary legislation are in transposition of EU directives on intellectual property into Irish law.  The Commission&rsquo;s work over the years in harmonising and co-ordinating national approaches in the IP field has had a powerful effect in creating and securing the benefits for all member states in the Internal Market.  New issues and proposals continue to surface. Several significant Commission proposals are under active negotiation. One of these is the proposed EU patent.  Unfortunately the current European patent system, which is administered by the European Patents Office, is expensive and complex, particularly its translation requirements.  After grant, the applicant must validate the patent in each country designated in which protection is required.  This can be very laborious and expensive.  It can also lead to legal uncertainty because if a patent is infringed, the patent holder must initiate legal proceedings in each individual country, with often different legal outcomes.  Today, obtaining a patent in Europe costs ten times more than securing one in the US.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">In April 2007 the European Commission put forward a communication to the Council entitled Enhancing the Patent System in Europe.  The Commission set out to get agreement on creating a simple, cost-effective and high quality one-stop-shop patent system in Europe, both for examination and grant as well as post-grant procedures, including litigation.  Negotiations on a future European Union patent are at an advanced stage.  The proposed EU patent would provide protection covering all EU member states and substantially reduce costs to<?oasys _jy ?>industry.  Ireland has long-supported the proposed European Union patent as a way of encouraging competitiveness, innovation and reducing costs especially for small and medium-sized firms.</P>
        <P>Another important area in the protection of intellectual property is that of copyright.  The principal European directive in the area of copyright, the Copyright in the Information Society Directive 2001, essentially harmonised the right of reproduction, the right of communication to the public, the right of making available to the public and the distribution right.  The basic principle underlying the harmonisation effort was to provide the rightsholders with a high level of protection and, accordingly, the scope of exclusive rights was very broadly defined at that time.</P>
        <P>In its 2009 Green Paper on copyright, entitled Copyright in the Knowledge Economy, the European Commission pointed out that copyright laws have traditionally attempted to strike a balance between ensuring a reward for past creation and investment and the future dissemination of knowledge products by introducing a list of exceptions and limitations to allow for certain, specific activities which are usually regarded as desirable in the public interest.  These generally pertain to areas such as academic and scientific research, the activities of libraries and archives and the rights of disabled people.</P>
        <P>The Commission considered that the main conclusion from the debate was that copyright policy must be geared toward meeting the challenges of the Internet-based knowledge economy.  It prioritised access to information products for people with disabilities, licensing solutions for mass-scale digitisation in a European context, and an impact assessment on how to foster the clearance issues that arise in the case of orphan works.</P><Col N="678"/>
        <P Just="Left">The most recent European economic initiative, the Single Market Act, which is designed to achieve a competitive social market economy, underlines that the absence of a European framework for the efficient management of copyright across the European Union is significantly complicating the process of making knowledge and cultural goods available online.  In order to create a single European digital market, the potential of online distribution must be used effectively by enhancing the availability of creative content while at the same time ensuring that right-holders obtain adequate remuneration and protection for their works. Accordingly, the Commission has signalled that it will now be submitting a proposal for a framework directive on the management of copyright, with the aim of opening up access to online content by improving the governance, transparency and electronic management of copyright.  It will also, next year, be proposing a directive on the issue of orphan works.</P>
        
        <P>At the same time, there are those who advocate a more American-type approach to the issue of copyright on this side of the Atlantic.  These advocates feel that a broader approach should be adopted in relation to exceptions and exemptions from copyright.  They argue that digital innovators in the United States have benefited from the more flexible regime there of exceptions to copyright rules under the broad heading of &ldquo;fair use&rdquo;.  They contrast this with what they categorise as Europe&rsquo;s catalogue of precisely defined exceptions which, they feel, are too inflexible to accommodate technological, business and societal developments.  They consider that this prescriptive approach appears increasingly maladapted to the digital economy and that it deprives EU-based innovators of the flexibility that has stimulated the growth of high-technology businesses in the US.  This idea, which is being strongly propounded by the information and communications technology sector in Ireland, will also have to be taken into account and examined carefully in the context of any changes being contemplated in the area of copyright legislation in future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Leas-Chathaoirligh for providing me with this opportunity to address the Seanad on such an important topic.  In outlining the importance of intellectual property to business and to innovation I hope I have reassured the Seanad that the Government and I as the responsible Minister of State recognise that protection of intellectual property is a key factor in developing the smart economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Protection of intellectual property is high on the priority list in the European Union also, and that is why there are so many initiatives under discussion in regard to intellectual property protection and the fight against counterfeiting and piracy.  The Government is committed to fostering an environment that will continue to help Irish-based industry to reap the benefits of investment, research, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship which are the building blocks of the smart economy plan and will pave the way to renewed growth in the economy and a way out of this dreadful recession.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
        <P>Intellectual property issues are getting more and more attention these days.  Unfortunately, far too often the issues are framed in such a way as to highlight controversy and polarise debate.  In fact, there is much about intellectual property protection on which everyone can agree.</P>
        <P>To arrive at a fuller understanding of the issue, it is worth spending some time considering how intellectual property rights developed and what role they play in achieving widely shared objectives.  What comes out of such an examination is the conclusion that intellectual property protection is a vital part of social, cultural and economic development.  Protection of intellectual property rights alone will not necessarily bring about this development.  However, it is hard to imagine that a country could ever reach these goals in the absence of such protection.</P><Col N="679"/>
        <P Just="Left">The essential idea behind copyright is simple.  Artists and creators should be able to enjoy the fruits of their labour for a specified time, after which the material becomes available for public use.  Society benefits because this incentive to create will yield a rich and varied cultural menu for its citizens.  Indeed, one can say that copyright protection is a necessary ingredient for ensuring cultural wealth in our societies.  If copyright protection is important for reaching cultural objectives, then it is equally true that the theft of these copyrighted goods, that is, the pirating of cultural works, is a threat to the creative sectors in our societies.  While there has been much press reportage recently regarding online downloading of music and movies in developed countries, in fact it is in the developing world that much of the serious damage is being done.  Many new musical voices, new authors and new stories on film around the world have never been made available, simply because the incentives were not there for these artists to take a risk.  They believed that whatever they produced would immediately be pirated &mdash; stolen &mdash; and they would not be provided the means to develop their talents.</P>
        <P>This is not an abstract argument.  It has happened on all continents.  A good example is Hong Kong, where a thriving movie industry was so hurt by rampant piracy that, just a few years ago, observers were predicting it would disappear from the film making map.  Today, the industry there is in better shape and moviegoers around the world enjoy new and exciting releases primarily because the Hong Kong authorities took decisive action to combat the piracy problem in their jurisdiction.  Studios in the movie industry in Bangladesh went on strike in March 2004 to protest against the problem of piracy and to demand action by government.  Similar developments have taken place in the world of music.  Ethiopian musicians went on a seven-month strike in 2003 to press for better anti-piracy measures from government.  These artists all understood the importance of protecting their works from piracy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has earned a reputation internationally as an island of creativity that has produced some of the world&rsquo;s finest music and literature.  For a small island of 4 million people we are unique in having groups like the Chieftains, U2, the Corrs, the Cranberries and more recently the Script dominating the world stage.  Consequently, we need to ensure the intellectual property rights of these and all our artists and innovators are protected by law.  The recent High Court decision on the UPC case to which the Minister of State referred can only lead us to conclude that there is no such legal protection.  This is very damaging for the international reputation of Ireland as a jurisdiction with appropriate legal protection for all kinds of intellectual property and copyright generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his judgment, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton ruled that Irish law does not require Internet service providers to identify and disconnect illegal file sharers but cautioned that the lack of such provisions in Irish law technically means Ireland is not in compliance with European law and that considering its place within the European Union, the Government must, therefore, address the issue.  Mr. Justice Charleton also condemned illegal file sharing.  His judgment states that it &ldquo;not only undermines business but ruins the ability of a generation of creative people in Ireland and elsewhere to establish a viable living&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it is destructive of an important native industry&rdquo;.  From the wording of Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s judgment, it is obvious he was most anxious to provide the kind of protection our artists need but that legally he had no basis for so doing.  The Government must now, as a matter of urgency, do its job properly and implement the required EU legislation without further delay.  Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s judgment could not be any clearer on where responsibility lies.</P>
        <P>With ever increasing broadband speeds, it will soon be possible to download a movie or a very complex computer game in a matter of seconds.  Without the proper legislative protection in place, Irish businesses in these sectors will go to the wall.  I believe the recent demise of the Chartbusters video rental chain, with a loss of almost 90 jobs, can be partly attributed to illegal <Col N="680"/>downloading of movies.  Xtra-Vision, our other major video chain, which employs 1,600 people, must also be under threat from this source.</P>
        <P>Ireland is rapidly becoming a world leader in computer gaming.  The computer games industry is an exciting field, currently outselling the film industry worldwide.  Recent research shows that computer gaming is rapidly broadening its demographic user base.  Industry statistics show that the average age of those who play video games is not 14 years but 34 years.  Last year, a quarter of all those who played video games were over 50 years of age.  The same figures show that two thirds of all households have a video game console or device and half of all parents now play video games with their children at least once a week.</P>
        <P>Ireland is rapidly establishing itself as a world leader in computer gaming.  We have created companies like Havok, which had its genesis just yards from here in Trinity College and which is now one such world leader in this field.  Since 2007, Havok-powered console and PC games generated combined sales revenue totalling more than $4.2 billion in the US market alone.  Computer game development is innovative and exciting from a technological and creative perspective, providing career opportunities for imaginative, logical and energetic people.  To nurture such development in Ireland we need strong legislation to protect the intellectual property rights of gaming developers and their businesses.</P>
        <P>This challenge we face is not some nebulous high-minded debate on the ethics or otherwise of illegal downloading, rather it is about protecting real Irish jobs and providing for the creation of many thousands of new jobs.  I am informed that such protection does not require a whole new raft of legislation and that a statutory instrument would suffice to give such protection.  Let us have that protection and let us have it now.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  This industry is facing a serious challenge.  Senator Cannon has covered much of what I was going to say in terms of outlining to the House the serious challenges facing the industry, the importance of the industry and the huge role it can play in recovery of the economy.</P>
        <P>The High Court ruling on the UPC case was given three weeks ago.  I am aware the advice of the Attorney General has been sought on the ruling.  Three weeks is a long time when an industry&rsquo;s back is to the wall, with approximately 60% of its turnover achieved in the five to six weeks prior to Christmas, which is a crucial time in the calendar year for this industry.</P>
        <P>This industry has been tremendous for the economy.  It has been possibly the best ambassador worldwide for Ireland plc.  In terms of the success worldwide of our artists, including Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, U2, Enya and others, we have punched way our above our weight despite having a population of only 4.5 million people.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, is supportive of this industry.  He has a track record in an industry not unrelated to the music industry.  I must declare at this stage that I have a vested interest in the industry, having been involved in it since 1963.  It has been an incredible industry for anyone with talent, for innovators and for creators.  One does not have to be a rich man&rsquo;s son or daughter to become a success in this industry, which is the beauty of it.  The person with ability and creativity is rewarded.  I have personal experience of this industry.</P>
        <P>I am baffled that obtaining the advice of the Attorney General on a ruling can take three weeks.  This is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.  I propose that we adjourn this debate until such time as the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice has been received, thus allowing the Minister of State and his Department an opportunity to deal with the serious crisis facing this industry.  For the innovator, creator or songwriter, for the person who records the artist or the material or for the person who invests heavily in having artists recorded and in the distribution of records and television advertising in this regard to be told by Government that they will not <Col N="681"/>receive any money for downloads is the greatest insult of all.  Ireland is proud of its achievements to date.</P>
        <P>Every January since 1977 I have attended the world music publishers conference in Cannes.  On one occasion an Irish Minister also attended.  Enterprise Ireland and its predecessor have always looked after us and provided us with a stand at the conference where the world of entertainment and music come together.  In four days, we planned and met representatives of all the other countries that attended, in particular the English speaking countries.  The conference provides people with small budgets an opportunity to conduct business and discuss their intellectual property rights with the biggest people in the business, be they from Los Angeles, Tokyo and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Intellectual property rights, with energy saving initiatives, are, as I said on the Order of Business, the future of the economy.  This industry has the potential to make billions of euro for the economy every year.  The industry, which has been a major contributor to the economy for the past 50 years, has asked for our assistance.  It has been an incredible contributor in terms of what it has done in the world of film.  The film industry has been a great ambassador for the country but to think that a film could be invested in and made here in Ireland and then not receive any royalties is a disgrace.  That must be viewed by Departmental officials, the Minister of State and the Government as an urgent case to be dealt with and not something to be left for three weeks while waiting to get an opinion.</P>
        <P>The judge highlighted the deficiencies, and Senator Cannon covered that point as well.  He said the deficiency in Irish law resulted in Ireland currently having no mechanism to disconnect Internet users who engage in illegal downloads and commented that this results in Ireland breaching its obligations under European Union legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We were always proud of the massive contribution made by our senior officials in Departments who give assistance to our Ministers and Ministers of State and a backup facility.  The senior officials in this Department must give the Minister of State a backup facility and get this decision from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office immediately, in the next 48 hours if possible, because as the judgment states, we are breaching our obligations under European Union legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The multinational companies which took this case to the High Court must be backed totally because the difficulty for those Irish companies operating in the area is that, ultimately, they must justify the investment by those multinationals being based in Ireland.  I am unashamedly making the case for them on what they have achieved over the years for the industry in general and for Irish artists who are not being protected in any way, as was stated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Article 8(3) of the copyright directive and Article 12(3) of the electronic commerce directive provide that injunctions should be available against Internet service providers, forcing them to terminate illegality on their networks regardless of whether they are responsible for it.  Those two articles say it all.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call on the Minister to make us here in Ireland compliant.  We have a proud industry and are a proud people.  We have had huge success and the least we can do is put the law in a European context with our partners in the United Kingdom, the French or any of our other colleagues in Europe.  There are many other issues I could outline to the Minister of State and on which I could ask for his assistance because by coming to the House in person, he has shown that he wants to help the industry, for which I thank him.</P>
        <P>The solutions to the problem of Internet copyright piracy are available.  It is not surprising the legislative response laid down in the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 came at a time when the problem was not perceived to be threatening to creativity and the retail economy as it has become in 2010.  Technology is changing so quickly it is mind-boggling.  What would <Col N="682"/>be covered in law in the month of November possibly might not be covered in law in the month of December.  This is a challenging Department for any official to have to work in and keep pace with the changes in technology.  It is a new challenge but it is also a new opportunity to get revenue into the country where people can pay their taxes and have money to pay for this service.  There is no point in our becoming the wild west of Europe and not being protected because we will not get any investment.  No multinational or film company or indeed no one else will come here and spend their money.</P>
        <P>I plead for an industry that seeks two simple amendments made to the legislation and I hope the Attorney General&rsquo;s office will give the officials and the Minister the support this issue deserves.  I look forward to the Minister and the officials coming back to the House in the not too distant future when we can confirm that will be the case.</P>

	<P>I am contemplating that because serious frustration has crept in on this issue.  Senator Cannon, Senator Dearey, who has a great deal of knowledge in the industry, and I have outlined that.  Senator Norris is in the Chamber as well.  I am at a crossroads in terms of what is the right thing to do.  There is never a wrong time to do the right thing.  If the Minister of State is confident he will have a response from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office within the next week or so, we can conclude the debate today.  If he is not, we will adjourn it and resume it another day.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cassidy&rsquo;s speech was the most impassioned I have heard him make in the Seanad for some time.  It made me wonder if I was on the right side of the House because I do not always agree with him.</P>
        <P>I have been approached by various interests in this area and I believe there is a balance of rights to be achieved because there is an entire generation of young people who believe, rightly or wrongly, with or without legal support, they have developed an entitlement to free downloading.  That is embedded in our culture.  There will be a public relations difficulty in selling whatever agreement is reached and one must be aware of the interests of young people.  That is what I would say is the establishment of apparent rights on the ground.  The facts are stark.  The majority of young people &mdash; 675,000 in the space of a year &mdash; are engaged in this practice.  That is an enormous number of people and therefore this matter must be addressed without alienating an entire section of our community.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, the arguments that have been made here are very good.  I have been told by a person directly involved in this area that, for example, U2&rsquo;s first album bombed and without the support of the record industry they would not be in the position they are in now.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If that first record had been downloaded and deleted, the commercial interests might have said they were no longer interested in it and washed their hands of it.  There are a number of such situations.</P>
        <P>A number of artists make their work available freely through the Internet.  George Michael made a clear statement on that, as I believe did Sin&eacute;ad O&rsquo;Connor.  Our business is to function as a Legislature.  We are charged with putting laws in place and in doing that, we often get the advice of the courts.  In this case a series of legal circumstances have emerged on which a clear series of judgments have been given, in particular in the judgment of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton to which I will refer from time to time in my contribution.</P><Col N="683"/>
        <P Just="Left">I am grateful to the Minister of State for giving me a copy of his additional remarks.  They are somewhat more expansive than is suggested but they are interesting because they relate to the section of his speech that addressed the issue which prompted Senator Cassidy and others to place this matter on the Order which afforded Members this opportunity to engage in statements.  I was a little surprised, therefore, that the issues is only dealt with in this short introductory section of the speech.  The problem is that although the Minister of State said the European directive has been transposed into Irish law and gave the regulations under which it was transposed, he indicated that where an Internet service provider establishes that it is a mere conduit or carrier of information, it is not liable.  Regulation 17 similarly covers caching or temporary storage.  Regulation 18 deals similarly with hosting or permanent storage.  That is precisely the difficulty Mr. Justice Charleton addressed.  The Minister of State went on to say: &ldquo;However, these regulations do not affect the power of any court to make an order against an ISP [Internet service provider] requiring that [the provider] not infringe or cease infringing any legal right.&rdquo;  However, there is nothing about the responsibility of the provider in circumstances in which the entity is clearly and knowingly facilitating what Mr. Justice Charleton described in his judgment as theft and piracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
        
        <P>What has been recommended is the graduated response process.  There is a history of negotiation between the music industry and its representatives and the Internet service providers which I will go into.  This process is also in operation in France and has been agreed in the Digital Economy Act in the United Kingdom.  Finland and New Zealand have already agreed to pursue this route, while Korea has had a graduated response system in operation for some considerable time.  The reason I say we must have some response &mdash; we cannot leave a lacuna &mdash; is that Mr. Justice Charleton identified the problem and indicated in a written judgment that Irish law was deficient.  He has indicated that a solution lies in the graduated response approach to which I have referred.  However, he is not in a position to enforce this or give injunctive relief because the European directive was, apparently, inefficiently and inadequately transposed into Irish law.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Precisely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish law could be brought into alignment with the intention of the European directive through a simple statutory instrument.  As long as Irish law is deficient, Mr. Justice Charleton has found that all creative Irish industries are losing money.  As things stand, there is a black hole which may lead to yet another situation where taxpayers, although they are not implicated, will be left to pick up the bill.  I do not think the general public wish it to be the case that because of a legislative deficiency, the music companies will be able to take legal action which will land the taxpayer with the bill.  That would be worrying for everybody, particularly in these difficult economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Charleton stated: &ldquo;Legislative intervention is required, if the Oireachtas sees fit, to protect constitutional rights to copyright and foster the national resource of creativity.&rdquo;  One of the problems is with the wording of the regulations to which the Minister referred which do not use the words that appear to be required; that is, they do not make provision for &ldquo;blocking, diverting and interrupting internet copyright theft&rdquo;.  Because of these three words, we are technically in breach of the European directive.</P>
        <P>This comes about because of developments in the technology of recorded music performance and access to it by the public.  In particular, there are many new developments that are a little beyond me such as peer-to-peer sharing through iPods.  As a person of my generation, I cannot understand why anyone would want several thousand tunes, but then I am not a kind of cultural glutton.  If I visit the Louvre, for example, I make sure I do not overindulge and give myself <Col N="684"/>aesthetic indigestion.  I head for those one or two rooms in which I can enjoy in a profound way the works of art exhibited.  However, I see tourists going through and they visit every room in the place.  I do not know how their brains do not explode.  They must be insensitive to the arts, but it is very good for tourism.</P>
        <P>On a similar basis, I am glad I am not of the iPod generation because I would never willingly sacrifice the thrill and delight of the hunt enjoyed by anyone who is a specialist in musical collections.  I was exhilarated for a week when I found an ancient record by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in Fenning&rsquo;s record shop on the quays.  I used to scour the shops and go through all the boxes.  I remember the joy of finding something and the immense joy of listening to my treasure trove when I got home.  If one can simply push a button and get 1,500 tunes straightaway from one&rsquo;s neighbour, much of the joy is gone.  However, we cannot hold back technological advances.</P>
        <P>I understand young people believe they are entitled to obtain music and this issue must be dealt with.  However, the facts were established in the judgment of Mr. Justice Charleton in which he stated: &ldquo;Between 2005 and 2009 the recording companies experienced a reduction of 40% in the Irish market for the legal sale of recorded music.&rdquo;  That is a devastating blow.  I do not know how many industries could tolerate a sudden and spectacular decline of 40% in their market.  He went on to state: &ldquo;Some 675,000 people are likely to be engaged in some form of illegal downloading from time to time.&rdquo;  Does that mean we have 675,000 criminals?  I do not think so, although we have 675,000 people who are infringing copyright law.  The judgment continued that &euro;20 million in sales was being lost annually.  That is a big hole in the budget of the music industry.  In a stringent comment, the judge stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am satisfied that the business of the recording companies is being devastated by internet piracy.  This not only undermines their business but ruins the ability of a generation of creative people in Ireland, and elsewhere, to establish a viable living.  It is destructive of an important native industry.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The reason I contacted people involved in the industry and spoke to Senator Cassidy was that I was particularly concerned by an editorial in support of the music industry&rsquo;s position by Niall Stokes in <i>Hot Press</i>, a magazine read by many young people.  It was an example of courage to address this situation so openly because I doubt his opinion was all that popular with his readers.  This is someone who is passionately concerned about the music industry and not, I think, linked with its profits.  I know there is not much sympathy for larger players in the music industry; for instance, people say, &ldquo;To hell with U2 &mdash; they make millions and use their tax haven in Amsterdam.&rdquo;  However, when Niall Stokes speaks, he must be listened to.</P>
        <P>The court judgment stated the purpose of the directive was &ldquo;to ensure that injunctive relief should be available in national law despite an exemption applying.&rdquo;  It went on to state: &ldquo;In failing to provide legislative provision for blocking, diverting and interrupting internet copyright theft, Ireland is not yet fully in compliance with its obligations under European law&rdquo; and, because of this, &ldquo;the Court cannot move to provide injunctive relief.&rdquo;  What was the effect of this?  There is an irony because, I am told, the effect of the publicity surrounding this judgment was to multiply theft.  There has been an increase of more than 30% in such downloads because the public were given the impression that it was perfectly legal.  Some 60% of Irish Internet suppliers are either actively supporting or prepared to support the music industry.  That leaves 40% which are not.</P>
        <P>Discussions have been ongoing and they can be considered in chronological form.  The Irish Recorded Music Association, IRMA, wrote to all Internet providers to try to bring them on board by asking them to a meeting, but it found it was impossible to find a date that suited <Col N="685"/>everybody and they could not agree on an agenda; therefore, although they did not actually refuse, they did not come along.  They had their own interests.  There was a case in Belgium which involved new technology from a firm called Audible Magic to filter illegal material from a network.  Based on what had happened up to then &mdash; the discussions with the Internet providers, plus this new technology &mdash; IRMA brought Eircom to court.  The case was heard in January 2009, but a settlement was reached, under which it was agreed that IRMA would find evidence of peer infringement and provide it for Eircom which would engage in the graduated response process.  IRMA agreed with Eircom that it would negotiate with other service providers to persuade them to operate the same system and various documentation was exchanged.</P>
        <P>As IRMA was unsuccessful in persuading either BT Ireland or UPC to co-operate, there was another case.  However, before it got to court, the Data Protection Commissioner intervened and there was a suggestion there could be an infringement of legislative provisions concerning privacy, access to data and so forth.  That led to another court case in which the judgment, on 16 April 2009, was again given by Judge Charleton who appears to be an expert in this area.  It confirmed that none of the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s concerns was valid and that the graduated response by Eircom and IRMA complied with data protection legislation.  The way was and is clear.  There are sensitivities because young people believe they have a right or entitlement and this must be confronted.  The fact that there were 675,000 indicates a strong market and the music industry, like the newspapers, will have to develop innovative ways to collect revenue on the Internet.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to European patents, a matter that must be dealt with.  European patent seekers are obliged to pay ten times the cost of seeking a patent in the United States because of bureaucracy, translations, having to apply in multiple courts and so forth.  That is nonsense.  I have been aware of this issue for some time because I visited the Irish community in Munich, including people working with the European Union, about two years ago.  There were a number of very talented Irish people among them who were qualified in copyright law and they were pushing within Europe to have the situation cleared up.  We must do this.</P>
        <P>The Minister raised the question of fair usage, a very grey area in which I got involved with the Joyce estate.  I took the advice of the most prominent lawyer in Ireland on copyright and we were able to find our way around it.  However, at the time the Government was not always on the ball where these matters were concerned, particularly with regard to literature.  I signalled to it some years ago, when the Joyce estate issue was coming down the line, that we would need to look for a derogation, in the way other countries had done.  We were moving from protection of copyright for 50 years to 75 years and the Joyce estate which is extremely voracious and threatening in this area moved in and inhibited creative artists from reinterpreting Joyce and scholars from quoting from Joyce&rsquo;s books in a spirit that defied Joyce&rsquo;s stated views in the matter.  The estate got away with it simply because we did not create the exemption as we could have done.  This is an increasingly technical matter.  There will be developments all the time, particularly electronically, and we must be prepared for them.</P>
        <P>I will be interested to read the Minister&rsquo;s response; unfortunately, I cannot stay to hear it.  It is a balancing act.  This is the Legislature and we are charged with implementing the law.  It is clear that there is a defect in it which has been drawn to our attention by the courts and it is our responsibility to ensure this deficiency is remedied.  At the same time, we must be conscious of the fact that an entire generation has become accustomed to this and the music industry must be flexible and generous.  It must keep its customers with it or, at least, try to transform the freeloaders &mdash; we all like to freeload if we can &mdash; into customers.  They should not be denied access to the music they love, but, at the same time, we must ensure the creative artists and the industry get their just and proportionate reward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I regularly look back through my record collection.  The labels include Two Tone, Terri Hooley&rsquo;s Good Vibrations in Belfast, Stiff Records and Mulligan Records.  I revelled in buying albums that did not come from EMI, Warner Music or any of the big labels.  There was a real antipathy at the time towards the industry and the punk movement was probably a way of showing two fingers to the music establishment.  That is my recollection of my music collection when I was growing up.  My worst indulgence was buying really dodgy reproductions on O&rsquo;Connell Bridge.  In fact, the first time I heard a Van Morrison track &mdash; I could barely hear it &mdash; was from a tape I bought there.  However, it led me to buy almost everything Van Morrison ever did through legal means.</P>
        <P>There was always a cat and mouse game within the music industry in terms of how one could get the original recording cheaply or for nothing.  Historically, there were always attempts to be independent in making, recording and distributing music.  Some of the best and most exciting and enduring music I heard came from labels that have long since been bought out or gone to the great rock and roll gig in the sky.  However, there was a basic belief copyright was important and a sense that when one was not buying a copyrighted piece of material, one was at least in the twilight zone and, if one was honest, one would acknowledge that one was doing something wrong which was damaging to the person who had produced the music.</P>
        <P>One of my albums is &ldquo;Ghostown&rdquo; by the Radiators from Space.  It is a fantastic, classic Irish album.  It is about dismal Dublin in 1980 and 1981 when the recession had really taken hold in the country.  What is striking about current times is the desperate ongoing search which I believe will bear fruit for ways out of the recession.  What did we do in the early 1980s?  It was about adding value to our food production, financial services and finding new ways in which Ireland could trade with the world and add value to its land resources.  We were very clever in some of what we did.  Everything did not work, but much of it did.  Eventually, once we had the public finances in order somewhat later, we traded our way out of it and this became a modern economy, rather than an agrarian one that was under-selling itself in terms of what it produced.</P>
        <P>Something similar is happening now.  It is about finding the new areas in which we will trade successfully.  It is an ongoing process.  It is hard to say when the new digital economy began to work for Ireland.  I cannot think of the seminal moment but perhaps somebody else can.  However, unless we get our intellectual property protection system right, the perception will grow that Ireland is not a safe place in which to develop intellectual property such as games, software, music, film and so forth.  There is a serious lacuna in our law which would allow, for example, an employee to walk out of his or her office and share a file that could travel around the world almost instantly, given the speed of modern communications.  Removal is simply not a sufficiently fast response to such an action.  There is an urgency in regard to the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice which we have all identified; Senator Cassidy did so in a particularly passionate way.  There is an immediate need to address this gap.  The judgment of Justice Charleton identifies the serious inadequacies in copyright law.</P>
        <P>I spoke about the uneasy relationship between copyright and those who sought to avoid it.  However, there has been a huge shift because it is now the cultural norm not to buy but to share or download material for free.  The response of the record industry has at times been ham-fisted but at other times very clever.  I have in mind the group Radiohead which offered an album online and one could pay what one wished for it.  It worked for Radiohead, but it does not work for most of the smaller bands and artists who are trying to sell intellectual property on the Internet.  I should declare an interest in this regard as I work with many young bands.  They are free downloaders and file sharers until it comes to releasing their own album when they become extremely careful to ensure the copyright is writ large on the compact disc sleeve.</P><Col N="687"/>
      
        <P>They understand they have ownership rights and a right to remuneration for the product which they have gone to trouble and expense to produce and into which they have put their creative energy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">There is a significant cultural challenge and ambivalence around this area and in that context, any kind of legal signal can be either damaging or helpful.  That is the reason that the weekend after the IRMA-UPC decision was given, the message went out that it was okay to download and that it was legal.  I understand there was a significant spike in download traffic the following weekend when the industry did its measurement.  Apparently, the industry takes its measurements when young people are most likely to be downloading, generally between particular hours at weekends, in order that it has an accurate measurement of traffic.  The signal given out by that decision, although inaccurate and at odds with the substance of what Mr. Justice Charleton said, was that it was okay to download and people responded accordingly.</P>
        <P>The situation needs to change.  As Senator Cassidy said, the advice of the Attorney General is urgently needed and it should be rapidly followed by a statutory instrument that will give the State some way of addressing and tackling the issue.  It is unfortunate that we are now coming into the period of the year when sales are most likely to spike.  This will be followed by a barren period.  Even at this stage, a message from the Attorney General would be helpful and would provide a clear message that this downloading is illegal and that artists have a right to remuneration for what they produce.</P>
        <P>Much of what has been said here summarises my thoughts on this matter.  However, I stress again the urgency of the situation and the need for the industry to play its part, although it should not use mechanisms it might acquire to deal with the issue in a heavy-handed way.  By and large, the 675,000 people who engage in downloading illegally see it as a normal behaviour.  That needs to be challenged and stopped, but not through enforcement in each individual case but through the Internet service provider being compelled, on foot of an injunction, to block or divert attempts to download.  This would be a more suitable response to the illegal trafficking of files.</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister of State that time is of the essence.  The message must be made clear and the cultural challenge is of particular significance in that regard.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I was briefed yesterday by people from the industry ahead of this debate and I found much merit in what they had to say and have sympathy for them and the situation in which they find themselves.  When preparing my contribution I thought I might reflect their position, but having listened to what has been said by previous contributors, it seems that argument has been well made.  I propose to read into the record an e-mail I received from a young constituent.  I would like to ensure that view is on the record for the purpose of this debate.  The industry may not thank me for this, but I read it so as to contribute an alternative view:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Senator Ryan,</P>
        <P LI="1">I am writing to you about tomorrow&rsquo;s debate on the protection of intellectual property.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It is my experience that debate about the development of intellectual property protections is dominated by a particular way of framing the issue, which is encouraged by powerful lobby groups in the intellectual property industries.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0" Just="Left">For instance, the statements by Minister Ryan following the recent EMI<i>v.</i>UPC High Court case do not suggest to me that Minister Ryan has available to him anything but industry PR and lobbyists to inform his approach to the phenomenon of online copyright infringement.</P><Col N="688"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The arguments that such groups have are by no means meritless, but as a young, informed, regular user of the internet, I am struck by the disparity between the consensus among my representatives in the Oireachtas and the industrial sector, and the consensus among my online peers.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Charleton J&rsquo;s ruling on the UPC case indicates unswerving moral support for EMI, and merely fails to find adequate precedent to rule in EMI&rsquo;s favour.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">But there is a growing, but politically underrepresented movement which has quite a different take on the development of intellectual property protections.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">This movement overwhelmingly falls within the 18-30 bracket, but also includes internationally renowned academics like legal professor Lawrence Lessig, so it is not without legitimate and respectable representation.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There are substantial worries that increasingly more stringent protection measures for intellectual property, in national legislation, court decisions, and in international trade agreements that are binding on Ireland, will infringe other important rights that citizens ought to have, such as the right to privacy in communication and the right to fair use in free speech.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There are also worries based on sound evidence that intellectual property protectionism is actually harming the creative efforts of a younger generation of artists and musicians.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Meanwhile, Justice Charleton appears convinced that online copyright infringement &ldquo;not only undermines [UPC&rsquo;s] business but ruins the ability of a generation of creative people in Ireland, and elsewhere, to establish a viable living.  It is destructive of an important native industry.&rdquo;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There is a wealth of data, for those who care to look, which roundly disproves this common falsehood.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I maintain that the prevalence of this falsehood is testament to the success of industry lobbying.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The debate in traditional media on these issues is all too often conservative to the point of ignoring the problem entirely.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Newspapers and officials too often continue to allow the debate to be framed by interested parties in words like &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;theft.&rdquo;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">These words are not legally correct characterizations of, for instance, copyright infringement, but they carry undue moral force, which then seems to recommend closing the debate.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The term &lsquo;intellectual property&rsquo; is misleading in itself, since it encompasses three diverse and dissimilar bodies of law, which are justified differently and which function differently.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Meanwhile a sophisticated and far more advanced approach to the issue has developed online, which is largely opaque to those whose source of information remains the established and local media.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I contend that the legal orthodoxy on the matter, especially under consideration of the history and justification for intellectual property law, will commend a more open approach, a more critical and inquisitive approach, to the debate &mdash; one which will cut through the demonstrably false and mendacious claims of, for instance, the copyright industry, about its alleged losses to online copyright infringement.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It is imperative that people such as yourself and your colleagues in the Seanad and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann do not blindly trust the received opinion on online copyright infringement.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The topic is far too sophisticated for me to represent it to you here in full.</P><Col N="689"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I am also unsure the extent to which the debate in the Senate will touch on these issues, or give them a fair hearing.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I am writing to you so as to ensure that you are aware of a substantial but unheard constituency of dissent for the received opinion that more stringent protectionism here is a &ldquo;good thing.&rdquo;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I would ask that, under this advisement, you would suggest during the debate that this is an issue with a great deal more sides to it than are presented to the common public, and on which the Oireachtas ought not to make decisions without canvassing the full informed spectrum of opinion on it.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It does so, I claim, at the risk of adding to a set of unjust laws which will only have to be dismantled by future generations, when the material and cultural cost of them becomes clear.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The reason I read this e-mail is that it offers an alternative view which should be heard, taken into account and appraised as to its merits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate, which relates to an interesting problem that requires immediate action on the part of the Government.  When we enacted the Copyright Act in 2001, we did not foresee the spiralling or viralling of downloading that has been going on or the splurge in Internet activity that has become a way of life for so many people.  This debate needs to be stripped down to how illegal downloading affects artists.</P>
        <P>Ireland has always been home to creativity.  We have always nurtured and respected our artists and, in turn, they feel very much part of our community.  From Ireland&rsquo;s Golden Age to now, we have always been a creative people who have punched above our weight artistically.  One only has to recall Bono, Bob Geldof and various other artists.  Ireland has also punched above its weight in science and engineering.  Many people, however, are not aware of intellectual property rights and that illegal downloading is theft.  We need to examine how to protect the creative person at the end of all of this process.  It is easy to get tied up with arguments about large multinational record companies but somewhere, somebody has used their own concept to create an entertainment form, be it a computer game or music, which is essentially their intellectual property.</P>
        <P>Entertainment is of important value to society, particularly in this time of doom and gloom.  Ireland is known as the country of the sing-song and traditional Irish music is internationally renowned.  It is also part of what tourists who visit here love about Ireland.  This element of our culture and what we are as a people must be cultivated as it has kept us going in the past.  Creative artists, therefore, need to have intellectual property protections in place.</P>
        <P>Since 2005, Irish record companies have seen a 40% drop in their sales.  Part of this is due to newer electronic music formats such as downloading from music websites.  For example, one can immediately download a song after it has been performed on the &ldquo;X Factor&rdquo; every Saturday night.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his recent judgment on UPC, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton said he felt UPC&rsquo;s actions were morally wrong but he could not provide the injunctive relief possible.  I am concerned this is a signal to the piracy market that Ireland is the wild west yet again and the full protections to prevent illegal downloading are not in place.  To close this loophole, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton said all that was needed was the transposition of Article 8.3 of the copyright directive and Article 12.3 of the e-commerce directive.  Both provide that injunctions should be available against Internet service providers, ISPs, forcing them to terminate illegality on their networks, whether they are responsible for it.</P><Col N="690"/>
        <P>If this protection had been transposed into Irish law, UPC would have had to examine, and probably follow, the graduated response Eircom put in place.  Are multinational games companies holding back material from Irish ISPs because piracy will subvert their industry and creativity?  Having checked Facebook and Twitter after the judgment, I noted there was much support for UPC&rsquo;s position.  However, UPC financially benefits because the larger the file the UPC-user downloads, say a movie compared to a song, the more expensive the package the user is put on.</P>
        <P>At the last budget the Government committed to making Ireland the world&rsquo;s leading hub in intellectual property rights.  Tax incentives and research and development policies were put in place to support this aim.  After the Charleton judgment, we need to close this gap in our laws and ensure Ireland is at the forefront of intellectual property rights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State has pointed out the new copyright directive will modernise the law when transposed.  For the interim, however, we should examine transposing the existing e-commerce and copyright directives.  The message needs to go out that piracy is not acceptable or legal.</P>
        <P>Many of the young people involved in piracy &ndash; for want of a better word &ndash; do not realise what they are doing is illegal.  The ISPs are also an important cog in the wheel, needed to send out the message illegal downloading is not acceptable.  Eircom&rsquo;s graduated response was reasonable and the other ISPs must follow suit.</P>
        <P>Ireland is seen as a creative country.  Our creativity has got us through past recessions.  We must ensure artists are not ripped off by piracy and their works are protected.  The Oireachtas must ensure no infringement of copyright is allowed.  Arising from the Charleton judgment, legislative intervention is required.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has previously done much work in this area and is very passionate about it.  I look forward to his response on how we can protect the intellectual property of artists on the Internet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Most Members have focused on intellectual property protection and the recent Charleton judgment which affects the music industry.  I want to focus on the role intellectual property rights can play in creating the smart economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The single best document the Government ever produced was the innovation task force report, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &ndash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal.  It contains half a dozen recommendations on intellectual property rights, the role of third and fourth level sectors in the economy and what can be done to deliver better access to them for consistent intellectual property protocols and policies in order that they can better commercialise innovation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Neil Leyden, winner of the Your Country, Your Call competition, made an exceptional proposal for an international digital services centre.  That is all about trying to put infrastructure in place, some of which will include resolving the issue to which the Minister of State is about to refer.  We already have the companies but Ireland should put together the infrastructure and location to become the best in the world at distributing digital content to everybody else.  That detailed proposal was recognised by the President and Dr. McAleese.  It is a brilliant idea and in a future debate I would like to hear the Government&rsquo;s views on how we can support this concept.  It represents a big part of the future of what intellectual property is and how the country can benefit from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate, which is both timely and relevant.  I particularly welcome the praiseworthy comments made by Senator Donohoe about <Col N="691"/>the innovation task force report, which I had the privilege to serve on.  It is a lodestone document for developing Ireland out of recession and into recovery.  It will help us to move up the proverbial value chain and develop high-end solutions, particularly by matching the intellectual creativity of our country with the newly emerging science technologies which are there to be utilised.  Essentially, they reduce the distance between Ireland and the global marketplace.  This is the key turning point concerning our economic recovery.</P>
        <P>Two basic premises underlie the innovation task force document.  One concerns how we can become a global location to entice creative and talented individuals, be they scientists or business people, who wish to commercialise intellectual property.  We should become a location to do precisely that.  Not only will we create some of this valuable intellectual property, but we will also attract people from other countries in Europe and elsewhere who will want to come here, in the same way that Google, Facebook and similar companies have located in Ireland because it is a good place in which to invest.</P>
        <P>I saw that happen last week when I visited Irishtown where Betfair is establishing an office with 100 jobs.  I met the company&rsquo;s chief executive on that occasion and we had a photocall.  Out of curiosity, I asked him why he was coming to Ireland.  He said he is locating here as he reckons Ireland is the best place in the world to establish a content-related, Internet-managed service company.  Betfair handles 5 million transactions per day with 3 million registered customers around the world.  The company has come here because we have skilled people and creative talent to match Betfair&rsquo;s expectation to continue to build and invest in that global business.  It was a source of great pride for me to attend that event and announce the creation of 100 new jobs.  I saw the chief executive&rsquo;s confident attitude to Ireland.  It was a no-brainer for him to bring that business here.</P>
        <P>I take Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s judgment very seriously.  He has described what is occurring with regard to the UPC issue and the court case generally as theft, and he is right.  We should not use ambiguous words here.  Copyright infringement is a form of theft and there is no point in pretending that there is an alternative narrative of democratic rights with regard to the abuse or exploitation of the author or copyright owner&rsquo;s material without permission.  This level of ambiguity is unacceptable, particularly in Ireland where we are seeking to build a smart economy through using our intellectual or human capital.  It is hugely important for us to recognise this.</P>
        <P>Approximately eight years ago, the World Bank published a survey of the source of wealth of many nations.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, unusually, 83% of the country&rsquo;s wealth derived from its human and intellectual capital.  We must take that empirical evidence into the equation when dealing with the vexed issues surrounding copyright theft, including downloading.</P>
        <P>While many Senators&rsquo; contributions focused on the music industry, we must also remember the film industry.  Those are two significant sectors in which Ireland has managed to excel over the years.  As a Government Minister, I found it worrying to hear somebody of the calibre of Paul McGuinness, the manager of U2, come out publicly on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; some weeks ago expressing concern, even before this court decision, about what is happening to the music industry and his artists in particular.  The organisation behind the very successful group U2, is building up other smaller bands for the marketplace.  It is investing heavily in them because it is expensive to bring a garage-type band to the global market.  We must ensure the situation is conducive for such developments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In case anybody thinks the Attorney General or I have been tardy in this matter, I should remind the House that the opposite is the case.  When I was appointed as Minister of State, I was so concerned about what was happening in this sector that I called in the Internet service providers within weeks of taking up this portfolio.  I appealed to them to collaborate and reach <Col N="692"/>an agreement with music and other rightsholders&rsquo; organisations.  The most sensible way for us to proceed is not by having a whole new panoply of legislation and regulation.  The lesson of the last ten years is that we over-regulated a great many of our industrial sectors.  My first instinct therefore is not to regulate or legislate.  I believe that the industries involved, be they Internet service providers, telecommunications companies, the music industry or the film industry, must get together and reach an agreement.</P>
        <P>I was impressed that one of the music rights organisations did come to an agreement with one telecommunications company, namely, Eircom.  I salute the bravery of Eircom&rsquo;s executives for entering into that arrangement.  It started in July and we will have to wait and see how it works out in practice.  This kind of voluntary agreement between the industries involved, and in dispute in this essential area, is far preferable than going down the road of further regulation or legislation.</P>
        <P>We are talking about theft in this regard.  As Senator Ryan rightly said we are also talking about the alternative view of young people who like to download music and do not regard it as theft.  It is theft, however, and there is no point in pretending otherwise.  I accept and applaud Senator Ryan&rsquo;s efforts to put that balancing item into the equation.  We cannot, Canute-like, restrict the onward march of the world wide web.  It is a free medium, although in this regard the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; does not mean not for payment.</P>
        <P>This is one of the great challenges for entrepreneurs and others who wish to use this new, emergent and dynamic technology.  It is a big struggle for some content providers to find a method of making it pay for them and their business.  That in itself is a broader challenge.</P>
        <P>Within weeks of being in my current job, and before this High Court ruling by Mr. Justice Charleton, I invited the Internet service providers and telecommunications companies to my office.  We had a long discussion, although it was not very profitable.  I found it hugely frustrating, annoying and disappointing that when I put down the challenge to them in my Kildare Street office, they were tardy in responding.  Psychologically or otherwise, they were not inclined to move towards the sort of recommendations that the majority of Senators have put forward in this debate.  They seemed to oppose the three-strike, graduated response and all the other formulae.</P>
        <P>To be candid, the problem is that there is no model country in this regard.  There is no paragon of virtue regarding the theft of intellectual property.  France has moved in a prescriptively legislative manner, but there are privacy and confidentiality issues involved.  That is not the role model we should be examining.  On the other hand, in the latter period of Labour rule in the UK, my old friend, Lord Peter Mandelson, introduced legislation, which I understand is being challenged in the British courts.</P>
        <P>I am putting down a challenge again today to all those involved in this business.  The last thing I want to do is provide further legislation and regulation.  If they cannot come to a sensible arrangement however, I will have to legislate and examine the matter in a deeper, more far-seeing way.  I have tried my best to bring people together.  They should get together.  In the meantime, I will meet the Attorney General and discuss in detail the optimum response of the State.  I wish to protect intellectual property.  It is vital the State provides a level of protection to intellectual property and rightsholders which they are entitled to enjoy.</P>
        <P>We stood in Farmleigh and listened to fantastic Irish businessmen from all over the world, including individuals who brought us Riverdance and many of the great global success stories over the past 20 years, including U2, and all were at one about the smart economy.  There is much jargon and nonsense generated about the smart economy.  It is about productivity but in Ireland&rsquo;s case it is about linking and matching our creative talents to emerging technology.  We <Col N="693"/>must maximise the speed to which we can go to market with new products and services online.  It is an exciting opportunity for Ireland.  People remember the bad old days when academics, writers, authors and commentators spoke about Ireland&rsquo;s peripheral nature relative to the European Union.  Cheap airfares and the Internet mean the distance between Ireland and the rest of the world is pretty much irrelevant.  If we are to maximise our position in the emerging world, enabled by technology where distance is reduced, we must protect the rights holder and the creative person who comes up with the new idea.</P>
        <P>I pledge to the House to come up with a solution.  If the industry and the players in the sector are not prepared to reach agreement, we will legislate and regulate even though I set out at the beginning of my contribution that I did not wish to do this.  I addressed this matter early on and I am disappointed by the responses to date.  Some people have been critical of the music organisation that conducted a bilateral arrangement with Eircom.  It is positive because it is the sign of a company taking the issue seriously and agreeing to police and patrol it.  The more of that, the better.  I am the last person to wish to impose more legislative, bureaucratic or administrative burdens on any industry in this country but I promise to return to the House within weeks, once I am appraised of the views of the Attorney General on this matter.</P>
        <P>I prefer not to go into detail on this case because these are sensitive issues.  If I was to disclose the internal thinking on this matter, it might not help in the context of the courts system and the cases that may emerge.  I thank the rightsholders, the ISPs and the people who genuinely engaged with me.  It was a source of great disappointment that we could not get agreement through voluntary efforts from the industries involved.</P>

    <Title>Overcrowding in Prisons: Statements (Resumed)</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  Last week I referred to the current prison population in terms of the rate per 100,000 people on an historic basis and the debt of gratitude we owe to Judge Reilly for his various reports this year on the prison system.  The Government has shown no willingness to reform the prison system.  Overcrowding and the slopping out procedures are totally unacceptable in this day and age.  The only response of the Government to overcrowding is the flawed operation of the temporary release system.  Yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers highlighted that over 200 people sent to jail for non-payment of fines were released at the gates of prisons.  What message does this send about the administration of justice and respect for our laws?  No one should go to jail for non-payment of fines but people should not be able to walk free without being held accountable.  Community service orders can be used but ultimately the moneys due in fines should be paid on an instalment basis from salaries, social welfare or whatever source of income a person has.  If such a system was in operation, we would have a significant decrease in the number of people refusing to pay fines.  They would realise they have to pay the money in the end.</P>
        <P>The revolving door system, which allows prisoners on temporary release and results in over 400 prisoners on the run, shows how dysfunctional is our prison system.  People convicted of attempted murder, assault, harassment, organised crime offences, and weapons and explosives offences are on the run and at large in our community because of the decisions of the Minister.  We are a long way from the zero tolerance policies Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue advocated but failed to implement.  What progress has there been on Michael McDowell&rsquo;s bold assertion that we would have drug-free prisons by now?  What is the situation regarding use of mobile phones in our prisons?</P><Col N="694"/>
        <P>Some years ago my colleague in the Lower House, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, produced an excellent paper on restorative justice to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  One pilot project in Nenagh was very successful.  We were assured restorative justice projects would be extended to other areas of the country.  Has this happened and what is the current position of the Minister on restorative justice?</P>
        <P>The Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention also refers to the many courses undertaken by prisoners that are not accredited.  Why is this happening, who provides the courses and are these people qualified?  Is this just another F&Aacute;S debacle?  These questions must be addressed and answered.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice and Law Reform is presiding over a dysfunctional prison system.  He has little interest in solving the situation.  Words rather than action and perception rather than substance is the order of the day.  Perhaps the Minister of State can tell us how many prisons the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has visited since taking office.  He did not visit Mountjoy Prison during the term of the excellent former governor, Mr. John Lonergan, who was a beacon of light for the Prison Service even though I do not agree with everything he said.  There is much to analyse in the report by Judge Reilly.  I hope many if not all of the recommendations will be acted upon rather than paid lip service, as is usual with these reports.  I hope the questions posed in my contribution will be answered comprehensively by the Minister in his response to this debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this debate even though it is difficult because it is disjointed from the debate last week.  Regarding the point made by Senator Cummins, the Minister made clear that 0.2% of the prison population is in prison as a result of fines.  We must keep a sense of perspective on this matter.  It is a very small number of people.  I agree with Senator Cummins that there should be no one in prison for the non-payment of fines.  However, we need deterrents.</P>
        <P>The success of a prison system depends on two groups, in particular, those who provide the service, namely, the prison officers, and the prisoners themselves.  One presumes prisoners do not want to be incarcerated.  The question, therefore, is whether there is an opportunity for rehabilitation.  When discussing prison policy, it is important to ask that question.  One must decide whether the purpose is to lock people up or to rehabilitate them.  In a more civilised society it must be about rehabilitation also as much as a sanction in terms of a loss of liberty.  What we should focus on is how the experience of prison can affect prisoners in a positive way and improve them in terms of availing of training and education opportunities.  That is the most important aspect of a prison service.</P>
        <P>Being a prison officer must be one of the toughest jobs because one is dealing with people who often have committed violent crimes and the circumstances are difficult.  Prison officers do not receive sufficient recognition for the tough job they do.  It must be a difficult task.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins paid tribute to the previous Governor of Mountjoy Prison.  I wish to comment briefly on the current Governor who is doing an excellent job.  He has only been in place for a short while, but he has made a determined effort to rid the prison of drugs.  Senator Cummins referred to this point also.  It is an appalling indictment of our system that someone who is not a drug addict might come out of prison a drug addict.  I like the way Governor Whelan has made a determined effort not to allow drugs into the prison.  He has taken significant action in that regard.  I was astounded when I heard the cost of a net was &euro;250,000, but one must bear in mind how fine and durable it must be.  It is a good investment.  He is a man who is clearly interested in the welfare of the people for whom he is responsible.</P><Col N="695"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>It is interesting that the issue has not been taken in hand quite so decisively up to now, but Governor Whelan has acted on it.  There was a belief that a certain level of drug use in a prison made it easier to maintain, but that has not proved to be the case.  However, I accept there was disruption in Mountjoy Prison subsequently.  The reports I read indicated that the new regime had meant fights did not break out over ownership of drugs thrown over the wall.  That activity caused a level of violence in itself.  It takes time to adjust to a situation where it is not possible to bring in drugs.  In a way, there was a facility that is no longer available.  This is an enormous step on the road to having drug-free prisons.  I commend the Governor on taking that action.  It shows a fair level of determination on his part to clean up the prison system.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about how many prison places were being established.  Previous Ministers also decided it was time to shut down our Dickensian prison system.  The previous Minister did not receive a great deal of support, particularly from a Member of the House who identified himself as someone who had become involved in public life because he was concerned about prisoner welfare.  That individual stood in the way of progress in terms of the closure of Mountjoy Prison prior to the commencement of work to allow the Thornton Hall project to proceed.  It is ironic that someone would want to keep a prison such as Mountjoy open.</P>
        <P>I have never been in any of the country&rsquo;s prisons.  That is a terrible admission which I intend to rectify.  We have a duty to show that we care about standards in prisons.  I accept there are prison visiting committees, of which public representatives are members.  We have a duty to see the actual conditions in which people who are incarcerated live.  The Minister referred to a changed system, of which Wheatfield Prison is an example.  I intend to go there first.  It is nicer to look at the future of the Irish Prison Service rather than, necessarily, the present.  It is important to see the conditions in a prison such as Mountjoy.  As it is a service that is being provided currently, it is relevant.  I appreciate the amount of work involved and the transfer of interest in the rehabilitation of offenders rather than the focus being purely on incarceration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of overcrowding in prisons has been to the forefront of the media spotlight in recent weeks following the publication and release of 18 separate reports on conditions in Irish prisons, of which 14 had been commissioned by the Department and a further four were carried out by Judge Michael Reilly, Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.  The findings of the vast majority of the reports were highly critical of conditions in the prison system.  I wonder why all of the reports were released simultaneously, in spite of the fact that they had been presented to the Minister on a staggered basis throughout the year, the earliest of which was in April.</P>
        <P>In one of the most recent reports published in October Mountjoy Prison was branded as overcrowded, unsafe and unhygienic.  It was acknowledged that inmates were being brought into prisons that were unsafe and grossly overcrowded.  The prison review committee for 2009 found that there had been little change in 14 years in the regime employed there.  Judge Reilly&rsquo;s report found that the prison was vermin infested and chronically overpopulated, with up to six prisoners sharing a cell at any one time and, in some cases, without beds.  Judge Reilly was unequivocal in his findings that there was no clear policy on the use of special, time-out, padded and assessment cells.  He pointed out that prisoners should not be denied their human rights.</P>
        <P>In terms of international law, there are serious gaps in Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to human rights in this area.  In October 2011 human rights commitments will be considered at the UN human rights council.  The record of UN member states in this area, including Ireland, will be scrutinised and conditions in our prisons will be a key issue.  Overcrowding and slopping out are leading to situations that are unsafe for prisoners and prison staff.</P><Col N="696"/>
        <P Just="Left">We are very quick to talk about the human rights of prisoners, which is appropriate.  In listening to the Minister the other day I was struck by the contrast between the record of commitment to improvement recited by him and the criticisms made by a person such as Mr. John Lonergan, the former Governor of Mountjoy Prison.  I was struck by the difference in the impact of what was being said by the Minister and Mr. Lonergan.  I do not wish to be too pointed, but Mr. Lonergan was quite critical of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in that the Minister had not shown much interest, visited prisons or so on.  Had the Minister attended today, I would have asked for his response.  I do not take the criticism at face value, but it is odd that such an eminent and credible person in the Irish Prison Service should make such pointed criticisms of Government and the Minister.  In some ways, it is only right that we ask the Minister for his opinion on the criticism of his and the Government&rsquo;s record.</P>
        <P>While it is proper that we discuss human rights, I wonder whether there is a serious commitment to the concept of human dignity.  If there was such a commitment, we would not tolerate for a moment longer the reality of people slopping out and going to the toilet in the presence of others.  The fundamental issue in this debate is what we view as being the purpose of the prison system.  By all means let part of the agenda be to punish but, unless the agenda is also to reform and rehabilitate, we will lose our way as a society.  We are certainly not thinking smarter if we view our prison system purely in terms of its punitive dimension.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What else is there other than the punitive dimension if we humiliate people to such an extent that we do not acknowledge their basic human dignity?  We store up all sorts of problems for the future when we send the message to prisoners that we want to treat them like dirt.  It is one matter to punish people properly for crimes.  I would be in favour of linking early release with willingness to comply with various prison programmes aimed at reform.  Mr. Lonergan was critical of the way the Irish Prison Service handled the release of Mr. Larry Murphy a number of months ago.  There may be no great sympathy for Mr. Murphy, but it is beyond dispute that the issue of release should involve incentivisation.  A part of the problem in the Murphy case lay in the fact that he was released without having shown any commitment to engage in rehabilitative programmes.  We need to incentivise prisoners by linking their early releases with their commitment to and participation in such programmes.</P>
        <P>Reform of sentencing and penal correction is necessary.  In the international context, Ireland is in the middle range, in that we incarcerate 90 prisoners per 100,000 people annually whereas Norway has approximately 60 prisoners per 100,000.  In 2009, 90% of the nearly 11,000 persons sentenced to three months or less were convicted of non-violent crimes, such as the non-payment of fines.  Of the more than 15,000 people committed in 2009, nearly 11,000 were sentenced, 12,000 had been committed more than once and more than 3,000 were committed while on remand and, thus, were only in the system for short periods.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister made great play of the fact that only a small number of people were in prison for the non-payment of fines.  He did this to rebut claims that prisons were overcrowded with non-violent offenders.  People who are in prison for the non-payment of fines represent only a cohort of non-violent offenders.  In this sense, the figure is not of much use.  It has come to light that many of the people sentenced for the non-payment of fines were released upon arrival at prison.  As such, they were not incarcerated.  This further distorted our ability to consider properly what the Minister was saying.  It was in this context that, a few days ago, I suggested ministerial speeches be circulated to Senators in advance in order that we might consider what we were about to hear and conduct research.  There is no point in Government representatives attending the House to make speeches, the quality of which we cannot assess, <Col N="697"/>or to make claims that are statistically truthful but have no real meaning when other facts are taken into consideration.  The Seanad must examine this matter.</P>
        <P>We must consider the heavy burden posed on public resources by the cost of imprisonment.  Prison expenditure reached more than &euro;300 million in 2003.  In contrast, the total level of resource provision for the probation and welfare service was &euro;40.7 million.  The current cost of keeping an individual in custody is nearly &euro;80,000 per annum.  We should be thinking smarter, not harder, about what we can do to fund and develop alternatives to prison, particularly for non-violent offenders.  The Minister mentioned a great deal in this respect last week, but he did not mention the concept of restorative justice, the idea that offenders would be confronted with the victims of their wrongdoing.  There have been reports in this regard, so I was surprised it was not mentioned.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, will rectify this oversight if he has not already done so.  Restorative justice is just one of the issues that should be at the top of our agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fortunate that we have had an opportunity to extend the debate, as the first discussion was followed by the Minister&rsquo;s statement and an indication of substantial change in Government policy.  It has also been followed by a significant statement in the UK, where the justice Minister recently announced the closure of six prisons.  While the reasons behind such decisions in many countries might be economic, in that the cost of running a prison-based justice system is no longer sustainable as a draw on public resources, they present an opportunity to liberalise and to create a more humane and effective justice system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mullen highlighted the fact that, for reasons to do with non-payment of fines and debt, an unacceptably large number of people form part of our prison population.  Changes in this regard have been painfully slow in coming.  I hope the Fines Bill will, upon enactment, address many of these changes.  In terms of television licensing, a significant category of people have been dealt with through the recent Broadcasting Act 2009.  That this has happened at all and not just to this extent indicates it is not something in which we can take a great deal of pride at this stage of the country&rsquo;s history.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister of State is taking this debate.  With several of his hats, he will know more than most the need to reform the prison sentencing system.  Not only are an unacceptable number of people in prison for non-violent crimes and economic circumstances as much as anything else, but too many people with mental health difficulties are also being held in the prison system.  Strategies to ensure alternative means of dealing with people with such conditions should move them away from the justice system and into the health system, particularly a community health system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent publication of the memoirs of the former Governor of Mountjoy Prison was accompanied by a great deal of media fanfare.  I listened to a radio interview with him and there is no doubt that he has achieved a significant public profile.  He is identified by most of the public as someone with important comments to make on this area.  When he was introducing his memoirs during the interview in question, I was struck by something he pointed out.  When he joined the Irish Prison Service, the prison population was 600 people.  It is now 4,500.  This increase is not just down to more effective policing and prosecution of crime.  Rather, it has become something of a political feather in one&rsquo;s cap to say that the more people one imprisons, the more successful one can claim to be politically.  This scene can be found in many countries and many political parties. I hope the current economic circumstances will help us realise that the opposite is the case.  The more people we imprison, the less successful we are as a society.</P><Col N="698"/>
        
     
        <P>We need to move away from custodial sentences as a way of dealing with the many problems in our society.  Of course, there will always be a need for custodial sentences.  There will be crimes that are unacceptable to many in our society and there is a need to remove people from society who are a source of danger to themselves and to society at large.  I and my party believe that the use of custodial sentences has been exaggerated and over-used in our system.  We need to move away from that approach as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The debate on the Irish system and its philosophy is important.  I express a personal fear in this regard.  In the shaping of Irish prison policy we should not go down the road that had an effect on the Department of Finance and our approach to financial regulation.  This was the idea there was a route whereby senior civil servants went through the Department of Finance, became Secretary General of that Department and then became the Governor of the Central Bank.  We can see where that approach to the Civil Service has led us.  I believe a parallel system is developing in the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  There seems to be a link between running the Irish Prison Service and becoming involved in the Department, and <i>vice versa</i>, which has led to an intensification of the <i>status quo</i>.  It does not allow for innovation or radical approaches and permits an ongoing defence mechanism for things staying as they are.  It results in an unwillingness to change.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I would like to see the Irish Prison Service and senior positions within the Department of Justice and Law Reform opening up a little to outside influences.  Too often we have seen a knee-jerk reaction to organisations such as Amnesty International and Irish Penal Reform Trust which, although they might be over-zealous in seeking better standards and an improvement in legislation, have a role to play.  They should be engaged with in a sense of partnership rather than in confrontation.  Too often we have seen that attitude displayed, not only towards non-governmental organisations but towards people appointed on an independent basis to assess the quality and effectiveness of our prisons.  Successive Ministers for Justice and Law Reform should take no great pride in the way in which successive reports by the independent Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention have been treated.  These are important documents that indicate what is wrong and the changes that need to made on an ongoing basis.  The real scandal of the ongoing reports of the independent Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention is that many of the same flaws and faults are reported in one report after another.  I do not know anyone who can stand over that in a social or political sense.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I welcome the ongoing debate.  It is important, especially in the prevailing economic circumstances, with the difficult decisions we must make in many areas of expenditure on social protection, that another look be taken at expenditure in the areas of justice and the prison service to see how it can be made more effective by using the resources we have.  Ultimately, that would be more just and humane.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Moloney.  The report of Judge Reilly has been critical of the conditions in 14 prisons.  In 11 of 15 prisons there is over-capacity.  The role of prison officers and the work they have done should be acknowledged, as Senator O&rsquo;Malley noted, and they should be supported.  They do extraordinary work but are undervalued, underappreciated and in need of our acknowledgment today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reading the report of Judge Reilly one is struck by the fact that the prison system is in need of overhaul, in both its infrastructure &mdash; its buildings &mdash; and its staff morale, but also by some way of making the prison regime more rehabilitative as opposed to merely locking up people.  We need to strike that balance.  Many would argue we should have a turn the key mentality <Col N="699"/>and should forget about the people we incarcerate.  It is much more important to have a holistic approach, namely, to understand the cause of the crime and to try to rehabilitate the prisoner who has committed the offence.  Much reference was made to Mr. John Lonergan and to comments he has made since retiring.  He spoke very well about the link between crime and social and economic deprivation.  He is right.  There is a clear connection between them.</P>
        <P>The report contains a very interesting statistic.  In 2008, 50 prisoners were in prison for less than three months, 124 were there for between three and six months, and 283 for between six and twelve months.  I am concerned that we have failed to tackle the overcrowding issue.  Limerick Prison has 75% more prisoners than it can cater for and on 23 July Cork Prison had 316 prisoners, exceeding its 272-bed capacity by 10%.  I talked to staff in Cork Prison when I was preparing for this debate and recently, when canvassing, I met other staff.  They are very concerned about their own safety and morale and, equally, about the way in which the prison is able to deal with prisoners in classes and workshops, which was mentioned by Senator Cummins.  They are concerned about the quality of the education system within the prison.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is extraordinary that all but eight cells in Cork Prison are doubled up and sometimes there are three prisoners in the one cell.  This lends itself to rioting and insurrection in prisons.  The Prison Officers Association made a very good comment on the Mountjoy Prison riots, describing the prisoners as being like flies on top of each other.  In Mountjoy Prison on the night of the recent riots there were 677 inmates, well in excess of the stated capacity of 450.  It is important to look at staff health and safety as well as at the prisoner.  This is joined-up thinking.</P>
        <P>As Senator Boyle noted, we need to consider what we want our prison system to do and what we want prisoners to do in prison.  During the summer I was in Rhode Island.  On Route 1, the main interstate route between Boston and Rhode Island, one frequently saw prisoners doing manual labour, picking up rubbish, cutting grass and trimming hedges on the main highway, under supervision.  These were low level prisoners.  It is important to engage in such a programme in this country.  I will probably have some human rights activists after me now but it is important we broaden our thinking about what we can get inmates to do.</P>
        <P>I believe, equally, that prison must be rehabilitative.  We must have an education system in prisons that would allow inmates, who in some cases would have little or no education, to come out of prison with some kind of learning and education, perhaps even a trade or a degree.  With my background in education, I believe we must give people an opportunity to redeem themselves and turn the corner.  If our system is only concerned with locking people up, incarcerating them for nine or ten hours a day, it fails.  It may give people their pound of flesh and a moral victory but overall there is a knock-on effect which we are missing.</P>
        <P>During his term as Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Michael McDowell boasted about making prisons drug free.  We are very far away from that.  I shall strike a politically discordant note by observing that the Fianna F&aacute;il mantra of zero tolerance has not worked either.  Our prisons are overcrowded.  We now see that our prisons are overcrowded, it is acknowledged that the methodology we are using is not working and we have refused to overhaul the prison system.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State say what the situation is as regards the proposed new prison for Kilworth in County Cork?  The site has been earmarked, but we have heard little or nothing from Government as regards that.  Senator Cummins spoke strongly as regards people with fines, and progress in that regard is to be welcomed.  However, we have seen a lack of joined-up thinking between local authorities and the Departments of Justice and Law Reform and Education and Skills as regards community service orders, anti-social behaviour orders and the <Col N="700"/>behaviour of people in society.  There is a need to use community service orders rather than incarceration as a sanction for minor offences.</P>
        <P>It is also important that there should be ring-fencing of moneys for drug treatment in prison.  It is not good enough that people go into prison drug free and come out addicted to some type of drug.  I pay tribute to Judge Michael Reilly for his report.  I also compliment Mr. John Lonergan, who has been a very strong voice in this regard.  I might not always agree with what he has to say, but he has not been afraid to articulate his viewpoint, and he has put a humane and compassionate face on the prison system.  I thank the Minister of State for being here.</P>

T&aacute;imid ag feitheamh ar na smaoint&iacute; at&aacute; ag an Aire St&aacute;it ar an &aacute;bhar seo toisc go bhfuil s&eacute; ina r&eacute;imse freagrachta.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Compared with other countries Ireland&rsquo;s prison population is relatively low, at around 85 per 100,000, as compared with an EU average of 109, while the figure for Britain is 153.  On the face of it that is a relatively low prison population.  There has been much talk about overcrowding in prisons, but again I believe that the number of places relative to the number of prisoners is more or less in sync, while obviously there are times when this position is exceeded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Belgium the prison figure is 125 per 100,000 of the population.  In France it is 130 and in Spain it is 141.  Those are the international comparators as regards where we are.  As more than 80% of Irish prisoners are serving sentences in excess of 12 months, obviously they are in prison for more serious crimes.  That puts in focus the background to the current prison situation in Ireland.  There is much emphasis on Mountjoy Prison and I realise the former Prison Governor has been making comments in that regard.  He took a particular approach with which one might agree or disagree.  My view is that an over benign approach to the prison population does not necessarily achieve the interests of society generally.  It should be a place of rehabilitation, as many Members have said.  Also, it should be a place of penance, as it were, for prisoners, many of whom have committed the vilest of crimes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The conditions in Mountjoy Prison, I know, are not what a civilised society requires.  It is a Victorian institution, containing all the elements and indications of that period.  However, even in the stringent times we are in, efforts have been made to improve the situation.  The acquisition of Thornton Hall, whatever about the costs involved, will afford accommodation for approximately 50% of the current prison population.  Value for money comes into this if we are to maximise the facilities based on the very skilled resources that will be available, in all probability, in the next decade or so.  In that regard, our tendering systems can sometimes be quite costly.  We put contractors who are tendering to a great deal of expense, and obviously only one will be successful.  This does not just relate to prisons, as it applies right across the public service.  It probably covers the position of the personnel involved, who may not have any expertise in the area, but it does not really serve well the notion of value for money.  Many would contend that the system in this regard is overly bureaucratic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome other developments too.  Apart from Thornton Hall, there are the Kilworth, D&oacute;chas, which will have 70 places in the foreseeable future, Portlaoise, Shelton Abbey and Castlerea Projects, all of which are the focus of capital investment to improve and extend prison facilities.  Much of the discussion has rightly concentrated on the integrated sentence management systems we have in place.  I concur with many who support alternatives to custodial sentences.  There is a reasonable acceptance of that principle through the temporary release mechanism.  I believe some 563 prisoners were on temporary release in October, which is similar <Col N="701"/>to parole.  The roll-out of electronic monitoring will facilitate this trend further.  Obviously, great care must be taken as regards who is on temporary release and who is not.  The risk to society and its protection are a fundamental part of that.</P>
        <P>Community service orders are playing their part, where people do unpaid work for between one and six weeks.  Perhaps there is no reason why that should not be extended, but I am somewhat concerned about the report that while there is a high utilisation of the community service reports by the courts, the scheme is not being used to the extent that it has been in the past.  That is a matter of some concern and should be addressed.  Community service supervisors are not at full capacity and could provide supervision for three times the number of offenders that have community service orders.  There is real scope there and I would like to see this extended.  There is no need for people who are not a threat to society to necessarily be incarcerated.  However, if the crime is very serious, then obviously they should be, and I do not believe that going to prison should be on a par with entering the Shelbourne or some of our top hotels.  They should be a place that one does not aspire to go to, and if one goes there once, one should not have a desire to return.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are anecdotal stories concerning people who, in winter time, because of a lack of accommodation believe that three months in prison might be a nice way to punch in the winter.  People involved in the system will acknowledge this.  I welcome the fact, too, that a legislative amendment is being made so that judges are obliged to consider community service in cases where custodial sentences are less than six months.</P>
        <P>There are a few issues I would like to see tackled, such as the whole remission area of<?oasys _jy ?>25%.  We should seek to enhance the notion of community work for prisoners along with education.  Sex offenders should be obliged to participate in therapeutic courses.  I genuinely believe that 25% remission should not apply unless prisoners conform to these norms and one of the criteria should be a sense of confidence in prisoners not reoffending.  My understanding is that 50% of those in prison are recidivists within four years.  One might argue that 50% are not, but that figure is very high, and while the statistics compare well internationally we should be always seeking to bring that down.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to comment briefly on the inspector&rsquo;s report and the many reports of his predecessors which have provided much food for thought and debate in this and the Lower House.  It must be acknowledged that every society has prisons and prisoners.  Prison is an emotive word.  Sadly, it remains a necessary part of the maintenance of social order in this country and in other societies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is disappointing to see reports repeatedly highlighting overcrowding, reoffending and the same people being in prison on a revolving door-type basis.  There are major issues which must be addressed by society and by us from a legislative perspective, including prison sentencing, prison accommodation, training, education and so on.  It appears that we have not made much progress in this regard during the past 15 to 20 years, in particular in regard to reoffending.</P>
        <P>It is traditional in this country that the majority of prisoners come from a particular socioeconomic background, which is regrettable.  This illustrates the need for progress in society from an educational perspective.  We must try to ensure children remain in school and to enhance and increase opportunities for those people for whom a life of crime becomes the natural outlet.</P>
        <P>The merits and demerits of the Celtic tiger are continually mentioned in this House.  It must be acknowledged that during the Celtic tiger era respect and manners went out the door.  Bad manners and a lack of respect became the norm as a result of the Celtic tiger.  Such lack of <Col N="702"/>respect not alone for authority but for neighbours, parents and the elderly leads, in many cases, first to minor crime and then to more serious crime.  We must address this issue at school level.  We must from the earliest possible age try to instil in children the need for respect for their peers and colleagues.  A regeneration of respect among young people would help in stemming the tide of low and high level crime and vandalism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report before us deals with the prison system.  We must all acknowledge the need for progress in regard to the provision of additional prison spaces, the construction of Thornton Hall and the construction of the new prison in Cork.  Senator Buttimer asked the Minister of State for an update in regard to the proposed prison at Kilworth.  I, too, am interested in hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response in that regard.  Progress must also be made on community service as an alternative to prison.  Much work needs to be done.  We have had many reports on prisons from prison visiting committees and so on, all of which indicates that the current system is not working as well as it should.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I doubt I have added anything of significance to this debate.  I want to acknowledge the work done by the inspector and his predecessors, whom I believe are challenging us to provide not alone new accommodation for prisoners but new interventions and approaches to ensure fewer people are in prison and, more important, a reduction in the rate of crime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Ahern, who is unable to be here owing to circumstances beyond his control.  I thank Senators who contributed to this debate last week and today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, the Minister set out the range of measures being taken in the prison system.  I reiterate that there are no easy or quick-fix solutions that can be brought in overnight to deal with prisons issues.  The Government is working to tackle the issue across a number of fronts, including more prison spaces, badly needed investment despite our current economic circumstances, the introduction of legislative solutions such as contained in the Fines Act, the Minister&rsquo;s proposals approved at Cabinet this week to draft a Bill to amend the community service order legislation to ensure judges will consider imposing a CSO in circumstances where a custodial sentence of up to six months might be contemplated, and use of Probation Service resources to work with offenders in the community to reduce reoffending and promote community safety, working alongside the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in local communities.  The Minister&rsquo;s concern is public protection and safety, which must be borne in mind at all times during our discussions.  Our prisons are filled with offenders who, by and large, are there for committal of serious offences and in respect of which the Judiciary believed a custodial sentence was warranted.</P>
        <P>In the time available, it is not possible to pick up on all of the points made but I will try to comment on some of the key remarks.  Many Senators, including Senators Regan and Bacik commented on the issue of prisoner overcrowding.  The Minister stated last week that he accepts that prisoner numbers have increased quite significantly in recent years but that this is not unique, in international terms, to Ireland.  I reiterate that there is no easy solution to how we manage our prisoner population.  Releasing serious offenders onto the streets is not an option.  I reiterate the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to providing the various criminal justice agencies with the necessary resources.</P>
        <P>The prisons building programme to provide additional spaces is but one example of the Government&rsquo;s determination to tackle these issues.  It represents a major commitment in these <Col N="703"/>difficult economic times for the people and we will continue to support prison management and staff in whatever way we can.  It has to be borne in mind that we have provided 1,920 new prison spaces since 1997.  That is a fact Senators opposite must acknowledge.  The Government is also determined to do what it can to prioritise expenditure on the provision of prison places and ensure serious criminals are kept off the streets.</P>
        <P>Senators raised concerns regarding the Thornton Hall project.  I acknowledge the point and agree that we need to replace the Mountjoy Prison complex.  The Government remains fully committed to building the Thornton Hall complex, albeit on a phased basis, to provide 1,400 cells, with a regime focused ethos for prisoners.  The first phase will see the provision of 400 cells capable of accommodating up to 700 prisoners and funding is being made available from the Department&rsquo;s capital envelope to enable it to proceed.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators also raised the issue of slopping out, on which the Minister accepts their strongly held views.  Improvements have taken place, with 72% of the prisoner population now having access to in-cell sanitation facilities.  That figure will rise to 80% in the medium term.  While we will need the facilities at Thornton Hall and Kilworth in place before we can completely eliminate the practice of slopping out, in the meantime the Irish Prison Service will continue to do what it can to address the matter.</P>
        <P>There has also been some comment on the most recent reports of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention and criticisms made of the prison system.  The Minister wishes to state we need independent oversight of the prison system and the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Judge Michael Reilly &mdash; a judge of many years experience &mdash; is doing an excellent job, as acknowledged by many Senators during the debate.  The Minister has asked the director general of the Irish Prison Service to review each of the reports presented.</P>
        <P>Among other issues, Senator Quinn inquired whether prisoners had a vote; I can assure him that is the case.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan referred to the activities available to prisoners.  Last week the Minister set out the range of activities available to prisoners, but we must remember that they must want to engage in education programmes, workshops and other work training programmes if we are to obtain best results.  Many prisoners want to engage &mdash; there are 90 workshops and about 220 whole-time equivalent teachers to provide classes, as well as prison grade staff in workshops.  Some prisoners are also completing leaving and junior certificate and Open University courses.  Therefore, it is not all negative.  We must commend those prisoners who use their time in prison well to improve their standard of education, etc.  Integrated sentence management also plays a role in how prisoners can be helped.</P>
        <P>The Minister listened carefully and with great interest to the range of views expressed on the non-custodial options open to the Judiciary.  I again thank Senator McDonald for her contribution.  It is agreed that community-based sanctions work well in appropriate circumstances.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan spoke, too, about putting people in prison for minor offences, a matter to which the Minister also referred from his experience as a solicitor.  As I said, he has indicated that he believes community service offers a real alternative.  In this regard, the Department of Justice and Law Reform is examining the entire range of sanctions available.</P>
        <P>I am unable to answer the question raised by Senator Buttimer on the completion of the Kilworth project.  I will have a response communicated to him.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to debate these issues.  The Government is committed to tackling the issues raised and supporting all aspects of the criminal justice system. <Col N="704"/> I do not have time to deal with a number of other issues raised by Senators, but I will have responses communicated to them.</P>
