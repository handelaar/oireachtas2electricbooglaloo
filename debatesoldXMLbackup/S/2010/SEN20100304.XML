	<P>I have received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to co-ordinate the building and renovation of Garda stations, given the inputs of the OPW, his Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as in the case of Carndonagh Garda station, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="2">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide approval to allow the Glenties primary care centre to proceed to tender immediately.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feargal Quinn of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the plans she is putting in place to address the financial problems which will arise for smaller ports in Ireland as a result of the United States&rsquo; proposal that 100% of imports into the United States be first scanned in the exporting country.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Keaveney and &Oacute; Domhnaill as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Quinn, as the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and adjourn at 1 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 1<i>a</i>, statements on tourism, to be taken at 1 p.m. and conclude not later than 2.30 p.m., on which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask again for a proper debate in this House on the banking crisis.  The banking inquiries that are currently being carried out on behalf of the Government are <Col N="318"/>taking place behind closed doors.  The Government&rsquo;s terms of reference prohibit any investigation of the fateful night in September 2008 when the Taoiseach saddled future generations with massive debt.  Last Friday, the Minister for Finance published his budget outlook for the next couple of years.  He made no allowance for the recapitalisation of the Irish banks.  We know that billions of euro will be spent on recapitalising the banks.  When the Minister published his outlook for the next couple of years last Friday, one can imagine the howls of derision if he had neglected to include a figure for the Department of Education and Science.  In this case, he has made no allowance for the fact that the taxpayers of this State will have to come up with billions of euro to recapitalise the banks.  Therefore, I ask the Leader to arrange a proper rolling debate on the banking crisis so Senators and those we represent can be properly informed about what is going on.  Too much is happening behind closed doors.  Taxpayers are getting the rawest deal going for future generations.</P>
        <P>I also ask for a debate on the pensions plan that was published by the Government yesterday.  There is a need for a serious debate on this issue.  I have been paying into a private pension plan for the last 15 years.  That fund is now worth two thirds of the amount of money I have paid into it.  There has been no growth or interest.  The Government is saying it wants the same fund managers to manage the future pensions of low-paid workers in the same way.  That is nonsensical.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Low-paid workers cannot afford to take such a hit.  We need a proper debate on how these pension funds will be managed in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Various groups within the community have suffered from the recession over the last couple of years.  I suggest that those involved in various branches of the arts, such as sculptors, painters and writers, have probably suffered more than any other group.  I appeal to my Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues to reassess their position on the appointment of a part-time arts officer in the Central Bank.  We are looking like philistines here.  At a time when we are fighting our way out of recession, there is nothing more important than to give ourselves hope and optimism for the future.  This industry depends on discretionary and marginal income.  It requires people to spend money.  We hear very little about this group.  I would prefer if we halved the car scrappage scheme, which is creating jobs in Germany and France, and put the money into the arts in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We should invest in artistic events in areas like theatre, sculpting and painting, which are part and parcel of Irish life.  I really think we need to look at this.  It is a sad day for Ireland when two political parties oppose the investment of a minor amount of money in the arts.  I should also mention that a library in Sallynoggin, which is one of the most deprived working-class areas of Dublin, is to be closed.  We need a debate on the importance of the arts in Ireland.  We need to consider where we need to go and how we can support these people, who need support like every other worker in the Civil Service, the public service and the factory line.  Artists are a hard-working part of our community.  I doubt that any other group is as much at risk.  Rather than criticising the investment of money in the arts, we should be directing more money into them.  Having expressed my disagreement with Fine Gael and the Labour Party, I have to say I agree with Fine Gael&rsquo;s point about pensions.  I have said for the last six years that I completely support the idea of compulsory pensions.  When S&eacute;amus <Col N="319"/>Brennan came in and made that suggestion about ten years ago, I think I was the only voice in favour of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I was in favour of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>And me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It has to be done.  However, I do not agree with the idea of giving responsibility for this system to the private fund managers who have created havoc in our financial services industry.  The Opposition parties are completely right to say that is not the way to go forward.  The most effective fund managers in this country over the last ten years have been the officials in the NTMA.  That is where the money should go.  The State fund that has been operated has been more successful than the funds operated by other groups.  We need to go in that direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to have a full and frank debate on the national pensions framework, which was published yesterday and provides food for thought.  It is vital to get all sectors of society to buy into Ireland&rsquo;s future pension commitments.  Those of us who are realistic accept the need for an increase in the retirement age.  At present, for every six workers there are two people on pensions, but that will change.  In 40 years&rsquo; time, there will be two workers for every person on a pension.  It is absolutely wrong to defer the tough decisions that have to be made.  I would welcome a debate on yesterday&rsquo;s publication of the framework document.  On the security of pension systems, we have to learn lessons from the examples of Waterford Glass and SR Technics over the last number of months.  We have to ensure the future pensions framework takes that into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>As this will kick in in 2014, many people in their early 60s woke up this morning to discover they will not be able to retire for another year.  We need to look at that again.  It is already clear, from the debate in the media and in this House, that we will have a robust exchange of views on this issue.  That is very welcome because it is vital that we get this right for all of our futures.  Today is the 13th world book day.  The main aim of the day is to encourage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The closure of libraries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;children to enjoy books and to read more.  Figures suggest that one in five students in this country leaves secondary school at the age of 15.  One of the main reasons for that is the literacy problem.  Approximately 500,000 Irish people have such problems.  That is why it is important to support this endeavour.  We have to recognise the good work that is done by libraries in Dublin and other counties.  The people of County Meath are very proud of the excellent library service there.  Children can go to libraries to borrow and read books, or to sit and study in quiet conditions.  It is vital to give libraries the facilities they need to retain quality standards.</P>
        <P>Yesterday saw the passing of a former leader of the UK Labour Party, Michael Foot.  He had a very full and long life and he achieved a lot.  He helped to establish the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.  He was an inspirational speaker.  He had a long-time interest in Ireland.  I heard him speak when I was in college in Dublin in the early 1980s.  He was an outstanding politician and an example to us all.  If the current generation of politicians can reach his age and be as well respected across the political spectrum, we will have achieved something.  Michael Foot will be long remembered by the international labour movement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the call for a debate on the national pensions framework, especially in the interests of those of us who will have to work for an extra three years when the time comes.  It is important that this House should debate the shape of our future society.  The call for a debate on the banking inquiry should wait until the terms of reference for the tribunal of inquiry are drawn up.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Those who attended a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service will have heard the Governor of the Central Bank saying he favours the model that is being adopted in the United States, which has some private elements but is largely public in its format.  I am confident the tribunal of inquiry, when it is formed, will have large public elements.  Can Opposition Senators square the Official Secrets Act 1963, which applies to people working in the Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s office and the Central Bank, with a fully public inquiry?  I would like to know how that circle can be squared.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for a debate on investment in the arts in the context of economic and social improvement.  Is important to focus on the decisions being made by local authorities on spending priorities.  I refer particularly to the Fine Gael-led local authority in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which has made a decision on local library services.  It has the right to make those decisions.</P></Speaker>

	<P>Regardless of the issue in question, I feel that type of behaviour and questioning is magnified elsewhere in public life.</P>
        <P>This morning when I was coming down Thomas Street an admittedly very drunk man shouted at me for five minutes calling me a maggot.  I believe he did so because he saw last night&rsquo;s scenes involving me on television.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The type of debate we have in this House where some Members mistake shouting, finger-pointing and exaggeration of rumour as fact does not help that process.</P>

	<P>It is questions to the Leader and no interruptions.</P>

	<P>Senator Boyle did not have any questions for the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Leader three questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It was disturbing this morning to hear a representative of the HSE state 20 reports on the protection and care of children had accumulated over the past several years in the health boards, and subsequently the HSE, but had not been published.  Why were these 20 reports produced but not made available to anyone?  There can be no legal excuse about confidentiality, or any other, that can justify not publishing these 20 reports.  Will the Leader ensure the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, attends the House as soon as possible to explain why this has happened, when these reports will be published and when children can benefit from their recommendations, some of which concern the deaths of children in care?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have every sympathy with Senator Twomey and others who have called for a debate on the proposed changes to pension structures.  I too was that soldier whose private pension plans, taken out over the past 15 years, were whittled down well below a viable value.  What annoyed me was that when it was plainly obvious in the past few years that the Irish banking sector was in a tailspin and its equities were going through the floor, many of the managed funds were still going into bank shares.  I recall attempting to get these funds changed in 2007 and 2008 only to be told they could not.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader consider a debate on Irish foreign policy within the European Union?  Both sides of the House will be familiar with the implications and consequences of the Lisbon treaty about the expansion of foreign policy within Europe.  Earlier this week, it was reported in the <Col N="322"/>Irish media that Baroness Ashton, the High Representative of the European Union, is in the process of setting up external affairs representatives, or in other words, EU ambassadors.  A turf war seems to be already developing between France and Germany as to who will get the top jobs.</P>
        <P>I believe Ireland should be at the heart of this.  Members on all sides have argued Ireland should be at the heart of Europe.  I urge for a debate on what Ireland&rsquo;s role will be in these expanded EU foreign policy structures because I am concerned a French-German-British view of Europe would be presented to the world.  Ireland does not do war.  We do peace, humanitarian aid and all the positive elements which the European Union is well-known for across the world.  I would hate to think that decisions taken and appointments made would not be in Ireland&rsquo;s best interest.  While it may not seem important in the wider scheme of things, it would be for Ireland&rsquo;s role and image in the European Union and the wider world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret once again we are not breaking for lunch.  I will not amend the Order of Business because of it but it is a pity.  We are entitled, as human beings, to some kind of decent treatment.  I have no difficulty whatever with our salaries being cut but I would appreciate if we had decent facilities in this House.</P>
        <P>My secretary is in every morning at 7.30 a.m.  She does not take lunch but has an apple.  She often works until 6 p.m. and after but we have run out of the overtime allowance.  I am here every day and I am delighted we are clocking in.  At least people will know those of us who are here.  It would be very refreshing if they could monitor the doings of the House to see who contributes and all the rest of it.</P>
        <P>Since the development of electronic communication, there is a flood of communications every day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, every day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In the recession, there are people whose homes are under threat, children are sick, have planning difficulties or are in debt which must be answered.  I never get to bed until after midnight.  Then I have to listen to cheap shots on the wireless claiming we were in the Seanad for a day and a quarter and get paid for doing nothing.  I bitterly resent and reject it.  I do not mind what we get paid but I want the facilities to do the job.  At present, we are being asked to make bricks without straw.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Frances Fitzgerald that it is horrifying there are 20 reports on children in care awaiting publication.  I must signal the warning, however, that it is terribly important that in intervening in this area we make absolutely certain we do not prejudice the welfare and rights of the other family members concerned.  I particularly think of two small children who will probably learn from their schoolmates today of the tragic circumstances of their mother&rsquo;s death.  In these matters we need sensitivity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Boyle in their calls for continued support for the arts.  It is important we do not make short-sighted decisions and undo some of the tremendous work achieved in the past ten years.  I am proud Kerry County Council provided in its annual estimates funding for the Listowel Writers&rsquo; Week, the national theatre in Tralee and other arts programmes.</P>
        <P>I am calling for a debate on national gas supply, particularly in the mid-west region.  This week Endesa announced it will proceed with a gas-powered generating station in Tarbert, County Kerry, creating 500 jobs which is to be tremendously welcomed.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has announced it will lay a pipeline connecting the power station to the national grid.  At the <Col N="323"/>same time, Shannon LNG has received permission to extend a gas pipeline on the same path.  There is obviously a need for joined-up thinking.</P>
        <P>If the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, attended the House, we could highlight the positive elements of these projects.  I know the Minister is committed to the creation of an energy hub at the mouth of the Shannon Estuary.  Such a debate would help and progress that idea.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls by Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Boyle and O&rsquo;Sullivan with regard to the arts.  Last weekend I had the privilege and pleasure of attending the Irish Museums Association annual conference in Killarney, County Kerry.  Museums are a great store of knowledge and value to the State, doing wonderful work for cultural tourism, preserving those important traditions that are of value to us and helping to explain from where we came and who we are.  The people concerned are greatly undervalued and under ferocious pressure.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I renew the call of Senator Twomey for a debate on banking and take on board the points made by Senator Boyle.  There are so many stages in this process.  The Commission in Brussels needs to get off its butt because it delayed the sanctioning of NAMA.  The business plans of the institutions have been made, yet we are going nowhere until the Commission sanctions or amends the business plans of our two major banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Bank of Ireland had to give shares instead of cash, which it would have preferred, because of state aid rules.  AIB will face this prospect on 13 May but I hope the Commission will have got off its butt by then and got this measure through in the interests of the State.  If amendments must be made and assets must be sold, so be it.</P>

	<P>There is no real need to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader understands recapitalisation cannot take place until the NAMA-bound portfolios are transferred.  None of the transfers has yet taken place.  There is a major delay.  We deserve to have the Minister for Finance attend the House in order that we can hear more of the details.  The availability of credit to worthy customers who are being choked is very important.</P>

I welcome that announcement, as hundreds of thousands will be allowed to qualify for a pension.  It is difficult to say who will be the best people to manage the scheme.  Those involved will receive an annual statement and be directly involved in the investment.  There are only three possible investments, all made from equities, property <Col N="324"/>or cash.  There are no further variations.  It is very easy for one company to state that if it had invested in cash, it would have done very well.  That may be true over a period of one or two years but over a period of 30 years equity investments have always outperformed the others.  The mandatory nature of the scheme will help people and is to be warmly welcomed.</P>
        <P>I suggest we have a debate on banking very shortly.  I ask that consideration be given to bringing home from abroad some of the assets of the NTMA and putting them into the banks, with a specific reference that they be used for the purpose of providing credit.  Over and above the funding the banks need, the money the NTMA has abroad should be brought home and invested in our banks with a specific reference to providing credit for businesses.</P>

	<P>Last week when Senator Coffey called for a debate on how we could develop the green economy, he mentioned the excellent document, Developing the Green Economy in Ireland, which was produced by a high level study group and published last November.  It contains many excellent suggestions, on which we need an urgent debate in order that Members opposite can familiarise themselves with the contents of report, on page 30 of which it is suggested, as Fine Gael has been suggesting for a number of months, that a single national water authority be set up.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, was bemused by this the last time the issue was mentioned in the House.</P>
        <P>The document expresses a strong commitment to wind energy.  I am working with a wind energy company based in Cork to help it to develop its business in the west.  It tells me it has hit nothing but brick walls and that there is a lack of support from the Government in expanding the wind energy sector.  One of the things to which it points is the major discrepancy between the way wind energy producers are treated here and across the Border in Northern Ireland.  For example, in this country there is little or no guarantee about the price one will receive for the energy produced.  In the United Kingdom, from 1 April, producers will be guaranteed 41p for every unit of energy produced, even if it is used in the producer&rsquo;s house or business.  There is no such commitment in Ireland.  A commitment given to offer a certain price was reneged on a few months later.  In the United Kingdom one pays VAT at a rate of 5% on the purchase of a wind turbine, whereas in this country one pays at a rate of 21%.  If the Government is serious about supporting alternative energy projects, it needs to take these issues on board.  I look forward to a debate on the green economy very soon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning we have had a number of pertinent contributions on the importance of the arts and artists in Ireland.  It is through the arts that we demonstrate our distinctiveness as a nation.  As a small nation, we are punching way above our weight in the artistic world and the envy of many countries.  From the Book of Kells to Riverdance, it is clear that is exactly what gives us status in the world.  The return on any investment in the arts is more than hundredfold.  Various surveys of tourists to Ireland show that the arts figure among the first four or five requirements.  Another element to consider is the great sense of pride the arts give us as a nation.  This occurs at community, national and international levels.  It would be a retrograde step, therefore, to consider cutting investment in the arts.  It is one thing to take the success and potential of the arts for granted, it is another to believe that in a competitive world our current status will continue if we do not sustain it.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to set time aside for a comprehensive debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>The time has come to focus on policies, not personalities.  In the media, this Chamber or anywhere else we are not helping the people we are supposed to represent.  That negative and disruptive message extends way beyond the shores of Ireland.  We should make a decision to deal with any policy we want to put to the people.  The day of the cult of personality in politics <Col N="325"/>and the manner in which it is handled in the media must come to an end or we will do much harm to the body politic and the confidence of people.  This will haunt us in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what colleagues have said about the arts.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made the opening comments about the bread and roses perspective.  His presentation is very fair.  Notwithstanding the financial difficulties of local authorities, they should attempt to support and promote the arts.  It is important we are having this mini-discussion at this point on the political spectrum because there is talk of a Cabinet reshuffle, not so much in terms of personnel but in terms of the reconfiguration of Departments.  There was a recommendation that certain Departments be amalgamated or abolished.  That is a judgment call the Taoiseach and his advisers must make.  If we are concerned about the arts and culture and their development on the island, the message from this House to the Taoiseach should be that the reconfiguration of Departments should result in a strong role at Cabinet level and a portfolio for the arts and culture with whatever addendums are provided for.  Members on the Government side of the House are saying there is an obligation on the Opposition to make demands of our local authority colleagues to fund the arts.  There is a strong obligation on the Government, given the Taoiseach is about to put in place a new Cabinet, to ensure a new Department responsible for arts and culture is defended.</P>
        <P>I support the request for a debate on pension provision.  I have raised this matter previously because we have become fixated with the pensions industry.  For the past 20 or 25 years, people who did not invest significant money in pension funds were looked on as second class citizens.  There was an inevitability to the collapse of the pensions industry.  Yesterday&rsquo;s document must be debated urgently.  A great deal of good work has been done but we have a distance to travel.  Pensions are vital for every citizen and the role of the State is central.  It is time for action and I hope the Leader can arrange a debate as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the call for a debate on the arts.  I would hate to think there would be a reduction in investment in this area.  Many Senators have touched on the subject.  Throughout Ireland, even in the smallest villages, art is blossoming in every form, whether it be reading, protection of monuments, stimulating interest in young artists or art exhibitions.  It is our natural flair to be involved in culture and arts and I would hate it if support was withdrawn.  Local authorities have a significant role in promoting local artists and culture.  Many aspects of the arts could be raised when the debate is put on the agenda.  The arts generate comprehensive interest and we are only touching on it now.  It is an important subject to be debated.</P>
        <P>I would be delighted to debate the proposed pensions structure.  Society has changed a great deal, as has the world of work, how people do their jobs and people&rsquo;s lifestyles and pensions will have to reflect that.  That is a good topic and the report needs to be studied and debated.  I ask the Leader to schedule debates on both these issues soon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Cathaoirleach turned down a matter I proposed to raise on the Adjournment because I referred it to a Department that claims not to have responsibility for it.</P>

	<P>The issue on which I sought a debate was the decision by the United States to insist that after a certain date, which has not yet been decided, all goods exported to the US will have to be scanned before they leave the country of origin.  I assumed that would be huge interest to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is essential that we overcome this because it will be costly to install the scanning system required to trace everything leaving Ireland in containers for the US.  I will table the matter again next week.  Bureaucracy and red tape is an issue.  It does not make sense that the wrong Department could not transfer my request to the appropriate Department.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have thought the Civil Service had a better system than that.  I will table the issue again next week on the basis that it has something to do with ports, but the Department for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources may well say this is not covered by its remit and it should be addressed somewhere else.</P>
        <P>With regard to pensions, some years ago Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the fact he was one of those who spoke about the need for universal pensions.  I fully supported that then but let us not jump to the conclusion that this will be easily done for private pensions.  Reference was made to what happened at Waterford Crystal.  If the company had a pension system under which it would have had to increase its costs over the past 20 years, it would not have lasted as long as it did.  It is not as simple as saying employers should pay pensions automatically.  The issue is much more difficult than that but there is a need for private pension provision.</P>
        <P>I attended an interesting conference yesterday morning entitled Turning Silver Into Gold.  It was opened by the Taoiseach in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.  It was about making money in the future out of those of us with silver hair.  It is fascinating that people who are a little older than retirement age have the ability to spend money and this presents an opportunity.  What emerged from the conference, however, is that a large number of people do not want to have to retire and it was interesting that a number of company representatives pointed out they did not impose a retirement age and they encouraged people to continue working.  That is why the criticism of us being told we have to work longer is dangerous.  A large number of people around the world and in Ireland would welcome the opportunity.  The word &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; should almost be banned.  People who wish to continue to work and contribute to the nation&rsquo;s wealth should be allowed to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>An important report will be presented to the Government on 12 March by Ms Norah Gibbons of Barnardos regarding the Roscommon case.  Sentencing in the case takes place tomorrow.  The report will be of significant importance to all concerned but it must be considered by the Attorney General.  I urge that it be published as quickly as possible after that and that it not be delayed because it is vital that this report, particularly in regard to the house of horrors in Roscommon, be published and those who ignored what happened accept responsibility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Today is world book day, which puts a welcome focus on the arts and literacy, which are linked.  As many Senators said, the arts generate a good spirit in our communities and they are a source of cultural tourism and creative industries.  They should be supported, as Senator Bradford said, at Government level in the upcoming reshuffle.</P>
        <P>I would like an urgent debate on literacy, given 30% of children leave schools in disadvantaged areas without being able to read or write, according to the recent NESF report.  Literacy is the passport to personal independence and it is also a matter of strategic national importance.  That also puts the focus on the need for a debate on the quality of our education system.  I was shocked on Monday when I heard the Minister for Education and Science say on radio that he was shocked when he heard we were only average in mathematics.  He said he thought we were always above average.  He clearly had not read the OECD&rsquo;s reports.  He is an uninformed Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because the Government has kept it all hidden.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>A service provider indicated in a radio interview earlier that serious gaps remain for children in care.  Could the Leader arrange appropriate briefings and reports? <Col N="328"/> We could then consider whether it is necessary to have a debate in the House regarding the level of supports, the gaps, if any, and the variances in different areas of the country in services provided to children taken into care.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that a number people are now joining me in asking for a debate on pensions.  As Senators will know, I have been asking for this debate for a period of time.  I hope the Leader will now be able to accommodate it, especially given that we have the new framework document.  We have other reports available to us, including the recent report from the Pensions Board.</P>
        <P>I have referred previously to the issue and importance of competitiveness.  I am pleased to note the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has announced today that he is to establish a working group to review commercial rent reviews.  He has already banned upward-only rent reviews and has now established this working group.  Would it be possible to arrange a debate in this House as soon as this group&rsquo;s first report is available because it impinges on the issue of competitiveness?</P>

	<P>I call for a debate on an issue that disturbs me greatly.  Gillian Fallon&rsquo;s husband was deported back to Nigeria yesterday.  They had been together as a family for three years and they got married on 5 May 2009.  Fourteen days later garda&iacute; arrived at their house &mdash; they are neighbours of my father&rsquo;s &mdash; at 7.30 a.m.  They disturbed the family, including two little children and issued him with a deportation order.  I was made aware that Gillian Fallon works full time and supports her partner who is not allowed to work even though he is a qualified electrician.  This is inhumane and heart-rending treatment for this family.  I fail to understand why I received no response to my representation made on 13 November.  They want nothing from the State; he just wants to be allowed to stay here.  They are in a loving relationship and he was a stepfather to her two children.  I fail to understand why he was deported and treated so inhumanely.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Government decision yesterday to ban a range of head shop products.  From June head shops will be prevented from selling a range of products that would have been sold under the heading of legal highs until now.  Head shops are a scourge on society.  A number of them in my constituency are causing tremendous grief and pain to parents and to the local community.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision, which is a step in the right direction.  Ultimately, while there may be a constitutional issue, I would like to see a total ban on head shops.  I would also like to see the regulation of such shops under the planning guidelines.  That might be considered in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is before the D&aacute;il at present.  Consumer law should be amended to take account of the dangers head shops pose to vulnerable people and young people.</P>
        <P>I refer to the ongoing dissident activity north of the Border, which is extending to untreatable levels and causing great distress to many people living north of the Border.  There are dissident groups on both sides that are scourging local communities.  Evidence of that was the death of <Col N="329"/>the young man in Derry approximately ten days ago.  The man had connections with my area in Donegal.  I know he was a very respectable young man who was killed brutally by a dissident republican group.  However, those people are nothing more than murderers who deserve to lie in the gutter.  Those people need to be brought to task.  They are not republicans.  They do not represent the values of the republican leaders who established this State.</P>

	<P>I am asking for a debate on the role of the media and the way in which they cover politics.  While much of Senator Boyle&rsquo;s plight was because of Facebook and Twitter, what happened last night on television was a very poor day for journalism.  Whatever else about us as politicians, we work hard and represent the people.  While we might have a different viewpoint regarding policies and personalities, but we leave that behind us when we go outside the doors of these Houses and we work for the people collectively.  What happened yesterday on television was poor.  I say that as somebody who is very critical of Government policy.  I suggest to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that the Government&rsquo;s policy has failed with 340,000 people unemployed, our banks almost bankrupt and the country almost bankrupt.  That is the fundamental problem.  We need a debate on how we can get out of the situation we are in, why Government has created unemployment and why the country is almost bankrupt.  Part of <Col N="330"/>the blame lies with the policies pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  As Senator Norris said, it is important for us to stand collectively together to defend ourselves.</P>

While I know it is a specific issue, it is one that goes to the heart of how we design our policies.  We have a national policy on social inclusion and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has a policy on social inclusion reflected in its development plans.  When it comes to the reality, the words mean nothing when it comes to the closure of this library, which has 1,300 members and had 22,000 books lent in a single year.  It is a disgrace.

	<P>I ask the Leader to investigate claims made yesterday that, owing to the industrial action taking place in our public services, social welfare offices were closed to people wanting to collect social welfare benefits.  I would like him to tell us the number of offices and the benefits that were affected by that industrial action.  This is an important issue that the House should address.  People are entitled and allowed to make their point, campaign and use the industrial relations tools at their disposal, but they should reflect on the fact that the consequence of such action is that people who do not have jobs suffer as a result of it.  There is a choice facing our society between the protection of jobs and the protection of income but in the choices any of us make, we must keep in mind those people who have been unlucky to lose their jobs through no fault of their own.  I ask the Leader to investigate the number of people affected by this industrial action.  If it turns out to be the case that people were unable to claim their benefits, those responsible might reflect on the consequences of their actions on people who are much less fortunate than themselves.</P>

        <P>Regarding Sallynoggin library, my understanding is that the decision was taken in the context of a new headquarters being opened in D&uacute;n Laoghaire which will be of enormous benefit to the wider community.  It represents a significant investment by both the council and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is part of the development plan for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and is expressed as a strategic objective in that plan, for which I assume Senator Regan&rsquo;s councillor colleagues voted.</P>

	<P>Senators Twomey, O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan, Coghlan, Hanafin, Leyden and Buttimer called for a debate on banking.  As I said on the Order of Business during the week, the Finance Bill will be debated on 24, 25 and 26 March.  We will have an all day and all night Second Stage debate and as I have already indicated, I will allow additional time to ensure everything pertaining to the finance portfolio can be debated on Wednesday, 24 March.  I invite colleagues to take up their various concerns with the Minister for Finance who will be present in the House that day.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey, O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan, Boyle, Mooney, Hanafin, Bradford, Ormonde, Quinn and Callely called for a debate on the pensions report.  That is timely and I have no difficulty in the House having a lengthy debate on that issue.  It is a serious challenge facing the nation and everyone can learn from the sorry experiences they have had in terms of what has happened to pension funds, especially since 2007.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Boyle, O&rsquo;Sullivan, Coghlan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Bradford, Ormonde, Healy Eames and Regan called on the Government to continue its great work on funding of the arts.  It was this Government that appointed a Minister to be in charge of the arts.  A great deal has been done, particularly in all the one-stop-shops throughout the country, whether in Castlepollard or Kilbeggan, where the libraries have increased to three times their size.  We have a beautiful library in Castlepollard comprising 1,500 sq. ft. which has almost 1,700 members.  There is a great deal of good work being done.</P>
        <P>Regarding the experience in Farmleigh, the feedback we got from all the successful, Irish-born people from throughout the world was about the portfolio of arts.  That is the area in which we have achieved the most, whether it be in regard to our entertainers, our musicals, our artists or anyone participating in the film world.  What other country&rsquo;s music is a brand name?  We are the envy of most countries in the world in terms of our success in the arts.  I agree we should have an afternoon debate on arts and arts funding and we can also take up the issue with the Minister for Finance when he is in the House on 24 March.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to the sad passing of Michael Foot.  I join the Senator in his comments on the contribution the late Mr. Foot made to public life in the United Kingdom.</P>

	<P>Legislation must take precedence and next week, as was the case this week, a number of Bills will come to the House. </P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Leyden and Callely referred to the Health Service Executive reports that are pending.  I listened to both sides attentively in that regard and look forward to their publication.  The constitutionality concerns of the HSE must also be taken into account but I know many colleagues in the House wish to have this report brought to our attention and discussed in the House.  As soon as the report is published, I hope to have it for their consideration in the House within a few short weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of Irish foreign affairs policy and our role within the European Union and expressed his concerns in that regard.  I have no difficulty in passing those on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs with a view to seeing how we can progress his proposal.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames called for a debate on literacy and quality in education.  I have no difficulty in allocating time for that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to the good news that 500 new jobs are to be created to work on the gas supply line at Tarbert.  He called on the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to come to the House to discuss the energy hub at Shannon Estuary and everything pertaining to that part of the country.  I will have no difficulty in arranging a debate on the matter in the very near future.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon called for a debate on the green economy.  Such a debate would be timely on one of the central parts of the programme for Government.  I will have no difficulty in arranging a debate on wind power, wave power and every related issue, apart from oil for which we have paid dearly for many years.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn outlined the high container charges and the fact that by 2011 all exports to the United States would have to be scanned.  I will have no difficulty with the issue being discussed at a future date.  The Senator also referred to the successful conference he attended yesterday in which the Taoiseach participated.  Certainly, for most of the self-employed there is no such thing as a retirement age.  I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator.  As 75% of all businesses in Ireland are family run, everyone will have to step into line for them to remain competitive.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for a debate on the issue of competitiveness.  This is the greatest challenge facing the country.  If it is overcome, the country will be well placed to witness an uplift in the economy and a return to buoyancy which we all experienced in the past ten or 12 years.</P>
        <P>Senators McFadden and Dearey mentioned the Gillian Fallon case.  I share their sentiments and will consult the Minister&rsquo;s office after the Order of Business.  I will come back to the two Senators on the case.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill outlined his serious concern about head shops and complimented the Government on banning various substances.  The debate on head shops which commenced in the House last week will be continued next week.  For those colleagues who were disappointed not to have an opportunity to make their contribution the matter is to be discussed in the House again.</P><Col N="334"/>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also mentioned the ongoing activities north of the Border and the young man who had lost his life in Derry.  I will certainly convey his serious concerns to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Those of us who attended the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Cavan last week came away extremely confident, given the close working arrangements and co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Please God, such occurrences will be rare in the future, rather than being the order of the day, as they were in the past 30 years.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called for a debate on the national plan to deal with rare diseases.  I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s strong views on the issue to the Minister for Health and Children.  We can debate it in the House with the Minister present at a future date.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe mentioned social welfare recipients, persons who were unemployed and unable to work.  I will contact the Minister&rsquo;s office about the matter and get back to the Senator in the afternoon.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&lsquo;bioethanol&rsquo; shall only be deemed to constitute a biofuel in the case of ethyl alcohol ex CN (Combined nomenclature) sub-heading Taric code 2207 1000 with an alcohol content of at least 99 per cent volume the properties of which comply at least the requirements set in document EN 15376:2007 or any subsequent revisions to this document by the EU Committee for Standardisation CEN;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a series of related amendments which go right to the heart of the matter on which I have been lobbied effectively by a commercial company.  I think the Minister of State will agree that in the current economic circumstances it is important that we foster and encourage potential indigenous industrial development.  What we are looking for is a level playing field.  It is similar to the position on Brazilian beef.  I happen to love Brazil.  Its people are very charming.  It is a very beautiful place and I have been there on a number of occasions.  Therefore, I am not anti-Brazilian, but we need a level playing field for those involved in our own industry.  We have seen the agitation of farmers on the rules pertaining to beef production.  We face a similar situation where the possible development of an indigenous industry may be stymied by the absence from the Bill of certain measures concerning tariffs which would bring us into line with at least eight other European countries which have introduced similar legislation.  They have provided for such tariffs to create a level playing field.</P>
        <P>Some of the language used is unattractive &mdash; natured and undenatured.  &ldquo;Undenatured&rdquo; is one of the most ugly words I have ever come across, but, regrettably, it appears to be necessary to describe some of the technical processes involved.  Undenatured or naturally produced bioethanol is the equivalent of a kind of poteen; additives are included to dilute it and so on.  It is also sometimes needed for certain chemical processes and so forth.  However, the transport of undenatured ethanol is a standard international practice.  There is nothing against it; it is not dangerous.  Therefore, there is no technical argument against it.  To secure the type of investment required, which is very significant, it is essential that our domestic legislation mirrors the European legislation of which I have spoken.  Sweden applies these tariffs to Brazilian ethanol, as do Belgium, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Austria and Spain.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment and to get involved in direct discussions with the agencies that wish to introduce this type of manufacturing into this country.</P>
        <P>The impact of this would be to secure jobs and to provide for the security of our bio-fuel requirements within the European Union.  At present, we use some of the major oil companies, which bring it in from various countries around the world.  That does not confer any real benefit on the Irish industrial community.  There would also be the development of plant infrastructure, and 4% of our fossil fuel requirements would be replaced by this indigenously produced material, which is very environmentally friendly.  A total of 100,000 tonnes of fuel would be produced as well as 110,000 tonnes of the basic materials for animal feed.  In that regard we currently import soya from various countries, including Brazil.  It will also produce 60,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> gas, which we must import at present through the British Oxygen Company.  The proposed plant would be located in Waterford and would be a major industrial development for the area.  It would help to alleviate the economic distress being experienced in Waterford, <Col N="336"/>particularly in the aftermath of the closure of companies such as Waterford Glass.  That must be a major argument for the Government.</P>
        <P>What is being proposed is the adoption of the quality standard technically known as EN15376 which is also applied to externally sourced ethanol outside the European Union.  The standard represents 99% volume purity, anhydrous &mdash; without water &mdash; and is the recommended standard used by the majority of EU member states to prevent tariff engineering of undenatured ethanol outside the EU or in bonded warehouses.  The difference in both standards, in the main, is the water content of approximately 3%.  The Brazilians would prefer to denature their own ethanol outside EU borders or within bonded warehouses inside the EU.  This essentially means a lower bioethanol production cost per litre while obtaining maximum price within the EU.  In other words, it is a tax dodge.  This benefits the Brazilian domestic industry, without having to maintain EU standards of production.</P>
        <P>We are talking about an improved security of supply and the development, construction and operation of a &euro;100 million bioethanol facility.  This is in addition to the indirect support of approximately 1,000 jobs in the Waterford area, which is an economic blackspot.  It would also create new opportunities for the agriculture sector after the ending of the production of sugar beet.  There is a serious problem in agriculture with the decline in sheep and cattle prices.  This development would have the spin-off effect of producing feed.  There would be a significant tax contribution through PAYE, corporation tax, rates and VAT to the Exchequer while there would be import substitution of 110,000 tonnes of soya animal feed through the utilisation of the distillers dried grains with solubles, DDGS, by-product, a product which is highly sustainable both in terms of environmental performance and greenhouse gas emissions savings.  Furthermore, there is a knock-on effect in Brazil.  Ireland, of course, will be a small player in this and Brazil is an enormous country.  However, everybody is aware of the appalling impact on the rainforest.  Millions of acres are destroyed partly for the production of soya.  The production of bioethanol in Brazil is also having an impact.  There are many environmental and commercial reasons for considering this proposal.</P>
        <P>There appears to be a perception that there are technical problems relating to the importation of undenatured Brazilian ethanol for fuel use.  It must be denatured before it can be transported.  All Brazilian ethanol is produced and exported in an undenatured state.  The denaturant is added within the EU borders, prior to the duty point, depending on the requirements of the individual end users and their national regulations.  It is denatured as a result of European national customs requirements by adding a select number of additives listed in EN15376.  Transport of denatured ethanol is rare and only happens if the end user requires it.  Shipping undenatured ethanol has nothing to do with technical feasibility; it is a standard practice around the globe.</P>
        <P>With regard to the water content in ethanol, EU oil and car companies do not want too much water in the ethanol.  The Brazilians always complain about this and say that the standard is a non-tariff barrier.  However, there has been an international inquiry into this issue and a tripartite committee was established, comprising membership from the United States, Brazil and the European Union.  Last year, the official conclusions were reached and they were unanimous that the water content issue was not a barrier to trade.  The Minister will be able to possess himself of this report.</P>
        <P>There have been doubts about the economic viability of an Irish bio-fuel plant.  There is the issue of economies of scale but this has been well researched and is supported by other major European, particularly German, chemical combines.  The plant size suggested is optimised to match both Irish demand for fuel ethanol and the capacity to produce feedstuff.  As an island, Ireland has a number of competitive advantages over other locations to make the plant viable. <Col N="337"/> I accept that the economic viability of an Irish plant is an issue to concern the promoter.  It is a market risk for the developer, but the developer will take this risk.  I am asking that the Seanad create the market conditions through legislation that will enable these investors and potential Irish industrialists to develop it.</P>
        <P>There are benefits with regard to carbon dioxide as well.  We import all our carbon dioxide through the British Oxygen Company.  I recall seeing its lorries travelling through Dublin transporting cylinders and my cousin was the company&rsquo;s chief engineer at one time.  The fact that we import all this gas makes CO<sub>2</sub> capture at the plant viable and will provide the company with an additional revenue stream.  It currently costs &euro;60 per tonne in transport charges alone to import this gas into Ireland so it will be a significant revenue stream.  The CO<sub>2</sub> capture also greatly enhances the environmental performance of the plant.  One of the other by-products is distillers dried grains with solubles, DDGS.  It is a valuable by-product and is a direct substitute for imported animal feed.  Once again, it would mean the replacement of imported material with Irish-produced material.</P>
        <P>I have absolutely no commercial interest in this proposal.  I merely met the people concerned but I considered the proposal so valuable I put forward these amendments.  Ireland&rsquo;s production costs per tonne are competitive within Europe.  This is partly because we have the highest wheat yields in Europe due to the longer growing period.  There are various other points concerning price and the impact at the fuel pumps which can be dealt with.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In terms of sustainability, the demand for land in Brazil, in particular, has been driven by the increased demand for soya, sugar cane and beef.  It can be expected that an increased demand for bioethanol worldwide to fulfil bio-fuel obligations will automatically create further pressure to convert rainforest to agricultural land.  Saying bioethanol is produced using sustainable methods does not guarantee that the rainforest will not be knocked indirectly by beef farms as a result of an increased demand for sugar cane.  As I said, the scale of destruction is absolutely vast.  Millions of acres have been destroyed.  The demand for bioethanol will increase and the question is where should it be produced.  I made the argument that it should be produced here to generate jobs and very valuable materials.  If the Government decides not to apply the tariff which eight other European countries have successfully applied and in so doing so secured their indigenous industries, it may be unknowingly promoting the destruction of the rainforest by creating increased demand which would be contrary to its intentions.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure a level playing field which would require no investment on the part of the Government.  It would at least open up the possibility of securing the development of a significant industry in what is an economic black spot.</P>
        <P>I ask that Seanad &Eacute;ireann employ all of its forces in requesting the Minister of State to take this matter very seriously, on which I believe I will receive support from other sections of the House.  There would be no cost to the Exchequer.  The Government would simply need to create the market conditions, whereby we could develop a viable, indigenous industry and give employment to our own people during this critical and difficult period.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is the first time we have encountered each other in this role.  We studied history together in UCD and I am delighted to meet him in this context.  </P>
        <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Norris.  As a lover of words, I flatter myself by thinking I am something of a wordsmith on occasion.  I fully share the Senator&rsquo;s view that &ldquo;undenatured&rdquo; is not a very satisfactory word.  It is not good English and we do not like the term.  I also share his sentiments on showing no inherent antipathy towards Brazil or Brazilians.  Unlike him, I have not had the opportunity to visit Brazil.  I am not yet sufficiently resourced <Col N="338"/>to make such a visit.  I have such an affection for my constituency that I do not like to be away from it much.  However, I may travel to Brazil in the future.  I agree with the Senator; none of our amendments is predicated on an anti-Brazilian sentiment.  In many respects, the contrary is the case, when we examine the food supply chain and the cutting down of the rainforest.</P>
        <P>All of my amendments are included in this group and I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, to discuss each of them.  However, I will take guidance from him on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Does the Senator propose to speak to all of his amendments in this group?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  All of my amendments are predicated on issues I raised on Second Stage.  The first was indigenous production of the raw materials required for the production of bio-fuels, the indigenous processing of bio-fuels and, on a national and international level, not allowing the production, use or introduction of quotas of bio-fuels to interfere in an adverse fashion with the food supply or put consumers in a position where they would pay inflated prices for food.  These parameters dictate the amendments I have tabled.  </P>
        <P>Our first and most compelling obligation as legislators is to create conditions to rectify the unemployment crisis.  Those of us who hold advice clinics or meet people on a regular basis are aware of the reality for the large number of young graduates who are unemployed and those who are dislocated from construction and traditional manufacturing industry.  Some 13 people out of every 100 or in excess of 437,000 are unemployed.  That should be the backdrop against which we approach any legislative package of this nature.</P>
        <P>Coupled with this is a crisis in farm incomes.  In 2009 the average farm income was approximately &euro;13,000, a bleak figure.  There is a crisis in commodity prices for farmers, despite the fact that at farm gate level they only receive a percentage of the ultimate price paid by the consumer.  Recent figures support the notion that the numbers employed in Irish agriculture are declining rapidly.  It is against that backdrop that we have to examine the Bill and the amendments tabled.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 4 examines the fact that 99% v/v purity is the recommended standard and used in a majority of European Union member states to prevent tariff engineering of undenatured ethanol outside the European Union or in bonded warehouses within it.  Countries such as Brazil produce ethanol to a standard of 96% v/v, which poses a threat to our domestic production of the raw materials or the indigenous processing industry.  A requirement to meet a figure of 99% v/v would make it difficult for substandard, cheap products to be imported.  Accepting the amendment would lead to the creation of the level playing pitch required.  Brazil would prefer to manufacture outside the borders of the European Union to a lower standard or in bonded warehouses within the Union.  This is something we have to prevent.</P>
        <P>The adoption of the code is important because it levels the playing pitch, from a cost and competitiveness perspective, for ethanol produced in the European Union.  The majority of European Union member states, including Sweden, Belgium, Slovakia, Hungary, Spain and Austria, have adopted the code, as Senator Norris pointed out.  I understand from lobbyists and independent research  that the cost implications in adopting this measure are insignificant.  Senator Phelan has spoken to me about the issue on a number of occasion and will support the amendment.</P>
        <P>Our other amendments would deal more fully with the fact that there is a proposal for the development of a 100,000 tonne bioethanol processing facility in Belview Port, County Kilkenny, which has the potential to create a large number of jobs that are very badly needed <Col N="339"/>in the region.  Senator Phelan will elaborate further on that.  It is very important we support indigenous attempts at processing and job creation and our legislation should be predicated in that way.</P>
        <P>Regarding the CEN standard, part of our country is signed up to European standardisation.  The CEN standard for Europe dictates that we adopt this amendment.  It is proposed that the adoption of the quality standard is applied also to ethanol sourced outside the European Union, which is the fundamental point of this amendment.  I ask for support for it on that basis.  It is a way of protecting indigenous industry and producers.</P>
        <P>Our second amendment proposes that the capacity of domestic producers to supply bio-fuel to meet market demand be part of the criteria used by the Minister as he reviews the bio-fuel content and levels of bio-fuel production and use in our transport system, as proposed in section 3.  It is important that we give specific protection to domestic production and the need for same.  I made the point on Second Stage that recent Teagasc reports established that 100,000 hectares of Irish land are suitable for the production of the primary raw materials for indigenous bio-fuel processing and production.  We have 100,000 acres that can produce the necessary materials without threatening food production in the country.  It is important that we do this from the point of view of job creation, to assist farm incomes that have gone through the floor and for reasons of security of energy supply and sustainability.  For every good objective reason we should protect our domestic industry and my party&rsquo;s second amendment is relevant to achieving that objective.</P>
        <P>Amendment No.12 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) the capacity of domestic producers to supply biofuel to meet market demand&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That should be a criterion and should be part of our statement within the legislation.  It should form part of the ministerial review of the progress of the legislation on an ongoing basis.  It is vital that we defend and support domestic production.  It is worthy of note that 70% of bio-fuels supplied in Ireland to date have been imported.  That is not acceptable.  We need to move from imported to domestically produced bio-fuels.</P>
        <P>It is also worthy of note that implicit in this legislation is a 1 cent per litre increase in the price of transport fuel.  If that were to be the case it would be a tax on work in many rural communities and a disincentive to employment.  It would contribute in its own small way to general inflation in our economy and to our lack of cost competitiveness.  If that were to be the scenario for the best of reasons, such as to cope with the finite supply of fossil fuels and because of our commitment to reducing carbon emissions, then at minimum we should support the domestic indigenous production of both raw materials and processing at local level.  It is not good enough to commit ourselves to an increase in the price of fuel if at the same time we do not actively and aggressively support domestic production.  At least we would offset the disadvantages to our economy by encouraging job creation within the country and supplementing farm incomes.  That is why this amendment should be accepted by the Minister.  It is critical.  The protection of domestic production should not be a matter upon which the House should divide.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 13 has a similar objective, again concerning the protection of domestic production and the insertion of that protection into the legislation.  It notes &ldquo;the various customs and tariff policies and other national policies across the European Union, in place to promote domestic production of biofuels to meet market demand&rdquo; which place an obligation <Col N="340"/>on native governments to support domestic production and processing and job creation at local level.</P>
        <P>We are very happy to support the climate change strategy which involves the reduction of carbon emissions.  We have no difficulty with that.  Regarding imported bio-fuels it is also worth noting that the process of importation and bringing them into the country by shipping in itself creates carbon emissions.  If one imports bio-fuels one defeats the objective of reducing carbon emissions because in the importation process one contributes to carbon emissions.  That is self-defeating and is worthy of note as such.</P>
        <P>Concerning the context of our support for the legislation on the grounds of the reduction of carbon emissions it is equally necessary, in the same context, to support domestic production.  That is how we will reduce transport costs and emissions which will be critical to the success of the legislation.  That is the first issue.  Second, it is important that we do not contribute to a reduction of food supply and an inflation in food prices or, indeed, to the cutting down of the rain forest.  Imposing the 99% requirement of the standardisation imposition in this country will help because cheaper imports will not be allowed to displace what should be domestic production.  The argument in regard to unemployment and farm incomes, on a national level, should compel support for these amendments which can all be reasonably accepted.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State not to make it necessary to put these amendments to a vote.  They will enhance the legislation rather than otherwise and on that basis they should be supported.  It is not in the best interests of people outside this House such as the 437,000 unemployed people across the country, the farmers who have low incomes and those people in counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Waterford who are waiting for the facility to go into production.  They are depending on us to accept reasonable amendments and to make the legislation foolproof in terms of domestic job production, farm incomes and the best climate change strategy due to the cost of the importation of bio-fuels.  Realistically, and we have no illusions to the contrary, even with our amendments and with our Second Stage presentation suggesting caution on progression without domestic production, it will take time to reduce imports.  However, we must begin the process immediately.</P>
        <P>We are very concerned we would put the cart before the horse by adopting legislation and not organising our indigenous production.  As I said on Second Stage, I am very concerned that the existing incentives for our farmers to produce the raw materials for bio-fuels are not sufficient at present and work needs to be done in this regard.  I put this issue to the Minister of State and look forward to a response.  While there have been tax breaks and so on, we also need stronger incentives for the bio-fuels processing plants.  At a minimum by way of incentives for those plants, we need to adopt the standardisation that is implicit in these amendments.  These are vital requirements in the legislation and I am concerned we would allow the Bill to go through without enshrining within it the necessary adjustments to ensure this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My criticism of the legislation, as I outlined on Second Stage, is that it does not set out sufficiently clearly to protect native jobs, native production and support for our farmers, nor does it set out sufficient parameters within it to eliminate the reduction of food supply or the cutting down of rainforests.  I realise there are European norms to which we are signed up but this should be more implicit in our legislation.</P>
        <P>The three amendments we propose are reasonable and I look forward to an initial reply, and, I hope, acceptance.  I will come back to them if necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  He has been here frequently and this Bill is on a particularly important topic.</P><Col N="341"/>
        <P>I concur with much of the argument put forward by Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Reilly with regard to the need for redefinition to change the thrust and, in particular, to promote the development of indigenous industry in this area.  We are using approximately 6 billion litres of hydrocarbon fuels per annum and we have declared we will move to a 4% bio-fuel obligation, which is somewhere in the region of 220 million to 240 million litres per annum.  At present, we are at not much more than 20% production of that target and, therefore, there is considerable scope to expand.</P>
        <P>I live almost as close as Senator John Paul Phelan to Belview Port and I am familiar with the proposals for it.  However, it is not just a matter of that location as we probably need to do more in this regard.  The Senators who spoke identified precisely what needs to be done, namely, to ensure the bioethanol should only be deemed to constitute a bio-fuel in the case of ethyl alcohol with an alcohol content of at least 99% volume, which is was what was put forward in the proposed amendment.  It is also relevant that this applies in many other EU states at present.</P>
        <P>If we fail to do this, we will continue to import from countries a long distance away, such as Brazil.  A number of issues arise in this regard.  We fully subscribed to the climate change agenda in the interest of the global environment as well as the global economy.  Therefore, if we subscribe to that, we must adhere to good practice to ensure it happens.  If we examine the import of any products from such a distance as Brazil, a considerable amount of CO<sub>2</sub> is involved in the transportation.  However, because it is Brazil, there are other concerns with regard to climate change in that area.  As Senator Norris said, the increase we are imposing on the use of the arable land in Brazil for the growth of crops is actually pushing the beef industry further west and into the Amazon, with the deforestation and adverse affects that come from that.</P>
        <P>One of the compelling arguments in this regard at any time but particularly in the current economic downturn, with the huge increase in unemployment, is that we would promote indigenous industry.  Most economists now accept that while we will still require foreign direct investment, it is the growth of indigenous industry that will be the key to overcoming our economic difficulties and reducing unemployment levels to more acceptable and sustainable levels in the future.  Not alone are we talking about the jobs in the production industries involved, but the ancillary services that go with that, not to mention the growth of the crops which will help an agriculture industry which is going through very severe difficulties at present.  I would certainly ask the Minister to consider these amendments favourably with a view to bringing them back on Report Stage, if possible.  We need to be positive in the way we construct our legislation so the climate for economic development and job creation is based on a strong foundation.</P>
        <P>The other point, which has not been raised as yet and which has been put to me by people involved in the recovery of hydrocarbon resources and their use, is that there should be potential within that area for them to play their part in meeting this 4% obligation with regard to bio-fuels.  I am unsure whether the reuse and recycling of this fits the biodegradable definition but the argument on reuse and recycling is one we subscribe to as a country and one in which the State, through its agencies, especially local authorities, has invested a lot of money.  If it can be fitted into the definitions, it is something I would put forward for consideration.</P>

	<P>I will not repeat the points made by other speakers.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Reilly and the strong case they have argued.

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am very disappointed with the attendance in the House today.  This is a classic example of something that is really central to our debates on job creation, on the economy, on climate change and on energy security.  I do not wish to make a personal criticism of anyone but there is a lack of understanding.  It might be preferable to adjourn the debate and ask Members to study this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I can guarantee it will not be reported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as it is crucial.  This happens on a regular basis.  Every agriculture, energy and climate change spokespersons should be in attendance for this debate.  I will not rehearse Senator Norris&rsquo;s points but they reflect my point of view and that of all the speakers so far, including on the Government side.</P>
        <P>This is crucial legislation and these proposals have the support of the whole agricultural community, the IFA and local communities everywhere and also the support of Irish industry.  I can assure the Minister of State they have the support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This is social partnership, a proposal from civic society coming before the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State may decide he will not accept these amendments and nobody will be the wiser because, as Senator Norris said, it will not be given a column inch.  This is a technical issue and nobody will even include the reference in the amendment. We are appealing to the Minister of State to look at this proposal in an open way.  I will remonstrate gently with my colleague and friend, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, as I do not want to misunderstand a point he made.  He made the point about the issue of attracting farmers into this area but that is not the issue we are discussing.  I want that issue kept separate.  We are not talking about incentivisation but rather about a level playing pitch.  We want the Irish farmer to have a level playing pitch with the Brazilian producer.  It took five years to convince the authorities on the question of beef and meat imports from Brazil and let us not go down the same road again.</P>
        <P>We are dealing with very technical issues and we are dependent on the Minister of State to cut through the technicalities and accept that good points have been made by speakers and that some of them may be conceded.</P>

	<P>This is too important.  I am sure none of my colleagues would mind coming back to tease this out further.  If there are flaws in our argument as articulated by Senator Norris, the Minister of State should deal with them one by one.  I know the Minister of State has heard arguments from an other side and they need to be examined.  Apart from the obvious advantages, the Irish plant in Waterford or Kilkenny&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is nearly in Wexford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is down there.  Apart from the main argument, the other argument which needs to be examined includes carbon dioxide capture.  Methane is 25 times stronger and more damaging than carbon dioxide.  This plant can capture the carbon dioxide and it can be reused.  We will save ourselves emissions costs and save ourselves paying for some of the carbon emissions trading units which the Government has had to include in the last two budgets.  The plant also produces a product for livestock which has a ready market in farms all over Ireland.</P><Col N="343"/>
        <P>The other counter-argument is to do with the price of wheat and this argument does not stand up to serious examination.  As it stands, wheat prices would have to become 30%, 40% or 50% more expensive in order to make it unviable for this plant in Belview to deal with Irish-produced wheat.</P>
        <P>Ireland grows winter wheat which is not common in most other European countries.  It grows longer and has a higher level of yield.  These are issues which I ask the Minister of State to consider so he can make our arguments to people who suggest a different argument to him.  It is completely in line with Government policy and ticks the box in terms of energy security, job creation and an immediate improvement in the construction sector.  Crucially, it will also mean that tax will be paid in Ireland.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It will mean increased tax revenue.  We should invite the officials from the Department of Finance to come to the House to applaud us for making this case so they will be on our side and understand our proposal.  This is also a question of sustainable rural development.  If there is any downside to our proposal in terms of Government policy, I cannot find it.  I acted as the Devil&rsquo;s advocate and went through the proposal with a fine-tooth comb and I cannot find the oppositional position on which, if the Minister of State and I were discussing it over a cup of coffee or a pint, would disagree.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly made an important point.  It would be really damaging for the House to divide on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a disgrace and we would be a laughing stock.  If aspects of our amendments need to changed, then they can be changed and if a similar amendment with a slightly different emphasis needed to be tabled, then the Government side should do that.  However, the Minister of State should recognise that the amendment is a serious attempt to improve and extend the legislation.  I can guarantee that by taking these amendments on board, the legislation will leave this House in a far enhanced, more acceptable and more deliverable condition.  We need to look at the arguments being put forward by Brazil in terms of the changes it wants to make and this was dealt with by Senator Norris.  The Brazilian argument is based on one single proposal, that they have to pay less taxation in Europe.  This is their only argument.  An old friend of mine used to say that when he hears people talking about principles, he often feels for his wallet.  Any principle that can be reduced to a quantum of money is one that needs to be taken less seriously than others.  This is about money.  We make no bones about the fact we are talking about money and finance and investment in the Irish economy along with long-term sustainable job creation.  I do not want to hear some of the other stuff.</P>
        <P>The best name for &ldquo;denatured&rdquo; is poit&iacute;n.</P>

	<P>And in the west, the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s own county would be well attuned.  One of the requirements is that it would not be saleable as raw alcohol.  I refer to head shops with denatured methanol or ethanol.  This is the reason petrol or some other additive is added in order to ensure it is not potable.  These are the issues to be considered.  I do not wish to repeat the points made by Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Reilly and by speakers on the Government side.  I do not think I am misrepresenting the Government benches by saying that.  I appreciate <Col N="344"/>the points that have been made by Senator Walsh.  It is important for the Minister of State to bear in mind that arguments can be made and legislation can be changed in the Seanad.  This House is the most appropriate forum for an inherent examination of the issues in a way that is not necessarily based on party policy positions.  The Members of this House put their shoulder to the wheel and move things on together in the interests of the country as a whole.</P>
        <P>This proposal would help to tick the security of supply box and to provide the construction jobs I mentioned.  It would support our agricultural sector, which could do with all sorts of help at the moment.  It would increase tax revenue.  More importantly, it is an environmentally friendly and sustainable industry.  It would help to meet all the demands being made at domestic and EU levels.</P>
        <P>I could speak about this issue for another hour, but all I would be doing is rehearsing or developing the points.  I assume the Minister of State understands these issues.  I am sure he accepts that Senators on all sides of the House have a sense of enthusiasm and commitment in this regard.  It would be very demoralising if the Minister of State were to puncture the great enthusiasm and optimism we have showered on him for the past hour.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister of State can take on board the gist of these amendments.  It may be necessary to redraft the wording of the amendments proposed by Senators O&rsquo;Reilly, Norris and O&rsquo;Toole.  Perhaps a Government amendment can be tabled on Report Stage.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly is quite correct to say there should be no need to have a vote on this issue.  Our sentiments on this section have been expressed by Senators on the Government side of the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris said we have been lobbied in this regard.  Every time Members of the Oireachtas meet their constituents, we are lobbied in some way.  I suggest that the lobbying done in this instance by a group of people in south Kilkenny who want to bring a viable proposal to fruition was correct.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole hit the nail on the head when he said they were looking for a level playing field in which they could compete with those involved in ethanol and bio-fuel production in Brazil.  I take my hat off to the Brazilian authorities for their economic efforts.  The manner in which they have embraced bio-fuel production has had <Col N="345"/>great knock-on effects for that country&rsquo;s economy, although its ecological effects are questionable.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of us not to do as much as we can in this legislation to promote the production of bio-fuel in this jurisdiction.  There is a huge irony in the notion that we import 70% of the bio-fuel that is used in this country.  At a time when we are talking about the protection of the environment and climate change, we are transporting huge volumes of bio-fuel over long distances to this country to be used in our economy.  I am not expressing any anti-Brazilian feeling when I support these amendments and ask the Minister of State to consider them.  As I have said, domestic producers deserve a level playing field.</P>
        <P>I do not think anybody believes the development of a viable bio-fuel sector in this country will be a panacea for the agriculture industry.  The possibility of the development of such an industry provides the potential for a floor in the market of cereal producers whose incomes have suffered substantially over recent years.  Just as live cattle exports provide a floor in the beef market, the bio-fuel sector could provide a similar service for grain producers.  It is particularly important in the aftermath of the sale a couple of weeks ago of Greencore&rsquo;s malting barley section to a British interest.  This development went virtually unheralded in the media.  Although there are a couple of small purchasers and merchants around the country, there are no large-scale malting barley purchasers left in Ireland as a consequence of Greencore&rsquo;s decision.  The facility in question is now owned by overseas parties who might not necessarily have the interests of Irish agriculture at heart.  It is important for the Oireachtas to do what it can in this legislation to put in place some kind of mechanism whereby that facility can be replaced.</P>
        <P>I echo the sentiments of Senator Norris and others who spoke about the need to introduce tariff control.  I understand that more than eight EU countries have imposed the level of tariff we are seeking in these amendments.  Such a tariff has been introduced in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and possibly other EU member states.  It would be appropriate for us to introduce a similar level in this jurisdiction.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole dealt in detail with some of the arguments that have been made against the development of a bio-fuel sector in this country.  I agree with the sentiments he correctly expressed.  There is no need for me to repeat them.</P>
        <P>I feel strongly on this issue because the development of a bio-fuel plant has been proposed in south Kilkenny.  There is a compelling economic argument for such a facility to be developed in my region.  With the exception of Donegal, the south east was the region of Ireland with the highest level of unemployment throughout the Celtic tiger years.  County Wexford, County Kilkenny and parts of County Carlow have traditionally had the highest unemployment levels in the country, when County Donegal is not included.</P>

	<P>Many people do not realise that.  We should grasp any opportunity for job creation in the south east.  It may be necessary for the Minister of State and his officials to redraft the Opposition proposals as set out in these amendments.  I hope that in his response, the Minister of State will say he can accept them now or, as a second resort, in modified form on Report Stage.  I do not think we should miss this opportunity to shape this legislation in a <Col N="346"/>way that would benefit Ireland&rsquo;s employment levels, the Department of Finance&rsquo;s tax revenue capabilities and this county&rsquo;s agriculture industry.  I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to respond to amendments Nos. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 28 and 32 together.  I thank Senators Norris, O&rsquo;Reilly, Walsh, McCarthy, O&rsquo;Toole and John Paul Phelan for contributing to the debate on this matter.  I assure them the Minister is very much on board in relation to the spirit of the proposed amendments.  The national bio-fuel obligation will incentivise the sustainable growth of the indigenous bio-fuel market, support indigenous bio-fuel producers and expand production.  The EU sustainability criteria will also provide a competitive advantage for Irish and other EU producers by ensuring non-EU imports meet strict environmental guidelines.  We must, however, remain compliant with EU and WTO guidelines on trade, meaning we cannot restrict imports unfairly.</P>
        <P>The amendments largely suggest Ireland should mimic the fuel standards in place in other member states, including Germany and France, which serve as an effective barrier to outright competition from imports outside the European Union.  Essentially, there are two separate tariff codes &ndash; one for denatured or industrial and the other for food grade or agricultural.   The latter is significantly higher at 19.2 cents per litre versus 10.2 cents per litre.  Many member states have done this with the explicit aim of protecting domestic production such as in the Germans&rsquo; bio-fuel quota Act and the French legislative equivalent.</P>
        <P>The European Commission would have to be notified under Directive 98/34/EC as this type of initiative would be deemed to be a technical regulation.  From a national perspective, the only substantial problem with the course of action is that the United Kingdom has not adopted such a measure.  Given that we import 60% of our road transport fuel from the United Kingdom, such a measure could have the potential to substantially increase costs to Irish consumers, theoretically, as they would have to be supplied with a different blend of bioethanol.</P>
        <P>The fact this standard is in widespread use across Europe means much of European production capacity is already geared towards producing the same.  The bioethanol in use in Ireland probably already meets this standard.  As such the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is considering this with a view to making an amendment in the D&aacute;il.  We are in the process of notifying the Commission about this change, as required.  This is known as a technical regulation.  Once notification is lodged, we can then make the amendment in the D&aacute;il.  We would prefer to do it on Report Stage in the Seanad but because of the timing factors involved, it will arise on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It is key to ensure the consumer will not be adversely affected by cost increases stemming from any such measure in this area.  The concept of a deferred introduction is one the Minister is considering in that regard.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept the amendments on the grounds that it would be pre-emptive to do so.  I do not propose to accept the amendment to the Title on the grounds that it already deals with this issue in so far it is possible or appropriate to do so.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  The spirit and content of their amendments will be approximated to the Bill when it reaches Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot make amendments on Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is perfectly clear we have won the argument in this House, a fact with which the Minister of State has agreed.  There is universal support for the amendments and I am glad we have had the opportunity to table them.  Will the Minister of State examine as urgently as possible any facility for accepting them in this House rather than in the D&aacute;il, as the arguments for their acceptance was made here?  The Seanad is always attacked for being <Col N="347"/>redundant.  This, however, is a damn good day&rsquo;s work, creating the possibility of 1,000 jobs being created in an economic black spot.  We have met all the scientific, environmental and agricultural arguments.  It is important, therefore, that the amendments are introduced in the Seanad, even if it is by the use of a deferred date.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State knows there have been erred calls for the abolition of this House, yet today there is a scandalous absence of press representation &ndash; I accept <i>The Irish Times</i> is probably watching on the monitor &mdash; for one of the most vital debates in which I have ever taken part, as it secures jobs.  I have received correspondence from people across the country in despair, as they are losing their jobs and houses.  Today the Seanad has done something positive.  We did not call for another head on a plate, blood on the walls or guts on the carpet, which is the routine in Parliament.</P>
        <P>On competition law and tariffs, I have referred to the unanimous report from the United States, Brazil and the European Union which answered that argument.  Since eight countries &ndash; Senator John Paul Phelan has suggested there are more &mdash; have introduced tariffs, I do not see any reason we should kowtow to the British.  We should get on with it and have the amendments accepted in this House.  Will the Minister of State give the Official Report of the Committee Stage proceedings to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to highlight the unanimous approval for the amendments and inquire as to why it is not possible to have them passed in Seanad &Eacute;ireann?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The reasons behind my tabling these amendments were based on dealing with the jobs crisis by creating jobs at bio-fuel producer and post-producer level and achieving a reduction in carbon emissions to keep in line with our Kyoto Protocol and EU requirements.  We won the arguments and the Minister of State has accepted them.  However, it is disappointing that he cannot accept the amendments.  I am sure the ordering of business in the House could facilitate the Government in sponsoring the amendments and tabling them on Report Stage in the Seanad.  Why must it wait until Report Stage in the D&aacute;il?</P>
        <P>It is vital this legislation contains a specific commitment to job creation.  I agree with colleagues that it is a disgrace there are no members of the media present for this debate which is of such critical importance that the young unemployed people need to hear it on radio and television.  People outside the House will wonder to what degree our deliberations contribute to job creation.  They are not interested in grandstanding or rhetoric; they want practical steps to job creation.</P>
        <P>The amendments only aim to create nothing but a level playing pitch by protecting the indigenous bio-fuel industry.  In doing so we would be sustaining and creating new jobs.  There can be no higher objective for this legislative assembly when 437,000 citizens are without work.  That is why I am asking that the amendments be accepted on Report Stage in the Seanad.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The United Kingdom imports 89% of its bio-fuel, a figure it will want to correct.  Any bilateral agreement should achieve this.  It cannot be repeated often enough that by virtue of importing bio-fuels, the Minister is creating more carbon emissions and failing to resolve the international problem as attempted by this legislation.  It is self-destructive.  It is bizarre and crazy that the Minister is attempting to reduce carbon emissions through this 4% obligation.  In the structuring of the obligation in this legislation, the Minister continues to acquiesce to bio-fuels being imported from Brazil and elsewhere to Ireland, which will obviously generate carbon emissions.  This defeats the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and the objectives of the Copenhagen agreement when transferred into legislative format.  It also defeats domestic commitments.  Without attempting to be unnecessarily partisan, it is bizarre that such a proposal comes from a Green Party Minister.</P></Speaker><Col N="348"/>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to be back in the House on the subject of the tourism industry.  I welcome Senator Mooney back to the House.  It is my first opportunity to liaise with him directly since his return.  I am participating in this debate on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, and I am sure Members join me in wishing him a speedy recovery from his current bout of illness.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House today on the subject of the tourism industry.  The House has proved a very useful forum for exchanging views and exploring important issues relating to the tourism industry and I look forward to our discussions.</P>
        <P>The tourism industry makes a vital contribution to employment, economic activity and exports.  It also contributes by encouraging social inclusion and access to labour markets.  With the support of the Government, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the tourism agencies, the tourism and hospitality sector can overcome the current challenges and make a major contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s economic renewal.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the tourism and hospitality sector provided up to 200,000 jobs, helped to generate &euro;4 billion in foreign revenue earnings and generated in the order of &euro;1.2 billion in tax earnings.  While 2009 proved to be an exceptionally challenging year, tourism is a very resilient industry and has proven its ability to bounce back faster than other sectors after a downturn.  Tourism is recognised as a vital, export-oriented service industry in the Government&rsquo;s framework for economic renewal, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy.  In further recognition of its important contribution to the economy, tourism was also among the areas focused on during the Global Irish Economic Forum in September 2009 and was the subject of some imaginative and challenging suggestions from the forum.</P>
        <P>One of the strengths of Irish tourism has been the robust policy framework developed for the sector since 2003 when the New Horizons report of the tourism review group was published.  This included clearly defined implementation arrangements through the State tourism agencies and a strong partnership approach with the industry.  In December 2008, to ensure the strategic framework for tourism development was able to respond to the rapidly changing economic and social environment, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, established the tourism renewal group.  The Minister asked it to review and, where appropriate, renew the existing tourism strategy contained in the New Horizons document.</P>
        <P>The tourism renewal group conducted a detailed and inclusive examination of the tourism sector nationally and internationally, the existing strategic framework and key tourism related issues.  The group analysed the implications of its findings and agreed on key actions required to support the tourism industry and help it survive, recover and grow.  The resulting report of the tourism renewal group, launched last October, set out the tourism industry&rsquo;s contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development and its prospects in a changed world, as well as a framework for action for the tourism industry&rsquo;s survival, recovery and growth in the period to 2013.  The report proposes five survival actions to minimise the impact of current challenges and nine recovery actions to set the tourism industry back on a growth path as the world economy recovers.  All of these actions are being vigorously pursued by the Minister, his Department and the relevant agencies in co-operation, where relevant, with other Departments and bodies, with a particular focus initially on the survival actions.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism <Col N="349"/>Ireland have built in the relevant renewal group recommendations to their business and marketing plans for 2010.  The Department is also working with a range of other organisations to develop opportunities to focus resources, achieve common objectives and maximise the impact on the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>Building on the framework for action, the 2010 budget recognised the tourism and hospitality sector as a critical, labour-intensive sector and incorporated a range of measures to renew Irish tourism.  The overall tourism services budget was increased by 2% to more than &euro;150 million, including the maintenance in real terms of funding for the tourism marketing fund as recommended by the renewal group and a trebling of the funds for tourism product development.</P>
        <P>We have been experiencing the impact of an international recession of unsurpassed severity.  Every major economy, including our key source tourism markets, is suffering.  In our own case, the situation has been exacerbated by unhelpful exchange rate movements and the challenges in our domestic economy.  Tourism worldwide saw a significant downturn in the second half of 2008, which continued into 2009, due to the global economic slowdown and loss of consumer confidence.  There were just under 7 million overseas visitors to Ireland during the year.  This figure represented a drop of 11.6% compared with 2008.  Outbound trips from Britain were particularly affected, with the euro-sterling exchange rate making it extremely challenging to attract visitors to Ireland and eurozone destinations generally.</P>
        <P>In common with many other businesses in Ireland, tourism businesses are experiencing difficulties with regard to capacity, costs and credit supply.  These difficulties are exacerbated by lower visitor numbers.  Some of these problems must be addressed by the tourism industry.  Others are being addressed generally by the Government, for example, through NAMA and the issue of supply of credit to businesses generally.  The Government will continue to work with the industry to help the sector manage its way through these difficulties by stimulating demand, helping to address costs or securing access to credit.</P>
        <P>Tackling the excess capacity that undoubtedly exists in the hotel sector is complex and, ideally, requires a market response over time.  This year is likely to be another tough year in the hotel sector, with further adjustments taking place as the market responds to excess room supply.  This process will gain further momentum in the coming months as more banks seek to clean their balance sheets and dispose of underperforming loans.  These market-led adjustments are necessary to restore some level of equilibrium to the hotel market.</P>
        <P>Credit availability also remains a real difficulty across the economy, including for the hotel sector.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for NAMA is centred on the goal of restoring a stable and functioning banking system.  As part of this process we are establishing a credit appeals system that will allow small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, including from the tourism industry, to appeal when a credit application has been refused.  This will provide a valuable independent recourse for businesses in their dealings with banks.</P>
        <P>Regarding concerns about costs such as labour, local authority rates and energy, the Government is taking initiatives to help the process by, for example, securing a reduction in energy prices last year.  The fact that consumer prices in Ireland have now fallen back to 2006 levels shows we are responding flexibly to the crisis.  This has been recognised by the European Commission and international markets, helping to restore confidence in the Irish economy.  I must acknowledge the tourism industry has made great strides to reduce costs and increase productivity over the past year or two.  These are certainly difficult changes but if we get our costs right while also using the crisis to restructure and reinvent ourselves, we will return to a sustainable growth path.</P>
        <P>With regard to Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete in the international arena in the future, maintaining and enhancing competitiveness is a major issue for the tourism industry as it is for the <Col N="350"/>economy as a whole.  In addressing that issue, it is important to bear in mind that competitiveness is about more than price and costs.  The tourism agencies continue to monitor Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness as a tourism destination and the Minister is encouraging them to assist the industry in responding to changing conditions as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Although there is little doubt that 2010 will be another challenging year for tourism, it is nonetheless important to remember that, despite the downturn, millions of people across the world will still take holidays this year.  The industry and the tourism agencies are fighting hard for every bit of this business.  Tourism Ireland has set an ambitious growth target of 3% for overseas visitor numbers and revenues this year, despite international experts predicting a 2% contraction.  However, a number of eurozone economies are coming out of recession and these are important source markets for Irish tourism.  Tourism Ireland will focus on major markets that are likely to deliver immediate returns this year, including Great Britain, Germany and the US, as research has shown these markets as our best prospects.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland is the North-South body responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday destination.  The objectives of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing strategy are to convince overseas consumers that now is the best time ever to visit, to show them the tremendous value available from industry partners and to demonstrate how easy it is to get here by air and sea.  Ireland must be positioned to take advantage of opportunities that will arise as the global economy stabilises.  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s commitment is to market through the challenges, work closely with industry partners and fight for every bit of business that is out there to be won.  I have just returned from a joint Tourism Ireland and tourism industry mission in the US and I was struck by the commitment of the Tourism Ireland team and the industry professionals who joined us.  It is evident that the American market is showing slow but clear signs of recovery and we are well positioned to capitalise.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland is engaged in a huge tactical marketing programme across all major markets, communicating strong reasons to visit together with clear, price-led messages.  Specifically, it is investing &euro;26 million in a marketing drive in the first half of the year, including the biggest ever promotional programme of activities to showcase Ireland during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.  Agreement has been secured to &ldquo;green&rdquo; iconic buildings and attractions like the London Eye, the CN Tower in Toronto, the Sydney Opera house and others.</P>
        <P>On the domestic front, as we await a boost from overseas visitors, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has launched a brand new advertising campaign to promote holidaying at home this year with a budget of &euro;4 million.  The new campaign is rooted in extensive consumer research and consultation with the tourism industry and is being broadcast publicly.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also boosting its promotion of business tourism and the opening in September of the new national conference centre in Dublin, to be known as the Convention Centre Dublin, will further enhance our capacity to attract international events.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance announced, in his budget speech, that larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had agreed to participate in a new scheme to be developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, aimed at offering discounted travel to senior citizens visiting Ireland from abroad.  The scheme owes its genesis to suggestions from Members of this House.  I am pleased to report that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has made significant progress in developing such a scheme, in consultation with larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Tourism Ireland.  Our intention is to launch the initiative to coincide with the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival and with Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s major promotions across the world, especially in Great Britain.  Furthermore, I understand that the parties are working with the aim of producing an exceptionally attractive unrestricted offer, which could be used widely across the rail network and would be simple to understand and which will be free to the qualifying customer.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P>The quality and value of the tourism product has improved dramatically over the past few years.  Accommodation quality, particularly in the case of hotels, is among the highest in Europe.  There are many more attractions to see and activities to partake in and we have managed to maintain and build on our natural assets and resources.  Visitors constantly express satisfaction rates of more than 90% for their stay here.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is investing more than &euro;20 million under its capital investment programme to improve and broaden the appeal of Ireland&rsquo;s portfolio of tourist attractions, activities and tourism-related infrastructure.  Investment in business, sporting and cultural events will also be increased, as all offer good prospects for tourism growth in 2010.</P>
        <P>Tourism enterprises are very concerned about the recession, weakened consumer demand, energy and labour costs and local authority charges, as well as access to credit, the regulatory framework and labour regulation.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working closely with tourism businesses all over Ireland, supporting enterprises and helping them to achieve real cost savings and efficiencies.  Business supports are aimed at assisting key tourism businesses to increase their international customer base, better manage their cost base, improve overall performance and marketing, particularly on the web, and sustain employment levels.  I acknowledge the great work of the Irish Hotels Federation in helping us to address these issues and, in particular, John Power, the chief executive, who has announced his intention to retire this summer.  I thank him for his work and wish him well in his new life.</P>

	<P>During 2009, F&aacute;ilte Ireland provided a range of training and business supports directly to almost 3,000 individual tourism businesses and, in 2010, it will invest more than &euro;11 million in direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.</P>
        <P>I thank the House again for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am pleased the House continues to take an active interest in tourism, perhaps our longest-standing and most important internationally-traded service industry.  We all recognise that these are extraordinarily challenging and difficult times for every economic sector and tourism is not immune.  However, drawing on the report of the tourism renewal group and with the correct foundations, including a robust and recently renewed strategic and policy framework, strong partnership between the public and private sectors, effective State agencies, appropriate investment in marketing and product and tourism enterprises which are now on a par with those anywhere in the world in terms of management capacity and quality, I am confident our industry will rise to this challenge and that it can position itself to come out of this downturn even stronger than before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I apologise that I missed the beginning of his contribution as business moved on promptly and I had been expecting a division on the previous business.  We can be misled on occasion.  I am sure the Minister of State made remarks about the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen.  I wish him well and I hope he recovers quickly from his back complaint and gets out of hospital.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his overview and I agree with much of it, although I would like other initiatives to be put in place.  He referred to the supply of credit to businesses generally, which is a difficult issue.  It very much affects the hotel sector and we all hope a stable and properly functioning banking system will re-emerge quickly because it is currently absent.  The supply of credit to the tourism industry is proving difficult.  Those involved urgently need credit as part of their working capital as the tourism season approaches.</P>
        <P>I was taken by the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on showcasing Ireland and the plans for celebrating St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day abroad.  I welcome the greening of iconic buildings.  This will be <Col N="352"/>beneficial and it will amount to free advertising.  It would be expensive if we had to pay for it.  I am glad the Minister of State acknowledged the role of Members regarding the discounted travel scheme for foreign senior citizens visiting Ireland.  We mentioned this more than a year ago and I am delighted it is coming to fruition.  Retirees have more time to travel and, hopefully, they have pensions.  The more we can do to encourage them to visit Ireland and spend their dollars and sterling, the better.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing that we have lost so much of the British market.  I have experienced this where I come from but this is affecting the entire country.  One of the problems for the regions is that more people who travel to Ireland want to visit the capital city.  Throughout the world, people are visiting capital cities more frequently and they are forsaking sun holidays.  We have to sell our greenery.  We have suffered in the south west and throughout the regions because of the concentration on Dublin and we have to try to redress the imbalance with a marketing initiative.  At its peak the economic value of the tourism industry was &euro;6.5 billion with 300,000 people employed in 2007.  These numbers, as we know, are falling dramatically.  Tourism revenue fell by &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;5.2 billion, its lowest level since 2004.  Overseas visitor numbers fell by almost 1 million compared with 2008.  Our largest tourism market, the United Kingdom, declined by 16%.  In his response the Minister of State might outline whether there are plans to redress that by way of a major marketing drive throughout Britain.  It is our nearest neighbour and the cost of travel is now competitive.  I am sorry to see the decline of the ferry companies across the Irish Sea.  I am very concerned as are others on both sides of the House that we should get the Cork to Swansea ferry back in place.</P>
        <P>We have a sad situation in the hotel sector, some of which was driven by the tax-incentive schemes.  At the annual conference of the Irish Hotels Federation in Galway this week, economist Peter Bacon said that failure to foreclose on insolvent hotels is damaging to the long-term interests of the tourism and hotel sectors and is undermining fundamentally sound businesses.  I would not like to think we can bring it down all of a sudden.  We need to be rational and anything that is going to happen should happen in an orderly fashion.  An Irish Hotels Federation survey carried out in February revealed that 70% of hotels and guesthouses have experienced unfair competition from otherwise unviable hotels being supported by banks.  In addition, some 88% of those surveyed said they are highly concerned about the viability of their businesses for 2010.</P>
        <P>The Peter Bacon report carried out on the sector last year suggests a quarter of hotels need to be closed urgently because the sector is insolvent.  He suggested the orderly elimination of 15,000 hotel rooms should begin before this year&rsquo;s peak season.  I again stress this needs to be done in an orderly fashion.  He pointed to that banks which had financed the loans are not foreclosing on the developers&rsquo; loans to avoid a negative impact on their balance sheets.  We obviously need a bit of a break on that also.  He indicated hotels are experiencing occupancy rates as low as 50% to 55%.  Encouraged by Government-sponsored tax breaks, the number of registered hotels in Ireland rose by 20% to 868 between 1996 and 2006.  We have a significant oversupply and I am sure this also affects the Minister of State&rsquo;s part of the world.  A total of 26,802 new hotel rooms were opened in Ireland between 1999 and 2008.  It is estimated the sector owes &euro;15,000 in debt for every hotel room and only 5% of hotels are currently running a profit as can be seen from the deals that are on offer.  In order to stay in business they are being forced to run at that level.</P>
        <P>I hope F&aacute;ilte Ireland will fund a significant home holiday campaign.  The more we can get our own people to holiday in Ireland the better.  We all know there are so many beautiful parts of the country which we would like to reach.  We need to do more in that regard.</P><Col N="353"/>
        <P>Access to Ireland has become worryingly restricted with the ongoing removal of routes and restrictions in airline capacity at both Shannon and Dublin airports.  This in turn has led to significant job losses.  However, we need to tackle the departure tax, which has exacerbated the situation greatly.  Aer Lingus has stated the tax will cost the company &euro;30 million this year and Ryanair has announced reduced routes and lower capacity, which is also nailing us.  The Dublin Airport Authority&rsquo;s credit rating was downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, which cited the departure tax as something that would accentuate the falling numbers of airport users.  This is a particularly worrying time for the capital&rsquo;s airport as it tries to sell commercial space in its new terminal against a background of fewer customers and it faces further loss of revenue from its hangar space due to the departure of SR Technics.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s own advisers, the tourism renewal group, have called for the abolition of the departure tax as a survival action for the industry but this has fallen on deaf ears.  Other European countries with similar taxes in place have moved to remove barriers to access to stimulate tourism.  We urgently need to do more in that regard.</P>
        <P>In my part of the world I receive many complaints about local authority charges on the hotel industry.  The Government needs to freeze these charges and reduce energy costs.  They are regarded as an unfair and unjust burden.  Not alone are hotels failing to pay this year&rsquo;s but many of them have not been able to pay last year&rsquo;s and in some cases the previous year&rsquo;s.  I understand a re-evaluation has taken place in South Dublin and Fingal county councils, which is much fairer for those involved in tourism in this part of the world.  However, what about the rest of the country?  How many years will it take?</P>
        <P>I wish to stress the importance of the value of cultural tourism.  As the Leader will tell the Minister of State, on the Order of Business this morning we voiced concern about the value of the arts, museums etc.  The Minister of State and I had a word on the margins about a man in his part of the world who misunderstands the situation.  The Irish Museums Association held its annual conference in Killarney last weekend.  These institutions are doing a great deal not just as a store of knowledge, but also in what they put on display and tell us about ourselves through their artefacts.  I believe the Minister of State understands the point I am making and the value of these institutions.  The agencies of the State need to be more co-operative with local interests.  We do not want civil servants fighting needless turf wars when we can jointly market things successfully.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  I thank him for his very gracious comments about my re-election.  The Government Whip made the comment that the last time the two of us were in the House together was on the last sitting day before the 2007 Seanad election.  He suggested I should start my contribution by saying &ldquo;Before I was interrupted&rdquo;.  I echo the comments made by the Minister of State and Senator Coghlan about the Minister, Deputy Cullen.  I am sure the House collectively would wish the Minister a very speedy and full recovery from his debilitating illness.</P>

	<P>Colleagues are undoubtedly aware that just yesterday the popular international travel guide, <i>Lonely Planet</i>, ranked Ireland in the world&rsquo;s top ten friendliest countries.  The guide book has published a list of ten countries where a warm welcome is guaranteed.  It highlights that Ireland&rsquo;s brand as a tourist destination remains strong internationally despite the economic downturn.  As we approach St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, Ireland is offered an unrivalled opportunity to highlight and promote ourselves internationally as a destination.  I received criticism from certain quarters at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs when I drew attention to the valuable <Col N="354"/>role played by Ministers travelling abroad for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  In his contribution the Minister of State referred to having returned from such an exercise in Canada.</P>

	<P>I fully support the right of a free media in a democracy to report and to bring the Government and its Ministers to account where the spending of public money is involved.  I was misinterpreted in the suggestion I made which I will make again.  We have heard the Minister of State outline the proposals to try to get more people to come to this country and to improve the tourist product, particularly this year.  I drew attention to the fact that each year only five or six Ministers travelled to targeted markets around the world and that a cynical view was taken of Ministers who travelled abroad to represent Ireland at this particular time of the year.  I will repeat the request I made.  The media should report on these trips, illustrate how much they cost, indicate how long Ministers go for and go into all the detail of what they do when abroad.  I support all of this.  If they were to do this, they would find out, as I have discovered in talking to members of the Irish Diaspora in Australia, America, Canada and elsewhere in Europe, including Britain, that these visits are gruelling in their intensity but that what is important &mdash; Ministers do not complain about this &mdash; is that Ministers are on the top of a pyramid which involves the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland, local Diaspora organisations and the business communities in the cities and countries they visit in ensuring that not only are important business connections made but also that their presence attracts the business community to come out.  Ministers are at the top of that important pyramid.  That is what Tourism Ireland is attempting to do.  </P>
        <P>I make these remarks in the context of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s presentation to the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport and Tourism in which it outlined what the Minister of State has outlined here, namely, the significant marketing campaign in which it is getting involved.  In fact, it is gearing up to engage in one of the most sustained and focused marketing campaigns ever conducted.  Some &euro;26 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money will be spent worldwide in an effort to increase visitor numbers to Ireland.  There will be a particular emphasis on the UK market, including on the use of the flash mob concept at eight major railway stations across the country.  Each morning and evening during the week in which St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day falls Irish traditional musicians and Tourism Ireland personnel will descend on the travelling public to provide uniquely Irish entertainment and engage with passengers on the attractions of taking a holiday in Ireland.  I applaud such inventive and creative thinking by Tourism Ireland to get people focused, particularly in our nearest and largest market in the United Kingdom.  The Irish Diaspora will be utilised in cities and towns across the country in which St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day activities will be held to highlight the value and enjoyment to be had from a holiday in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Of particular significance is the announcement made by the Taoiseach, reiterated by the Minister of State, that agreement has been reached between Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the Government to participate in a new scheme to offer free travel to senior citizens visiting Ireland from abroad.  I express my appreciation of the tourism industry for undertaking this initiative with the Government and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I commend the extraordinary pioneering work done by the Irish Diaspora, particularly in the United Kingdom, through the Federation of Irish Societies and many other Irish Diaspora societies which for many years lobbied successive Governments to introduce free travel for senior citizens, former emigrants, who settled in the United Kingdom and wish to return to Ireland as an incentive and a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for the contribution <Col N="355"/>they made through emigrant remittances at a time when the country badly needed them.  In that context, even though we are talking about the narrow concept of tourism, there is wider symbolic recognition of this initiative.  I applaud the Government for introducing it.</P>
        <P>I add a caveat, however.  I hope, once the concept is up and running &mdash; I understand the scheme will be initiated in the week on which St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day falls; I am sure the Minister of State will have further details on its introduction &mdash; it will be extended to include bus travel.  Until recently I was chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland North West.  Of the five regions, it is the one that needs the most visitors because it attracts the least number of international visitors.  Of the five counties in that region &mdash; Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan &mdash; there is only a rail service to counties Leitrim and Sligo.  There is no rail service or network in County Donegal, the jewel in the crown and the heart beat of the tourist economy in the north west.  It relies on tourism to an extraordinary degree to boost the local economy.  Notwithstanding the importance of counties Cavan and Monaghan which offer their own unique tourism product, they will not benefit from the scheme because there is no rail service in either county.  It seems that, when one looks at the map, it will be the areas with the largest concentrations that will benefit.  I do not for one moment take away from County Kerry and the fact that it is a peripheral region&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I will give Members an idea of what we are up against.  In that regard, I am grateful to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for providing information I requested on what other countries were doing, which will give some indication of the opposition we face and the competitive nature of the tourism business.</P>
        <P>Regarding taxation measures and other financial incentives in countries from which we hope to gain visitors, France, for example, has reduced the rate of VAT to 5.5% on restaurant meal items, matching its long-standing hotel VAT rate implemented in July last year.  Scotland is providing funding to support the owners of castles, tower homes and other relevant historic buildings to refurbish their premises.  The Government in Thailand is promoting domestic tourism and offering rock-bottom discounts to Thai residents. Canadians are being encouraged to spend their travel dollars at home through a national advertising programme to boost domestic tourism.  In Spain, India has been identified as one of the fastest growing outbound tourism markets and the Spanish Government is working to promote Spain and increase tourist numbers from India.  The Scottish Government has also decided that it, too, will begin to target that market.  I put these forward in the context of the promotional element involved.  The VAT rate being suggested is of particular importance.</P>
        <P>I suggest the departure tax, on which the tourism renewal group set up last year by the Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, has an opinion, as does the industry, should be revisited and perhaps reduced for journeys to United Kingdom airports, considering the main focus of the marketing campaign will be on the UK market in the coming year.</P><Col N="356"/>
        <P>Car rental numbers are down.  I believe this will create a difficulty for the tourism industry later this year.  I, therefore, suggest some initiative is required to boost availability in the car rental industry.</P>
        <P>I support the views expressed by some of my colleagues about local authority charges, as they are impacting on the hotel sector.  I strongly suggest there should be a revaluation of hotel property.  If we could do this through NAMA and do it quickly, I see no reason there should not be an incentive, with Government support, to have a revaluation to bring it to more realistic levels and help to reduce costs.</P>
        <P>There is so much more about which one can talk in the tourism sector but I applaud Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland which are spending &euro;4 million to boost the domestic market.  I wish them success.  This will be a good year for tourism.  Of those involved in the tourism industry who were asked how they saw the outturn in tourism this year, 63% expressed a positive, up-beat, confident view that there would be a turnaround and that this would be a better year for tourism.  I believe that will be the case because it is our most important indigenous industry, as the construction and agriculture industries are in recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I have been in his part of the world a lot recently and it is impressive.  I was very impressed by the figures he outlined to the House, particularly the figure of 200,000 jobs dependent on the tourism industry.  If the level of expenditure is &euro;4 billion, it suggests 11% of the people are employed in the industry.  I will not go through the figures he mentioned but I was pleased to hear about the discounted rail travel aspect.</P>
        <P>I was chairman of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s festival committee for a number of years.  I note that Tourism Ireland is to invest &euro;26 million in the first half of the year.  A person from Japan said to me that if they had a brand like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, they would use it effectively.  The person concerned was criticising the way in which we had used it.  I agree with Senator Mooney in what he said about using the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festivities for various purposes.</P>
        <P>I grew up in the hotel business or, better still, the holiday camp business.  My father ran Red Island Holiday Camp in Sherries, County Dublin, which he built just after the end of the Second World War.  It had 250 bedrooms and catered for 500 guests.  There was one important message I learned from that business.  The camp was run by my father on the basis that practically all of the guests would come from the north of England from places such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham who would travel by boat or aeroplane and pay on the day of arrival.  Everything was included in holiday price.  It was a very interesting way to do business.  My father&rsquo;s view was that one should not bring any spare money.  I call it the Boomerang principle whereby everything one does is aimed at getting the customer to come back.  The objective was not to get as much money as possible from the customer because if one sought to do this, one would be in breach of the contract made with the customer whereby travel, accommodation, food and entertainment was included.  In later years I have been on holiday with our children to Club Med where the same principle applies &mdash; everything is included, including wine.  One does not spend money on anything other than spirits.  The reason I mention this is that I believe the answer is in our own hands.  It is up to hoteliers and everybody involved in the tourism business to recognise that if we succeed, it will be because people will come and enjoy their visit and want to come back again.  That lies in our own hands and we can do it in so many ways.</P>
        <P>I was speaking the other day to a person who had tried to book into Kelly&rsquo;s Hotel in Rosslare but it was booked out, even at this time of year.  The hotel has a history of doing things well and I am sure there are others like it.  It caters for families, those interested in good food and <Col N="357"/>golfers and appears to do everything well.  I take it as an example.  When I visited another part of Ireland, I could not get over the bad service offered.  In one hotel, as I was checking in, a person asked the receptionist, &ldquo;Is that a VIP?&rdquo;  She replied, &ldquo;No, it is not.&rdquo;  In other words, I would not receive the level of attention that would be given.  I was very disappointed.  I walked into another establishment and the owner and an assistant were talking to each other.  There were a number of tourists present.  As we walked between them, they never even noticed us.  There was no eye contact and no link.  How could they hope to get people to come back?</P>
        <P>Some years ago I spoke at a conference in America.  After my wife and I had pulled up at the hotel in southern California, the commissioner opened the door and said: &ldquo;Mr. Quinn, you are very welcome.&rdquo;  I was very impressed.  As we chatted, he asked if I had been to the hotel before and I replied that I had not.  He said he would look after my bags and told me to proceed to the reception desk.  He asked if I had come a long way.  I said I had come from Ireland and he asked how long it had taken me to get there.  I said it had taken ten or 12 hours.  As I approached the reception desk, the receptionist looked up and asked: &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Quinn?  You are very welcome.  You must be exhausted.  You have come all the way from Dublin which is about ten or 12 hours away.&rdquo;  I was so impressed that I went down the following day to watch as the next guests arrived.  As the taxi pulled up, the boot opened, the doorman ran behind, saw the name on the case and asked: &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Buckley?  You are very welcome.  You have been with us before.&rdquo;  He said he had been there the previous year and had played a great round of golf, better than he had had ever played before but which he would beat this time.  The doorman said, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Buckley, you know the way; head over to the reception desk.&rdquo;  Mr. Buckley headed over and received the same welcome I had received.  The receptionist said: &ldquo;How are you Mr. Buckley?  You are welcome back.  You are the guy who shot 72 last year.&rdquo;  He was very pleased.  I was watching the doorman who had a microphone in the lapel of his jacket and was whispering into it.  I mention this because they went to some pains to make sure they got it right.  These are the things we can do.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have another story about a hotel in America at which we arrived a number of years ago.  I was very impressed when the man who was clipping the hedge said, &ldquo;Hi, you are very welcome.&rdquo;  We went to our room and my wife and I decided to eat in the hotel that night.  I said the Americans were great, they called a person by name.  We have always had a difficulty in getting people to do this.  I telephoned the restaurant to book a table.  I was asked, &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Quinn?  You are very welcome.&rdquo;  The person concerned could see on the telephone who was ringing and said, &ldquo;This is Elaine; what can I do for you?&rdquo;  We booked a table for two at 7.30 p.m. in the non-smoking section and I thanked her.  She then asked where I was from.  I told her I was from Ireland.  She said she knew this and that she was from Ratoath.  There were four young Irish people working there.  I remember going into one of the little boutiques in the hotel.  The assistant was bending down behind the counter and did not see us come in.  When he saw us, he suddenly looked up and said he was very sorry, that he had not greeted us.  I spoke to the four Irish youngsters of 19 and 20 years of age who had jobs in the hotel.  They told me they had received 45 minutes' training.  They were told to always call customers by name, always introduce themselves and never to allow a customer to come into one&rsquo;s shop without greeting them.  These are the things they were doing in that hotel in America because they were the right things to do.  The reason I tell these stories is that I believe they play a huge part.  In other words, let us not look to the Government, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to do everything.  There are some things we can do ourselves.</P>
        <P>Last year Senator Mary White complained that there were very strict restrictions in place for those over 70 years of age in car rental.  I have rented cars in the United States and not <Col N="358"/>experienced this.  The conference I mentioned on the Order of Business that I attended yesterday was entitled, Turning Silver into Gold.  It was about people with silver hair and business opportunities.  One of the participants said that retired did not really want stuff &mdash; that was the word used &mdash; that they did not want more things, that what they wanted were experiences.  This is the opportunity for us in Ireland to do things.  We could do much in eco-tourism, protecting the environment and so on.</P>
        <P>Let me speak about something the Government can do.  Strict visa requirements for visitors from certain countries are causing major problems for the tourism industry.  Mr. Gerry Mullins, chief executive of the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, has said that while the conditions are not new, things have changed and that newly wealthy visitors from China, India and Russia, also mentioned by Senator Mooney, are being refused entry because of a strange and stupid system.  The documentation needed by a person from China applying for an Irish holiday visa includes bank statements for six months and a letter from their host in Ireland stating he or she will support the person concerned during the visit.  We are supposed to welcome them.  I have visited the three countries mentioned in recent years and there is a degree of wealth in them.  The people concerned want new experiences and are happy to come here.  Chinese tourists are very well off and travelling in their millions.  This is a sector in which there will be a major increase.  Why is the Government continuing with outdated visa restrictions?  In a stroke, by relaxing the conditions, we could create thousands of jobs.  There was story in <i>The Irish Time</i>s  about an agent in Indonesia who had said he could sell 1,000 coach tours to Ireland this year with 40 people on each if Ireland was not so difficult to get into.  We need change.  This is an issue about which we could do something.</P>
        <P>Dublin will be City of Science in 2012.  What a smashing opportunity this will present.  The opportunities are huge and we can do a great deal.  It was a great victory for Dublin which was in competition with a number of other cities.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney and possibly Senator Coghlan mentioned golfing holidays.  Scotland is having a bigger impact than us on golfers.  I accept that sterling gives it an advantage but the golf clubs with which I am familiar are not receiving anything similar to the number of visitors and green fees they did previously.  Scotland is doing a huge amount of business and we could do a great deal more.  Let us ensure we take the necessary steps.  The steps that are being taken are in the right direction but we could do far more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House for this debate at such short notice.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, well in his recovery.  He is in hospital at present.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, is in Los Angeles; I am grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, for his attendance.  I also thank the senior officials for attending.  I had to lean on them in the past 48 hours because I had made a commitment on the Order of Business on Tuesday to hold this debate owing to the pressure on the hotel industry.  It is make or break for the industry.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment that it will continue to work with the industry to help it manage its way through the current difficulties.  The most important challenge facing the industry is access to credit, as the Minister of State pointed out.  It is a real difficulty across the economy, including for the hotel sector.  The Minister of State went on to say the Government&rsquo;s NAMA strategy was central to the goal of restoring a stable and functioning banking system which is creating a major problem for hotels.  The Government is establishing a credit appeal system which will allow SMEs, including those in the tourism industry, to appeal a credit application that has been refused.  This will provide a valuable independent resource <Col N="359"/>for businesses.  The system will require a number of staff because practically all credit applications are being refused.</P>
        <P>Over 300,000 people are employed in the tourism industry, which emphasises its importance.  A total of 75% of all businesses in Ireland are family-run.  Many of these family businesses will not go into NAMA.  The trophy hotels will.  The objective of this debate is to find out what the Government will do for family-run businesses and the people who, for generations, have been maintaining and improving standards.  There have been incredible improvements in standards in tourism-related facilities run by families, particularly in the last ten to 15 years.  The difficulty for the hotel sector in the South is that there is a government guarantee scheme in place for the sector in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The hotel industry is a huge employer.  A hotel, regardless of how many stars it has, will employ from to 40 to 150 people.  This is true of hotels in the most remote areas, as well as in towns and cities.  What will be done in the short term to help hotels?  What can this debate, for which the Minister of State has made himself available, do to help the industry in the next few months?  The last two winters have been an appalling disaster for hotels.  New hoteliers who include the children to whom parents have passed on their hotels have no response to it because they do not have the support of their banks.  The credit line is the problem.  The difficulty in the last two years is that their reserves have been run down by the difficult winter months of November, December, January and February.</P>
        <P>There is a state guarantee in place in Great Britain and Northern Ireland with a ceiling of &pound;350,000.  Up to 75% of the guarantee can be availed of to give an overdraft facility that carries the hotel over the winter months.  The hotels I am referring are not fly-by-night concerns or trophy hotels.  They have good bookings for their eight month season.  They do not owe the banks much money and are employing a huge number of people.  However, the guarantee scheme in the North is a serious challenge for hotels in Dublin and in any area within 100 miles of Northern Ireland.  Hotels in the North have a huge advantage over those in the South.  I hope NAMA will not be used to beat the family-run hotels.  They offer the c&eacute;ad mile f&aacute;ilte Senator Quinn mentioned.  As an artist, I performed on the stage in Red Island Holiday Camp when Senator Quinn&rsquo;s late father was running it.  It was a pleasure to go to premises where the attitude was to win and the training of the staff was top class.  The Irish welcome was abundantly evident and there was repeat business every year.</P>
        <P>We must grow the tourism industry.  As Senator Mooney said, it is one of the three main industries in which Ireland can increase employment and get people back to work.  The potential income for the Government is absolutely huge.  I call on the Government to urgently consider its policy with regard to the guaranteed scheme in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Another point must be made.  There is no time for rates for hotels and guesthouses to be reviewed.  They must be reduced immediately.  It is unbelievable we have to wait up to four more years.  Before a hotelier opens the door, he or she must pay &euro;3,000 a week in local authority charges.  That is unacceptable and unsustainable.  The hotel might be employing 40 to 100 people, yet it is asked to pay &euro;3,000 a week in rates and water charges.  That is not fair, particularly during the downturn in the global economy.  These hotels are employing and training huge numbers of staff.  The hotel sector is an area earmarked for future growth in turning the economy around and getting income back into the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Solheim Cup golf event to be held here next year.  The attention of the world and the golfing fraternity will be on it, through CNN, CBS, Sky Sports and others.  I congratulate everybody concerned.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for making it possible to hold this special debate on the urgency attached to dealing with the problems being encountered by family-run hotels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for organising this debate.  It is not often he is thanked from all sides of the House but he has clearly gone out of his way to ensure this important debate is held.  I also thank the Minister of State for his attendance at such short notice.</P>
        <P>This week saw the announcement that there were 435,000 of our fellow citizens without work.  We must focus on the areas in which we do well to grow the economy and create jobs.  Two ways of doing this are through investing in green energy, an issue we have discussed on previous occasions and will discuss again, and developing the number of jobs in tourism.  We must use the beauty of our country and the warmth of our people as natural resources to attract additional visitors.  We can do this by increasing our efforts in the eco-tourism part of the market.  Many go on walking holidays elsewhere in Europe and further afield several times a year.  We do not get as much of this growing market as we should.  There are various reasons, including issues relating to the right to roam across certain lands, lack of signposting and general rights of way.  Ireland is not as attractive as it could be to the walking fraternity.  There are also problems with property rights and insurance.  The Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has tried to make progress in improving the situation and opening land to ramblers and bona fide walkers but more could be done.  It is a sector of the tourism industry that would be easy to grow if we were prepared to go the extra mile to tap into it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The second area concerns cycling, into which we need to put more effort.  Once again, there are issues regarding signposting in rural parts of the country, as well as the state of the rural road network which is probably unsafe.  I recommend to many cyclists not to go out onto the roads at the current time because they can only cycle in the middle of the road, which is not very safe, and the edge of the road often disappears or there are potholes.  We need to consider how we can retain the number of cycling tourists which currently come here, bearing in mind the state of the road network.</P>
        <P>We also need to examine growth areas such as the surfing community.  Many of our coastal areas are particularly well suited to surfing.  If one wants to see the impact it can have on community, one should visit Newquay in Cornwall which was once quite depressed economically but has been transformed by the advent of surf tourism.  Many coastal areas in Donegal and further south are very well suited and we should consider how we can attract the younger fraternity to our shores.</P>
        <P>Another area we can grow is heritage tourism.  I am lucky; I come from the heritage capital of Ireland and see, on a regular basis, how it can help to create jobs in the local community.  One of Ireland&rsquo;s world heritage sites, Newgrange, is on my doorstep.  It attracts 250,000 people every year, many of whom come from outside Ireland and come to Ireland because Newgrange is the number one attraction.  The heritage site for the Battle of the Boyne is also located in Meath, which former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, opened a number of years ago.  It attracts 100,000 people from north and south of the Border.  By investing in projects such as that, including the Boyne canal, we could attract even more people.  In investing in our heritage sites, we could help to grow the number of people who come to our shores.</P>
        <P>It is not just about capital investment.  We should also be more innovative about how we do things.  Organisations such as Oideas Gael in Donegal put on courses in the Irish language and attract people, not just from the city who want to escape to Donegal for a week or two but from all over Europe and the world, who have some interest in Irish culture and language, and come to spend their hard-earned money keeping local communities employed.  We can do innovative things to try to grow our tourism industry.</P>
        <P>I have seen first-hand how some countries, such as New Zealand, use innovation to attract people.  New Zealand is probably the adrenaline capital of the world.  It has activities such as <Col N="361"/>zorbing.  Where can one go zorbing in this country?  There may be one or two places where one can do it, but I am not aware of them.  We could consider this.  I visited a prawn farm in New Zealand.  To earn extra money it rented out golf clubs and one could take a pot shot with a ball into the lakes containing the prawns.  If one was not interested in looking at the prawns, one could practice one&rsquo;s golf swing.  Little things like that can help to add value and generate local funds for the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is the week after next.  Many people will complain about the amount of money spent by Ministers in travelling abroad.  I must put my hands up and say <i>mea culpa</i> because in the past I have complained about excesses in expenditure during the time of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  I have been convinced by the arguments made on how important it is that we, as a nation, get out there and sell ourselves.  I am convinced that very few countries have the access our Ministers have, even for one day a year, because of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  The English have St. George&rsquo;s Day, which is not noted at all across the rest of the world.  Scotland has St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day, which hardly gets a mention.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is known worldwide and we need to use it in order to sell this country, in particular in these years of economic recession.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that in two weeks&rsquo; time most of our senior Ministers will be going away to sell the country.  I caution against spending too much and spending on hotel rooms costing &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 a night cannot be defended.  It is vital that they go and sell the country in this day and age.  We can all do our bit.  In America some 40 million people claim some Irish heritage.  Now, more than ever, it is important that we try to attract many of those people to our shores as tourists.  We all have a responsibility to make a phone call to Irish Americans we know or get messages out there in any way we can to encourage as many people as possible who claim to have some Irish heritage and may never have visited these shores to come here this year and that we need their visits now more than ever.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leader for organising this debate at short notice.  There are areas in which we can grow the market.  Senator Quinn referred to China.  There are now 200 million middle class Chinese citizens, which is approximately half the size of mainland Europe.  It is a huge market.  The Russian economy has recently faltered but it had tremendous growth over the past 15 years, through its gas and oil fields.  The exchange rate in Brazil has become more favourable by approximately 20%.  There is also an emerging middle class in India.  Those countries and others should be targeted by our Government.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report recommended closing some embassies, but perhaps we should consider opening more embassies or consulates in areas where we hope to gain from extra tourists.  For example, I understand we do not have an embassy in Thailand.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank the Leader for organising the debate at short notice.  Senator Coghlan referred to tourism outside Dublin, on which I wish to focus.  Dublin is the region with the highest number of tourists in the country.  Jobs are mentioned repeatedly in this House.  The fact tourism provides 200,000 jobs nationally is extraordinary.  I come from the west.  There are 2.75 million visitors, including some 1.4 million overseas visitors and 1.36 million domestic visitors, to Galway, Mayo and Roscommon each year.  Let us not forget the importance of internal tourism.  We need to encourage Irish people to travel around the country and partake of the various tourism attractions.</P><Col N="362"/>
        <P>To outline the relative importance, 16% of our national tourism is in the western region which is important for it because it is not a major industrial region.  We rely on many different things, but tourism is of huge importance to the part of the country from which I come.  The revenue from direct tourism is &euro;771.8 million.  Overseas revenue is &euro;497.7 million.  Domestic revenue is &euro;274 million.  One thing on which Galway relies is a very good product, but we also rely on organising festivals and our fantastic scenery.</P>
        <P>I live close to the beauty of Galway Bay.  We are all familiar with the songs about Galway Bay.  Bing Crosby is one of best advertisements for the tourism sector in Galway due to the song he sang about Galway Bay which was written by Dr. Arthur Colohan.  The Government invested in the Volvo ocean race stopover which came to Galway city and, as a result, some &euro;58.9 million was spent in Galway and some &euro;36.5 million was spent outside Galway.  We are hoping to have the stopover in Galway city again in the future.  I cannot stress strongly enough that politicians from all sides are very much behind this.  It is important that as a Government we invest in providing a certain amount of seed capital in order to be able to entice such great international events to come to Galway.  Of further importance is the number of people who found out about our country as a result.  There were television figures of 1.327 billion people for the race, with 234 billion radio listeners.  These people will be aware of Ireland now.  The satisfaction rating of the 650,000 people who came to Galway and Salthill during the ocean race was almost 100%.  It was incredible.  All those people went away with that memory.  The further revenue this event could generate, not only for Galway at the time but for Ireland in the future, is incredible.  It brings us very much into the international stage.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers talked about the importance of eco-tourism.  It must be recognised that even though today is a beautiful sunny day, unfortunately not every day is as sunny as it is in Spain.  Ireland is not known as a sun resort but as a country with a nice, mild pleasant climate most of the year around.  Our country has great attractions for many people.  The climate here is warm enough and is very welcoming for many people.  We have beautiful scenery, magnificent coast lines and a very pleasant environment.  The west offers an experience that very few people forget.</P>
        <P>However, our people are our greatest resource.  The many festivals that happen in the west need to be supported by the Government.  It is great to say there is an arts festival in Galway city which brings in &euro;20 million.  That is wonderful but it does not happen by accident.  Many community groups come together to make that arts festival attractive to people.  It is all very well saying we will run an arts festival every year which will bring in &euro;20 million.  Unfortunately, if those community groups are not supported there will be a serious problem because we will not be able to provide the attractive arts festival that happens every year in Galway.  It is important that the Government provides money through the Arts Council and that funding is maintained.  We are living in difficult economic times but the mix of arts and tourism is a good one.  They come together very well, along with sports.</P>
        <P>We should not forget the importance of sporting tourism which is enormous, especially the various international events, in particular those in Dublin.  It would be nice to see international events happening throughout the country.  As mayor, I had the pleasure of introducing one of the youth international teams to Terryland park to play football.  There is a great possibility that with the assistance of the FAI and the IRFU we might try to encourage international sporting events in different parts of the country, especially at under age level.  They do not all have to happen in Dublin.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="363"/>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Access is very important.  In the west we have Shannon Airport and a number of regional airports.  There is a small regional airport in Galway and there is Knock International Airport which play their part in bringing people to the west.  However, the reality is that the vast majority of visitors to this country come through Dublin Airport.  It is important that people can get to and visit other parts of the country.  Investment in roads certainly facilitates that but in tourism rail plays a huge part.  It also plays an environmental part.  I am delighted to note that from 29 March we will be able to get trains from Limerick to Galway because the first phase of the western rail corridor is to open.  This is a massive development for tourism but one cannot take it out of context.  People often look at such an outcome without using joined up thinking and think the actual cost of providing the service is X, it makes a profit and so on.  I cite the case of the Isle of Man which decided its ferry service was not making a great amount of money.  It brought in a private company which made sure the service made money because it cut back most of the services.  The problem was that the tourism industry collapsed as a result.</P>
        <P>One cannot look at these matters in isolation but must look at the overall service provided.  The western rail corridor will provide a great benefit to tourism in the west.  I have campaigned for the rail corridor to go to Shannon Airport.  There must be a clear link-up with such places if it can be provided, whether by rail or bus service.  The concept of a future rail corridor all the way to Derry is something we must consider.  Again, that is something all parties locally in the west support and we must all do so.</P>
        <P>We are in the middle of Seachtain na Gaeilge.  There was a nice breakfast in the House today, hosted by Conradh na Gaeilge.  I point out the importance of the Irish language to tourism, especially in Galway where it is significant.  Recent figures show that the Irish language generates revenue of about &euro;120 million to the Galway region.  TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta play a huge part in this.  Again, it is important that the entire Gaeltacht area is maintained and respected.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that all?  Good God above in heaven.  This topic is one the Leas-Chathaoirleach would have liked to discuss because he sought a debate on it a number of times but unfortunately he is precluded now from doing so because of time restraints.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State and join in the calls for the speedy recovery of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, from his back problems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt there has been a tremendous fall off in tourist visitor numbers and a reduction of revenue, especially in the past two years.  At its peak, the economic value of the tourism industry was &euro;6.5 billion, with more than 300,000 people employed in the industry in 2007.  Tourism revenue dropped by &euro;1.1 billion in 2009, with the lowest figure since 2004.  Overseas visitor numbers fell by close to 1 million in 2009 compared to the previous year.  The worrying aspect is that our largest tourism market, the United Kingdom, declined by over<?oasys _jy ?>16%, which is a big worry to everybody.</P>
        <P>I shall not reiterate what my colleague, Senator Coghlan, stated in regard to the Irish Hotels Federation annual conference, the report from Dr. Peter Bacon and the points made.  I do not know if Senator Coghlan mentioned the departure tax which is also a major problem and has been highlighted by all involved in the tourism industry.  There should be a serious re-think in that area.</P>
        <P>There is a serious credit flow crisis and the level of debt facing the sector as a result of the economic downturn is affecting tourism businesses badly.  These are, primarily, small and medium-sized enterprises.  The Irish small and medium-sized enterprises association, ISME, <Col N="364"/>published a report this week which shows that 55% of companies which applied for funding in the past three months were refused credit by their banks.  Some 80% of SMEs stated that banks are making it more difficult to access finance.  The restaurant sector alone warned that one in three businesses are at risk of closing which would result in an estimated 21,000 job losses and a &euro;700 million annual loss in tax revenue.</P>
        <P>My party has a number of propositions and policy proposals in the area of tourism.  One such was mentioned, namely, the reduction of local authority rates and the freezing of Government and local authority charges and energy charges.  We would certainly support that.  Immediate efforts should be made to abolish the airport departure tax.  We also need to reduce the 13.5% VAT rate on hotel accommodation and restaurants to 10%.  Many areas around&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>While I am not overly familiar with the rules of the House, I have no problem coming back again, if necessary.  I thank all Senators for their contributions which I will pass on to the Minister, as I will pass on the good wishes of the House.</P>
        <P>I want to reflect on a number of specific contributions that were made before making some general remarks.  With regard to Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in&rsquo;s points on the Volvo ocean race, I understand from his local media that there may be good news on that issue later today or later this week.  On 2 February, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, announced that the Government was willing to commit &euro;4 million support for the Let&rsquo;s Do It Global bid to host a port stopover in the 2011-2012 Volvo ocean race.  That funding was dependent on commensurate funding from the private sector, which is an issue we are working on.</P>
        <P>Many Senators referred to the airport departure tax.  There is no doubt this is an issue for the industry and it has been highlighted at the tourism renewal group.  However, it is important to point out that the airport departure tax is an important revenue raising measure and, in its absence, that revenue would have to be sought elsewhere.  The Government has tried to be as fair as possible in considering areas for additional tax revenues.  As many Senators mentioned commercial airlines, it is worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax.</P>
        <P>Several Senators raised issues about visas, a live issue for the Government.  The Taoiseach, in speaking to the Irish Hotels Federation earlier this week, noted that the visa issue was raised at Farmleigh and that it is a complex and sensitive area which raises important issues of migration policy and security.  The Government is anxious to work with the tourism industry to minimise the potential impact on tourists.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is targeting some of the countries <Col N="365"/>mentioned by Senator Quinn and we are asking the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to seek practical solutions to deal with the issue.</P>
        <P>I have spoken about credit supply many times in this House.  We are continuing through NAMA to pursue policies to ensure credit supply will become available once we get a properly functioning banking system.  The tourism sub-group of the main credit supply steering group met on 24 January 2009 to discuss the specific issue of credit finance for the tourism industry.  Arising from that meeting, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation have joined the main credit supply group; therefore, there is a focus on the credit supply area in regard to tourism.</P>
        <P>I note the many comments from Senators about local authority charges.  The Minister, Deputy John Gormley, announced the establishment of a local government efficiency review group to review the cost base, expenditure and numbers employed in local authorities.  The signalled introduction in the budget of water charges and a site valuation tax to be used to fund local authority services is a step towards the broadening of the revenue base at local level which, ultimately, will relieve the burden on tourism and other businesses.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in spoke about a number of issues in regard to cultural tourism.  I acknowledge his remarks about festivals and declare an interest as a board member of the Ballina salmon festival.  We need to do more to fund our local festivals and, in particular, the F&aacute;ilte Ireland restrictions around promotion of local festivals need to be relaxed.  This is an issue I wish to work on.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s query regarding the particular market initiatives in Britain, Tourism Ireland is implementing all the recommendations for a root and branch review of the British market.  Those include a focus on value, differentiating a holiday on the island of Ireland from one in Britain and a spend in the British market of &euro;12.8 million in 2010.  For Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s benefit, I point out we are also targeting the German market and, earlier this year, 900 travel professionals from Germany spent their annual academy in a place called Killarney, which I understand he knows well.  As discussed, we have been involved in the tourism blitz in North America, which will continue.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that I am happy to come back to the House to discuss this issue or to have the Minister come back to discuss it.  We must remember a few positive points.  Our tourism stock and hotel stock are now among the best in the world following the period of sustained industry investment, supported by the initiatives introduced by the Government, including an array of grants and tax reliefs.  While those tax reliefs are being criticised at present for causing the oversupply, it is important to remember that they drove the increase in standards referred to.</P>
        <P>Recent surveys have found that hotel room prices are some of the lowest in western Europe, which should appeal to increasingly price conscious tourists.  The price of getting to Ireland is also competitive by international standards and is falling, and the reduction in alcohol excise duties in the 2010 budget should result in lower hospitality costs for visitors.  I agree, as many Senators have suggested, that we need to address the broader cost of entertainment and dining out for our guests, which is all the more important given the movements in international exchange rates, particularly in the US and British markets.  We will continue to focus on reducing costs.</P>
        <P>Regional tourism is obviously an area of importance to me and was mentioned by many Senators, including Senator Mooney who has brought his expertise to bear in that area in recent years.  The regionality issue has now moved beyond a simple east-west debate and incorporates more of an urban-rural split in the business, to which Senators Coghlan and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in referred.  This is an international trend and reflects global consumer patterns.  However, it is important to note that the 2008 figures show that approximately 70% of total tourism revenue is spread in the regions outside Dublin.  The importance of promoting a balanced <Col N="366"/>regional spread of tourism in a way that maximises the potential for growth is reflected in our plans for the development of the industry as a whole.</P>
        <P>In regard to the support for individual businesses, F&aacute;ilte Ireland worked directly with 3,000 tourism businesses in the area of marketing support and general support in 2009.  It will continue to provide and invest extensively in 2010 in direct supports, training and advice for tourism businesses.</P>
        <P>A number of comments were made about our culture.  Aonta&iacute;m leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go nd&eacute;anfaimid iarracht infhaighteacht na Ghaeilge a fheabhs&uacute;.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the comments from Senators about St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  I heard a comment on radio which queried what the Government would be charged for the access we get to the international media and international governments on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  A PR professional replied that while one could charge handsomely for trying to get that kind of access, one could not buy it.  We have an enormous opportunity in the next couple of weeks.  Worldwide attention is focused on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and the island of Ireland.  It would be worth undertaking a research project to find how many people actually do not make the connection between St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and Ireland.  We must maximise that opportunity in whatever way we can, particularly, as Senator Mooney said, given the year that is in it.</P>
        <P>The Irish tourism industry is a resilient one.  It is well placed to capture its fair share of global tourism arrivals with a proper policy framework, a strong partnership with the industry and active and responsive tourism agencies.  In Tourism Ireland, which is an outstanding agency in the work it does internationally, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, I am very confident about our capacity to survive these exceptional times, recover, return to sustainable growth in the medium term and get the global and Irish economy back on track using tourism as a vehicle.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to raise this issue.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary.  I am a little disappointed that the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, is not present, but I understand he is out of the country on State business.</P>
        <P>I will outline the crux of the problem.  There is a national Garda station building programme but it is a complete mystery who is involved in it, who is responsible for it and how it is funded and operated.  I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for 14 years.  When we were trying to develop Buncrana Garda station I succeeded in arranging a meeting between the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, the Office of Public Works, the office of the Garda Commissioner and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in an attempt to drive the project.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue about Carndonagh Garda station because development of the Buncrana and Carndonagh Garda stations was to be advanced as a joint project.  I had a meeting about Buncrana Garda station and I got all the parties around the same table.  I noted at the meeting that Carndonagh Garda station could have fitted on the table at which we were seated.  The assistant Garda commissioner said I was not telling the full truth.  He said that Carndonagh <Col N="367"/>Garda station would fit one and a half times on the table.  There has been an ongoing difficulty with the development of this Garda station and I am trying to ascertain how it can be moved to permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>My lobbying has achieved 24-hour status for the station in Carndonagh covering the north Inishowen area.  In 2008 the priority was to acquire a site at significant cost.  By 2009, the site was unavailable for various reasons, a situation for which I do not blame anyone.  Now in 2010, opportunities for permanent accommodation have been offered to the OPW, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, yet a Government agency is spending &euro;175,000 on a site that everyone knows is not appropriate for what some regard as a small job, namely, the provision of a new portakabin structure at the rear of the station to accommodate male and female locker facilities, ablution facilities, including accessibility features, a kitchen area and a communications room.  The resulting modification of the existing station will include enhancements to the public office in the form of ramps and alterations to the public counter to provide greater accessibility, while the former communications room will be converted for use as a sergeant&rsquo;s office and administration office and will provide for additional ablution facilities.  The former sergeant&rsquo;s office will then be available for use by local management at their discretion.</P>
        <P>This is a waste of &euro;175,000 at a time when our economics are such that we should not be wasting money.  I am aware of alternatives that are not that much more expensive and which would yield a permanent solution.  In the words of one senior local garda, it would fulfil the future needs of north Inishowen policing.  I have been asking landowners and brownfield site owners to offer alternative sites to the Office of Public Works.  My greatest difficulty is that I have been providing this type of information to the OPW, the Garda authorities, the office of the Garda Commissioner and the local garda&iacute;, yet I am unable to find out why a decision was made to go with completely the wrong choice.</P>
        <P>The residents of Carndonagh and north Inishowen are up in arms, rightly so.  They are very distraught.  They are afraid that this small job will result in the major job being deferred for more than a decade.  I do not believe this is the case and the Garda Commissioner has given me his assurance that he wants the best facilities for his people.  I also have correspondence from the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, on this matter.  I suggest we give the portakabin to someone else or some deserving cause and get the proper solution now in Carndonagh.  I am sure the OPW would be inundated with suggestions.  It seems that everyone has prioritised this scheme, it is included in the 2010 building programme and yet the real solution has neither been looked at nor sought.  We have something that no one &mdash; local garda&iacute; or local residents &mdash; is happy with.  The garda&iacute; have had to move out of the town.  There has been a threat of direct action against drug dealers in the Inishowen peninsula.  While I do not wish to hype the situation because I believe our garda&iacute; to be well organised and I have received a personal guarantee from the Garda Commissioner that the area will be patrolled, none the less people are scared unnecessarily.  There are local solutions that could have been achieved and for which I fought but which have not been delivered.  I will continue to fight and this is the reason I have raised this matter to find out who is responsible for the building programme and why it is such a mystery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Martin Mansergh, is away on Government business.  I am aware from the record of the House that Senator Keaveney has been very active with regard to Carndonagh Garda station.</P><Col N="368"/>
        <P>The programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is based on agreed priorities established by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This programme is brought forward in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that a contract is in place for the refurbishment and extension of the accommodation at Carndonagh Garda station and work commenced on site last Tuesday, 2 March 2010.  This work will include the provision of additional accommodation to provide male and female locker facilities, ablution facilities, a kitchen area, communications room, enhancements to the public office and the provision of additional office space.  The refurbishment and extension works are expected to last a number of months during which time garda&iacute; normally based at Carndonagh will operate from Clonmany and Malin stations.  In addition, a Garda public office will operate in Carndonagh during weekdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for the duration of refurbishment works to facilitate public inquiries.</P>
        <P>Garda management monitor policing arrangements and operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  In this regard, local Garda management has put in place arrangements to ensure there is no diminution in the policing service provided to the north Inishowen area in the period concerned.</P>
        <P>There has been a sustained programme of investment in Garda accommodation in recent years which has seen the delivery of a number of significant projects, including the new Garda district headquarters at Buncrana which has recently been completed.  A number of other works have either been completed, are in progress, or are about to commence within the division, including Newtowncunningham, Raphoe, Letterkenny, Clonmany and Ballybofey.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Senator has a strong interest in the issue of providing a new Garda station in Carndonagh.  In that context, I understand the Office of Public Works will continue to examine all available options for a new Garda station in Carndonagh in the context of securing best value for public money in the light of available resources and in the context of the identified accommodation priorities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will direct the Senator&rsquo;s frustrations to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh.</P>

	<P>I welcome the significant investment which has been and continues to be made in Garda stations and do not wish to take away from that made in the area in question.  I am not alone, however, in having a strong interest in seeing a new station provided.  Will the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, the Garda Commissioner and all those with an interest in providing this new station undertake to ensure it begins this year and not in many years&rsquo; time?  The main concern of residents is whether this small job will yield a solution that removes this project from the priority list for the foreseeable future.  It is not securing best value for public money in the light of available resources.</P>

	<P>The Glenties primary care centre is much awaited in the local area and is urgently required.  When complete, it will provide a number of services for the people of the area within the town and surrounding areas, such as general practitioner services, public health nursing services, community welfare services, community physiotherapy services, social work services, occupational therapy services, dietitian services, learning disability services, minor injuries procedures clinic, mental health services, physical and sensory disability services, psychology services and many others.  The site was acquired from the St. Columba&rsquo;s <Col N="369"/>trust on the understanding it would be used as a primary care centre only.  The building that was to be designed would have been a single-storey premises.  It would have facilitated the integration of primary care services and individual public health nurses.  It would have been based with, and assigned to, specific GP practices.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of this proposal is to ensure a fully integrated primary care team is developed under one roof, with a clear emphasis on patient-centred care delivery in Glenties.  The new facility that is proposed for Glenties would provide primary care services and community service clinics.  It would be used by the broader community for social interaction and activities.  A new centre would enable primary care to focus on the needs of individuals and community groups.  It would match local needs with essential components like assessment, diagnosis, therapy, nursing, social services referral and rehabilitation.  If a new centre is to be provided, it should be developed in a way that facilitates formal and informal interaction among the members of the primary care team.</P>
        <P>I am more than a little disappointed with the progress that has been made with the efforts to allow this project to proceed to tender.  I have been in constant dialogue with the HSE, locally and nationally, on this issue.  I have been advised on numerous occasions that the project will proceed to tender.  The initial feedback I received in September 2008 suggested that work on the site would commence in June 2009, with practical completion by July 2010.  Obviously we have moved well beyond those dates.</P>
        <P>I have been in touch with the HSE at local level again in recent days.  All the preparatory work has been done by the HSE team in County Donegal.  The project has been given stage 5 approval.  The next step that is required will be approval to go to tender.  The local team in County Donegal is anxiously awaiting such approval.  It is a matter for the HSE at national level or the Government to issue approval to go to tender.  The people of Glenties are waiting for that approval.  They deserve a primary care team to be established in the new primary care centre in Glenties.</P>
        <P>The Government gave a commitment in budget 2009 to support strong and innovative HSE proposals to fast-track the roll-out of new primary care centres throughout the country.  I accept the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, does not have specific responsibility in this area.  I am delighted he is here.  On behalf of the people of Glenties, I ask him to indicate clearly whether approval to go to tender can be delivered as quickly as possible.  That is why it was vitally important for me to raise this matter.  The HSE at local level is waiting for formal approval of this project.  If such approval is provided, the project will be able to proceed to tender and construction.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for raising this matter.  I will respond on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  It is important to affirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing primary care services at local level.  In line with its policy document, Primary Care &mdash; A New Direction, the HSE is refocusing its services to provide direct community access to multidisciplinary teams including GPs, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, physiotherapists and occupational therapists.  This policy is designed to maintain people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  It will also decrease hospital attendances, facilitate early hospital discharge and support care at home.</P>
        <P>The HSE plans to develop 530 primary care teams and 134 primary care and social networks by 2011.  Since 2002, additional funding of &euro;52 million has been provided for the development of primary care teams.  At the end of 2009, some 222 teams were operating, or holding clinical team meetings on individual client cases involving GPs and HSE staff.  A further 31 teams were holding clinical team meetings without GP participation.  Almost 2,800 allied health professionals, including 600 new frontline professionals, had been assigned to such teams by the <Col N="370"/>end of 2009.  Some 755 GPs are involved in the operation or development of primary care teams.  In addition to reassigning staff from primary, community and continuing care services to work in primary care teams, the HSE also intends to redeploy a significant number of staff from acute hospitals and corporate functions into the community.</P>
        <P>With regard to the development of a primary care centre at Glenties, my Department is reviewing the HSE draft capital plan for the period 2010-14 and following up with the HSE where further details may be required.  The plan requires the approval of the Minister for Health and Children and the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Details of the plan will be published by the HSE following its approval.</P>
