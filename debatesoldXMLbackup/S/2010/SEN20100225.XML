	<P>I have received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to appoint a full-time harbourmaster in the port of Castletownbere as a matter of urgency to fill the existing vacancy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an update on the redevelopment of St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s special school, North Strand, Dublin 1, and a guarantee from him that it will be speedily processed for departmental funding.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give an update on progressing sewerage schemes in Newtowncunningham and Moville, County Donegal and the precise reasons for the current delays on these vital schemes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Diarmuid Wilson of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Communications Energy and Natural Resources to make a statement regarding interference with television reception in the villages of Mullagh, Cootehill and Shercock, County Cavan as a result of the erection of telecommunications masts facilitating the TETRA system for emergency services.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, Donohoe and Keaveney as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Wilson as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>As a matter of urgency, the House must debate the banking crisis with the Minister for Finance.  To some degree, the Government&rsquo;s economic policy is unravelling before our eyes, while at the same time taxpayers are committing themselves for unbelievable amounts of money.  We have paid &euro;11 billion in direct aid to the banks.  We will buy approximately &euro;50 billion worth of junk bonds from the European Central Bank.  We have a bank guarantee of &euro;400 billion and we are still at it.  The Government is committed to spending billions more and buying stakes in our major banks which, it is clear, are still operating to their own rules, which I would expect them to do to some degree.  However, we are investing billions of our children&rsquo;s future into banks without yet knowing whether it will work.  We need to have a serious debate on this issue.  We cannot do what the Minister for Finance is doing and state that everything is hunky dory because Europe supports us.  Europe does not support us.  All Europe supports is that we do not cost it money; it does not give a hoot whether we bankrupt ourselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need a serious debate about what is happening in the public sector.  Public sector workers are refusing to answer phones or to take any part in the reorganisation of health or other services.  Even if it is only inconveniencing people, we know such inconvenience can be a huge issue for ordinary people seeking social welfare payments or medical cards.  In the health services, it has the potential to cost people their lives unless we get it sorted out fairly quickly.  Will the Leader call on the Taoiseach to come to the House to discuss this issue before it escalates to a point where it has a detrimental effect on citizens?</P>
        <P>Yesterday, comments were made on the quality of patient care in the health services.  Prior to the most recent general election, the D&aacute;il debated the Medical Practitioners Act which had a section on assuring the competency of doctors.  Three years later, that competence assurance programme has not started.  Such a programme for doctors, nurses and other professionals in the health service is how we will curb the Michael Nearys of the future.  The Minister must do more than legislate; she must ensure these programmes work and get them working immediately.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I still think it is crucial.  The Leader himself has been clear on the importance of this debate.  I agree with him in regard to the issues we have to consider, includ<Col N="137"/>ing the third banking force, our relationship with the European Union, the timetable for NAMA and the Government&rsquo;s best projections for the economy for the rest of this year.  I would like to debate the figures in the budget, which appear to be on course at this stage.  We need these debates in order that people can express confidence in or criticise what is happening.  Given that next week will be three months since the Budget Statement, it would be useful to hold a debate on the budget&rsquo;s very positive forecasts for Government debt at all levels. Are they still positive? The projections for unemployment were also positive. We need a debate on this matter and banking is a crucial part of it. I support the calls made by Senator Twomey for a debate and I would like one to be arranged for today. I am not proposing an amendment to the Order of Business but the Leader needs to deliver on this immediately. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of student maintenance grants.  A number of us met representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland this morning in Buswells Hotel to discuss the impact on students of delays in grant payments.  I found out just this week from the Department of Education and Science that in my own county of Meath, 140 students have not yet received their first payment which was due in October.  They have had to pay for rent, clothing and food from their own pockets throughout the winter because the Government has dragged its heels.  We can rectify the situation by introducing the student support Bill 2008.  It has been in existence for two years.  I ask the Leader to use his good offices to find out what is happening to that Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the publication by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, of the heads of a Bill enabling the election of a mayor for Dublin.  However, it is clear from his proposals that further scrutiny and improvements are needed before the proposed legislation is passed into law.  We could do worse than learn lessons from what has been done in other jurisdictions such as the mayoralties of New York and London. I saw the benefits a directly elected mayor can bring when London established such an office in 2000. Two years ago, I campaigned with my colleagues from the Labour Party in Dublin South-East on behalf of a former mayor, Ken Livingstone. Although the object of our affection was not successful on that occasion, I have no doubt that when it comes to Dublin&rsquo;s mayor, we will be successful.  In scrutinising the Bill in this House, I want to examine the powers conferred on the mayor and the issue of the discretionary budget, which is necessary. It it is clear from listening to the Minister that he will not meet his original timetable of holding an election in June. Although he expressed certainty that the election would be held before the end of this year, I doubt he will be able to do so because it is clear from his Government colleagues and senior officials around the capital that many people do not want this legislation and would prefer to see it kicked to touch The Minister needs to push on with his proposals while ensuring real powers are devolved to the mayor. The legislation has the potential to provide excellent news on service delivery for 1 million Dubliners, but improvements are needed before we put it through the Houses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish briefly to address the Adjournment matter I tabled for the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept and appreciate the decision of the Chair.  The new TETRA system, which I warmly welcome, will allow digital communications with Garda stations throughout the country.  The system began to be rolled out in counties Cavan and Monaghan just before Christmas.  Unfortunately, it is causing interference to television reception in the towns of Mullagh, Cootehill, Shercock, Bailieborough, Clones, Castleblayney, <Col N="138"/>Ballybay and Monaghan.  This is a particular problem for elderly people who depend on terrestrial television for entertainment.  Many of them follow the soaps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have ruled on the matter.  Is the Senator making a request of the<?oasys _jy ?>Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader facilitate a debate in this House with the Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the difficulties the TETRA system is causing to vulnerable people in the aforementioned towns and, no doubt, in other areas as it is rolled out?  I welcome the introduction of the new system and do not deny its necessity.  It is possible to rectify the problem by purchasing a piece of equipment that can be placed on one&rsquo;s aerial but it costs &euro;300.  In these times of hardship, that is a lot of money for elderly people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on this matter?  I respect the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s decision in regard to the Adjournment matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the past 12 months I have regularly called for a debate on law and order, to no avail.  We have had no debate on law and order.  We are only two months into 2010 and eight people are dead because of gangland murders.  There were 20 deaths in 2009 but we have already reached 35% of that figure this year.  Despite rushing legislation through this House to make gang membership a criminal offence, no arrests have yet been made under this provision and nobody has been convicted for a gangland murder in the past three years.  As we all know, the drug trade fuels gangland crime and it is thriving.</P>
        <P>Security in our ports and airports falls far below the required levels.  Two container scanners are expected to cover every port in the country.  This is an absolute disgrace.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year alone, 2,174 mobile phones were seized in our prisons.  Criminals continue to run their operations from jail.  If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot secure our prisons, how can he secure our streets?  We need him to come to the House to account for his very poor stewardship.  He can snigger and mock in the other House, yet he cannot be accountable to us for the appalling condition of law and order in this State.  He needs to come to the House at the earliest possibly opportunity.  We have been waiting 12 months for a debate on law and order.  Crime is rife on our streets but we cannot have a debate in this House.  It is an absolute disgrace.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I suggest the repeated requests for a debate on the banking crisis are fuelled by concerns about the lack of credit from the banks to small and medium-sized enterprises.  Perhaps the Leader would consider widening the debate on banking to include proposals on job creation and resolving this severe imposition on small and medium-sized enterprises.  Everybody knows they are hanging on by their fingernails in the hope that NAMA will free up credit.  In facilitating this debate, will the Leader examine the role of Mr. Trichet, the European Central Bank and Germany, which seems to be the driving force protecting the euro? In the light of what is happening in Greece, there is a growing view among economists that we at least need a debate around the question of having a devaluation of the euro. If that were to happen, I suggest in the context of a request to the Leader, this would be of enormous benefit to this country as a trading nation. We have suffered grievously in recent years because of the strength of the euro <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> our two main trading blocs, the sterling area and the dollar area. Perhaps we need to get clarity and to find out exactly why the European Commission is delaying a decision on NAMA in order that we can get the concept rolling and, I hope, then release credit where it is needed most not only to protect jobs but also to create new ones. </P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what Senator Hannigan said about the student support Bill.  Many of us have already been lobbied this morning about that in Buswells Hotel.  The Leader of the House might be able to tell us where the Bill is and what is happening to it.  I think it is sitting somewhere in Merrion Street and has been for two years.  The least the students should get is some indication of when it will be published and come before these Houses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport.  There was a missing ingredient at that meeting, namely, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who for some reason is one of the lead players in the controversy surrounding Ryanair&rsquo;s effort to get into hangar 6.  Will the Leader of the House ask the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House to explain the Government&rsquo;s position on this?  I notice she is quoted this morning as saying it would not be in the interests of Aer Lingus shareholders for her to combine with Michael O&rsquo;Leary to ask Aer Lingus to move out of that hangar. As far as I know she is not in the business of acting for the other Aer Lingus shareholders. The reason the T&aacute;naiste has that key shareholding is because she is meant to act in the interests of the nation and the taxpayer. I do not know whether she is muddled or muzzled but it is about time she decided whose interests she is acting for &mdash; Aer Rianta, the taxpayer or the other shareholders. She does not seem to know.  I suggest she come to the House and sort this out because there is a growing suspicion that whatever the rights and wrongs of this ongoing spat there are at least three parties whose prime motivation is to thwart Michael O&rsquo;Leary and Ryanair rather than the interests that they are meant to represent. It would be a great pity if a major decision was taken on the basis of personal animosity or a personal difficulty, which all of those three parties have got with that company. I have one question which Mr. O&rsquo;Leary himself asked yesterday. If this was Bill Gates or Michael Dell, would they get the same treatment as Michael O&rsquo;Leary? I suggest they would not. </P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Leader of the House give some consideration to the proposals, suggestions and speculation that a major reconfiguration of Departments is about to take place?  This House could have a good input and advise and make recommendations to the Government.  There is much experience in this House as far as the configuration of Departments is concerned.  For instance, I hope that the Department of Community, Rural and Gael<Col N="140"/>tacht affairs will be retained but one could add culture to that because it is an additional part of rural life.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Next week will be a benchmark for the Irish language.  It will be the commencement of the Irish language fortnight.  As we know from previous years this is a very comprehensive promotional effort for the Irish language.  Perhaps the Leader could invite in the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to update us precisely on the draft 20 year strategy which has now been published.  In recent weeks the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs had a comprehensive debate. Seven Irish language organisations were invited to the meeting to debate the strategy. The meeting was transmitted live on TG4 for two and a half hours. That was a first for the Oireachtas. Tomorrow the committee will travel to Connemara and will meet representative groups from all the Gaeltacht areas, starting at 9 a.m. and finishing at 6 p.m. tomorrow evening.  It would be timely and opportune next week, given the fact that it will be Irish language fortnight, to invite the Minister to participate in a debate with us on the status of the Irish language. One thing of which we are all well aware is that there is huge goodwill for the Irish language at present. It is no longer a political football. We now find young and old want to see comprehensive proposals and policies to build on that goodwill. If one looks outside this country, whether at Moscow, New York or London, there will be Irish language celebrations and activities throughout the fortnight. There will be Irish language celebrations and activities throughout the fortnight. I hope it will be possible for the Leader to allocate time next week because most of the people organising this are young, full of energy and inspirational and they will look to the Oireachtas for support and endorsement. We should not let that opportunity pass. </P>

	<P Just="Left">I join colleagues in asking for a debate on the financial system but it should cover the economy generally and not be confined to the banks.  I walked through the Hibernian Way and Creation Arcade on my way to Leinster House earlier.  Approximately 50% of the shops are closed and the remainder have sales with reductions ranging from 50% to 70%.  That hits one when one physically sees it.

He is a very colourful, flamboyant, brilliant and successful businessman but he is a robber baron and it would be astonishing in terms of financial morality if we were to stand over a situation where contracts, leases and so on could be just torn up willy-nilly because jobs which may or may not be there are dangled in a cruel fashion in front of a hungry workfoce.  This is the kind of thing we witnessed at Shannon Airport where we were prepared to give into financial gangsterism and sacrifice all our principles of morality and decency.  I will oppose this, although I admire the business enterprise of Mr. O&rsquo;Leary.</P>

Apart from the appalling conditions in which people are living that I had to witness, I was in an UNRWA van with both sides shooting across us.  There was thin metal between me and death.  The Minister should meet Hamas representatives.  The peace process in Northern Ireland was successful because we overcame our revulsion at bombers and gunmen and we dealt directly with people.  This is not the same.  A legitimate government has been driven into a corner.  It behaved badly but, by goodness, it is nothing compared to the crimes being perpetrated against the people of Gaza.</P>

Before the Bill is introduced, the House should be informed about what is likely to be coming down the road regarding the lord mayor&rsquo;s powers, whether they will be worthwhile or whether the office will just be another layer of bureaucracy.  That is my worry about the concept of the lord mayorship.  It is one thing to refer to the role of the lord mayor in London and New York but Ireland is a different country and I wonder whether many committees will be abolished as a result of the creation of the lord mayor&rsquo;s office.

	<P Just="Left">I also seek a debate on the preservation of our history.  This has been an historic week in the context of political upheaval and resignations.   I refer to a matter raised by Senator Quinn weeks ago regarding the National Archives.  It has been proposed that the National Archives of Ireland and the Irish Manuscripts Commission should be merged into the National Library of Ireland, which has given rise to an enormous concern among archivists and historians. This was mooted in October 2008 and Senator Quinn raised the proposal in this House on 20 January. The proposal has generated considerable publicity and a good deal of controversy and I seek a debate on it and for the Government to inform Members whether it intends to stand over it. It would be against all current thinking on the need to preserve national archives independently and would, as some commentators have remarked, enable us to mark the 90th anniversary of the Four Courts bombardment in a highly disturbing fashion, in that it again would result in the downgrading of the preservation of our records. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">On foot of the excellent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary broadcast last week, I seek a debate on maternity services and the need for an inquiry into the barbaric practice of symphysiotomy.  It appears as though this practice was carried out in Irish maternity hospitals until the mid-1980s, long after it had been utterly discredited in maternity hospitals elsewhere.  An independent inquiry is needed in this regard and the Minister for Health and Children has not given an adequate response as to the reason she will not permit one.  I express my support for both the survivors of symphysiotomy and AIMS Ireland, an organisation which seeks improvements in maternity services in Ireland, in its call for a comprehensive debate on the issue of consent in maternity care, the treatment of women in maternity hospitals and on the reason an independent inquiry is not being held into the barbaric practice of symphysiotomy.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I spoke briefly yesterday on the Border economy.  I wish to return to the subject with a little more hope in my heart following the announcement that Warner Chilcott intend to establish 200 jobs in a new pharmaceutical facility at Mullagharlin, just outside Dundalk.  It is a town with a proud manufacturing tradition that has reinvented itself a number of times from being a railway town to a shoe manufacturing and brewery town.  I hope this pharmaceutical announcement marks the beginning of Dundalk taking its place in the new smart economy. It is a tremendous testimony to the work of the local authorities, from which I have just departed, that in tandem with the IDA they have created a key site for high quality inward investment in Ireland in recent times at Finnabair Industrial Park.  That park, which comprises approximately 150 acres of serviced sites with adequate gas, electricity, transpor<Col N="146"/>tation and communication links, makes possible announcements such as the one yesterday.  It is an indication of how local authorities, in tandem with the IDA, and with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which I also commend in this regard, can work together to make smaller local regional centres attractive.  It bodes well for a place that has suffered dreadfully.  Initially, this was through the scourge of the Troubles, which have since passed although it still occasionally raises its awful head.  More recently, it has suffered from the asymmetry between the economies on either side of the Border and which must be addressed.  I welcome this announcement and commend all who have played a part in it.</P>

	<P>Yesterday, the restraint unions in general have shown was quite properly raised on the Order of Business.  It is only right that restraint should be shown.  The unions have been asked to undertake a task of bearing the responsibility of ensuring that the economy does not crumble.  In fairness, notwithstanding a few exceptions, this has been upheld and it would be worthwhile for this House to have a debate on the role of unions, particularly because it is likely that there will be growth in the economy in 2012, 2011 and perhaps in the last two quarters of 2010.  With this in mind, it is incumbent on Members to tell unions that the sacrifices that have been made at this time will be remembered and will not be forgotten and that this has not been the first time the public service has come up to the mark and has done what was right for the economy.</P>
        <P>As for the economy, I note there has been another call for a debate on banking.

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to move on briefly to another important item, on which I appeal to the Leader to facilitate a debate as soon as possible.  I refer to the complete lack of a relationship between what is charged to consumers in retail outlets and what farmers receive at their farm gates.  On average, retailers charge &mdash; this has been checked out &mdash; five times the amount that farmers receive at their farm gates.  A farmer receives 20% of the retail price for cheese, 36% in the case of milk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;34% in the case of potatoes and farm incomes are at an all-time low.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This Senator can make these points during the debate, if the Leader agrees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader for a debate on the reason there is this difference.  Why is it that a farmer will only get 27% of the price of pigmeat compared with 51% 15 years ago?  We need a debate on why farmers earn an average annual income of &euro;13,000, why their prices at the farm gate are so low, why retailers are charging certain prices and why the consumer is paying over the top.  This is a serious issue.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A couple of weeks ago, I called for a debate on the Common Agricultural Policy post-2013.  I again request that the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to attend the House to discuss this important matter.  As there have been preliminary talks in the European Union, it is time we had a debate in this House.  A number of Senators on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have met Mr. George Lyon, a Scottish MEP, and some Irish MEPs to discuss this issue.  Will the Leader treat bringing the Minister to the House as being urgent?</P>

        <P>The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and its president, Peter Mannion, are to be commended on keeping the issue of education, especially the needs of students who are being hard hit, on the agenda.  The politician-friendly booklet made available by the USI this morning makes a number of significant points, not least of which is the fact that our current system for processing grant applications is anachronistic.  For example, it is remarkable that students must fill out a 26-page form that sometimes requires 20 pieces of supporting documentation and this cannot be done on-line.  It is remarkable.</P>
        <P>The Minister has decided that new applicants for the back to education allowance will be ineligible for the grant.  This raises issues of legitimate expectation.  Are new applicants people who are already within the system or are they people who are applying to attend college for the first time?  When one considers the sacrifices made by mature students in returning to education, those who are in the halfway place between working life and studying life, it is important that they not be compromised given the importance of getting people into education in a bid to deal with our problems.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of head shops.  We have a troubling new reality among us.  Not only are manipulative and predatory people running these shops, they are also supposedly running delivery services for their mind-altering substances in the most dishonest way.</P>

	<P>This time last year, the Government appointed a national strategy group to commission a report on higher education under the chairmanship of the economist, Dr. Colin Hunt.  In November, the Minister for Education and Science informed the D&aacute;il that the report would be published by early 2010.  In an Adjournment debate yesterday, I was informed by the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, that the report will not be published before the summer.  It is a critical report and clarity and certainty are required where the role of our higher education institutions in developing the economy and creating and supporting jobs is concerned.  It is a 20-year strategy.  I urge the Leader to ask the Minister to publish the report, which is important for everyone, without further delay.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the Government report, Developing the Green Economy in Ireland, which was published in November and signed by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan?  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, must not have read the document because he criticised the Fine Gael Party for its proposals regarding the establishment of a single water authority.  In the report, it is clear the Government is supportive of our idea.  Progressing the <Col N="150"/>report&rsquo;s contents would benefit every Senator and the economy and we on this side of the House would be willing to debate them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the call made by colleagues for a debate on the proposed reorganisation of Departments.  I welcome the apparent suggestion of a Department with responsibility for public service reform and another Department that will focus specifically on the need to train and educate the unemployed.  However, I wish to make two points.  First, these proposals are being driven by the McCarthy report which has not been properly debated in the House.  It will have significant implications for major decisions that will be made in respect of the country.  Second, I want to emphasise the point that, despite my welcome, new Departments are not the answer to the difficulties we are facing.  Rather, we need a new attitude, a new awareness of the challenges we face and a new willingness to develop fresh ideas to tackle them.</P>
        <P>I refer to the debate in the House on Ryanair and hangar 6, a matter touched on by Senators Ross and Norris.  I reject the growing distaste articulated by some for a business that is willing to get out there, hustle, argue and sell itself to drive its business.  This is the spirit our businesses need at home and abroad.</P>

	<P>I refer to the judgment of the Special Criminal Court as regards the Omagh bombing.  One can read today about how the issue of falsified Garda notes has dogged both trials of Colm Murphy in connection with the Omagh bombing.  There was no evidence before the courts on which a jury, properly charged, could convict the accused.  This is an extraordinary indictment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission must investigate the matter.  I say this reluctantly because I understand what it is the Garda is up against in trying to deal with these types of atrocities, but the falsification of notes is an extraordinary turn of events and has destroyed the prospect of a conviction in the case.  In the public interest, the commission can initiate an inquiry without having received a complaint.  If a complaint is necessary, making one would be warranted.  This situation is most unfortunate and unsatisfactory.  Another investigation into Garda activities must be carried out this week.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of our councillor, Mr. Shane P. O&rsquo;Reilly, and congratulate him on his family&rsquo;s recent success.  Senators Twomey, O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan, Mooney, Coghlan and Hanafin called for an urgent debate on banking.  The Finance Bill will be before the House on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, 24-26 March.  As we all know, Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il is being deliberated.  A timeframe has been allocated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mooney suggested that a devaluation of the euro could be considered.  Whatever the possibility of that occurring, I understand the euro&rsquo;s strongest point is that it keeps interest rates down.  Given the fact that this is a small nation, I hate to think what interest rates we would be charged were we not in the euro.  They would be mind-boggling.</P><Col N="151"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Mooney, Norris, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Hanafin and Donohoe called for a special debate on jobs.  It will be held next Wednesday.  As many colleagues are anxious that we discuss the subject, I will consult party leaders at our meeting on Tuesday.  I will continue it the following week, if necessary.  All of next Wednesday afternoon will be devoted to a special debate on everything to do with the creation of jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Twomey called for a debate on the public sector.  That may be tied in with the jobs debate if leaders agree.  I would have no difficulty with that.  The Senator also referred to health services and a new medical council Bill.  I will do everything I can to facilitate his request.  </P><P Just="Left">Senators Hannigan, Ross and Buttimer spoke about the student support Bill. The Bill has not been published but I will make inquiries as to when that might happen. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Wilson made a strong point in support of his native Cavan and neighbouring County Monaghan.  As a Senator who lives on the Ulster border I fully agree, as does Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, with Senator Wilson&rsquo;s serious concerns at the huge interference suffered by the people of Mullagh, Cootehill and Ballybay, which was well represented in the House for many years.  Bailieborough and Ballina are also seriously affected.  When the ESB placed pylons across the country I remember that our car radios were affected when we drove under them.  Now that Cavan and Monaghan have come into the 21st century we have digital services and the area has been opened up.  Others are now discovering this &ldquo;hidden Ireland&rdquo; which we have known for some time.  We now have the same opportunities as other places.  Those of us who attended the recent meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly saw the effect of the huge investment in tourism in Cavan, particularly the magnificent four and five star hotels which have been built there.  It is fantastic to see this happening and we fully support the people of Cavan, through Senator Wilson&rsquo;s representations here.  I know that all colleagues will join the Government Whip in his request.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cummins called for the Minister to come to the House to speak about law and order and gangland crime.  On Tuesday next, the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Bill 2009 will be debated in the House and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who always attends when his Bills are being debated, will be present.  I know the Senator is a champion in this area.  I ask colleagues to bring these matters to light when speaking in the debate on Second Stage.  If Senators of various parties and groups wish to have additional time for Second Stage of this Bill I will discuss that with the leaders on Tuesday.  Whatever time is required will be provided so Senators can make their strong views known to the Minister during the debate on Second Stage.</P>

I will make inquiries in this regard.  As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for this area it could also be highlighted on Tuesday next.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Hanafin and Ormonde called for a debate on the new mayor of Dublin.  Under the proposed legislation the mayor will have a range of substantial powers to establish and deliver a vision for Dublin.  This is to be welcomed.  It is part of the programme for Government that the mayor will have powers to draw up strategic plans for land use, planning, waste management, water services and their implementation at local level.  The Dublin local authorities will be obliged to comply with these plans.  It is timely that we should have a debate.  The views of colleagues in both Houses and in local authorities as to how the Minister and his Department can be assisted in implementing this innovative proposal will be very welcome, as Senator Ormonde said.</P><Col N="152"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Ross and Norris referred to yesterday&rsquo;s lively proceedings of the Joint Committee on Transport.  I saw excerpts from the meeting on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; last night.  I was disappointed that colleagues who excelled at the meeting were not featured in the transmission.  Of course, everyone waited with bated breath for Senator Ross&rsquo;s contribution but we were denied it.  Innovation and the creation of jobs is a serious challenge.  Ireland has been proud of the success of Aer Lingus, carrier of the national flag and the shamrock throughout the world.  In bad times, many of us were delighted to see Irish planes arriving at Kennedy Airport bearing the shamrock logo.  Aer Lingus has excelled in that area.  All airlines are going though a difficult time at present and every job is a godsend.  We should do anything we can do to help Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary.  The Government and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment are doing everything humanly possible in this regard.  Other hangars have been proposed.  The lease has been signed, as Senator Norris has said, and the contract is in place.</P>

Having a Minister at the Cabinet table makes a major difference to a town.  I know what was done for Athlone by my own colleague.  We have seen what happened from time to time throughout the country.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  Like Senator Dearey, I support the local authority, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  A European head office is a boon for an Irish town such as Dundalk.  We congratulate everyone concerned in making this happen.  I join Senator Dearey in that.  We are in the same constituency.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to the groceries order, the prices being paid to farmers and the prices the consumer must pay.  I very much agree with him in this regard.  It is about time the groceries order was revisited, perhaps by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Senator might influence his colleague, Senator Coghlan, who is on that committee, in order that this could happen at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Carty called for a debate on the Common Agricultural Policy.  This would be a very timely debate and at the appropriate time in the very near future I intend to allow an all day debate on the challenges facing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and everyone involved in agriculture, on the Common Agricultural Policy, what it has done for our country and for our farmers and on where we are going in the next ten to 15 years in this area.

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>For the benefit of the House and the Minister who was not in attendance for the debate on Committee Stage on the last day, this amendment was tabled in an effort to acknowledge the needs of people already involved in operating breeding establishments.  The Minister has already acknowledged that a three month lead-in time is required.  I presume it is to give those people an opportunity to get their houses in order to meet the requirements of the new regulations that may come into force once the Bill is enacted.  </P>
        <P>Planning or other requirements might apply and Fine Gael believes a more reasonable timeframe of 12 months would be more appropriate.  If the housing conditions in establishments are not adequate, sufficient time should be given to the people and the stakeholders involved to apply for planning permission and to get their relevant structures and establishments in order.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I said during the debate the last day that if this is to be good legislation, it is important there be a good buy-in to it and that all stakeholders have a good understanding of it and trust in it.  This is a reasonable amendment to offer the people concerned an opportunity to bring their breeding establishments and the structures in which they house their animals up to an adequate standard.  I hope the Minister will consider extending the period from three to 12 months, if at all possible.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="2" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the amendment because three months is very restrictive, especially given the need in some instances to put in place finance for the upgrade of premises or to obtain planning permission.  As the Minister knows, that process can often take many months.  There is no real difficulty in accepting the amendment to extend the period to 12 months but if the Minister is unable to accept it, I would like to know the reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I support my colleague, Senator Coffey, in his proposition of this amendment.  Three months is an unreasonably short time for any of our walks of life or businesses.  To make considerable changes or even become familiar with the terms of the legislation, a three-month period is unrealistic.  The amendment should be viewed in those terms.</P>
        <P>If the Minister accepts the amendment it would be a sign that he is involved in a consultative two-way process with breeders and this is not confrontation but rather a joint attempt to do <Col N="156"/>what is right.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are part of that joint attempt rather than forming part of a diktat from on high.  It is unreasonable to ask people to adapt, in so far as they need to, within a three-month period.  It would be too much of a shock and unrealistic.  No other sector would be asked to do it.  When we move people in offices, we give them money.  Under this legislation we will ask breeders to reorganise in a similar fashion.  In the interests of common sense, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Having listened to the debate, I note there is reason in the amendment which would extend the three-month period to 12 months.  If the Minister has problems with a period of 12 months, he might agree to a compromise in order that we might come up the middle to identify all the problems which could arise in the transitional stage and allow people to familiarise themselves with the new inspectors, the local authorities and procedures and structures.  The amendment is not unreasonable; therefore, if the Minister cannot allow 12 months, he might look to compromise along the way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this reasonable amendment.  To follow from Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s comments, we have proposed a period of 12 months but if the Minister wants to come back on Report Stage with a nine-month period instead, we will go along with it.  Three months is not sufficient for people to comply with all the new legislation which will be put before them and for the local authorities to implement the proposals in the legislation.</P>
        <P>No matter what happens, three months is insufficient for dog breeders to get their houses in order if necessary.  I know from the greyhound sector in particular that the majority are in order but some establishments may need a longer period than three months in which to act.  I hope the Minister will compromise on the issue as it does not concern the principle of the Bill.  It is dealing with the reality.  The amendment has been proposed in good faith and I hope the Minister will respond favourably to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>The thrust of this amendment is worthy at least of extra consideration.  In the main we are talking about reputable breeding establishments which are anxious to see implemented much of the action the Minister wishes to take.  It is not a case of persons not wishing to see the legislation enacted.</P>
        <P>Three months is a particularly short period and a 12-month period has been suggested.  I would like to think the Minister might be able to give some more consideration to this.  The various views put forward here seem reasonable but perhaps the Minister has other reasons to explain to us.  For the industry, it is important for us to be seen as supportive and responsive to its needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very reasonable amendment which the Minister should take on board.  When the Bill is enacted, this section will have consequences for people in the industry.  They will have to make their minds up in some cases as to whether they will stay in the breeding business, which will entail financial decisions and going to bank managers.  It is not difficult to get an audience with a bank manager nowadays but it is difficult to get a decision as to whether extra facilities will be extended or existing facilities will be withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is a reasonable amendment put forward by Senator Coffey extending the period from three months to 12.  In the economic circumstances we face and in view of new legislation which will require people to make decisions on the future of their businesses in some cases, it seems a reasonable amendment.  I hope the Minister will not divide the House on the matter.  The people on the Government side are supportive of this amendment and see it as reasonable.  The House should not be divided as I have no doubt that Senator Coffey will press the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="157"/>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I preface my remarks by saying that many people in the dog breeding industry in this country and involved in the Irish Greyhound Board or other groupings are in the main very reputable.  More than anybody else, they want to ensure the cowboys and cowgirls operating the infamous puppy farms are put out of business.  If that happened yesterday, it would not have been too soon.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In this section of the Bill, the three months allows for registration.  To give this the optimum effect, one would have to ensure the local authority &mdash; the registration authority for these establishments &mdash; would effect a positive and active public awareness campaign.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s reply on why the three-month provision was included.  He might look at it again.  I can say with a great degree of certainty that all of us in the House are trying to do the right thing.  If the Minister can confirm that three months is sufficient, that is fair enough but if not, I am sure the Minister will reconsider it on Report Stage or even in the Lower House.  Having had time to consider the matter and heard the debates pertinent to the section in both Houses, he might look at the provision again.  I await his comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is present to deal with the legislation.  I hope his presence and responses will help to alleviate some of the concerns which may be felt, rightly or wrongly, by some of our constituents about the broader aspects of the Bill which we will debate later today.</P>
        <P>The amendment has been proposed by my colleague and friend, Senator Coffey.  On first reading, an application within three months may appear appropriate or reasonable.  However, reading what is required in the application, there certainly could be difficulties.  For example, the application must contain such other information as may be prescribed, but we do not know yet what that information may be or whether financial projections and so on are required.  It could be difficult to have a proper application within a three month period.  It would be fair enough if the Bill stipulated that one had to write to a local authority within three months and state one&rsquo;s intention to apply.  However, we do not know what the information required may be, so three months may be a little unreasonable.</P>
        <P>The Minister knows that we all want to see this Bill enacted, and we support his efforts to regulate puppy farms and shut down puppy farms that are being run in an improper fashion.  To send the right signal that we can all work together on this Bill, I ask the Minister to look favourably on Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment or come up with some compromise.  That is a reasonable request and I look forward to the Minister being equally reasonable in response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am coming to this relatively fresh, which may not be a disadvantage.  I can see the welfare issues involved and the danger that a 12 month period will be interpreted as a charter for the underbelly of the industry that we all abhor.  Twelve months for some of these individuals is more than enough time to adapt.  As I have seen this in other sectors along the Border during the years, I would be wary of creating a timeframe that is too lenient, given the very serious animal welfare issues that this Bill is attempting to address.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bradford touched on a very important point about the application.  Section 8(6)(<i>b</i>) refers to whether a local authority &ldquo;is of the opinion that the premises in respect of which the application concerned was made is not suitable for the operation of a dog breeding establishment.&rdquo;  We do not know what the Minister means by &ldquo;is not suitable&rdquo;, because we have not seen any technical specifications, standards and so on.  The council officials who will be responsible for enforcing the Bill at this stage do not know what they would be required to enforce, because we have no detail on those standards.  I take on board what <Col N="158"/>Senator Dearey said, but if we do not get in as much buy-in as possible from people in the breeding industry, we will drive it underground, which is the last thing any of us want.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We want to expose the people who have been treating puppies badly.  As we want to eliminate puppy farms that are irresponsible, we want a Bill that will work.  This is a reasonable amendment to provide an all-encompassing role for the people involved in the industry.  It gives the breeders reasonable time and gives the officials who will enforce inspections reasonable time to get to grips with the standards that will be expected.  As of today, we do not know those standards, which is why we are tabling this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill seeks to ensure that we are dealing not just with the question of animal welfare, but that the dog breeding establishments will benefit.  We already have a problem as we have a reputation for being the dog breeding capital of Europe, with all the animal welfare issues associated with that.  This means that we are not held in high esteem, and one only has to read some of the articles that have appeared in the British press.  This Bill will be of major benefit to dog breeders.</P>
        <P>People are misreading the Bill.  We want to ensure a smooth transition and this proposed amendment would extend the period for owners to register their dog breeding establishments from three months to 12 months.  We have consulted widely on this issue, and it could be argued that the five years that have elapsed since the report of the working group is ample lead-in time.  We have been talking about this over and over again, yet we are here on Committee Stage and I am being told that people are not aware of this.  They have been made aware of it and they have been given ample time.</P>
        <P>I am trying to ensure that we have a smooth transition to full registration, while keeping the period allowed for registration meaningful.  Therefore, I propose to retain the three month period for registration provided for in the Bill.  The three month period starts from the date of the enactment of the Bill.  In view of the number of representations that my Department has received on this Bill, I can safely say that there are very few dog breeders here who are not aware of the Bill and its proposed requirements.  People have been made aware of this.</P>
        <P>Senators have raised certain issues related to the Hunting Association of Ireland and the Irish Greyhound Board.  Representatives from these bodies assured us that their breeding establishments maintain the very highest voluntary standards, and on that basis I cannot see that their establishments will need significant alterations to meet the requirements of the proposed legislation.  Those regulations will be made.  We must enact the Bill first and then we will bring in the regulations.</P>
        <P>While the Bill provides for a three month grace period, I envisage that the submission for an application for registration within that period will see a dialogue begin between the local authority and the establishment to ensure that any requirements are met.  We are not coming in here with a heavy hand and this is not draconian.  We will bring in registration and then examine how each breeder can make his or her establishment a better place in respect of welfare.  It is in the best interests of the dog breeders to comply with this.  They know that their reputation is at stake.  If they want to sell their puppies abroad, they must ensure that the highest standards apply.  The message that we are getting from our consultations is that for the most part, they comply with those standards.  There are those few people who are bringing us all into disrepute, as Senator Dearey pointed out, and that is very regrettable.</P>
        <P>Once an establishment acts in good faith to implement improvements, it is my intention that the relevant local authority will work with the breeding establishment.  This is about co-operation and is not about heavy handedness.  I have concluded that the three month period is <Col N="159"/>definitely sufficient.  As we are talking now, those establishments have an opportunity to come in and talk to my officials.  In fact, they have been speaking to my officials in recent years.</P>
        <P>This Bill has been in gestation for a long time.  I am not bringing it in all of a sudden.  We have been talking about it for years.  It is not as if people did not know about it.  The local authority officials will not demand that this place or that place be closed down.  They will act where people are clearly in defiance of the rules, but anybody who is co-operates will get every assistance from the local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody in the House seems to be on the same wavelength about this.  There should be a reasonable lead-in time for registration.  When regulations are introduced or changed, it is not just the simple fact of complying with the rules and so on.</P>
        <P>I would like to get some clarification on something the Minister said.  If people are having difficulties in complying with registration and so on, they should be dealt with on a case by case basis.  If an inspector calls and I am not registered, what happens? The Minister said there would be dialogue if I claim I have not got round to registering.  Does that mean dialogue with the Department, which would then grant another two months to sort things out?  This must be clarified.  If new regulations are introduced in any business, those involved will know about it but that is not the point, the point is that people must be given a reasonable time to get their house in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister claims not be using a heavy hand in this legislation but he is not prepared to accept the wishes on both sides of the House that there be a greater lead-in time.  If that is not being heavy handed, I do not know what is.</P>
        <P>The Minister is going against the wishes of the vast majority in this House.  He talks about consultation.  There were many aspects in the report that was commissioned, including a minority report from the Irish Greyhound Breeders Association that is not referred to in the Bill.  Consultation is one thing, but the Minister is listening while not heeding what people are saying because he does not want to hear.  He has his own view, is digging his heels in and is not prepared to compromise on such a minor issue as a three month lead in period.</P>
        <P>He mentioned the British press claims Ireland is a bad place for dog breeding.  There have been occasions and incidents that we deplore.  I was first to raise the disgrace of puppy farms six years ago.  Everyone wants to rid ourselves of the rogues and blackguards involved in this type of breeding of dogs.  We do not, however, want to penalise those who are looking after their dogs properly.  That is what the Minister is doing; he is tarring everyone with the one brush.  He is going about this the wrong way, he is getting people&rsquo;s backs up unnecessarily.</P>
        <P>Accepting a lead-in time of longer than three months is the minimum we expect, it is not a lot to ask.  I find it reprehensible that the Minister talks about good faith but is not prepared to accept a reasonable amendment that the vast majority of people in the House support.  I hope those on the Government side who know what the situation is like will support the amendment.  It is nothing to do with the principle of the Bill, it is a reasonable amendment that has been put down to allow for a practical arrangement.  We will need a greater lead in time.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey has outlined the local authorities do not even know what regulations will be put in place.  The Minister is talking about people coming into the Department.  It is rubbish and, with all due respect to the Minister, he should be man enough to accept the proposal being put before him and that has the support of almost everyone in this House and the vast majority of people in the country.  We cannot pander to minorities who have no interest in overall animal welfare.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister suggested that Senators have misunderstood this section of the Bill.  We do not misunderstand it, we understand it better than most of the Minister&rsquo;s officials who drafted it.  I have outlined the reason for the amendment, in order that there would be a more workable and legitimate Bill that would achieve the Minister&rsquo;s objectives.  If we bring this in, as it stands, we will drive rogue traders underground.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not address my query about the standards required, although he mentioned that regulations will be introduced after the legislation.  Why can we not have an idea of what those regulations will be along with the legislation?  Why could they not be an appendix to the Bill so everyone would be aware of what is going to happen and would not need to extend the timeframes for lead-ins?</P>
        <P>It is unfair to say the working group was in place for five years.  Every breeder and small farmer who is involved in this area would not have been aware of that.  This amendment is reasonable and secures inclusiveness.  We are prepared to withdraw it, however, if the Minister would agree to some extension, even to six months.  It seems the Minister is not for turning, which is a disappointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s openness in his address and his indication that true consultation and representation brought us to this point.  I hope we will be able to continue in that frame.</P>
        <P>I grew up with a dog in the house and have lived with a dog in my house ever since, including my beautiful west highland terrier that I enjoy personally.  I have a great love for the simplistic pleasures of having a dog and the benefits that accrue to a family from having a dog.  I certainly abhor puppy farming.</P>
        <P>I took an interest in the Dog Breeding Establishment Bill as it was passing through the House and listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s address to my parliamentary party, where there were a number of representations made to him.  The Minister is aware of our concerns and I support Senator Coffey in his remarks, and I am glad to hear he is prepared to withdraw amendments if the Minister co-operates.</P>
        <P>A former member of the Minister&rsquo;s party sat in this House on Committee Stage and to the embarrassment of the Government sat with her hands on her backside when it came time to vote on the Defamation Bill and other Bills.  We do not want to get into that sort of situation and I support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s idea that it would be best if we could work through the Committee Stage of this Bill in consultation and co-operation.  The Minister also indicated there had been representations and that he was aware of the issues.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that these amendments are the only amendments.  I understood there would be Government amendments.  Is the Minister going to take on board the various genuine representations?  Will he refer to the impact this Bill will have on rural pastimes, the Ward hunt and other issues such as the RISE campaign?  The Minister should clarify how consultation and co-operation will work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coffey used an important phrase, namely, &ldquo;workable legislation&rdquo;.  In general, workable legislation is good legislation and <i>vice versa</i>.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the possibility of either accepting our amendment or drafting a similar amendment for Report Stage.  In the context of the need to make an application within three months, we are operating in the dark to some extent.  Such applications must contain &ldquo;such other information as may be prescribed&rdquo;.  We are not aware and cannot yet be advised as to what might constitute such other information.</P><Col N="161"/>
        <P>Most people want there to be goodwill in respect of this legislation.  If we are to drive the rogue traders out of business rather than underground, it is important that the legislation should work.  In that context, the three-month period is somewhat short.  The Minister may be in a position to present a convincing argument with regard to why a period of 12 months is too long.  Various political parties experienced turmoil in the past two to three weeks.  I am of the view that we should be able to progress legislation such as that before the House without becoming overly excited in a party-political sense.</P>
        <P>If the Minister and his colleagues in government can assist in resolving the problems in Northern Ireland, surely it is not beyond us to come to a decision on whether three months or 12 months should be the appropriate period.  I am sure there is an alternative somewhere between the two with which everyone would be comfortable.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the position and to return to the matter on Report Stage.</P>

	<P>The Minister was particularly conciliatory in his interpretation of the proposed legislation.  Conciliation is the hallmark of the Minister.  We were expecting to have a conciliatory debate on this Bill today.  I take on board the points made by Senator Dearey in respect of the legislation.</P>
        <P>On reflection, I was not recommending a 12-month extension.  The important thing is to remove disreputable individuals from the breeding industry.  However, I remain of the opinion that a period of three months is too short.  If the period were extended to six months, this would be of assistance.</P>
        <P>Conciliation should influence the tone of the debate on this Bill, particularly in view of the fact that there are other issues which remain to be discussed.  It would be far better if we made progress in that way.  The Minister is prepared to reconsider the position before Report Stage, which is what we were hoping would happen.  I thank him for his positive response.</P>

	<P>The Minister is a reasonable man, as is Senator Coffey.  The Minister indicated that this measure will be self-financing.  If that is the case, there will be an obligation on local authorities to have sufficient numbers of staff in place.  This will require a reorganisation of staffing resources and a glut of cheques will be sent in by those who wish to register.  It will take time to deal with these various matters.  In that context, the Minister is taking the right approach and I am delighted he has given a commitment to reconsider the position.</P>

As indicated, all that I am is a simple dog lover who is concerned about animal welfare.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated the merits of the work done to bring this legislation before the House.  I appreciate what he said in that regard and I am of the view that everyone would support improved regulation, especially as this would be in the best interests of animal welfare.</P>
        <P>I have a difficulty in respect of one issue.  I spend a great deal of time in west Cork and I enjoy participating in traditional rural pastimes.  On occasion, I have also enjoyed the Ward Union Hunt.  There appears to be a degree of ambiguity in respect of this matter.  The Minister indicated that he was expecting some amendments to be forthcoming in the aftermath of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting he attended.  He also indicated that the Bill will not impact on the Ward Union Hunt, rural pastimes and other issues of that nature.</P>

I will leave it to the Minister&rsquo;s good offices, in the knowledge that he knows there are certain concerns on certain issues, to ensure those amendments come forward to the satisfaction of all those who would like to sign into this.</P>

In the light of that fact, we are happy to withdraw the amendment in the hope that the sentiment of it at least will be addressed on Report Stage in a Government amendment.  We will wait and see but we reserve the right to resubmit the amendment on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister said the working group took five years and that everybody knew about the legislation.  I would have hoped that the Government parties would have had their houses in order and tabled their amendments so we could debate them properly on Committee Stage.  It is a shame to have Government amendments introduced on Report Stage when we cannot interact on them.  I hope communication lines between the Government parties on this important Bill can improve.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:</P><Col N="164"/>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(6) Without prejudice to the executive function of determining any additional conditions specific to a particular registration, the determination of conditions of a general character to apply to any registration in the functional area of the local authority is a reserved function.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment proposes to give a role to elected members of local authorities to ensure they can have an input into the regulations that will govern the scheme.  It is a straightforward amendment and I ask the Minister to take it on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his amendment.  As I indicated previously, however, I will ensure the draft regulations are subject to consultation with all the interested parties before I sign them into law.  It is important these regulations are consistently applied throughout the State.  Giving the power to local authorities to have their own local conditions or guidelines would not assist in ensuring uniform and effective implementation of the legislation.  A requirement for local guidelines would also place an unnecessary burden on local authorities to develop local guidelines and standards.  Such broad latitude where each local authority could implement its own guidelines would only create confusion which would result in a lack of clarity on the standards to be implemented by breeding establishments throughout various local authority functional areas.</P>
        <P>A number of questions arise in this context.  What would happen if a dog breeding establishment straddled two local authority areas?  Could it choose the less onerous of the two sets of guidelines?  We come across this repeatedly and we are trying to address it in the White Paper.  Would we want operators to engage in location shopping whereby they would set up a dog breeding establishment in a local authority area with less onerous standards?  These are practical difficulties that I see in the amendment proposed by the Senator.</P>
        <P>In its report, the working group stressed the importance of having regulations that are very clear and enforceable.  Providing for local guidelines would undermine the national approach envisaged by the working group and which is provided for in the Bill.  The very fact we are introducing this legislation will help dog breeding establishments.  There is no question that reputational damage has occurred and it is only by having a national standard that we can progress.  I understand the thinking behind the Senator&rsquo;s amendment but there would be practical difficulties in its implementation.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (7), line 23, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 8(7) states that a local authority may refuse to register a premises or dog breeding establishment under the section.  The reason we think it should be compulsory is because the section later refers to such refusal being necessary to ensure the safeguarding of animal welfare.  If it is necessary to ensure the safeguarding of animal welfare, it should be compulsory and not arbitrary.  We do not think the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is strong enough.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully understand the intent behind the amendment and emotionally I have much sympathy for it.  The idea of the amendment would be to instruct a local authority <Col N="165"/>to withhold registration from those who may have certain convictions, especially for cruelty to animals.  It would seem to create a blanket provision because it would not matter how old the convictions were or under what circumstances they were received.  That seems to be the intent.  As someone who abhors animal cruelty and who believes in animal welfare, I have a great deal of sympathy for the amendment.  However, we are seeking to impose a new regulatory regime with the sole purpose of providing for the welfare of dogs in breeding establishments.</P>
        <P>If one was to stand back from the situation, one might consider it unfair to apply restrictions that might have a retrospective effect.  If a person had been convicted of an act of cruelty, he or she would have received the appropriate sanction from the court at that time.  It is not for the Bill to punish a person further by denying him or her a right to a livelihood.  I intend to allow local authorities use their discretion in such instances.  In contrast to the subject matter of the previous amendment, in this instance I will allow local authorities to use their discretion to consider whether a person has learned a lesson.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>After the Bill is enacted I am sure it will be appropriate in instances for members to raise issues such as this in a council chamber to state a person has been convicted of treating animals with a certain amount of cruelty and to express a view that the person will continue to act in this way.  However, discretion is the order of the day.  Putting it in cast-iron terms that under no circumstances can such a person continue with a business is an unnecessary restriction.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged under the Bill that a local authority will work in co-operation with dog breeding establishments on an improvement model basis to ensure proper standards are maintained in dog breeding establishments.  In keeping with this co-operative relationship it is considered more prudent to allow the local authorities discretion on whether to refuse registration on the grounds outlined in section 8(7).  I do not propose to tie the hands of local authorities and therefore I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I hear what he has to say on this matter.  On one level it seems appropriate to make it a discretionary power.  I certainly hear what he has to say on the rule against retrospection.  The idea that a person should not be prosecuted for an action which was not an offence on the date it was committed has a clear constitutional background and we are very conscious of that when considering issues relating to retrospection.  However, if one reads through the relevant section, one will see it is about local authorities considering whether a refusal to register a premises would be necessary to ensure the safeguarding of animal welfare.  It also deals directly with issues of cruelty to animals.</P>
        <P>Is it possible that where there is any contravention of the Bill it would be upgraded to mandatory refusal?  I understand the legislation will have to be implemented in context, whereby a local authority will work with people to get them to come into line.  However, once this legislation is in place they will have had that opportunity.  Stricter requirements should be imposed on local authorities where it is established that they have breached the new legislation.  Will the Minister would consider tweaking this to allow the discretionary aspect where one is considering past wrongs or offences under existing legislation while tightening the obligation on local authorities in the event of contraventions of the Bill.  This is the type of area where a nod may end up being as good as a wink in that unevenness could apply among local authorities <Col N="166"/>in the way they apply the standards.  I do not think we should discount the possibility of creating a requirement on authorities in certain circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with great interest to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution.  Before he publishes the guidelines, will he hold further meetings with the stakeholders involved?  I welcome to the Visitors Gallery the chief executive of the Irish Coursing Club, Mr. D. J. Histon, who takes this business very seriously.  I am sure he would like to have an input into the guidelines.  If the Minister was to liaise with the people concerned before the guidelines are published, he might address some of the issues raised by Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Burke on keeping the doors open to stakeholders.  Agreements can only be reached through consultation.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt that the people involved in the dog breeding industry are reasonable for the most part and I have no reason to believe standards are not being upheld.  I have no difficulty with engaging in consultations.  I have indicated to my officials that they should meet interested parties and they have done so on several occasions.  That is as it should be.</P>
        <P>In regard to Senator Mullen&rsquo;s contribution, if tweaking is necessary I would be happy to consider any amendment he might propose on Report Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I referred to his point on consistency across local authorities.  As I am only too aware, this difficulty arises in a number of areas.  One has only to look at the annual service indicators to recognise the lack of consistency between local authorities.  I certainly do not want to see this occurring in the context of this Bill.  The only way to achieve the Senator&rsquo;s aim, however, is by making sure local authorities enforce the guidelines properly.  On reflection, it is better to preserve the section without amendment because of the difficulties that could arise otherwise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (12), line 17, after &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;and shall comply with any conditions attaching to such registration&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to amend section 12 to provide that the operator of a dog breeding establishment registered under the section shall display the registration certificate issued to him or her in a prominent position and shall comply with any conditions attaching to it.  At present, it is not an offence to fail to comply with the conditions of registration and we believe that is a major omission.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="167"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether this amendment fits perfectly under subsection (12), which deals solely with the display of the registration certificate.  This subsection stands alone as an important provision which seeks to ensure transparency for the consumer.  It is important that any customer of a dog breeding establishment be informed that the establishment is registered because this is an assurance that the standards of the establishment are sufficient and that the dogs are well cared for.  Subsection (17) provides that it is an offence not to display the registration certificate.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The proposed amendment is perhaps too general.  The Bill provides ample opportunity for the local authority to act if the establishment is found not to be in compliance.  The working group, to which I keep referring because that was how we consulted stakeholders, recommended that an improvement notice be served on an establishment that fails to meet the standards required.  We do not plan to commence a prosecution immediately because we want to give establishments the opportunity to improve.  In line with best practice in all regulatory systems, there is an appropriate scale of actions which can be taken to gain compliance.  We are not seeking to impose huge penalties because we want to encourage people to comply.  This is an objective which I think is shared on all sides of the House.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>If agreement is not reached between the local authority and the establishment, the local authority is empowered under section 18 to issue an improvement notice.  Given that the improvement notice sets out the measures to be taken within a specified timeframe, the proposed amendment is unnecessary.  The notice can be appealed to the District Court within seven days of its serving and the local authority can progress to a closure notice under section 19 if it is ignored.  However, this would only occur at the end of a very long and arduous consultative process.  It is only when a person contravenes the closure notice that he or she will be guilty of offence, at which stage the fines are hefty and set out in legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that the provisions of the Bill are clear and enforceable.  The amendment would dilute the clarity of the enforcement provisions under sections 18 and 19.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cited the dog breeding working group but I have held meetings with dog breeders in County Wexford and it was amazing to hear how many concerns they expressed about this legislation.  They informed me that very few of their recommendations were taken on board by the working group.  They are concerned about becoming victims of crime because their dogs are potentially valuable resources.  They fear that by posting signs all over the place they will make a list available to anybody who wants to snatch their dogs in the middle of the night.  The Minister is making it too easy for thieves, bar giving them the keys to the establishments.</P>
        <P>Other provisions of the Bill appeared to go against the spirit of the working group.  For example, one section describes a bitch as beginning to breed at four months of age.  Nobody breeds dogs at four months of age, however.  The Bill also refers to a uniform breeding cycle for dogs but there is no such thing across all breeds.</P>

There is nothing wrong with a person wishing to purchase a dog going to a dog breeder&rsquo;s kennels to make sure it is of good standing and that the registration is displayed prominently somewhere within the premises.  They are the type of principles the Minister should try to follow.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;or any other matter that significantly affects the welfare of the dogs.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In section 11(8) we are dealing with the possible contraventions that could lead to a removal of registration.  Would it be sensible to add the amendment as a new subsection that it would include &ldquo;any other matter that significantly affects the welfare of the dogs&rdquo;?  It is clearly meant to be a catch-all measure and given the overall objectives of the legislation perhaps that is something that should be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sympathetic because in the way he has worded the amendment Senator Mullen has referred to &ldquo;any other matter that significantly affects the welfare of the dogs.&rdquo;  I also have to ensure that we have legal clarity.  Section 11 provides for the removal of a dog breeding establishment from the register in certain circumstances which are outlined in the legislation.  They include by order of the District Court if the operator has committed certain offences under specific Acts.  The section is very specific as to the circumstances in which an establishment may be removed from the register.  The proposed amendment, which is stated in fairly broad terms, would lead to an erosion of that clarity and might introduce an element of uncertainty to the basis for removal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To return to the point Senator Mullen made, this is very much open to interpretation.  He wants us to include &ldquo;any other matter that significantly affects the welfare of the dogs&rdquo;.  We might have a certain interpretation of what affects the welfare of a dog while others would have a different interpretation.  In terms of the law, that leaves far too much uncertainty.  Therefore, to be on the safe side and to ensure that we have clear, robust legislation, it would be better if this were not included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s explanation.  I agree that we require clarity in the law.  It is essential.  However, given that there are responsible bodies in charge of applying the standards, I wonder whether it would be a problem in practice were such an amendment to be included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It raises an interesting issue because, as Senator Mullen might be aware, there are those who would argue that those who carry out the inspections should be veterinary experts and that perhaps they would have a different point of view than those laypersons who have an interest in animal welfare.  They would have different perspectives.  Therefore, if one had a provision of this type one might not go down the strictly veterinary route and one might have quite a subjective interpretation.  The less subjective a Bill is and the <Col N="169"/>less it is open to interpretation the better.  I am very sympathetic to what Senator Mullen is saying, but as Minister I also have to be mindful of the robustness of legislation and therefore I am sticking to the wording as is.</P>

A significant amount of every dog licence fee that is paid through post offices is taken in fees by An Post, whereas if there was direct registration by electronic means the full amount of the licence fee could be used for what it is meant for, namely, to maintain proper standards in dog care and to provide council pounds.  That would be a positive step to take.  I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P>I have too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to be prescriptive about this.  We are not talking about mass payment.  There is a limited number of dog breeding establishments.  At this stage local authorities are quite experienced in processing payments for rent, rates or levies of any description.  They generally operate a range of payment mechanisms to facilitate easy payment.  It is not necessary for the Minister to prescribe how they should operate their systems.  I understand the sentiment behind the amendment but it is not necessary.  Therefore, I intend to leave the section as is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to withdraw the amendment in the light of what the Minister has said.  However, I would ask him to consider the payment of dog licences and the introduction of an electronic means of registration.  The latter would help to increase the number of dog registrations.  I take the opportunity to bring that to the Minister&rsquo;s attention. <Col N="170"/> Much of the money going to An Post could be reinvested where it should be, namely, the care of dogs by local authorities.</P>
        <P>I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to another matter relating to the section although we have not tabled an amendment on it.  Section 12(1)(<i>a</i>) to (e) refers to dog breeding establishments of varying sizes.  Would the Minister consider including the words &ldquo;for the purposes of breeding&rdquo;?  In effect, that is what this Bill is about, namely, the regulation of breeding establishments.  It should not be seen to be a catch-all measure.  Other legislative Acts deal with animal welfare and greyhounds, for example.  The purpose of this Bill is to regulate breeding establishments.  We need to be more clear and specific in our language in that regard.  I urge the Minister to consider tabling such an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not respond to my questions on the previous amendment but the issue crops up here again.  There is reference in section 12(5) to a &ldquo;bitch&rdquo; being a bitch of more than four months old capable of being used for breeding purposes.  One can have young pups on a farm that could be for sale at some point.  They may not be sold or they might be awaiting export and so on.  That could push people over the breeding quota and they could end up paying much more.  Four months is wrong and something must be done about that.  The Minister cannot be that restrictive regarding dog breeders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Senator propose?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The time varies for different dogs but the Minister should consider at least nine months for the average dog.  Most people will not keep a pup beyond nine months.  It will be sold or used for some other purpose.  Four months is too young.  Some dogs breed much later than that.  For instance, a pelvic test is done on Labradors at 13 months to see if they are suitable for breeding.  Other dogs have different breeding cycles.  The Minister wants this provision to be restrictive but that could cause problems for genuine breeders and this figure must be changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, subsection (8), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) the operator of the establishment is registered through the Irish Coursing Club,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will withdraw the amendment because the wording is incorrect and I will resubmit it on Report Stage.  The amendment should read, &ldquo;the operator of the establishment is registered through the Irish Greyhound Board&rdquo;.  A registration and fees system is in place for the greyhound industry.  The Minister will know from his working group that the industry is governed by the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 which clearly sets out the responsibilities of the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, and the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, in the promotional development of the sport and in the regulation and enforcement of standards in the sport.  A sophisticated system tracks all matters relating to breeding and ownership of greyhounds.</P>
        <P>Duplication is a possibility as a result of this section.  A system is in place under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism which involves reputable agencies such as the ICC <Col N="171"/>and the IGB.  The ICC operates a register of all matings, litters born, adult greyhound naming and transfer of ownership.  All the stud dogs and brood bitches are DNA profiled and all the greyhounds are tattooed and earmarked for identification purposes.  All the pups are inspected and tattoo marked by control stewards jointly appointed by the ICC and the IGB.  Greyhound breeders are subject to registration fees which ultimately support the maintenance and integrity of the industry.  I am sure the Minister will agree we do not hear many complaints about the maltreatment of greyhounds because this is a well regulated industry.</P>
        <P>While the Minister is not doing this intentionally, the amendment is an effort to avoid duplication.  The greyhound industry is well regulated and breeders are paying fees for regulation and registration.  Imposing further fees, regulation and bureaucracy could threaten the viability of the industry.  Greyhounds are covered by the 1958 Act which comes under the remit of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  It would not be a problem if the Minister wanted to strengthen that legislation by cross-referencing it in this legislation and endorsing the work of inspectors.  Reference is regularly made to the economic climate, over regulation, bureaucracy and overheads.  This provision will result in an unnecessary overhead through additional inspections in an industry that is well regulated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have also had representations from Bord na gCon and I agree with Senator Coffey&rsquo;s comments.  Bord na gCon is a responsible body and one does not hear many complaints about the industry.  When I see greyhounds, I am always struck by how thin they are.  The fashion industry comes to mind whenever I look at a greyhound.  The key issue raised by Senator Coffey is cross-referencing.  It would be useful to cross-reference the 1958 Act in the legislation.</P>
        <P>People who have complained about aspects of the Bill are concerned that it will somehow introduce onerous requirements on the undeserving in that people who are operating to a high standard could be drawn into a bureaucratic nightmare as a result of the Bill&rsquo;s requirements.  I will touch on this later when we deal with my amendment regarding guidelines.  Will the Minister clarify his expectation about how the Bill will work in practice?  Is it likely to lead to inspections of reputable groups, bodies, organisations, companies or individuals?  How will the legislation be enforced?  It would be useful to hear what the Minister thinks about that looking forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Burke raised a number of important questions.  I would like the Minister to address the issue regarding the 1958 Act, in particular, which governs the IGB.  Surely the board will continue to impose its own fees and regulations.  Will registration fees be duplicated or will the regulations and standards proposed by the Minister supersede the 1958 Act?  The IGB and the ICC are doing a wonderful job regulating their own affairs.  It would be to the detriment of the greyhound industry if fees and regulations were imposed under both the 1958 Act and this legislation.  How will the legislation operate on the ground?  Will fees be doubled?  Will two sets of people visit farms and so on?</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>

        <P Just="Left">Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coffey will amend his amendment but will the Minister address the questions raised rather than have us repeat them again on Report Stage?  He should respond to the questions raised regarding the 1958 Act, double registration and so forth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the section, I wish to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views regarding the 1958 Act and the current regulations, regimes and registration systems that are in place.  How does he envisage the provisions of this legislation fitting in or working in collaboration with the existing system?  Essentially, these provisions constitute an overlaying of the existing regulations and concerns have been expressed in this regard.  Moreover, I refer to the section&rsquo;s definition of a &ldquo;bitch&rdquo; being &ldquo;a bitch of more than 4 months old that is capable of being used for breeding purposes&rdquo;.  I concur with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Senator Twomey, and ask the Minister and his officials to reconsider this point before Report Stage.</P>
        <P>While I intend to submit an amendment on Report Stage on this subject, in the interests of collaboration the Minister and his officials also should consider an amendment.  I will offer a wording for the new definition, namely, &ldquo;a bitch that has produced a live litter and is capable of being used for breeding purposes&rdquo;.  Obviously a bitch cannot be considered capable unless she has produced a live litter, which is the evidence and proof.  The four-month age limit does not seem reasonable, is illogical and demonstrates no understanding of the breeding cycle of a bitch.  The Minister should consider this point because it is a fundamental aspect of the Bill that will have implications on its introduction.</P>

	<P>There are just two simple questions in this regard.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>On section 13, the Minister will put in place regulations for the local authorities, which will have powers to inspect and a fee will be forthcoming.  At the same time, however, under the 1958 Act the Irish Greyhound Board is empowered to have its own regulations and to levy fees.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Under section 13, which will give the Minister the power to put in place regulations, will two sets of regulations henceforth apply to greyhound breeders, that is, one from the Irish Greyhound Board and the other under the relevant local authority?  Similarly, will there be two sets of inspections?  What does the Minister envisage will happen in respect of the 1958 Act under which the Irish Greyhound Board, which is doing a great job, is regulating?  What will the local authority do following the enactment of this legislation and the imposition of new regulations on them?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I can only speak in general terms.  This issue arises because, as Members may know, the Hunting Association of Ireland sought exemptions from inspections and the licence fee requirements.  In that instance, I proposed that while people could not be exempted from inspections, as the Hunting Association of Ireland operates on a not-for-profit basis, it was exempted from the fees.  Therefore, I could look at issues in a similar light but have not done so.  Members have just raised this issue in respect of the Irish Coursing Club.  I will try to be as fair as possible but my approach will be similar.  I note the Fine Gael Senators are in conclave but I am trying to give them some idea of my thinking in this regard.

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>While I accept what the Minister has said, I will outline the question on which I seek clarity.  There already is an inspection regime in place under the 1958 Act, which this Bill should address in some way.  It should be either endorsed, superseded or amended.  Members and the industry need clarity in this regard because otherwise there will be duplication in respect of registration fees and inspection regimes.  This Bill certainly will introduce over-regulation and bureaucracy in this area and will bring the viability of the valuable Irish greyhound industry under serious threat at the fundamental levels of breeding, rearing and training at dog establishments.  This is a highly important section of the Bill to which adequate time must be given to achieve full clarity and certainty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to section 13(9), in which a bitch is defined as being &ldquo;a bitch of more than 4 months old that is capable of being used for breeding purposes&rdquo;.  Who in their right mind would have bitches breeding after four months?  Who is advising the Minister in this regard?  I do not wish to be emotive and I do not believe I was emotive earlier.  I certainly am not a headline grabber in this House.  However, I like to deal with practicalities and the Minister likewise should deal in a practical manner in this regard.  Who advised the Minister that people are breeding bitches at four months old?  This is absolutely crazy.  How could anyone support a section of a Bill that refers to bitches for breeding purposes at more than four months?  It is ludicrous and no one could support this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>To be fair, some time ago in response to a request from Members for an extension from three months to a year, the Minister stated the industry has had five years to consider this matter and to get its house in order.  However, only two or three months from the legislation&rsquo;s enactment, when Members ask a straightforward question on <Col N="175"/>whether this Bill will necessitate additional inspections, the Minister will not tell them.

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting my issue.  I appreciate the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  He might believe that the marine, which he is in charge of, is unrelated to the environment, but he would not be right, as my Adjournment matter is on two sewerage schemes, one in Newtowncunningham and another in my home town of Moville.</P>
        <P>I will start with the latter, given the issue has been ongoing for more than 30 years.  I remarked that it was not unrelated to the Minister of State&rsquo;s remit because raw sewage is being pumped into the Foyle in Moville.  The surrounding area does not have a basic sewerage infrastructure and issues with the water supply, which needs to be upgraded, must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Newtowncunningham scheme is in the same situation.  Land is available for purchase to progress the scheme, but the community is concerned that if there is a delay, the land might not be available in future.  It has been identified as a proper site.  Those involved in selling the land and those in the community who are trying to progress the scheme are anxious to know the exact position and the timescale on the scheme&rsquo;s delivery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my area, there has been a controversy about getting a site.  The council decided on a site, had an environmental impact statement, EIS, conducted, went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and put it out for public consultation.  The scheme was supposed to be delivered in the 1990s.  My main <Col N="176"/>issue is the question of how to bring industries into areas that have lost many jobs.  Jobs in the manufacturing sector have been lost all along the Border, including in Inishowen.  We have a heavy reliance on fishing and farming in terms of employment, but even those are in decline.  If we do not have basic infrastructure, how can we encourage people?  Basic infrastructure includes water and sewerage.  The lack of infrastructure has stymied development in my area for some time.  I cannot understand what or who is causing the delay.  Even when times were more flaithi&uacute;lach economically, for want of a better term, the schemes did not progress despite being priorities.  In recent days, there have been many political conspiracy theories, but I almost wonder whether there is a conspiracy not to deliver on sewerage schemes in the Inishowen area.</P>
        <P>We have the badly needed Moville scheme, but extensions are required in Buncrana and facilities are needed in Ballyliffin and Newtowncunningham.  No matter how long they seem to sit as priorities within the council and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, they do not come to fruition.  When a project went before An Bord Plean&aacute;la, people were told the EIS submitted with it was unnecessary.  A couple of months after the EIS was sent back to the council, An Bord Plean&aacute;la decided that it actually was necessary.  Resubmitting it took one year.</P>
        <P>I do not understand the process or why it has been blocked.  This might be a serious allegation, but someone is ensuring that this basic infrastructure is not progressing.  Who is blocking it?  Is it the Department or the council?  Perhaps a more pertinent question is what is blocking it.  Can we get to the crux of the issue?  Is it down to co-funding or can people step forward and say what the problem is?</P>
        <P>If we cannot get basic infrastructure, I cannot fight our corner for inward investment as we need to fight it.  Added value products in the marine sector could be created in Greencastle and Moville, but not without proper waste water treatment centres.  I appreciate this matter is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s direct responsibility, but it has a knock-on effect for his remit.  I hope we will not only receive answers, but direct timelines for the schemes&rsquo; delivery.  Uncertainty and ongoing delays are stymying economic investment in my constituency.</P>

	<P>As the Senator may be aware, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently advised both Houses that he will soon publish a new water services investment programme.  This programme, which will cover the period 2010 to 2012, will set out the water services contracts that are likely to proceed to construction in the next three years and the schemes for which planning will continue during this period.</P>
        <P>The Moville and Greencastle sewerage scheme has been in planning for some considerable time, as stated by Senator Keaveney.  I remember her raising the issue when I was a Minister of State in that Department.  Funding has been provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for this planning work.  I understand that Donegal County Council has completed a preliminary report for the scheme, but an EIS must also to be prepared, as the Senator stated.  The EIS was submitted by the council to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, where such statements are assessed, and no decision has yet been made by the board.  When the certification process is completed, I expect the council will immediately submit the preliminary report and relevant documentation to the Department for consideration.</P>
        <P>There were no proposals to provide a new sewerage scheme to serve Newtowncunningham in the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme for 2007 to 2009, on the basis that it was not of sufficiently high priority within the schemes required in the county.  The priority to be accorded to schemes in County Donegal is a matter in the first instance for Donegal County Council.  Local authorities were asked to submit assessments of needs for water and sewerage services in their areas to the Department by 23 October 2009.  The Department is now finalising the consideration of these assessments, which will form a key input to the <Col N="177"/>development of the 2010 to 2012 water services investment programme.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.</P>
        <P>With the changed economic climate and the completion of the first cycle of river basin management plans by local authorities in the near future, there is a greater need than ever to focus strategic environmental and economic objectives.  The 2010 to 2012 programme will do this by prioritising projects that target public health and environmental compliance issues, support economic and employment growth and offer best value for money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have indicated, the Minister expects to publish the 2010 to 2012 programme shortly and his Department will work closely with Donegal County Council to advance priority schemes identified in the programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister of State can get the information for me without my needing to use a freedom of information request.  From the Department&rsquo;s records, I would like the exact details of the timeline for the Moville sewerage scheme.  The Minister of State remarked: &ldquo;I understand that Donegal County Council has completed a preliminary report for the scheme, but an EIS must also be prepared&rdquo;.  If I recall correctly, the EIS was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at least three years ago.  It might have been four years ago.  The council was told by the board that the EIS was not necessary, but it was resubmitted one year later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What are the precise reasons for the current delays?  I am shocked that small schemes like the Newtowncunningham and Ballyliffin schemes are not even on the radar.  Can the Minister of State give me precise details of the interactions between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Donegal County Council and the period of time involved?  This has been going on for a phenomenally long time and I cannot get to the bottom of why it has not become a reality.</P>

    <Title>Harbourmaster Appointment. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to accept this motion on the Adjournment.  He is familiar with the circumstances of the situation in Castletownbere.  Substantial business is being lost to the town and to the peninsula because we do not have a full-time harbourmaster.  An investment of almost &euro;40 million has been made in Castletownbere Harbour, which is of significant importance for the future, and I accept that the fishing industry is the prime motivator of business in Castletownbere.  Nevertheless, vessels have recently been directed away from Castletownbere because they could not be properly berthed.  A full-time harbourmaster with the goodwill of the district in his focus would ensure no business was lost to the harbour.  The owner of a local oil company which supplies boats in the harbour says his business has declined by more than 50% in the last 12 or 15 months owing to uncertainty.  On four occasions ships of the Naval Service could not come into the harbour because berths were not available.  EiraNova, a Spanish-Irish fish processing company, is now landing many of its vessels in Dingle.  This sends a very bad signal in difficult times.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food indicated that he is anxious that a new harbourmaster be appointed.  I urge that this be done sooner rather than later.  I will be in Castletownbere next Monday to meet 15 companies, big and small, which do business in the harbour.  They are seriously concerned.  One company will lose three or four jobs if the current state of play continues indefinitely.  There has been a lapse of two years during which the former harbourmaster was ill and a temporary person was appointed.  This creates considerable uncertainty at a time when the fishing industry faces significant difficulties.  It would be a pity if related industries on the peninsula and in the greater west Cork area were allowed to suffer.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="178"/>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the up-to-date position on this matter and to acknowledge that he has been raising issues relating to Castletownbere, including this one, for a long time.  The Department has responsibility for the management and development of six fishery harbour centres located at Killybegs, Dunmore East, Howth, An Daingean, Ros an Mh&iacute;l and Castletownbere.  These centres are located strategically around the coast of Ireland and provide an essential service for our fishing fleet and its fishermen.  The six fishery harbour centres accommodate various fishing related industries which generate local employment.  They provide facilities for the repair and maintenance of the shipping fleet and for the support of passenger and car ferries to the islands and play an important role in the Irish tourism and marine leisure industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Castletownbere is Ireland&rsquo;s second largest fishery harbour centre.  In recognition of the important role played by the fishery harbour centres and in this case by Castletownbere, the Department has invested &euro;33 million to date in a major capital infrastructure project to upgrade facilities at the Dinish Island wharf which is located within the Castletownbere fishery harbour centre. Dinish Island is owned and managed by the Department.  Such investments help to underpin and develop the important role that the fishery harbour centres, including Castletownbere, play in the fishing industry and local economies.  The specific importance of Castletownbere can be seen in the fact that the income generated in 2008 at Castletownbere fishery harbour centre was &euro;136,000 and fish landings are in the region of 20,000 tonnes at Castletownbere per year.  This activity sees some of the largest boats in the Irish fishing fleet operating out of Castletownbere with vessels from other EU states. There has also been an increasing volume of commercial and cruise liner traffic at the harbours.</P>
        <P>The role of harbourmaster in any of our fishery harbour centres is varied and demanding and is central to the continued efficient and effective management and development of the harbours.  The principal tasks which harbourmasters are expected to undertake include the enforcement of harbour by-laws, rules and regulations, the maintenance of control over all shipping, fish landings and passengers entering or leaving the port by sea, ensuring compliance with the wide range of health and safety requirements in respect of the harbour, ensuring the proper functioning of all harbour facilities, and supervising the staffing complement on each harbour.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the role undertaken by harbourmasters, specific qualification and experience requirements are in place within the recruitment process.  The most recent appointment of a harbourmaster in Castletownbere was made in October 2005 following an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service.  In November 2009 the harbourmaster in Castletownbere retired from his post.  To address the situation whereby the harbourmaster post was effectively vacant for a prolonged period prior to this, the Department appointed an officer to take on the duties of harbourmaster in an acting capacity with effect from November 2007.  While the position remains that an officer is taking on the role of harbourmaster in an acting capacity, the Department is anxious that the post be filled on a permanent basis now that the previous harbourmaster has officially retired. As I have previously noted, the position of harbourmaster is a specialised post and a targeted recruitment process would have to be put in place to recruit a full-time harbourmaster for Castletownbere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Owing to the need to further control public expenditure and the numbers of public sector employees, the Government decided in March 2009 to introduce a moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service.  This moratorium forms a central plank in this Government&rsquo;s programme to control public expenditure.  It is recognised, however, that in specific and limited cases there will be circumstances in which the specialised nature of certain posts will mean that work cannot be reorganised within a Department to address the effect of a post falling vacant.  It is my view that the post of harbourmaster in our fishery harbour centres is one such post.  Within the terms of the moratorium on public sector promotion and recruitment <Col N="179"/>it is open to Departments to request an exception to the terms of the moratorium. Any such exceptions are understood to arise in very limited circumstances only and require the prior sanction of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  Given the specialised nature of the post and the important role which the fishery harbour centres play, my officials are pursuing this option with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding with a recruitment process to fill existing harbourmaster vacancies in the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for State.  I understand from what he says that the moratorium is tying his hands.  I hope he can use his influence with the Minister for Finance to establish the exception he suggests in his reply and that the post will be advertised and filled before the longest day of the year.</P>

    <Title>Special Educational Needs. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I visited St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s special school in Dublin on Monday morning last.  In the course of our work as politicians, we spend some time visiting schools and trying to understand their needs.  I have never visited a school which does such important and hard work in such difficult circumstances.  This school looks after young men and women who, for different reasons, are not part of our mainstream school system.  They are boys and girls who have real difficulties with their behaviour, lifestyles and family circumstances.  If these pupils did not have a school to look after them, they would face a tough life with very slim chances.  The school does vital work for pupils who do not have anyone to give them the care they need.  It is an amazing school doing badly needed work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise this issue because despite the great work being done and the dedication of the teachers in tough circumstances, which I saw on Monday morning, the school has been housed in pre-fabs for a number of years.  The school has moved through the stages of the Department&rsquo;s schools building programme.  It sought planning permission for a site and school design.  Planning permission was granted in 2008.  The cost of the project has been approved by the Department and the project is moving through the system.  However, progress has now stopped. </P>
        
        <P>The board of management and the teachers need an update from the Department of Education and Science on where the project stands and a commitment that it will move ahead.  I emphasise that they are doing the most difficult work in looking after children who need support and care which they might not be able to get elsewhere.  They are working in prefabs and in conditions which are not suitable.  They had a glimpse of what the future might look like but it has been removed and they do not know where the project stands.  I would like an update from the Minister.  I will certainly make a commitment to do all I can to help them, because they need it, and I hope the Government and the Minister will do the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  It provides an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position on the building project for St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s special school, Dublin.</P>
        <P>The allocation of funding for school buildings in 2010 is just under &euro;579 million.  This represents a significant investment in the schools building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding at a time of great pressure on public finances is a sign of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to investing in school infrastructure and it will permit the continuation of the Department&rsquo;s programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Modernising facilities in our existing building stock, as well as meeting the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Govern<Col N="180"/>ment has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc., leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.</P>
        <P>As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  The original criteria were revised and refined in 2004.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The building project for St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s special school, a youth encounter project, has been assigned a band 1.2 rating.  The brief for the project is to provide a new school on a site currently owned by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  Funding for the design and construction phases of the project are being provided entirely by the Department of Education and Science.  The project will entail demolition of the existing buildings on the site and the construction of a part two-storey, part three-storey school with the main entrance to the school being from Seville Place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  Planning permission has been secured for the project.  Stage 2(a) of architectural planning, which is the developed sketch scheme stage, was approved by the Department in September 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  Unfortunately, it was not possible for the Minister to include this project in the recent announcement of 52 major projects to proceed towards tender and construction this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposed building project for St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s special school will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  However, in the light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for giving me an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position on the school building project for St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s special school.</P>
