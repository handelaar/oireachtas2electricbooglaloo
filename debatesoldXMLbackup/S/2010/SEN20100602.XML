      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Competition (Amendment) Bill 2010 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 2 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House; No. 2, statements on whistleblowing in the financial sector, to be taken at 3 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons; No. 3, statements on the interception of the Gaza-bound humanitarian flotilla, to be taken at 7.15 p.m. and conclude not later than 8.55 p.m., on which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons; and No. 35, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 17 re lifelong learning and upskilling, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 but not earlier than 5 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7 p.m.  There will be a sos between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand Senator Callely will make a statement to the House this morning on the controversy surrounding his expenses.  Members sought such a statement yesterday and expressed serious concerns regarding the media reports on his expenses.  As I will not be provided with an opportunity to respond to his statement later, I note it should be thorough and comprehensive and address all the issues of concern.  The Cathaoirleach will agree that Members cannot afford a continuation of this controversy and that trust and faith in politics must be restored.  I also expect that details of the written statement the Taoiseach has requested of Senator Callely will be made available to this House.  People seek leadership at this difficult time of political and economic uncertainty.  They seek a jobs plan and a proper banking plan.  They demand proper child care services and support for elderly people in the community.  These issues and topics which affect people&rsquo;s lives so seriously are those which Members should address seriously in this House and on which they should seek action.  I will reserve further comment on Senator Callely&rsquo;s statement until later but I wanted to make clear these points because I understand Members will not be in a position to respond immediately in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>On a different issue, I seek a debate in this House on the highly disturbing reports that appeared today regarding Israel, Irish passport holders and the apparent illegal use of their passports.  I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs will address this matter tonight, which is a very important issue for this House to debate.  Second, Members must discuss the cuts in higher education and the information that came to light today on courses and jobs in the higher education sector.  I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on that topic.  While there is much discussion on the smart economy, education cuts at higher level will make it highly difficult to make economic progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the information of the House, on the conclusion of the Order of Business I intend to call Senator Callely to make a personal statement.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="91"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Taoiseach listened to Members on this side of the House yesterday.  I was somewhat disappointed that there was not more of a response from Members on the other side.  No one needed to be disloyal but at least it was good that one voice came from the other side of the House.  However, Members on this side dealt with this matter as an issue for the Seanad, which is how it should be dealt with.  Members should take a view on the issue of politics, the House and its importance.  This can be done without engaging in personal vendettas or without personalising issues.  However, in outlining the circumstances of this entire fiasco to either the Cathaoirleach or the House, if Senator Callely chooses to so do, Members should be clear about what they expect.  I am clear about where this must go.  It should deal with all the unanswered questions and concerns.  It should explain any mistakes or incorrect claims and should calculate precisely and put on the record the quantum of overpayments.  Moreover, it should recognise the damage to politics and the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Callely will make a statement.  I do not want a discussion on this matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition, there should be details on the redress proposed by the Senator.  I do not want anyone to ask subsequently what did Members expect because I have just outlined what I expect, namely, five issues and five matters to be dealt with.  Moreover, this should be placed on the record of the House in a clean, simple and straightforward fashion.  This is how Members will move on and as I also have expressed this view to Senator Callely, there should be no doubt as to where I stand on this matter.  I look forward to what he has to say and there will be time enough to come to conclusions thereafter.  However, it is fair to record the exact reference frame within which Members will judge the impact of his statement and his communication with the Cathaoirleach or both, which I presume will be brought to the attention of the House or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>While the House is navel-gazing on its own issues, the world outside goes on.  The most sickening thing to happen over the weekend was that, at a time when Members have been bailing out banks, looking after the finances of the country and the economy, taking all the difficult measures and agree that ordinary people are experiencing difficulties with regard to loan repayments, jobs, unemployment and so on, the Government began to target lone parents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want any Member from the other side of the House to recount tales of the famous lone parent who has four houses in America and so on.  People on the ground are struggling and I will ask a question of Members on the other side of the House.  At their parliamentary party meetings, someone should ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions should be directed to the Leader on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; who is advising the Government to rip off lone parents?  Who does the sums and picks the easy targets?  Who is so ridiculous and stupid as to put this forward as a policy position that is sustainable, measured, capable of being implemented and acceptable to the people?  It is an absolute disaster.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the other speakers, I welcome the announcement that Senator Callely will make a statement following the Order of Business.  As the other speakers have noted, Members require a full and comprehensive statement to resolve this matter.  It has been a most unwelcome distraction in a week of serious political events both here and elsewhere and has served to bring all Members into disrepute.  This matter must be resolved and the Cathaoirleach deserves an explanation as much as do other Members.</P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>On the aid flotilla, as Senator Fitzgerald stated, Members must have a full debate on the issue tonight.  In addition, Members must hear from the Minister on the issue regarding forged Irish passports.  I commend the bravery of the Irish crew on board the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> and, as I believe will all Members, condemn the accusations made against them this morning by the Israeli spokesperson, Mark Regev.</P>
        <P>On a completely different issue, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to debate a highly important issue that has been overlooked in all the other dramatic events that have happened this week, namely, the issue of climate change and, in particular, the need for climate change legislation.  As Members will be aware, in October 2007 I introduced the Climate Protection Bill which has been languishing on the Order Paper since.  This week in Bonn, a new round of United Nations climate change talks began, which are aimed at securing international agreement on emissions reduction targets.  Although the Government has promised that it will introduce legislation to set domestic binding targets nationally in June, Members still have not had sight of it.  Consequently, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we hold a short debate today on the need for legislation, the Climate Protection Bill on the Order Paper and to hear what the Government has to say about its promised Bill that is long overdue.  It is beyond time for Ireland to sign up to binding targets.  This has been done in Britain and elsewhere and it must be done here this week as a matter of urgency, given the continuation of the United Nations climate change talks.</P>
        <P>I note that a penal reform seminar is being held today on life after prison.  It will discuss the issues of spent convictions and the difficulties prisoners experience in reintegrating into society.  I ask all Members who are able to so do to attend that seminar after the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the statement to be made after the Order of Business today.  It is necessary and should be as comprehensive, as other speakers have indicated.  It must clear up a great deal of uncertainty that has emerged through the reportage and must try to lay to rest a wider perception of the issues in hand and how they might affect every Member of this House, as well as all those who are involved in public life.  Consequently, I hope the statement, when made, will cover all such eventualities.</P>
        <P>As for the debate this evening, I agree with previous speakers on the need to address the illegal, unwarranted and totally over-the-top reaction of the Israeli Government regarding the Gaza flotilla and the other issues in respect of the use of Irish passports.  It also should address several other issues that have questioned the commitment of the Israeli Government &mdash; I stress the Israeli Government rather than the Israeli people &mdash; to the concepts of international law.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proposed amendment to the Order of Business, I will try to set Senator Bacik&rsquo;s mind at rest by stating I attended a meeting earlier this morning and that the heads of the Bill have been prepared.  A series of meetings will be held this evening and the heads of the Bill will be published by the end of this week.  I also am impatient for this legislation to be published, having published a D&aacute;il Bill on the subject several years ago.  I argue that possibly I am at the head of the queue in this regard and think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the health supplement with <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday there was an article on the need for this country to set up its own umbilical cord blood bank.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue because umbilical cord blood can be used to cure many childhood leukaemias, but there are also major prospects of developing the IT sector in that regard because this is high end stuff.  We can use umbilical cord blood in stem cell research and to cure other illnesses, not just leukaemias.  We should have an urgent debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>I, too, ask that Senator Callely come into the House to give a comprehensive answer on the issues raised about him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taxi Regulator&rsquo;s report was published this week.  It was an interesting report which would be a useful subject for debate if the Leader could arrange to have the Minister for Transport come to the House.  I raise a particular aspect which concerns hackney drivers in rural Ireland.  As Members will be aware, hackney drivers operate under a different code of practice from taxi drivers and, as of yesterday, licences are no longer being issued because of the moratorium in place.  While one can transfer a taxi licence, there is no provision under the code for the transfer of a hackney licence.  That is serious because most hackney businesses in rural Ireland are family businesses in which the owner of the firm is aging and wishes to transfer his licence to either his wife or a member of his family.  However, there is no provision to enable him to do this.  I cannot understand why that should be the case because no new extra licences would be created.  This is very worrying and I ask for a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the entire Government on the stance they have taken on the recent outrage.  They have shown calm leadership and are resolute.  They are clear on what they are doing and I am certain they have the support of the entire country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that Senator Callely come into the House to make a statement.  This goes to the heart of the question of integrity in politics and the position, as reported in the newspapers, casts a slur on all of us, which is regrettable.  I welcome the highly unusual interest of the media which I hope will be sustained.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on the situation in Gaza &mdash; a Member of the House, Senator Daly, was actually there &mdash; or on whistleblowing, in respect of which I had an important case <Col N="94"/>which only received attention in the Irish media when it was reported in <i>S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung</i>.  Let us have more attention, not just for the bad stories but the positive work the Seanad does.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Government has withdrawn the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  It was a disgrace.  Two hundred amendments were tabled to it in the D&aacute;il and it was also attacked in this House.  It contained serious human rights violations and probably was unconstitutional.  In an act of extraordinary political effrontry, the Government sought to continue in office, by name, someone who had been discredited in the appeals tribunal.  I am very glad the Bill has been withdrawn and would like the Leader to tell us when the matter will be brought before the House in a proper and decent form.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader tell us when the Government will become the last in Europe to ratify the Aarhus Convention?  I am very concerned at the statements of Sr. Majella McCarron who said yesterday that the right of Irish citizens to a fair trial and due process was being prejudiced, particularly in the Corrib gas field dispute in the absence of ratification of the convention.</P>
        <P>It is my honour to second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator Bacik.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Members will be aware that four or five weeks ago I circulated a copy of Mr. Justice Hardiman&rsquo;s judgment in the case of Murphy <i>v.</i> the Mahon tribunal.  I believe I said at the time that I would draft and bring forward a motion which I have now done.  I have decided, however, not to table the motion in the House but to bring it to the attention of Members.  I have spoken about it to certain Members and circulated it to all Members with a covering letter.  There is an onus on us at this stage to take action.  I had the motion prepared two weeks ago, but, as I was not due to be here last week, I decided to hold it over until now.  I welcome the comments made by the leaders of the parties in the other House.  I remind Members that on 18 September 1997 and 8 October 1997 we asked the tribunals to inquire urgently into matters regarding planning and payments to politicians.  I have used copious extracts from Mr. Justice Hardiman&rsquo;s judgment to support some aspects of the motion and set out that we should convey our concerns regarding costs to the two tribunals.  In that regard, I quote from the judgment:</P>
        <P LI="1">Of the various tribunals of the last two decades, the Flood Tribunal is by far the best known.  In part this is due to its unprecedented length (with the possible exception of its contemporary, the Moriarty tribunal) and its consequent unparalleled expense.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It would be wholly unrealistic not to acknowledge that these costs can only be described as truly enormous.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In response to other comments made, we take money from people who are working hard to earn a living and meet their obligations.  We take money at the point at which they earn their income.  There is a commensurate obligation on us to ensure that money is spent prudently and cost effectively.  The time has come for the House, collectively, on a cross-party basis, to deal with the issue.  I ask the leaders of the parties and groups to come together, either on this or an amended motion, or at the very least to have a debate next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to allow us advance the issue and bring it to a conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="95"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the fact that Senator Callely will make a statement and that, depending on the statement made, it may be referred, if necessary, to a committee of the House which would report as expeditiously as possible to us on the matter which I hope will be satisfactorily put to bed.</P>
        <P>I am very concerned about anecdotal evidence that some officials of NAMA have been in touch with some officials in county councils on the proposed dezoning of lands where these lands have been transferred to NAMA as a result of impaired loans.  That raises a question raised here previously about the powers of NAMA and how absolute they appear to be.  It is not proper or correct that one agency of the State can try to dictate, lay down a policy or ask that others in positions of responsibility lay off, so to speak, as has been reported to me.  That is not good enough.  The matter might be subject to a future discussion if we can acquire more evidence which might be available.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Moriarty tribunal, it may be appropriate, following the meeting which will take place later today between the leaders of the parties, to have a debate in the House because both Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of reference of the tribunal.  In the light of the discussions, decisions or recommendations which may flow from the meeting to be held today, the Leader might keep the matter under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on offshore drilling.  We have a second instance of the impossible happening with the appearance of a very large oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico.  Any of us who has been to the area is aware of the beauty of that environment.  It is sad fact that many thousands of barrels of oil are leaking into the gulf.  We were told this could not happen and that there were fail-safe mechanisms in place, but these mechanisms have not worked.  It happened previously in the case of the Chernobyl plant when we were also told such an accident could not happen.  With that in mind, we must re-examine the question, particularly when this country is, in reality, the Saudi Arabia of green energy.</P>
      
        <P>We have the wind energy and the rivers and know we have the tidal capacity and the waves.  If properly harnessed, like Switzerland harnessed its rivers and exports energy, we could become a net exporter of energy supplies.  We need to put in place the enabling legislation in order that the Spirit of Ireland group can proceed and we can say to the international markets that we are open for business.</P>
        <P>I support two items raised by other Senators, one of which by Senator Twomey was on umbilical cord blood.  There should be a system under which the umbilical cord can be stored for future use, as it contains the individual&rsquo;s own stem cells.  That is the best way of assisting an individual in the future should he or she need to use his or her stem cells.</P>
        <P>As consistently and correctly raised by Senator Walsh, there is the scandal of cost in the courts.  It has become a national scandal at a time when money is tight and could be used for better purposes.  We are spending not millions but hundreds of millions.  That must be brought to an end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Senator Healy Eames, was rapporteur for the Joint Committee on Education and Science in the recent production of the substantial report on the problem of early school leaving.  Will the Leader provide for a debate on this report in the House, if possible?  It certainly needs to be ventilated.  The report and the work done by Senator Healy Eames shows the value of the Oireachtas committees and it needs to be aired and debated.</P>
        <P>The Leader might attempt to arrange to have the Minister for Social Protection, as he is now called, come to the House to discuss social welfare policy.  It is two or three weeks since we debated the possibility of cuts to old age pensions.  It appears a kite was flown by the Minister. <Col N="96"/> Now the agenda has moved on to lone parents.  These are matters for budgetary and Government policy, but we could have a substantive debate on social welfare, which would be useful.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The annual bill for social welfare is considerable.  The figure of 10% is often quoted as being the possible amount of fraud in the social welfare system.  If this problem could be tackled and the money accessed, many genuine persons on social welfare could have their lot improved and we could help deal with the budgetary difficulties.  In advance of the budget and final Government decisions being made, we could have a useful, and constructive debate on social welfare policy.  There are a plethora of schemes.  Those of us who involve ourselves in constituency work almost need a computer to follow them.  There is major scope for rationalisation of the schemes and for administrative tidying up.  We need to have a debate with the Minister.  Everyone could gain from this.  We could put to bed some of these scare stories about old age pensions and lone parent&rsquo;s allowance being cut and we could also attempt to tackle what clearly is a serious fraud problem in the Department where taxpayers&rsquo; money is going amiss.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome Senator Bradford&rsquo;s suggestion on a debate on early school leavers and support his call.  Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s comment that Ireland is the Saudi Arabia of green energy is a good and important statement and I certainly welcome consistent debates on that topic because it is crucial to the future of this country.  I get a little nervous, however, when specific groups are referred to in this context as having a facility to produce energy in the west of Ireland for export to the United Kingdom.  That particular model is not one we should take lightly.  We need to look at energy security for our own country before we start looking at generating energy in Ireland and exporting it.  Anything else is a dangerous way to do our business.</P>
        <P>I also very much welcome the statement from Senator Callely on senatorial expenses which he will make later today.  I reiterate the position of the Green Party that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We cannot comment, as Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Callely will make a statement later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to that point.  It is vital we move to a much more transparent system of expenses.  It is not only Senators or Deputies who need to have their expenses examined.  The entire public service expenses regime throughout the country should be fully transparent, and that goes for broadcasters, public servants and others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that a statement will be made by Senator Callely, a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee to this House, and the clarification that the statement will be made.  However, the matter cannot end there.  I want clarification from the Leader on that point.  This is an issue of alleged fraud which was highlighted in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> article on this matter.  We in this House will be judged not on this incident <i>per se</i> but on how we deal with it.  It is critical there is full and detailed examination of the issue.  A statement will be made.  What is the procedure which follows?  Will the matter be referred to the Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests of Seanad &Eacute;ireann?  Will there be the opportunity for a proper debate in this House in order that we can give our views and assessment as to whether the explanation, which presumably will be given shortly by Senator Callely, bears scrutiny?  I raised this issue yesterday.  The committee, if it is examining this issue, should examine any other similar cases which have occurred since this Seanad came into being in 2007 where someone has claimed a principal <Col N="97"/>residence which does not stand up to scrutiny.  I would appreciate it if the Leader could clarify these points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>All Members will understand the House has no role in that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Leader will take the opportunity to convey to all on the other side of the House that they do not hold a monopoly of concern about the image of this House and that silence does not in any sense mean acquiescence.  We welcome the opportunity the House is providing for Senator Callely to make a statement.  I have served in this House for a long time and, like all colleagues, I take my role seriously.  I am also more than acutely aware of the public perception of this House and of anything that would in any way damage it in the current climate.  There is a major political party which wants to abolish the House.  It is not the first time that this proposal has been brought forward.  It should make all members aware of their own position in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A question to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Leader will take the opportunity to convey that those of us on this side of the House have equal concern for the image of the House.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader consider holding a debate on Northern Ireland?  It is interesting that Northern Ireland has figured prominently in debates in the Seanad down through the years, especially during the period of violence and in the immediate aftermath of the peace process, but it seems to have slipped off the radar.  This request has been prompted by a North-South civic forum that took place last week at Farmleigh House and which was widely reported in the media.  It has been agreed that there should be a Minister for justice, the remaining building block in the St. Andrews Agreement has been put in place and the civic forum is operating.  The other element of the architecture of North-South relations is the parliamentary dimension.  This is in the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement and was in the Good Friday Agreement before it.  We are now 12 years on from the latter and there has been no move to set up a bilateral arrangement between members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Members of these Houses, similar to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on which I had the honour to serve for five or six years and which has been tremendously positive in terms of the relations between these two islands.  Will the Leader investigate what is happening on the proposals to set up a North-South parliamentary tier which would go a long way to advancing closer relations between the North and South?</P>

	<P>I remind Senator Walsh that it was the Government, under his party&rsquo;s stewardship, that set the fees for the tribunals and, in this case, the Government reduced <Col N="98"/>the fees but decided not to apply them to the current tribunals.  It is your Government that has done this.</P>

	<P>In that case, I will ask the Leader.  Does he agree with me that Senator Walsh&rsquo;s amendment would not be necessary if the Government did its work properly?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>I ask that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, come to the House.  For a number of weeks he has been creating tension and fear and causing pandemonium among the elderly and now lone parents.  What is the Government&rsquo;s policy on social welfare?</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Walsh has undertaken very extensive and thorough research on the cost of tribunals and has done so in a non-partisan way.  In addition, he has <Col N="99"/>made the findings of that research available to us.  He has endeavoured on several occasions to generate interest in the matter which has been touched on here, particularly on the Order of Business.  We all understand there are constraints on Members of the Oireachtas in discussing an issue such as this because it was the Oireachtas which set up the tribunals.  No party wants to put its head above the parapet on the issue, lest it will be offside.  I do not think we are serving the interests of ordinary citizens in being cowed or overawed in this way.  Particularly at a time when we are suffering economic deprivation, each and every legislator should endeavour to find ways and means of helping.  It is particularly true that the legal profession has done exceptionally well out of the tribunals which have taken on a life of their own.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that Senator Callely is to make a statement, to which I am sure we will all listen with care and courtesy.  </P>
        <P>I also welcome Senator Twomey and others raising the need for an umbilical cord blood bank.  I know Senator Quinn is also interested in the issue.  This proposal made by Peadar Mac Gabhann as part of the campaign, Your Country Your Call, deserves careful scrutiny and widespread support.  According to the leader of the international marrow donor programme, 70% of patients who need a transplant are unable to find a matching donor.  The transplantation of cord blood is ethically not problematic.  We hear much discussion about stem cells, but here is an area in which Ireland could take the initiative in a way that would unite the community.  There is great hope that in the future embryo cell research can be achieved by more ethical means, which should be a source of hope for us all.  There are 70,000 births in this country each year and this material is being thrown away.  Cord blood is a source of stem cells that ethically could be used in transplants leading to better lives for many.  I suggest we have a debate on the subject and ask for an appropriate initiative to be taken.</P>
        <P>I mention the report today that two thirds of head shops have closed since the ban on legal highs was introduced, but this raises the question of what has happened to the other one third.  We have also heard reports that, as predicted, new substances are appearing in order to get around the measures taken by the Government.  We need to look at the possibility of taking sterner measures to rid our society of this plague completely.  This would involve a change to our planning laws so as to require permission for a change of use from anyone who wishes to open such an establishment.  We also need to look at how existing establishments can be closed down.</P>

	<P>I welcome the safe release of Irish citizens from Israel and commend the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, for their very steady handling of the issue.  They have indicated to the Israeli Government where Ireland stands on it and on the deaths of the nine Turkish citizens.  On the issue of passports, the Government has called in the people responsible for forging Irish passports.  We should also bear in mind that the situation in Gaza stems from the Hamas regime breaking away from Fatah.  Unfortunately, there is no unity among the Palestinians, which is adding to the problem.  I appeal to the Hamas regime to recognise the right of the State of Israel to exist.  It has denied this right and its policy is to destroy the state of Israel.  This has given the Israelis an excuse to impose an embargo, lay siege to Gaza and carry out atrocities there.  Some 1.5 million people are prisoners in Gaza.</P><Col N="100"/>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to express to the Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy, and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na our congratulations for their excellent work last week, in conjunction with the Spanish and Belgian police forces and others further afield.  It was a very sophisticated and successful Interpol and European Union operation.  We cannot prejudge but at least action is being taken against the criminals invovled on the costa.  I compliment the journalist, Paul Williams, formerly of the<i> Sunday World </i>and now of the<i> News of the World</i>, on his thorough investigation of their activities.  I compliment him on his courageous work, as well as all other members of the media who have highlighted the issue and assisted the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which we owe a great debt of gratitude for the courage and conviction of its members.  Those who use heroin, cocaine and other substances are assisting the criminals in question to amass vast fortunes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate on the live register figures released this morning.  They show, sadly, that the overall number unemployed is up by 6,600.  These are the real issues that matter to the people whom we are looking to serve.  They also show that, despite the Government&rsquo;s best efforts, the economy has now turned so many corners that, tragically, it is back to where it started from.  We are facing rising unemployment and rising personal debt.  In addition, as I mentioned yesterday on the Order of Business, banks are still not lending.  On a number of occasions I have called for a debate on the report of the innovation task force, which report the Government is aiming to use in dealing with the issue of unemployment.  It is reported today in the media that one of the hub centres, the national digital research centre, received capital funding of &euro;25 million which the Department of Finance is now claiming did not go through the proper procedure.  This highlights the need for a debate on the issue.  </P>
        <P>I agree with my colleagues that there is a need for the Minister for Social Protection to come to the House to explain his recent comments.  I am not quite sure whom he is looking to protect in his new job but it certainly is not the old and anybody who is feeling vulnerable in our society.  His recent comments have gone a long way towards inflaming their anxieties and as such his comments need to be clarified to the House as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the release of Mr. Shane Dillon and others.  Shane is due to meet the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 12.30 p.m. today to outline his experience of the attack on the flotilla in international waters.  Lest we forget the pressures on Israel, five militants were killed yesterday, three of whom had fired rockets into Israel and two of whom had been in a fire fight with Israeli soldiers.  They had been trying to kill Israeli citizens.  Israel has a right to protect itself.  No one, either inside or outside the Oireachtas, would deny Israel&rsquo;s right to take appropriate measures against those who attack it.  Obviously, however, the attacks in international waters are to be condemned.  I welcome the debate to be held this evening, which the Minister will attend.  </P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan raised an important issue concerning the power of NAMA and its contacts with county councils to prevent dezoning of land.  As the Senator is well aware, this has been a controversial issue in County Kerry, as it is elsewhere.  NAMA has serious powers with regard to reviving and extending planning permission.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange to have a debate on NAMA.  Many developers who bought lands on the fringes of towns that are now being dezoned by one branch of government in the guise of councils under directives from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will end up being administered by NAMA.  Therefore, they will end up on the doorstep of taxpayers and the Government.  It is right and proper that NAMA would try to defend taxpayers&rsquo; interests by contacting county councils and preventing them from dezoning land.  I do not have to tell the good Senator <Col N="101"/>who is an auctioneer of many years standing that the difference between zoned and dezoned land is enormous.  I join him in seeking a debate on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the ban on non-commercial domestic turf cutting which is an important issue for rural Ireland?  If the Minister attended the House for such a debate, we could go a long way towards resolving the matter.  We could make proposals to the Minister if he was in a position to listen to the experience of those affected by the ban.  </P>
        <P>I also seek a debate on funding local authorities, some of which are in dire straits.  We can see the deterioration in the road network, particularly county roads.  The funding of local democracy and local authorities needs to be debated in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have just received a copy of the latest bulletin of the National Suicide Research Foundation which informs us that from 2003 to 2008 some 63,000 people presented themselves at accident and emergency units having deliberately harmed themselves.  Most of the self-harming incidents occurred on Sundays and Mondays.  The bulletin suggests this is due to binge drinking, which affects cognitive behaviour and prevents people from thinking through their problems.  My 2008 document entitled What we can do about suicide in the new Ireland, outlined three key areas for reducing self-harm and suicide.  The one element that jumped out from all the international research was controlling alcohol consumption.  Last week the World Health Organization produced its 2010 world strategy for alcohol consumption.  The strategy included suggestions as to what countries and governments should do to reduce consumption and counter the detrimental effects of excessive indulgence in alcohol.  I seek an immediate debate on the World Health Organization&rsquo;s report on alcohol consumption, as well as what Ireland will do about it.</P>
        <P>Sports events and music festivals should not be associated with alcohol promotion.  I have raised this matter in the House on previous occasions.  Last weekend I heard a spokeswoman for the drinks industry defending sports sponsorship by that sector.  She had a rational argument, but she is not allowing for the fact that some people are not able to control the amount of alcohol they drink.  The grape is a gift from God and I am not opposed to people taking a little alcohol, but it can become an addiction with serious consequences.  I would like the Leader to arrange for such a debate in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on food labelling.  In recent months we have seen ample evidence of widespread abuse of the food labelling system by some multiples.  Some of them deliberately set out to deceive shoppers into believing the farm produce they are purchasing is of Irish origin.  We have seen liberal and deceitful use of the Irish tricolour in certain multiples.  The vast majority of shoppers support the farming sector, first, because it is Irish and, second, because they believe it is of superior quality.  This week the Lidl chain has sunk to a new low in this deceitful action by advertising the wonderfully named Inis Vale brand of lamb chops as being &ldquo;Bord Bia quality assured&rdquo; with an Irish flag.  In the fridges beneath this label, however, they are selling Inis Vale lamb chops.  According to the small print, they are produced in Northern Ireland using lamb from New Zealand.  That is deliberately deceiving people into buying foreign produce, which I would argue is of inferior quality.  We should apply major sanctions to deter multiples from carrying out such fraudulent action in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s remarks on head shops.  Yesterday I raised the issue of three or four young people who had been admitted to Mullingar Regional Hospital over the weekend.  I hope to be in a position to inform the House on the nature of <Col N="102"/>the substance involved.  Senator Mullen is correct in stating new products are coming on the market which are not covered by legislation.  The Government will have to examine this problem, as will Members of the Oireachtas collectively.  </P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on litter.  On my way here some days ago I saw two bags of rubbish on the N4 at different locations.  As if that was not bad enough, I saw more bags of rubbish on the side of the M4.  Those responsible can only be termed as environmental assassins and should be in jail.  There are certainly people in jail for less.  The relevant local authorities, including Kildare and Meath county councils, should try to apprehend those responsible, bring them to court and put them behind bars where they belong.  These people are dragging down the good name of this country.  I ask that something be done about it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy that there will be a debate this evening on the recent incidents in international waters involving the over-reaction of the Israeli forces.  I do not propose to pre-empt that debate or rehash what has already been said here.  It is noteworthy, however, that one of the Irish people awaiting trial in Israel is Fiachra &Oacute; Luain who was a candidate in last year&rsquo;s European Parliament elections.  He acquitted himself creditably while canvassing in the west constituency.  With Senator Paschal Mooney, I met Mr. &Oacute; Luain in a number of local radio stations across the area.  He performed well and was committed to the democratic process.  He is an idealist and his current predicament is worthy of recording in this House.</P>
        <P>I want to raise another issue.  Every family&rsquo;s nightmare is that one of their relatives will be diagnosed with cancer.  For that reason, it was disturbing to read a report in a newspaper stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">Cancer patients are having their treatments delayed and in some cases are dying because of hospital-acquired infections, the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (RCPI) said yesterday.  Consultant medical oncologist Prof Peter Daly said at least one in 10 patients receiving intensive chemotherapy was likely to contract a healthcare-associated infection.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Infections are rampant in hospitals and infecting cancer patients.  The report quoted Professor Hilary Humphreys as saying up to 10% of patients were getting such infections.  I suggest single rooms should be made available in hospitals for cancer patients, especially those with blood cancers who have a particularly high risk of infection.  While this issue might affect a minority of people, it is extraordinarily serious for the families concerned.  I want the Leader to react to my comments and bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children immediately.  If possible, it should be the subject of a debate in this House.  At a minimum, the Minister should be asked to react to it at once.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader is aware of my concern about the length of time it takes to get things done in this country.  The debate in this House on the Human Body Organs and Human Tissue Bill 2008 which provides for presumed consent was adjourned two years ago because the Minister said she wanted to consider the matter and consult certain interests before deciding whether presumed consent should be allowed.  Almost two years have passed since.  It seems we do not regard speed as important.  People are dying because they are unable to get body organs that should be available.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen and Twomey have mentioned that we do not have an umbilical cord storage bank in Ireland.  We should be storing umbilical cords rather than throwing away approximately <Col N="103"/>70,000 of them each year.  An interesting article in yesterday&rsquo;s health supplement with <i>The Irish Times</i> opened our minds to the opportunities in this area.  Many cases of multiple sclerosis, lymphoma, leukaemia and other cancers could be solved in this way.  It is totally ethical.  There is no problem with stem cells in this area.  When one mentions stem cells, one sometimes raises many concerns and worries.  In this case, we can take steps to save lives.  People are dying because we are not taking the initial steps.  No huge costs are associated with this.  Storage takes place in other countries.  We can do it here.  I urge the Leader to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to what we can do immediately in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs at his earliest convenience regarding a report on the BBC news website that the Turkish Government is considering sending a gunboat to accompany the <i>Rachel Corrie</i> as it moves towards the blockade off the coast of Gaza?  As this report is on a website, I cannot confirm it to be absolutely the case.  It deserves the immediate attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We need to contact the Turkish Embassy to ascertain the accuracy or otherwise of the report.  If it is true, the <i>Rachel Corrie</i> will be used as an extremely vulnerable pawn in what could become a very dangerous conflict between two countries that have seriously damaged relations with each other since last Monday when nine Turks were killed on a passenger liner.  There are five Filipino seamen, six Malaysians and five Irish citizens on the <i>Rachel Corrie</i>.  In the interests of their safety, will the Leader contact the Minister as soon as he can to ask him to call the Turkish ambassador on this matter?</P>

I support the call for a change to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Donohoe in calling for a debate on unemployment.  Today&rsquo;s live register figures show that an extra 5,000 people were unemployed in May.  If one drills down into those figures, one will see that 2,600 of those involved, or more than 50% of the increase, are under the age of 25 years.  This is a real issue because it is having an impact on people&rsquo;s self-confidence and self-worth.  It relates to what Senator Mary White said.  We should be concerned about this increase.  I do not think we are providing enough retraining opportunities or places on post-leaving certificate courses.  We are not doing enough to help mature students who joined courses on the understanding that they would get grants.  That understanding is now being reneged on by the Government.  I would like to see a debate on unemployment, especially youth unemployment, as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I join Senator Cannon in asking for a debate on matters relating to retailing and food labelling.  I spoke a number of weeks ago about the appointment by the Government of a retail strategy co-ordinator.  I understand the former European Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, was approached to take up the position but he declined, having initially indicated that he would accept it.  The Minister said he would look for another appointment to be made.  Will the Leader clarify the position in that regard?  Are we any nearer to appointing someone to that position?</P>
        <P>Last Tuesday many Senators spoke about issues concerning the care of the elderly in nursing homes, in other institutions and in the home.  Are we going to have the debates that were requested next week and the following week?  I understand the schedule was changed this week for obvious reasons.</P><Col N="104"/>
        <P>On the proposed carbon tax, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment received a presentation from a group of solid fuel suppliers last week.  They outlined their significant reservations about the introduction of a carbon tax on their products.  Much of what they supply is brought into this jurisdiction by solid fuel merchants from Northern Ireland who are not subject to the carbon tax or some of the other regulations to which suppliers in the Twenty-six Counties are subject.  Will the Leader arrange a discussion on the issue?</P>

	<P>I wish to clarify that No. 1, Competition (Amendment) Bill 2010 &mdash; Second Stage will adjourn not later than 2 p.m.  I think I said it would conclude not later than 2 p.m.  I hope I have clarified the matter.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators Boyle, Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik, Norris, Coghlan, Regan, Mooney, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Leyden, Daly, O&rsquo;Reilly and Dearey who expressed serious concerns about levels of trust and faith in public life and public representatives.  They have referred to everything we stand for and the people we represent.  It is a great privilege to be a Member of Parliament.  I join the Taoiseach in asking Senator Callely to make a statement in the House this morning after the Order of Business.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for making this possible.  Those of us who are privileged to be Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas wish to enjoy the faith and trust of the people we are honoured to represent.</P>
        <P>Serious concerns were expressed and updates were sought about what is happening in Israel and Gaza following the interception of the flotilla of ships earlier this week.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, will come to the House at 7.15 p.m. and will be here until 8.55 p.m.  This serious matter has been brought to the attention of the House.  I will immediately pass on to the Minister our serious concerns about the matter brought to our attention by Senator Dearey.  We want to support the Government in everything it is trying to do to help to end this serious debacle.</P>
        <P>Calls were made for a debate on everything to do with education.  I agreed on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business to arrange such a debate.  I will have no difficulty with it taking place.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Norris and Hannigan asked for a debate on climate change.  I will have no difficulty in arranging such a debate.  The Deputy Leader of the House has mentioned that the heads of the climate change Bill are being prepared and that the Bill will be brought to the House in the next session.  We all welcome the great progress being made.  Senators Twomey, Mullen, Quinn and Mooney outlined to the House the need for an umbilical cord blood bank, an issue which we all must take seriously.  Great progress can be made in this area.  I have no difficulty with the Minister for Health and Children coming to the House to debate the matter.  As she will attend the House in the coming weeks, Senators can bring this matter to her attention then.  There will be unanimity in the House on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan outlined his serious concerns regarding difficulties experienced by the taxi industry.  I will allow time for this to be debated.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  A new Bill has been submitted and we look forward to it coming to the House for its consideration.</P>
        <P>Senators Walsh, Coghlan, Hanafin, Buttimer and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the matter of the tribunals of inquiry.  Senator Walsh has spent an enormous amount of time dealing with tribunal issues.  The excessive high costs were never envisaged, nor was the 13-year timeframe.  After 13 years, <Col N="105"/>a sense of urgency does not come into the matter.  I will have no difficulty in meeting the leaders to discuss the matter and find common ground on it.</P>
        <P>Senators Coghlan and Daly raised issues concerning NAMA and banking.  I gave a commitment yesterday on the Order of Business that we would debate banking issues, NAMA and the challenges facing the Minister for Finance once a month.  We will have a lengthy all-day debate before the summer recess on these matters.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin raised the matter of offshore oil drilling and the terrible situation in which the people of America find themselves with the major oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico.  It goes to show that when human error occurs, it can be very destructive.  We wish everyone well in the clean-up operation and will have no difficulty in having the issue debated at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senators Bradford, Coghlan and Buttimer called for a debate on all matters pertaining to social welfare.  The next budget is not due until December.  This year&rsquo;s Social Welfare Bill will be before the House for its consideration in three weeks time.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for a debate on energy security.  I have already given such a commitment and have no difficulty with it taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney called for a debate on Northern Ireland and, as a Member living near the Border, made certain proposals in this regard.  I have given a commitment that the Taoiseach will return to the House before the summer recess at which time we can review the progress made in Northern Ireland, particularly following the recent UK general election, the challenges we face and Senator Mooney&rsquo;s proposals to assist North-South relations.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen and Glynn raised the matter of new substances being sold in head shops.  If they are not covered in the legislation, they should be covered by ministerial order.  When these new substances emerge, they should be banned in law by ministerial order within five minutes.  All sides of the House are united concerning whatever we can do to eliminate the plague and the scourge of head shops.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden congratulated Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the recent arrests, which extended to Europe, and success in tackling organised crime.  I join the Senator in congratulating the Commissioner and his team.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Donoghue and Hannigan called for a debate on employment.  As all Members know, it is the Government&rsquo;s number one priority.  The unemployment rate is far too high and we want to do anything we possibly can to reduce it.  Last Saturday at our major conference in Athlone, the Taoiseach made a major statement on the Government&rsquo;s policy in this regard.  As has been said, 20 years ago 900,000 people were employed; today, it is 1.87 million, an increase of 880,000 people from the last recession.  The Government&rsquo;s priority, and that of parliamentarians, has to be to see what we can do to assist those who are unemployed, particularly in the 18 to 25 year old age bracket.  It would squeeze a tear from a stone to see well educated and good young men and women available for work but none available for them.  The Government is endeavouring to do everything it possibly can.  If any Member, no matter what side of the House he or she is on, has a good suggestion we want to hear it.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke called for an urgent debate on restrictions on turf-cutting.  It is a timely call and I will have no difficulty in debating the matter.  As one who lives in an area that includes the Bog of Allen, I am always baffled going through the bog that on one side of the road a national agency can harvest 2,000 acres of turf, while on the other side local people cannot cut it for their private use.  This is not common sense.  It is unfair.  I will allow whatever time is necessary to debate this issue before the summer recess.</P>

	<P>Senator Burke also called for a debate on local authority funding.  This is an urgently needed debate because the challenges facing local authorities are changing.  Rates for retailers are too high and they cannot afford to pay water charges.  An urgent examination of the challenges facing local authority funding is required.  I will have this debate take place before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White raised the report on self-harm.  She is doing Trojan work in this area.  She also called for a debate on control of alcohol consumption.  In moderation, everything is acceptable.  It is the abuse of alcohol on which we are all up in arms.  I will have no difficulty in allocating time for a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senators Cannon and John Paul Phelan called for a debate on food labelling and outlined the use of the Irish flag on the Inis Vale brand which contains New Zealand lamb.  The former Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business carried out an in-depth investigation into the groceries order.  Deputy Edward O&rsquo;Keeffe who has much expertise in this area pointed out the dangers in labelling on many occasions.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment must debate this as a matter of urgency.  I will pass on a note to the committee&rsquo;s Chairman after the Order of Business to ensure such a debate takes place in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on litter.  This is particularly timely considering all our Tidy Towns committees are endeavouring to show off our beautiful towns and villages to their very best.  I support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s request and will try to have it included before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly called for a debate on cancer treatment with the Minister for Health and Children.  She will be in the House in the coming weeks and Senators can bring this matter to her attention then.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn introduced the Human Body Organs and Human Tissue Bill two years ago.  Recently he was given a five-month timeframe concerning his Bill on subcontractors.  We welcome the great work he has done in that area.  I will endeavour to find out the up-to-date position on the consultation period for the Human Body Organs and Human Tissue Bill and return to the House in the next week on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan called for a debate on care of the elderly.  I gave a commitment yesterday to arrange such a debate.  He also called for a debate on the carbon tax and Irish suppliers being affected by products coming from the North of Ireland.  I have no difficulty in having a debate on this matter also.</P>

	<P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to make this statement to the House.  I am conscious of the comments of my colleagues on the media presentation of my expenses and I very much regret any distraction for this House and its Members.  I am equally conscious of my family, wider circle of friends and loyal supporters.  I recognise the difficulties this matter has caused and I am prepared to co-operate to address all issues satisfactorily.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Most people will appreciate that this issue is difficult to address by way of a simple statement here today.  The expenses regime is complex and there are anomalies in the system.  Like others, I am deeply upset and concerned at the presentation of my expenses and the negative complexion this has put on me, this House and the profession of politics.  As the matter is complex and there is a full file of documents that clearly indicate my position from the time of my appointment to Seanad &Eacute;ireann to the present day, I most respectfully request that I be afforded the opportunity to go before the Select Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests and submit myself to its investigation into this matter and assessment of any wrongdoing, if any.</P>
        <P>The original media story was based on freedom of information requests which, in their published form, do not give a full picture.  I am satisfied that the select committee should consider <Col N="108"/>all documents relating to my file to enable it to obtain the full facts of the case.  I have always indicated that I have a west Cork residence, a Clontarf home and a constituency office in Dublin North-Central.  I travel from all three, depending on circumstances, to fulfil my Seanad duties.  I understand I have complied with the regulations.  There are anomalies in the expenses regime which warrant consideration and I have raised such matters with the Oireachtas.  As the issue of expenses is very complex, I hope the select committee will investigate all issues relating to my case and come to a speedy conclusion.  I will fully co-operate with the select committee and comply with any and all requests and directions given by it.  I look forward to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of the issue.</P>

    <Title>Competition (Amendment) Bill 2010: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Competition (Amendment) Bill 2010 is targeted and focused and has the purpose of amending section 35 of the Competition Act 2002 to enable the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to appoint whole-time members, on a temporary basis, to fill current vacancies in the Competition Authority.  A number of recent departures at Competition Authority member level, the most recent being last week, in addition to a vacancy being carried since January 2009, have resulted in the membership of the authority being reduced to below the statutory minimum requirement, giving rise to concerns regarding the proper functioning of the authority.</P>
        <P>Following the departure of the authority&rsquo;s chairperson in March to take up another position, the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, appointed an existing member as chairperson of the authority on a whole-time temporary basis.  This appointment is for a period of just under six months, at which stage the Minister expects a chairperson will have been selected for appointment following an open Public Appointments Service competition.  While creating a vacancy at ordinary member level, the appointment of the temporary chairperson ensured the authority was properly constituted, in accordance with the requirements of the Competition Act 2002, and able to carry out all of its statutory functions between the period from mid-March to the end of last week.  The resignation of another member, effective from 30 May, has resulted in the membership of the authority being reduced to below the statutory minimum requirement.</P>
        <P>The Minister is concerned that the current improperly constituted authority is, as matters stand, unable to fulfil its statutory obligations and that any decisions made by members in such circumstances could be the subject of a legal challenge.  Of particular concern are those functions specifically reserved, by statute, to the authority acting as a decision-making collective body.  These functions include the making of a declaration under section 4(3) of the Competition Act 2002 that a specified category of agreement, decision or concerted practice is not prohibited if it complies with the conditions set out in section 4(5); the power to initiate criminal proceedings for an offence relating to anti-competitive behaviour or practices under sections 6, 7 or 26 of the 2002 Act or for relief in civil proceedings under sections 14 and 15C of that Act; and the power to make a phase 2 merger determination under section 22 of the 2002 Act.</P>
        <P>Powers are also devolved from the European Union to designated national competition bodies.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the relevant body is the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P>It is essential that the performance of the Competition Authority of its functions, for example, the making of a decision to either approve or prohibit a merger, be on a sound legal footing and not subject to uncertainty as to its validity.  The amendment to section 35 of the Competition Act 2002, as provided for in the Bill, and the subsequent appointment by the <Col N="109"/>Minister of temporary whole-time members will safeguard the integrity of the authority&rsquo;s workings and decision making power and will, following the making of the appointments, reinstate the membership level above the statutory minimum requirement.</P>
        <P>Membership of the Competition Authority is governed by section 35(1) of the Competition Act 2002 which provides that the authority shall consist of a chairperson and between two and four other whole-time members, as may be determined and appointed by the Minister; a whole-time member appointed by the Minister to cover a period of temporary inability by a member to discharge his or her duties and; such number of part-time members as the Minister may determine and appoint.  Under the 2002 Act, the appointment of a chairperson and a minimum of two other members satisfies the statutory minimum membership requirement.  The appointment of a person to replace a member who is temporarily unable to discharge his or her functions, or the appointment of a part-time member, as provided for in section 35(1)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), does not satisfy the minimum membership criteria.</P>
        <P>The legal mechanism under the Competition Act 2002, in respect of replacing whole-time members, is through the holding of a Public Appointments Service competition.  The actual mechanics of advertising, interviewing and then taking into account the need for successful applicants to give some months notice to their current employers &mdash; possibly up to three months in some cases &mdash; mean that the entire recruitment and selection process could take a number of months to conclude.  The Minister has clearly stated he must ensure the Competition Authority can function with the requisite statutory membership during this period.</P>
        <P>The Bill will allow for the appointment of whole-time members for the period to provide cover up to the time when whole-time members are appointed following the holding of a Public Appointments Service competition.  It provides that these temporary appointments will be made having regard to the competencies laid down in section 35(5) of the 2002 Act for the appointment of members. That provision requires appointees to &ldquo;have sufficient expertise in or experience of one or more of the following areas, namely, law, economics, public administration, consumer affairs or business generally&rdquo;, thereby ensuring only suitably qualified and experienced people can be appointed to the Competition Authority, even on a temporary basis.  The integrity of the authority&rsquo;s decision making power will, therefore, continue to be protected, both in terms of the number and quality of its members.</P>
        <P>The appointment of members under this legislation will be short-term, for a defined period and will conclude when the whole-time members have been appointed under the Public Appointments Service-run open competition.  Immediately following enactment of the Bill, the Minister intends to make two appointments to the Competition Authority. This will result in membership of the authority consisting of the chairperson and three whole-time members.  This arrangement will prevail until successful candidates are appointed from the Public Appointments Service competitions that will be held.</P>
        <P>I turn to the provisions of the Bill and will explain what each is designed to achieve.  Section 1, definition, and section 3, Short Title and citation, are standard legislative provisions, while section 2 is the core of the Bill.  It provides for the amendment of section 35 of the Competition Act 2002 to allow for the appointment on a whole-time basis of temporary members, including a chairperson, to fill a vacancy occurring in the Competition Authority&rsquo;s membership arising from the death, retirement, resignation, disqualification or removal from office of a member.  It is envisaged that these temporary appointments will be for a period of up to six months. The Bill also provides that the Minister may extend this period of appointment for a period or periods up to a maximum of a further six months.  It is intended that the provision allowing for an extension of the appointment will only be used in specific circumstances, for example, in the event that the recruitment and selection process is not finalised or the successful candidate <Col N="110"/>is not in a position to take up his or her appointment within the initial six-month time period.  Appointees to these temporary positions must, in the opinion of the Minister, possess sufficient expertise in or experience of one or more of the following areas: law, economics, public administration, consumer affairs or business generally.</P>
        <P>The Bill will also provide that a temporary appointee remains eligible for appointment, through an open competition, as a whole-time member within the Competition Authority, unless he or she has been removed in accordance with the existing provisions of section 35(12) of the Act.  That provision permits the removal of a member who has become incapable through ill-health of performing his or her duties or whose removal appears to the Minister to be necessary in the interests of the effective and economical performance of the functions of the authority.</P>
        <P>Following enactment of the Bill and the making of the necessary temporary appointments, my next legislative priority in this area will be the Bill to give effect to the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  Since being announced as part of the rationalisation plan for State agencies in the 2009 Budget Statement, the Minister&rsquo;s Department has been working with both bodies to ensure a smooth transition from the two separate entities to a single dual functioning body responsible for competition and consumer protection.  As both bodies were established under statute, it is necessary to give effect to the newly merged body by way of primary legislation.</P>
        <P>At the time the merger of the two bodies was announced, work on a review of the operation and implementation of the 2002 Competition Act was well under way.  The submissions received following a public consultation process were being considered, as were the report and recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers.  Rather than give effect to the amalgamation of the authority and the agency in stand-alone legislation, to be followed in due course by legislation to amend, reform and update the 2002 Act, it was decided to introduce a single comprehensive Bill that would create the new consumer and competition body; update existing competition law; strengthen the public interest test in respect of media mergers, in line with the report of the advisory group on media mergers; make some minor amendments to the consumer protection legislation; and give effect to the Government commitment under Towards 2016 regarding the exemption of certain specified categories of vulnerable workers from competition law.</P>
        <P>While work on the draft legislation has been progressing on this basis, a number of other developments have arisen which have led to additional requirements in the Bill.  The renewed programme for Government contains a specific commitment to &ldquo;implement a code of practice for doing business in the grocery goods sector to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers&rdquo; and &ldquo;to review progress of the code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code&rdquo;.  A provision to place a code for retailers and suppliers on a statutory basis will be included in the proposed Bill.  As the House may be aware, efforts are under way to explore with all the relevant stakeholders the possibilities of agreeing a voluntary code of conduct in the grocery goods sector which would respect the interests of all parties.  In fact, Mr. John Travers has been appointed as a facilitator in this regard.  This offers stakeholders the opportunity to develop a voluntary code most suited to the dynamics of the Irish grocery goods sector and which would form the basis of any subsequent statutory code.</P>
        <P>This all-encompassing approach to the draft legislation has, to some extent, delayed the legislation for rationalisation of the two bodies.  The Minister is, however, of the view that we will be better served in the long run by a single legislative measure that establishes the new body and provides for a combined and updated consumer and competition code, with appropriate enforcement provisions being given to the new body.  Work on the draft heads of the <Col N="111"/>Bill is at an advanced stage and the Minister intends to bring them to the Cabinet within the coming weeks.  Until they have been approved by the Government, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the specifics contained therein.  I know Senators are awaiting the approval and subsequent publication of the Bill and may seek to avail of this opportunity to progress issues contained in that Bill.  During the debate on this Bill in the other House Deputies raised a number of competition related issues such as a possible exemption from competition law for certain categories of workers and professions, as well as the code of conduct for the grocery goods sector.  In addition, proposals for possible Oireachtas scrutiny of ministerial nominations for appointment and follow-up action on recommendations made by the Competition Authority were also articulated during that debate.  I urge Senators to await publication of that Bill.  The Bill before us is focused and defined.  It deals with the membership and make-up of the authority.  It is imperative that it be passed by the Oireachtas without undue delay in order that the Minister can appoint the members in sufficient time to avoid a reduction in membership levels below the statutory minimum. The matters to be included in the comprehensive consumer and competition Bill, including many of the issues raised in the debate on this Bill to date, will in due course be considered and debated, no doubt in great detail, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>While the Bill before us is a short one, for all that, it is extremely important.  I look forward to working with Senators on Committee and Report Stages and will be happy to reply to any questions that arise.  Substantial legislation on the amalgamation of the two agencies will soon be published and discussed in both Houses.  The Competition (Amendment) Bill 2010 deals with membership of the Competition Authority and will ensure it is in line with statutory minimum requirements.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  He outlined the main purpose of the legislation, which is to enable the Competition Authority to continue its work.  Fine Gael will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but will seek to make a number amendments on Committee Stage.  The authority is an important State agency and it has an important role.  The limited implementation of reports it has produced and recommendations it has made by the Government during my time in politics has been remarkable.  It raises a broader question about how the Oireachtas and the Government goes about implementing the contents of its reports.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the new system whereby the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation will appoint temporary members to the authority, which is the main thrust of the legislation.  The provision dealing with appointments in the 2002 Act is vague.  The Minister of State outlined the criteria appointees have to meet if they are selected.  Section 35(5) states that for someone to be eligible for membership of the authority he or she must have &ldquo;sufficient expertise in or experience of one or more of the following areas, namely, law, economics, public administration, consumer affairs or business generally&rdquo;.  Any member of the population could qualify on that basis.  We are all consumers and the Act does not go into detail to define what is &ldquo;sufficient expertise&rdquo;.  The system of appointing temporary members is vague and it is a far cry from what we were told would happen when the Government was formed.  Subsequently, there were different pronouncements by Ministers regarding appointments to the boards of State agencies.  They said they would have to be not just political friends of the appointing Minister and they would have to prove they had a vigorous and thorough understanding of the brief of the body to which they were being appointed.  Fine Gael and other parties have consistently proposed that appointees to State bodies should be subject to questioning by the relevant Oireachtas committee.  In this case, it is the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I will table an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage.</P><Col N="112"/>
        <P>Much of the good work done by the Competition Authority over the past 12 years remains to be implemented.  It has produced significant reports on a number of sheltered professions, in particular, and most, if not all, of the authority&rsquo;s recommendations relating to dentists, architects, barristers and other professional service providers have not been implemented by the Government.  Where recommendations were implemented, no explanation was furnished by the Government as to why they were implemented while others were ignored.  It is unsatisfactory that the Government would establish an agency with an important function and then proceed to ignore many of its recommendations without proffering an opinion as to why they were not being implemented.  The Government may be correct in many cases not to introduce the changes recommended but, in the absence of an analysis or commentary on why certain decisions are made and others are not, the entire scenario is unsatisfactory.  There needs to be a complete change in how Departments deal with the recommendations of the Competition Authority and other arms of Government.  There needs to be much more transparency and clarity about why certain decisions are made and others are not.  The Minister of State said the heads of the new competition Bill are being discussed and they are due before the Cabinet in the not too distant future.  I hope that legislation, which will amalgamate the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, will address the implementation of recommendations from the authority.  The current scenario is highly unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>The role of the authority is narrow.  It is completely focused on the relationship between the consumer and the retailer.  I refer to the relationships between retailers and suppliers, which relates to my greatest criticism of the operation of the authority.  Most of the work it has done is good but officials have never focused on the other aspect of competition, which is the relationship between the retailer and the supplier, whether the supplier is a farmer or a wholesaler who sells a product to put it on our shelves.  Significant work must be done in this regard and I hope the new Bill later this year will give major powers to the new amalgamated body to examine this relationship.  Members on all sides of the House and the enterprise committee have consistently raised the issue of the relationship between large multiples and their suppliers as well as consumers who buy the products at the end of the day.</P>
        <P>Representatives of a body appeared before the enterprise committee recently.  They referred to competition law and the role of the Competition Authority and whether the primary legislation needed to be amended to ensure a focus on other aspects of competition and not only on the relationship between the consumer and the person from whom he or she is buying a product or service.  I hope when the legislation comes before the Oireachtas later this year the Minister of State will give an honest opinion on how he feels competition law should be implemented in future.  We have focused primarily on the relationship with consumers and, while it is vital and is the most obvious aspect of competition, there is much more to competition than just the ultimate relationship between the supplier and purchaser of a service.</P>
        <P>I will not oppose Second Stage but I will seek to make a number of amendments on Committee Stage to ensure the appointment of temporary members to the authority is done through a more transparent process, that these members will be subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas before they are appointed and that the criteria relating to the qualifications they hold will be more stringent than the vague definition mentioned by the Minister of State.  While I do not oppose the Bill, it is unsatisfactory that we have to rush it through to ensure the authority can continue to function.  I do not know whether the primary legislation was too restrictive and did not allow for enough members to be appointed in the first place in the event of resignation and retirement but we have arrived at a position that emergency legislation has had to be introduced to ensure it maintains its role.  I do not understand how the process laid down in the original legislation for the appointment of members could not have been set in train before <Col N="113"/>now to ensure we did not arrive at this juncture and have to pass emergency legislation.  For that reason it is somewhat unsatisfactory.  Given the significant function of the authority, it is crucial this legislation should be passed to ensure it can continue its important work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my good friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2010 and very much appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s openness in the latter part of his contribution in which he indicated to the House what is coming.  I support much of what the previous speaker said about the outline of that legislation.  It will be very important and its title will be along the lines of the consumer and competition Bill.  More importantly, the clarity of its content will be very significant.  I gather, from inquires I have made with the Department, that it will be sizeable legislation.  I understand that currently there are in the region of 140 sections, which means there will be a sizeable measure of detail.  I look forward to participating in the debate when the Bill comes to the House.</P>
        <P>It was useful that the Minister of State indicated to the House what was coming because it puts the legislation before the House into greater context.  This is a very short Bill which is focused and narrow in its scope.  One can now understand why that is so, especially after hearing what the Minister of State had to say about the current format of the Competition Authority, its board membership and so forth.</P>
        <P>The Bill is prompted by a number of recent departures of members of the Competition Authority.  The membership had dropped below its minimum permitted level and this situation warranted immediate correction.  It is crucial that the authority, given its importance, is properly constituted in accordance with the Act.  We all appreciate that the Competition Authority is very specialised in its work, dealing as it does with issues such as mergers, monopolies, cartels and so on.  It is vital the performance and operation of the authority are not subject to any level of uncertainty.  The amendment to section 35 of the Competition Act 2002, as provided by this Bill, will safeguard the authority&rsquo;s workings and its decision making.  This is necessary since the current legislation does not properly provide for the situation that has arisen where a number of vacancies present at short notice.  The Act states that all appointments at member level must by way of a Public Appointments Service, PAS, competition.  It takes time to organise such a competition.  I am not fully familiar with the methodology but I presume there are procedures in place and each step must be adhered to.  None the less, I like to believe we can fast-track such procedures.  Even if we do and the successful candidates are identified and are willing to serve, I presume they will have to undergo a procedure following the successful competition.  They will also have to give notice arising from existing commitments and so forth.  I certainly understand where the Minister of State is coming from when he says this could take some time to organise and that the Bill before us is required to accommodate events.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the appointment of members under the legislation will be short-term, especially in light of the forthcoming Bill.  This will be a complex legislation and I do not know when it will be passed.  That means we do not know how long that piece of string will be just yet.  The Minister for State said the appointment of members under the Bill before the House would be short-term, for a defined period and would conclude when whole-time members were appointed under the open PAS competition.  There are not too many options in this regard and I presume this is the most appropriate way to go.</P>
        <P>Why do we find ourselves in this position?  We are learning every day, so if people either leave, become ill, die or whatever, vacancies will arise.  I hope the new consumer and competition Bill will adequately provide in the event of issues arising.  It is the common lot of humanity to learn from previous experience.</P><Col N="114"/>
        <P>The proposed legislation provides for the amendment of section 35 of the Competition Act 2002 to allow for the appointment of the temporary members, including the chair, and to fill a vacancy in the authority&rsquo;s membership arising from death, retirement, resignation, disqualification and removal from office, as the Minister of State indicated.  While the requirement to appoint a member, following the PAS competition, may be dispensed with to avoid any doubt, the Bill provides that the Minister, if he so desires, may continue to fill any such vacancy through the PAS recruitment process.  I gather these temporary appointments are for a maximum period of six months which may be extended for a further six months.  It is intended that the provision allowing for the extension of the appointment would be used only in specific circumstances.  This would be where either the PAS recruitment or the selection process has not been finalised or the successful candidate is not in a position to take up the appointment within the defined period.</P>
        <P>I gather from the information available that appointees to these temporary posts must possess sufficient expertise or experience of one or more of the following areas: law, economics, public administration, consumer affairs and business generally.  The Bill also provides that a temporary appointee is eligible for appointment as a whole-time member within the authority unless he or she has been removed in accordance with the existing provision of section 35(12) of the Act.</P>
        <P>This is a very focused and short Bill.  It is something we would all sign into and I do not foresee any difficulty.  We would all want to ensure the Competition Authority is able to perform its duties and that there is no question of any doubt in relation to challenges or any other issues of which we may not yet be aware.</P>
        <P>I welcome what the Minister of State has done and I wish him well.  I hope we shall pass this Bill quickly and move on.  I look forward to the Minister of State coming back to the House with the new legislation he announced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome to the House, as is the Bill.  I believe the Bill is necessary and that we must have it.  I know it is temporary legislation until the main Bill is enacted, and I have read what the Minister of State has said.</P>
        <P>In respect of this temporary legislation, we must take cognisance of one of the problems that has arisen in recently whereby nominees to various boards and committees have been accused of being unsuitable because very often they were political appointments.  Let us ensure we do not have political appointments in this area.  In 1979 the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs was divided between An Bord Telecom and An Bord Poist.  Michael Smurfit and I were appointed chairmen, respectively, of the two boards.  That was acceptable because it was clear these were not political appointments.  In those days it was quite customary, and not unlikely, for appointments to be political.</P>
        <P>The other thing that concerns me is that nowadays the best people are not necessarily willing to accept appointments to boards or authorities because of the onerous duties and responsibilities they must accept.  We must be careful when establishing regulations that they do not deter the right people from accepting such positions.  It is important that changes are made in the way we do business to make ourselves more competitive.  I hope this short Bill will point us in that direction.</P>
        <P>The only real way to create more jobs is through competition.  We must avoid protectionism or going alone in certain areas.  I have spoken before about the code of conduct for the grocery trade in Ireland, as mentioned by the Minister of State, which will deal only with the relationships between Irish retailers and Irish suppliers.  Thus, it only applies &mdash; and can only apply &mdash; <Col N="115"/>to Irish suppliers and retailers, which means it cannot be enforced for those whose headquarters are outside the State.  We are now part of Europe, and if we pass laws that hinder the operation of Irish retailers and suppliers, we are handing a gift to competitors abroad.  Those retailers and suppliers which are based in Britain, Germany or wherever are not affected by it and, no matter how much pressure we put on Irish suppliers in the future, it will work against their interests and therefore those of Irish consumers.</P>
        <P>We must remember that there are much wider outside forces at work.  We are part of the EU and we must try not to introduce more regulations that may hinder Irish businesses even more.  Let us consider the example of the carbon tax.  The French, after announcing that a carbon tax was to be introduced, decided against introducing it in the belief that it would hinder French businesses in competition with others.  Instead, they are waiting for a more EU-wide implementation of such a tax, as they believe this would be a much fairer way of doing business and would give French businesses a chance to compete.  Should we have pushed for the type of carbon tax we have when our competitors do not have such a tax?</P>
        <P>I am glad we seem to be becoming more competitive in various ways.  For example, fewer shoppers are crossing the Border to shop, not because of any regulations or rules but because we have managed to bring costs down and make ourselves more competitive.  We need to recognise this more widely if we are to create jobs instead of merely concentrating on protecting existing jobs.  We have much more to do.  Certainly the drop in the euro compared with sterling has helped a little, but the costs of energy and rent are still outrageous.  We are making ourselves uncompetitive.  The Government cannot necessarily do everything in that area, but it can unravel some of the constraints we have.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has indicated that following this Bill, his priority will be to provide for the amalgamation of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  I am concerned about the effect this may have on the retail sector.  About 280,000 people are employed in retailing &mdash; not just grocery retailing but all retailing &mdash; and it must be borne in mind that these two bodies have different views on the code of conduct proposed for retailing.  How can we reconcile these different views when it comes to amalgamation?  One will have to prevail, and I hope it will be the view that we should not put more constraints on competition, as the National Consumer Agency would have preferred.  We must try to reduce costs in this area.  I urge the Minister to take these two opposing views into account, especially considering the massive benefit of the retail sector to this country.</P>
        <P>The 280,000 jobs in the retail sector depend on competition and on the ability of one trader to be better than another &mdash; to persuade customers to drive past another shop and come to that trader&rsquo;s shop.  It is a competitive marketplace.  The good news, however, is that jobs are being created all the time.  Retail Excellence Ireland has had three seminars in the past three weeks.  I attended all three: one that finished yesterday in Cork, one the previous week in Limerick, and the first one in the Burlington Hotel.  The organisation advertised and ran a free course in retailing to encourage people who are not working in retail to consider a career in this area.  I met engineers and architects who had not even considered retail as a possible source of employment.  They came along to these free courses in Dublin, Limerick and Cork and left, as far as I could see, with a great deal more confidence than they had before because they could do something about their situations.</P>
        <P>I mention this because a number of retailers have said they need more workers.  Retail Excellence Ireland reckons that 1,000 jobs will open up in the retail sector before the end of the year.  This was an opportunity to give people who would not otherwise have considered a career in retail the opportunity to explore this area.  Competition will encourage retailers and <Col N="116"/>suppliers to flourish.  The steps being taken by the Government are in the right direction.  Let us ensure we encourage competition and that the country&rsquo;s retailers and suppliers, and especially consumers, get the benefit of that competition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I was slightly distracted from the main theme of the debate by Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments on the carbon tax, to which I may return in a few minutes.</P>
        <P>The Bill, which amends the Competition Act 2002, has been forced on us by circumstances, some of which were mentioned by Senator Quinn.  There is difficulty in maintaining a board in these times when scrutiny is rightly of the highest order and when the responsibility that goes with holding such a position is of an onerous nature.  We probably need a wider debate which would encompass the area of staffing of boards of authorities and State agencies.</P>
        <P>What strikes me about this Bill is that the Competition Authority has powers that are devolved from those of the European Union and assigned to national competition bodies across the EU.  Thus, there is a European perspective to this, namely, the imperative for us to have an authority that is in good standing should it be in a position in which it must use its powers to examine mergers or initiate criminal proceedings for offences relating to anti-competitive behaviour.  If we were to initiate such criminal proceedings, only to find, on appeal, that our competition authority was not properly constituted, this would have major reverberations not only here but in terms of its effect on our good name in Europe, and would be acutely embarrassing.  There is no question that the Bill is urgent.</P>
        <P>I am not entirely clear about references to the 2002 Act not envisaging this situation.  This is where we are and it is important we deal with the issue as quickly as possible.  As the Minister of State said, it is in the context of a more substantial Bill that will be introduced later with a view to merging the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P>The issue of appointments is a cause for public concern.  I should declare that as a councillor, I was appointed by a Minister to the board of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, so I have been a beneficiary of the system that exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>As was the organisation a beneficiary of the Senator&rsquo;s appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is kind of the Minister to say so.  Given the requirement for the highest level of public trust and transparency, it is wise that the new programme for Government envisages an examination of the process of appointment to all of these boards.  This is an important commitment which was agreed between the Government parties and which ought to proceed even as we move to have the Bill, which will give the Minister power to make temporary appointments, enacted.  Given the particular skill sets the appointees would need in the areas of law, economics, public administration and so on and the weakness of the authority should any such appointees leave, this certainly recommends itself to me.  Moreover, it would be worthwhile, in time, to add to this to demonstrate to the public that not only are the people qualified but that they are chosen purely on the basis of qualification and that no hint of grace or favour is involved.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, Senator Quinn has left the Chamber.  I wish to address the issue of carbon tax and competition.  The Stern report on climate change identifies the latter as the greatest market failure in history.  Essentially, we are externalising a cost on to the environment and it will cost us all far more than what the carbon tax currently constitutes.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party recognise and agree with this and support the implementation of a carbon levy.  The question is how one goes about it.  Unlike countries such as France, Germany or Britain <Col N="117"/>that have their own internal power sources, Ireland is 90% dependent on imported fossil fuels.  This behaviour must be changed as a nation, as well as in respect of individual businesses and households and it is recognised that one methodology to so do is the introduction of levies that drive different choices regarding energy.  As early responders to this issue, this will come to be seen as a measure that provided impetus and momentum to our economy becoming less energy dependent on imported fossil fuels, more self-sustaining and in the medium term, not even in the long term, becoming more energy efficient and therefore more competitive in respect of the output of its business community and manufacturing sectors.</P>
        <P>There is an inherent logic to what has been done and it will make us more competitive although I do not disagree that it brings fair amounts of anger and discomfort.  As the Minister of State is aware, I am in business and am grumbling too.  At the same time however, I am examining the possibility of using the various schemes introduced by the Government to lessen my use of fuel and energy consumption and to negate the impact of a carbon tax while simultaneously making my business more competitive into the future.  I wished to address that tangential issue that was introduced by Senator Quinn.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of competition on this island between North and South.  Great improvements in the competitiveness of the economy have been made on this side of the Border, which initially are becoming manifest in the retail sector, in which the position in towns along the Border is stabilising as price reductions of the order of 8% have stemmed the tide.  Regrettably however, loss leaders still are being offered in the North, especially in the area of drink.  Nevertheless, I believe that as the economy becomes more competitive, it also will become a more prosperous and productive place in which to do business.</P>
        <P>The work of the authority must continue.   I agree with Senator Phelan that its work in respect of suppliers and retailers is critical.  Anecdotal evidence is legion regarding ways in which the supply chain is unfavourable to Ireland&rsquo;s smaller economy when compared with, for instance, that of our neighbour in Britain.  I look forward to this authority, and the newly constituted authority that will emerge following its amalgamation with the National Consumer Agency, dealing with such issues in a vigorous manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and his officials to the House to introduce this Bill.  The Bill proposes to amend section 35 of the Competition Act 2002 to permit the appointment of temporary members to the Competition Authority.  It will enable the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to appoint temporary members to fill current and forthcoming vacancies, thereby ensuring that its membership exceeds the statutory minimum requirement to allow it to function properly.  Obviously, if the validity of decisions made by the authority is never to be impugned, this is the correct thing to do.  Therefore, the Labour Party will support this Bill in principle to ensure that the authority is properly constituted, thereby putting it in the position to carry out its important functions.</P>
        <P>This is a short Bill and is quite specific in its intent.  The Minister is concerned that an improperly constituted authority would be unable to fulfil its statutory obligations and that any decisions made by members in such circumstances would be open to legal challenge.  Despite legal reservations the Labour Party might have in respect of the content of the Competition Act 2002 &mdash; I refer to section 4 in particular, which the Labour Party sought to amend with the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2007 &mdash; it is appropriate for all sides of the House to facilitate the Minister&rsquo;s efforts in this Bill to address the problems that have been identified.  The Labour Party will support the Bill because of this.  The Minister has promised the introduction of a comprehensive Bill later in the year and I look forward to debating it on behalf of the Labour Party.  For that reason, I see no point in debating what is not in this Bill and simply will deal with its contents.  However, as other Members have noted, it is astounding to have <Col N="118"/>arrived at this impasse and this illustrates the failure of the Government to ensure that the Competition Authority had the appropriate membership level in the first place.  The authority appears to have been carrying a vacancy in its membership since January 2009 or for almost 18 months.</P>
        <P>One item that should be included in the legislation that has been promised for later in the year is a statutory code of practice to bring some sense of fair play to the relationship between suppliers and retailers to which Senator Phelan referred previously.  A voluntary code of practice will not work because large retailers are used to being in the driving seat and will not voluntarily vacate it.  In the main, power in such relationships rests with the bigger retailers, which constantly push out the boundaries and in many cases are driving small companies and growers over the edge and out of business.  Under various guises, &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; has been demanded of suppliers by large retailers and I note that many suppliers operate in vulnerable areas of the economy.  Many of those involved are not in a position to come forward about this matter, some because they fear being de-listed.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority stood idly by while this was taking place.  Its excuse, when its representatives appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, was that it had only received a small level of complaints on the matter.  As a member of that joint committee, I asked whether, given the nature of relationships in this sector and the certainty that fear would prevent greater numbers of complaints, this should not have been a spur for action.  Unfortunately, there has been no action and the authority continues to bury its head in the sand and such practices continue.  Suppliers and representative bodies that appeared before the Oireachtas joint committee have indicated that unless action is taken now, there will be few suppliers because most of them will have been wiped out with ever increasing levels of unemployment.  Ultimately, we all are consumers and shoppers, many of whom have sons, daughters, nieces and nephews who are employed by such suppliers.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In particular, I refer to the problems encountered by those who are involved in the horticultural industry, which is based to a great degree in my locality of north County Dublin.  How can such growers be expected to continue in production when supermarkets are selling two cabbages for the price of one?  Growers eventually will be wiped out because it is uneconomic to operate at the level to which I refer.  It is important therefore that the Minister should examine this matter in detail and should opt for a statutory, and not a voluntary, code.  Growers must be guaranteed a fair margin, as should all suppliers.  As I noted previously, the Labour Party proposes that such a statutory code should be introduced and that an ombudsman be appointed to supervise it.</P>
        <P>As for Senator Quinn&rsquo;s earlier comments on whether such a code would be applicable to companies the headquarters of which were located outside the country, this could be dealt with under Irish law.  Is it Senator Quinn&rsquo;s argument that in trying to deal with unfair relationships, it must be open to Irish retailers to be unfair to suppliers in the same way as are retailers from outside the country?  This issue can be dealt with and I do not accept this point.  It also is important that multinational retailers are obliged to publish their operating margins for their business within this jurisdiction.  At present, they only produce consolidated accounts, which do not afford the correct level of visibility.  It will be important to have visibility in this regard, if we are to introduce fairness to supplier-retailer relationships.</P>
      
        <P>We have done a good deal of work in that area in the joint committee and we will have produced a comprehensive report, with cross-party support, that is likely to be of assistance to the Minister as he prepares his more comprehensive legislation.  In mentioning cross-party support I should say that Senator John Paul Phelan and Senator Ivor Callely are also members <Col N="119"/>of the joint committee.  I hope the Minister and his officials will reflect the findings of the joint committee in the proposed Bill.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party supports this Bill in principle but will table one or two amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>I join others in welcoming the Minister of State to the House.  I welcome this Competition (Amendment) Bill 2010.  As the Minister said in his contribution, it is short but important legislation to give the appropriate authority to the Minister to ensure the board of the Competition Authority has the adequate numbers to allow them continue their work.  </P>
        <P>At no time in our history is the issue of competition and our competitiveness as important as it is today.  It is vital that all appropriate ministerial powers are in place to ensure the authority is in a position to continue its work and to do it effectively.  In that respect, the Minister highlighted several areas of particular concern which, if this legislation is not expedited and passed through the Houses quickly, would impinge on the authority&rsquo;s ability to do its work and call into question some of the actions it may take, leaving it open to legal challenges and other risks.</P>
        <P>The Minister also outlined a number of points on the forthcoming legislation to deal with the amalgamation of the authority and the National Consumer Agency.  I would welcome a more full debate on those in the coming months when that legislation is brought forward.</P>
        <P>A number of Members mentioned the area of retailing, and I am conscious of the renowned and respected expertise of Senator Quinn.  We would always listen to his views but I am conscious that in the Border counties, with the proximity to Northern Ireland and a regime with a different minimum wage, a different taxation system and a lower value added tax regime, a level playing field does not exist.  The Minister might reflect between now and bringing forward that legislation on whether measures could be put in place which would give the appropriate cognisance and attention to the clear disadvantage faced by retailers in that jurisdiction.  We must have a level playing field and open competition in this jurisdiction but some people are more equal than others in the context of the difficulties the retailers in the six Border counties have had to contemplate and negotiate in these most difficult times.</P>
        <P>I do not want to delay the House.  As others have said, this is a short Bill.  There is nothing to oppose within it.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to Committee and Report Stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions in this area.  As was pointed out, and to which most Senators referred, this legislation is quite specific in the context of ensuring we have the statutory requirement for the make-up of the Competition Authority.  </P>
        <P>To be honest and open, the position is that the original Act did not foresee the number of resignations from the authority at the one time.  As to the reason an appointment was not made since January 2009, there was a proposal that there would be amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  We had a chair plus three members but there have been two resignations since then and we now have a chair plus one member.  Since Sunday, therefore, we only have a chair plus one member and it is critical that we get this legislation through the Houses and enacted as quickly as possible to make sure we can bring up the number to the statutory minimum requirement.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised by Senator Feargal Quinn with regard to political appointments, whole-time members must go through the public competition recruitment system in place.  There are <Col N="120"/>provisions in the Act which stipulate that they must have competency in law, economics or a number of areas.  The competencies required are clearly laid down in the Competition Act.  Candidates must go through the public services appointment system.  That is necessary and welcome.</P>
        <P>There is also a commitment in the programme for Government in the context of appointments to these various agencies and authorities.  The Oireachtas committees will have an input in making nominations to a panel for consideration and presentation to the Minister for appointment but there must also be democratic accountability.  If Ministers make appointments they are democratically accountable in the Houses of the Oireachtas but the programme for Government has specific details on the way appointments are made and the relevant committees will have an opportunity to make nominations and suggestions to a panel of people with the required competencies for the particular agency or authority.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised by Senator Phelan regarding the recommendations of the Competition Authority, in fairness, some of the recommendations have been acted upon.  About 40% of the original recommendations have been implemented and approximately 9% or 10% are currently in the process but when we try to implement some of them there is some resistance.  The recommendations are not always welcome across the spectrum of political opinion in these Houses.  Most people acknowledge that governments decide on policy and the Competition Authority, or any such authority as constituted, makes recommendations and governments act upon them.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority has served and is serving a useful purpose in trying to highlight cases of anti-competitive measures or blockages to competition and ensuring there are opportunities for consumers to have access to goods and services at a reasonable rate.</P>
        <P>An issue that needs a great deal of discussion across all sections of political opinion in the Houses of the Oireachtas and outside them in terms of stakeholders is the voluntary code of practice for the grocery sector.  I have no doubt that if we did not have a code and there was a free for all, so to speak, it is possible that we would drive down the cost of groceries to the consumer but we are not running an economy.  We are running a country.  We have primary producers in agriculture, horticulture, fisheries and other related areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have a new chair?  Commissioner Byrne refused the chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I mentioned that at the outset.  Mr. John Travers has been appointed to facilitate the setting up of the voluntary code of practice.  There will be a provision in the forthcoming legislation on the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency to bring that into statutory effect but we must have balanced legislation that is fair and reasonable to all sides, from the primary producer to the consumer.  People will have varying views depending on their area of interest or the organisations or areas of industry they represent.  However, if we could have a broad debate and come to consensus in the Houses of the Oireachtas it would send out a strong signal in the context of where we see competition fitting into ensuring people get a fair reward for their day&rsquo;s work while ensuring that there are no anti-competitive measures in the supply chain from the primary producer to the consumer that do not allow a fair price to be passed on if there is a price reduction in the particular industry.</P>
        <P>I refer to an issue we have raised on numerous occasions.  I have met the Competition Authority on several occasions, and I have commented in the Houses of the Oireachtas previously on anti-competitive practices, &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money or other forms of what we call the anec<Col N="121"/>dotal suggestions.  The difficulty we have is that no one has come forward yet to the Competition Authority willing to present evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are afraid to come forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>That may be, but I make the point that no one has come forward.  I have asked the Competition Authority to be proactive in investigating that as opposed to waiting for a person to come forward and present evidence.  If there is hearsay evidence, has the authority the competency to try to find evidence to highlight whether &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money is being used in the broader industry?  I have travelled the country and met people from the primary producer up.  Some people have clearly stated information to me but when I ask them if they would present that to the authority they say they will not.  One would think at this stage that people who have left the business would now come forward.  They may not have any material interest because they are no longer in the business but they could come forward and present evidence.  I urge anybody who has evidence but who has no material interest or fear of presenting that evidence to come forward.  To date that has not happened.</P>
        <P>The consumer Bill, which will be published later, will be broad legislation.  It is not only about the amalgamation of two agencies but restructuring them in their entirety, from competition right through to the consumer.  The code of practice could be placed on a statutory basis in that Bill.  We must try in that legislation to provide a balanced code which will be fair and reasonable to everyone and on which there will be genuine buy-in.</P>
        <P>On the issues raised, I mentioned the recommendations from the Competition Authority, about 40% of which have been implemented.  This Bill is quite specific.  It is merely ensuring we have the statutory minimum requirements for the make-up of the authority.  There were a few more issues raised by the Senators and I have covered most of them.  We will have an interesting debate on the legislation that will be published later in the year.</P>
        <P>Border counties were referred to and the issues raised in that context have been the cause of great distress to retailers along the Border.  There are some issues that are completely outside our control such as sterling depreciating against the euro which creates a pull to the North.  The opposite was the case previously and that was beneficial.  We must ensure there is competitiveness in the economy.  There are a few areas we need to address and the Competition Authority plays a key role in that.  There is a broader Government policy on fuel and energy costs and other anti-competitiveness measures.  There is the issue of retail planning guidelines and the size of stores.  All these issues are key components in how we structure our economy in the area of retail.  We are conscious of the significant pressure on retailers in Border counties and that has been highlighted continually by Senator MacSharry and other public representatives from the region.  The Senator has been forceful in trying to come up with solutions to ensure there is no drag from local communities.  He was involved in innovations such as encouraging people to stay local, something people should be conscious of.  If people take money out of the economy it means that there is less in the economy to support services through taxation.  It is a simple matter of arithmetic.  If money is spent elsewhere and we are losing revenue, there is less in the Exchequer to spend on badly needed public services.</P>
        <P>I look forward to taking Committee Stage quickly and to evaluating any amendments.  It is critical that this authority has the competency because at times the EU also delegates some competencies to this authority.  There could be a merger or an acquisition at any stage that would have to go before the authority and if it is not constituted, we could be left in a precarious position and there could be legal challenges.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their broad support and look forward to Committee Stage.  When the Bill is passed, I look forward to the publication of the competition and consumer Bill and there <Col N="122"/>being a broad debate on it.  I hope there is a consensus in the House in support of that Bill to ensure a system is in place that acknowledges the right of the primary producer to a fair price and ensures the consumer has access to competitive prices in the grocery and retail sectors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first occasion I have had to be in the House since the death of Senator Kieran Phelan.  I extend my sympathy to his family and all his colleagues.  He took great pride in his membership of this House.  He always referred to it, particularly to those of us in the other House, as the Upper House.  I encourage all Members to reflect the pride he had and in their membership of the House show the same diligence, care and sense of duty.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to be here to speak on the important issue of whistleblowing in the financial sector.  The Government does not cavil at the need to protect those who, at potentially great cost to themselves, expose corrupt practices in order to serve the public interest.  I will begin by setting out is what ordinarily understood by the term, &ldquo;whistleblowing&rdquo;.  It is usually interpreted to mean the reporting in good faith of a breach or potential breach of the law and the protection of the person concerned against penalisation by the entity about which the report has been made.  In many cases, it involves protecting employees who blow the whistle on their employer.  Whistleblowers risk their careers and expose themselves to being ostracised by their colleagues.  They may also face potentially costly and stressful legal action.  They do so in order that information, often buried deep within organisations and beyond the purview of regulators and officialdom, can be brought to light.  The Government does not need to be convinced of the value of having honest men and women of integrity who are willing to assume these risks in the public interest.  Agreement on the policy principle does not, however, reduce the complexity in translating these protections into workable legislation to encourage the unearthing of illegal practices in a way that will prevent the victimisation of whistleblowers.  I will speak about possible enabling whistleblower legislation in the financial sector, but it may useful to place my comments in the context of general whistleblower developments across the<?oasys _jy ?>sectors.</P>
        <P>The Government has never sought to play party politics with this issue.  It was willing to engage with the Private Members&rsquo; Bill brought forward by the Labour Party in 1999.  It gave careful attention to the provisions of that Bill, but it became clear that a number of amendments were required, amendments which raised detailed and complex issues which required substantial redrafting of the Bill.  Having explored the various possible approaches to protecting whistleblowers, it became clear to the Government some years ago that while one grand slam piece of legislation, so to speak, to provide blanket protection would be desirable, there were considerable legal obstacles to finding a good fit between the genuine intention of the legislation and the multifarious circumstances in which it was to apply.  The Government was careful not to promise whistleblower protection which, if tested by the courts, might ultimately be found wanting.</P><Col N="123"/>
        <P>The second difficulty is that there are many genuine instances where those working in the State have access to sensitive personal and commercial information or information that is of importance to national security.  Clearly, in such circumstances, there were concerns about where best to draw the line of public interest.  This problem was exacerbated by the need to find a solution that would work well and equally so in all circumstances.</P>
        <P>I will provide the House with a flavour of some of the issues arising at the time to enable Members to gain some appreciation of the complexity involved in giving effect to a provision on which, perhaps, we all agree in principle.  For example, in the financial sector it is necessary to consider the position of the Central Bank.  Its confidentiality regime derives from obligations regarding professional secrecy imposed under the European System of Central Banks Statute and the Treaty of Rome and further underpinned by section 33 AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  Clearly, any provision will need to be consistent with the Central Bank Acts and-or EU law.  Other complex legal questions arise in relation to the obligation on designated bodies and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland to report suspected money laundering to the Revenue Commissioners; the Official Secrets Act 1963 and its implications for civil servants; and the protection of trade secret types of industrial processes.</P>
        <P>On balance and in the light of the many legal complexities likely to be encountered, it became clear that a sectoral approach would be more effective and practical.  This approach has served us well in placing whistleblower protections on the Statute Book to be used effectively in a number of areas.  Examples include the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the more recent Labour Services (Amendment) Act 2009.</P>
        <P>Senators will be familiar with the whistleblower provisions in sections 222 and 223 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009.  Section 222 provides protection against civil liability for whistleblowers, while section 223 prohibits penalisation of whistleblowers by their employers.  The sections apply to a range of persons and there is a redress process available under Schedule 2 in respect of employees who consider they have been penalised.  In addition, section 203 imposes a positive obligation on NAMA to report suspicion of crimes to appropriate law enforcement authorities.  The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland has also published a whistleblower policy for its own staff, outlining its approach to dealing with reports of wrongdoing within the authority.</P>
        <P>The number and range of the whistleblower provisions introduced in the past five years show clearly that the Government has engaged fully with this critical issue.  Of course, there are still some key areas, of which financial services is one, in which we must consider what more can be done.  Policy in this area has been informed by the work of the company law review group, the statutory advisory expert body charged with advising the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on the review and development of company law in Ireland.  The group examined the inclusion of whistleblowing provisions in Irish companies legislation in 2007 and brought to light the complexity of the issues involved.  The majority recommendation at the time was that a company law-specific whistleblowing provision should not be included in the new Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill.  In coming to this conclusion the group stated it had taken into account the degree of malpractice, the required nature and extent of the disclosure, the reputational risk for companies and the extra resources, or the diversion of resources, for enforcement agencies.  However, this is a matter which the Minister for Finance will consider further, given recent disclosures regarding corporate governance in the financial services sector and, in particular, in the light of the outcome of ongoing investigations of these matters by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Financial Regulator.</P><Col N="124"/>
        <P>Senators will be aware of the recent announcements on white collar crime by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  The Minister made proposals in the context of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill under consideration by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and awaiting Committee Stage.  The Bill includes a provision to protect whistleblowers who report offences of corruption within the meaning of the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2005.  These measures propose to protect any person working in any sector who reports, in good faith, a suspicion of corruption as defined in these statutes.  Under the legislation as it now applies to situations involving whistleblowing, the definition of corruption essentially provides that anyone who corruptly accepts any gift, consideration or advantage as a reward for someone doing an act or making an omission in relation to his or her office or position is guilty of an offence.  The Minister intends to look at clarifying this definition further under the Bill.  The provision will also contain an outline of the various methods of redress which will be available to an individual who may be treated unfavourably by an employer, for example, for making such a report.  Committee Stage of the Bill is expected to be taken later this month and Senators will have the opportunity to consider the proposal in greater detail.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has also announced recently that he will be bringing proposals to the Government shortly for the consolidation of all the anti-corruption legislation on the Statute Book, some of which dates back to the Victorian era, while some has been introduced more recently.  There is undoubtedly a need to bring greater clarity to the issue by consolidating these offences in a single statute.</P>
        <P>One area in which the need for whistleblower provisions has been brought into sharp focus is that of financial services.  The issue of whistleblower provisions in relation to financial services was most recently brought to public attention by comments made by the Director of Public Prosecutions during a recent interview on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; programme on RTE.</P>
        <P>Prior to the financial crisis, there was a general view that the structures and systems responsible for financial regulation were effective and appropriate.  As we now know, that confidence was seriously misplaced.  The previous regulatory system failed spectacularly to prevent grossly excessive and irresponsible lending to the property sector.  As a result, our most systemically important banks have had to be recapitalised and Anglo Irish Bank has had to be brought fully into public ownership.</P>
        <P>The financial system overall has been severely shaken and customers and households are managing unprecedented levels of debt.  Wide-ranging reform is urgently required.  We need a system where the overarching objective of the stability of the financial system directly informs the supervision of individual firms, while at the same time safeguarding the interests of consumers and investors.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 has recently completed Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is expected to come before this House before the summer recess.  The Bill is a crucial step in a comprehensive programme to put in place a domestic regulatory framework for financial services.  It meets the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining the stability of the financial system.  It provides for the effective and efficient supervision of financial institutions and markets, and it safeguards the interests of consumers and investors.</P>
        <P>In terms of the overall standards to apply across the sector, the Bill provides for new powers for the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers.  We have already seen the devastating effects of irresponsible and incompetent behaviour at senior levels in financial institutions and must ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the powers are available to <Col N="125"/>prevent such behaviour in future.  These new powers for the bank will help to restore confidence in the management of financial institutions domestically and in international markets.</P>
        <P>A second Bill to be brought before both Houses in the autumn, will enhance the powers and functions of the restructured Central Bank, particularly concerning the prudential  supervision of individual  financial  institutions; the conduct of business, including the protection of consumer interests; and the overall stability of the financial system.</P>
        <P>A third Bill will consolidate existing statutory arrangements for the Central Bank and financial regulation in the State.  This legislative programme is demanding and complex, but it is essential.  A sound financial regulatory regime is fundamental to a sustainable and dynamic financial services industry.</P>
        <P>It is within the context of the second Bill that the Government will look at the need for specific legislative protection for whistleblowers in the banking and financial services sectors.  In carrying out this examination we will draw on recent experience in Ireland, as well as experience in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>Current financial reforms under discussion in the United States include new financial incentives for whistleblowers.  The Financial Regulation Bill passed by the US Senate recently includes a provision that expands a bounty programme to compensate whistleblowers who report fraudulent or corrupt activity by their employer.  A new fund would pay out between a minimum 10% and a maximum 30% of the recovered money from a violation of more than $1 million.  While I am not sure that making incentive payments to whistleblowers is the way to go in this country, it important nevertheless to note that whistleblower provisions such as this are emerging as a common feature of reforms elsewhere.</P>
        <P>In the United Kingdom the Public Interest Disclosures Act 1998 provides a basis for whistleblower protection.  That Act applies to people at work raising genuine concerns about crimes, civil offences &mdash; including negligence, breach of contract or administrative law &mdash; miscarriages of justice, dangers to health and safety or the environment, and the cover-up of any of these.  The Act applies to employees, including contractors and trainees, but not to volunteers, the self-employed, the intelligence services or the armed forces.  The Act provides that disclosures may be made by employees and, depending on the circumstances, to the employer, regulators or more widely to the police or MPs, for example.</P>
        <P>Generally, disclosures are protected where they are made in good faith and where the whistleblower has a reasonable belief that the information tends to show the occurrence of malpractice.  Additional requirements apply to disclosures to regulators or wider disclosures, for example, to ensure disclosures are not made for personal gain.</P>
        <P>Gagging clauses in employment contracts are void in so far as they conflict with the Act, although the Act does not provide protection for breaches of the Official Secrets Act or other secrecy provisions.  Where a whistleblower is victimised or dismissed in breach of the Act, they can claim for compensation from an employment tribunal.  Awards are not capped and based on the losses suffered.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the recent report on whistleblowing by Transparency International entitled, An Alternative to Silence, which puts forward the UK legislation as a model to follow.  It also recommends the enactment of whistleblower protection for the financial services sector.  That report pulls together useful information in this under-studied area of Irish life.  I was particularly interested in the 2008 research cited in the report on the financial services sector, which explored attitudes to whistleblowing.  It also examined reasons which would discourage disclosures such as a sense of loyalty to the company, fear of negative reaction from co-workers; the belief it would impact negatively on a person&rsquo;s career; and the belief reporting an incident was outside a person&rsquo;s realm of responsibility.  Interestingly, the fear of reprisal was cited least.  This <Col N="126"/>is just another example of why this is a complex matter and that there are other factors that discourage disclosures beyond the existence of specific legal protections.</P>
        <P>The Government is prepared to look at making such a provision in the context of the reforming legislation on the financial services to be published this autumn.  In developing our thinking in this area, there are several matters that need to be examined in great depth such as whether there should be confidentiality provisions attaching to disclosures and whether anonymous complaints would be pursued; whether the protections should apply to all employees or even beyond employees to any person reporting malpractice, for example, customers or suppliers; and the time limits for making disclosures or claims for compensation for reprisals.  We should consider whether reprisal protections should extend to others who may become vulnerable, apart from the whistleblower.  We should also consider how compensation levels are to be set and whether a cap should apply.  Equally, we must examine the circumstances when full whistleblowing provisions should apply, which would provide protection against penalisation of the employee and protection for the employee against civil liability.  There are also a range of other issues.</P>
        <P>When looking at the financial services sector specifically, we need to look at how best to handle the relationship between any whistleblower protection provisions and commercially sensitive information, intellectual property rights, and the protection of confidential and personal data, among other things.</P>
        <P>As Senators will be aware, there are many important matters that must be considered and decided upon to give full effect to any sort of whistleblower provision in the context of the Irish financial services system.</P>
        <P>Some Members of this House have had their own experiences with whistleblowers.  I look forward to the debate on the issues I have outlined, as well as reflecting on the experiences that Senators may care to outline in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have been more impressed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech if he had focused on how we could overcome the problems he mentioned.  For instance, he should have focused on what problems have been encountered in the United Kingdom where the Public Interest Disclosure Act of 1998 has been in place for the past 12 years.  Could that legislation be transposed into Irish law?  The whole purpose of whistleblowing is to ensure the information becomes public, thus leading to change and-or prosecution, depending on the leading reason a whistleblower acts.  </P>
        <P>Reprisal or other adverse events against a whistleblower are often secondary when the whistleblower first decides to make information public.  We have done very little about this, however.  I do not think there is the ethos or culture here to support this sort of thinking.  There was nothing in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech &mdash; or in so many Oireachtas debates &mdash; to indicate any great desire by the Government to promote whistleblowing, whether in the financial or other sectors.</P>
        <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has a fair idea of how the law works and what could or could not be achieved with regard to legislation.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions considers there is a need for whistleblowing legislation, he clearly understands we can overcome the obstacles to which the Minister of State referred.  I believe, however, that the Government parties have no interest in making whistleblowing work in the way we would like to see it operating.</P>
        <P>There are a number of ways in which it could be made to work.  For example, a potential whistleblower could contact a regulatory body which could then make inquiries.  All of these <Col N="127"/>inquiries could be made away from the glare of public discussion in the media.  If the information turns out to be true, it can be made public in whatever forum is deemed necessary such as the courts or the Oireachtas.  If the information was given in bad faith for some reason &mdash; the person concerned might have been trying to manipulate the facts for personal gain, for example &mdash; it could be quietly disregarded.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand the argument that whistleblowing cannot work accurately in this country.  If I refer back to my own profession, medical doctors receive buckets of confidential information on sensitive issues such as the health of an individual or organisation, or child abuse in the home or the community.  We can avail of an array of ways of reporting such information to the Irish Medical Council, the HSE and our colleagues.  With the possible exception of the legal profession, no other profession is as bound by confidentiality.  We are able to make it work.  I do not believe the Minister of State&rsquo;s suggestion that real and imaginary obstacles have prevented the Government from implementing whistleblowing legislation for over a decade.  I suggest the Government does not believe in the ethos of open government.  I do not think a great enough effort is being made to transmit this information and get the legislation on the Statute Book.  The Minister of State should come back to the House to clearly and properly outline the obstacles to making whistleblowers legislation work.</P>

I do not believe the issues mentioned by the Minister of State cannot be overcome.  We need to focus on the financial sector.  Commercially sensitive information could easily be handled by an ombudsman who would understand the sensitivities involved.  If the role of the ombudsman was strengthened appropriately, the issues associated with intellectual property rights could be dealt with.  Confidential and personal data are constantly protected by many organisations across the country.  If a specific whistleblowers ombudsman were given responsibility for such information, he or she would treat it with the confidentiality it required.</P>
        <P>Members of the Oireachtas have always been excluded from the limited whistleblowers provisions included in legislation.  As we have parliamentary privilege, we can say what we like about anybody or anything.  In my eight years of experience across both Houses, I have never seen that privilege abused in a major way.  Members of the Oireachtas are capable of handling sensitive information and deducing whether it needs to be highlighted.  We can use our contacts &mdash; Oireachtas colleagues and officials in the public service &mdash; to clarify much of the information given to us.  We are able to check whether it is authentic.  On the basis of my experience as a Member of the Oireachtas and before that as a medical professional, I see no reason robust whistleblowing legislation cannot be enacted.  If the Minister of State gets an opportunity to respond to us, perhaps he can speak a little more strongly and forcefully about why it is not happening.  Perhaps we should examine the UK legislation in this regard.  UK legislation can often be relatively easily transferred into the Irish context because our legal systems are so similar.  I ask the Minister of State to give me an answer on that issue.  That is what we really need.</P>
        <P>This debate which consists of statements on whistleblowing in the financial sector is happening as if this issue had just fallen out of the sky.  If we have to continue to come into the House to listen to statements, the role of the Seanad will be demeaned.  We know that more could be done.  When the relevance of the Seanad is being discussed, we can say we raise issues in the Chamber on a regular basis.  Statements in the Seanad have a role to play in the context of dealing with topical, complex or changing issues.  It is important that we will make statements <Col N="128"/>on the Gaza crisis this evening, for example, as it will give the Minister for Foreign Affairs an opportunity to update the House on relatively new developments.  I suggest, however, that these statements on whistleblowing in the financial sector represent no more than a sop to our concerns, if they involve the Minister of State rehashing some old ideas.  All he is doing is acknowledging that there are problems, while suggesting they cannot be overcome.  It is clear that they can be solved.  I ask the Minister of State to return to the House with something stronger.  He should give us the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion on why the obstacles in this sector are genuine and, ultimately, produce legislation on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make a few points about whistleblowing in the financial sector.  I would like to pick up on what Senator Twomey said.  It would be extremely foolish for any Minister participating in a debate to dictate the position rather than to listen to suggestions and points that have been thought out by Senators.  I hope some of the points we make today can be reflected when improvements are made in future legislation.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Twomey that the culture until 2005 or thereabouts did not give whistleblowers any protection.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, alluded to a number of Acts that have been introduced since.  We have legal whistleblowing safeguards to cover people reporting suspicions of child abuse, breaches of ethics legislation and competition law and problems with workplace health and safety.  Garda&iacute; and Garda civilian employees can report corruption or malpractice.  Health care employees can report threats to the welfare of patients.  Whistleblowing provisions also apply to offences relating to employment permits, the regulation of communications, consumer protection, offences relating to chemicals and breaches of charity law.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Government is playing a part, to the maximum extent possible, in trying to change the culture.  The Minister of State has outlined in detail that whistleblowing protections are needed in the financial sector.  He has mentioned some of the difficulties in that regard.  Senators can consider and respond to such points.  I look forward to benefiting from the substantial experience of Senators Ross and Norris and others.  As Senators, we can play our part in our democracy by giving our informed views.  We are required to feed into legislation the will of the sectoral interests we are supposed to represent.  The Senators I have mentioned represent the universities, just as I represent the industrial and commercial sector.</P>
        <P>I am glad the speech made by the Minister of State was not prescriptive.  It sought to deal with the complexities that he outlined which have made it difficult to introduce the simple overarching whistleblowers protection law we would have liked to have had before now.  The Minister of State has mentioned that there was some engagement on the Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced by the Labour Party in 1999.  We would all like the legal complexities in that regard to be overcome as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte has sponsored the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 2010 which has been discussed on Second Stage during Private Members&rsquo; time in the D&aacute;il.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide protection from civil liability for employees who make certain disclosures, reasonably and in good faith, with regard to the conduct of the business and affairs of their employers.  The Bill also proposes to prohibit the penalisation of employees by their employers in such circumstances.  It sets out the persons to whom disclosures could be made and the categories of matters, in respect of which such disclosures would be permitted.</P>
        <P>One has to acknowledge that cross-party efforts have been made to try to advance this issue.  It seems from the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks that the Government is trying to make progress with it as a matter of priority and as quickly as possible.  Recent developments in the world <Col N="129"/>economy make it all the more important for us to take this forward.  The Minister of State described the spectacular failure in our own regulatory regime, from a financial services perspective.  A Transparency International report in January stated the most obvious gaps in coverage of the whistleblower provisions relate to the reporting of offences under company law and financial services.  This was referred to by the Minister of State.  It also stated, regardless of the unethical events of recent years in some Irish enterprises, that the business community and vested interests remained actively opposed to protecting those who reported such wrongdoing.  It recommended that Ireland adopt a generic whistleblower protection law, the principal of which was agreed by all concerned.  This does not solve all the complexities involved.  I am interested to hear the views of those informed about the complexities of the financial services industry such as Senator Ross, and the Minister of State&rsquo;s views in the preparation of legislation in this area.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recent address by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the Law Society in which he stated any renewed prosperity must also bring with it reformed systems, strong laws and regulations to ensure it was not possible to play fast and loose with the financial and economic system.  He stated that part of this reform would mean a rigorous focus on white collar crime, detecting and deterring it and bringing to justice those who perpetrated it.</P>
        <P>The Minister has also proposed the introduction of blanket whistleblower protection for reporting suspicions of corruption, a new consolidated corruption Bill and a White Paper on white collar crime seeking public and practitioner input.  We cannot have enough consultation when it comes to such important legislation.</P>
        <P>The best example of whistleblower protection is the UK Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, widely regarded as the international benchmark and which I am sure will form the basis of the Government&rsquo;s and this House&rsquo;s consideration of the appropriate provisions.  It allows employees in the public and private sectors to report concerns to their employers, regulators and, in limited circumstances, the media.</P>
        <P>Regarding the latter provision, the Minister of State has said consideration will have to be given to whether anonymous reports should be investigated.  I believe they should be.  In some instances there is a need for reports to remain confidential until such time as they are proved to be factually correct and require investigation.  The universal charter has worked without legal mishap for ten years in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State rightly pointed to the spectacular failure of the international financial regulatory regime and the Irish regime, which we all much regret.  The new Financial Regulator, Mr. Elderfield, and the new head of the Central Bank, Dr. Honohan, are doing some good work in making improvements to the regime.  The legal, accounting and auditing professions should also have their existing ethics and standards examined.  They will contend everything they did when it came to financial institutions were to the highest standards of the day.  These standards, however, fell far short of where they should have been.  Accordingly, an examination of the respective organisations that represent these professions should be undertaken to ensure significant improvements can be made to their own regulatory regimes.</P>
        <P>I hope all voices are heard during the consultation process on the White Paper on white collar crime.  I am glad the Minister of State has an open mind on the matter and is listening to the views expressed in this House to ensure they feed into the process.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank Reform Bill, currently going through the Houses, will put in place a new domestic regulatory framework for financial services and create a new fully integrated structure for financial regulation.  The Central Bank (No. 2) Bill, to be published in the autumn, will enhance the powers and functions of the restructured Central Bank framework and will provide <Col N="130"/>an opportunity to consider the provision of specific whistleblower provisions for the financial services sector.</P>
        <P>It must be acknowledged that it is impossible to have any level of independent financial advice from financial institutions within which their employees are expected to operate in a targeted sales environment.  This needs to be addressed by the State through the auspices of a statutory organisation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s last sentiments but little else of what he said.  This promise of legislation is deeply disappointing.  As the House knows, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. James Hamilton, made a statement on the need for whistleblower legislation on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; programme.  Suddenly, a week later, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform announced he would introduce such legislation.  It took the Director of Public Prosecutions, not parliamentarians or members of the Minister&rsquo;s party, to prompt him into saying he was going to take action.  There was a welcome response to the announcement and agreement that at least Mr. Hamilton had managed to get some badly needed movement on this issue.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech today reveals the response is totally and utterly inadequate.  I am also slightly puzzled as to which Department is in charge of this legislation.  Is it the Department of Justice Law Reform or the Department of Finance?</P>
        <P>I had the experience of a whistleblower, of which I have written; therefodre, I am not revealing anything new about any individual.  Mr. Eugene McErlean who worked in AIB had blown the whistle on foreign exchange transactions and all sorts of internal goings-on at the bank to the Central Bank.  His reward for this was to lose his job at AIB.  He has also been before several Oireachtas committees and everyone knows he is an utterly convincing and truthful witness and a man to whom a great injustice has been done which has not yet been properly remedied.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s whistleblowing proposals will not address these problems.  I see his point about various whistleblower protections which have been promised in various places.  This addresses solely the issue of corruption, by which the Minister means bribery.  To claim we will look again at financial whistleblower provisions is absurd because the real and only issue is financial whistleblowing.  To introduce legislation which addresses corruption overall is inadequate.  What we need is legislation which protects people in the financial services sector who blow the whistle on unethical, inappropriate and illegal activities.  Mr. McErlean would not have received any protection from the promise here today.  It is simply not adequate but I do not blame the Minster of State for this; I recognise the hands of the mandarins all over this speech.  There is a power play going on in the Department of Finance.  It is not adequate to maintain that this has been addressed, that the problem was examined in 1999 and that it is somewhat complex.  We know what that means and that it is being put on the long finger.  We know that someone has put their hands on this legislation and decided he or she will not address it because it is too complex.</P><Col N="131"/>
        <P>I was in the House when a very complex problem was addressed here.  I cannot remember the date exactly but when Larry Goodman went bust there was a complex problem.  Some 33 banks and a significant amount of legislation were involved in that case.  It was introduced overnight and passed without any problem.  The Minister of State has an issue with whistleblowers but no one can tell me that this has not been addressed in the public domain because it has.  The Government maintains it examined this issue in 1999, it has considered it very carefully since but that it is somewhat complex.  It is not.  Blanket immunity should be given to people in the same situation as Mr. McErlean and others such as Mr. Tony Spollen, a man whose name is known to many in this House and who was in the same situation.  He blew the whistle on AIB and lost his job but he would not be protected by this Bill.  It is inadequate to come forward today and suggest it is too complex to address now but that it will be considered.  We should receive the legislation today and not promises of a future date.</P>
        <P>I am unsure whether the Minister of State mentioned it and I may be wrong to say otherwise, but he will be aware that this issue was addressed at the Council of Europe some two or three weeks ago.  A resolution was passed at the Council of Europe which would address the problems in the financial sector and the problems with which Messrs McErlean and Spollen were confronted.  For some reason, we are not up to speed on that development.  We introduce a bunch of rhubarb about difficulties here, there and everywhere which is utterly and totally unconvincing.  I say as much not to chastise the Minister of State but simply to point out that this is something which could be but has not been addressed.  Today Mr. McErlean is in the same situation as he was then.  He has not been given the credit or acknowledgement he should have been given for doing a public service to the State and the nation and for revealing what was going on in the financial sector.  I refer to what this matter is all about, that is, the main problems faced by whistleblowers in the financial sector.  There is documentary evidence of people having been victimised for having told the truth.  The Government maintains it is concerned about the matter and it will consider what to do.</P>
        <P>I apologise if I am somewhat emotional on the matter but I call on the Minister of State to indicate when and how he will address this subject and to give us a timetable for it because I do not believe he could possibly be content with the script he was given to read today.  His reference to urgent reform being necessary is totally unacceptable.  We are aware that wide-ranging reform is needed but wide-ranging reform comes from one place alone.  The reference to the relevance of key people or roles being changed in the financial sector is complete and utter camouflage.  It does not matter a hoot who has or has not been changed or what changes have been made.  The issue is protection for employees and whistleblowers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  He will recall the old Irish seanfhocal, &ldquo;&Eacute;ist le fuaim na habhann, mar gheobhaidh t&uacute; iasc&rdquo;, or &ldquo;listen to the sound of the river if you are going to catch a fish&rdquo;.  I refer to it because, having listened to Senator Ross, I hope the Minister of State will do the same.  His comments must be instilled in this process.  Why are we taking so long to implement this legislation?  We should consider the recommendations of Transparency International, which is calling for one single tranche of legislation to protect and promote whistleblowing.  It has pointed out that the United Kingdom did as much some ten years ago with the UK Public Interest Disclosure Act.  That legislation came about after a series of avoidable disasters such as the sinking of the ferry <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i>.  Do Members remember that incident?  It was a long time ago.  The thinking behind it was that hundreds of lives could have been saved if those working in companies had secure means to have their voices heard.</P>
        <P>We have all heard the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. James Hamilton, call for legislation to protect whistleblowers in cases of alleged white collar crime.  However, he believes <Col N="132"/>that recourse to the Employment Appeals Tribunal is not sufficient for a dismissed employee whistleblower.  In this respect, the Council of Europe has stated Ireland should introduce whistleblower protection against unfair dismissal, defamation or prosecution for breaching official secrets.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice and Law Reform indicated last Friday that whistleblower protection was to be included in new anti-corruption legislation, which is welcome.  However, Senator Ross&rsquo;s point is that we need one tranche of legislation to make this happen because the anti-corruption legislation will take a long time to bring forward.</P>
        <P>Some very interesting developments, which are worth considering, may have unfolded in the United States in this area.  The financial regulation Bill, passed by the US Senate last Thursday, includes a provision that expands a reward programme to compensate &ldquo;whistleblowers&rdquo; or those who report fraudulent or corrupt activity by their employer.  Currently, the programme, run by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, only pays out to &ldquo;informants&rdquo; in insider trading cases.  This has been used five times in its 20-year existence.  However, the programme&rsquo;s expansion would cover all securities violations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a law that bans the bribing of foreign officials by US companies, US citizens and, under certain circumstances, foreign companies and foreign nationals.  The new Bill in the United States will set up a new fund, known as the Securities and Exchange Commission Investor Protection Fund, which will pay out between a minimum 10% and a maximum 30% of the recovered money from a violation of more than $1 million.</P>
        <P>The fundamental idea behind the whistleblower reward programme in the United States is to encourage people to come forward.  It is evident that many working in the financial sector were aware things were wrong before the crisis hit.  Even in the months leading up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, that institution&rsquo;s vice-president, Matthew Lee, tried to whistleblow over the firm&rsquo;s accounting.  His contract was terminated some weeks afterward in June 2008.  In Ireland there have been many examples, some of which were referred to by Senator Ross, of bankers or those working in the financial sector who had their careers severely affected when they proceeded to raise concerns about malpractice within their employers.  For example, in 2001 Rupert Walker was sacked from AlB&rsquo;s British subsidiary, Govett, after speaking out about a &ldquo;magic circle&rdquo; of fund managers.</P>
        <P>I do not hold that we need a vast financial awards scheme as part of whistleblower legislation but it is a measure well worth considering.  Some form of award may tip the balance for those who have doubts about reporting financial wrongdoing.  Also, given the significant financial benefit of reporting certain wrongdoings in the financial sector, an award would probably be a tiny percentage of this.  More may come forward with their concerns were there better protection for whistleblowers, but perhaps they should be rewarded more for what is often a remarkably risky act.  We have heard some examples of such cases today.</P>
        <P>We are doing everything as a country to restore confidence internationally and set the conditions for our recovery.  However, we still lag behind countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and many European nations also.  We could significantly improve our reputation in corporate governance and regulation were we to introduce such legislation and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s intention to bring this forward, I hope not in the near future but in the immediate future.  We need whistleblower legislation confined to this area to ensure it materialises, rather than a long drawn out process.  I am amazed by the remarks of Senator Ross.  He referred to the first consideration of this matter in 1999.  We must move on this matter.</P><Col N="133"/>
        <P>I refer to one criticism of the difference between the business world and what happens in legislation, that is, the length of time it takes to get things done.  Let us move on this immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Although I acknowledge the culture has improved immeasurably in recent years, if we had a culture of openness and transparency here, there would be no need for whistleblowers or legislation that would oblige the exposure of information which has remained hidden for too long.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the situation in our financial services sector and the difficulties we are obliged to deal with due to that lack of openness and transparency.</P>
        <P>These statements are being made at a very important time.  We are awaiting the publication of the reports which have already been presented of Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson and of the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, on the circumstances surrounding the collapse of our banking sector.  I expect these to be forthright and honest reports and the public debate will be assisted by their publication.  That said, these reports are preliminary and are meant to inform the tribunal of inquiry into the banking system which will follow.  In making these statements it is important we call for that inquiry to be as open and public as possible.  I believe it will predominantly be public, although elements will be private and confidential, being linked to commercial interests and so forth.  The model in place in the US Congress which has been promoted by the Governor of the Central Bank is the one we should follow.  I look forward to decisions being made in the next few weeks that will allow such a tribunal to be held.</P>
        <P>I share the frustration of many Members regarding the lack of legislation and the inability to assist or engender a culture of whistleblowing in this country.  There has been conflicting legal advice as to whether this can be done in one over-arching legislative measure, in a number of measures, through some form of halfway house with a measure to deal with the public service in general and another to cover the financial institutions under the State guarantee, or by having degrees of State ownership.  It must be done to the largest scale and depth possible and as quickly as possible.  Often it is not the fact that there are crimes that are unaccounted for, which unfortunately there are, but the element of cover-up and the lack of ability to get the information that causes greater public concern than the nature of the crime itself.  The culture that allows that to happen is one that generates fear and disbelief among the population, and the political system cannot allow that to occur any longer.</P>
        <P>Like other speakers, I believe we are being too cautious and led by legalities in this area.  There is a type of coquettishness about dealing with the issue, on which we must put a brake.  Ultimately, there are things we do not know, and we do not know them because the individuals who have caused the situations are not being open and honest and those around them do not have the appropriate degree of legal protection that would allow agencies of the State to reveal these issues properly.  Others will ask: &ldquo;If not by now, when?&rdquo;  The time we are living in and the nature of the economic shock we have experienced in terms of the public expenditure crisis and the collapse of the banking system will be seen in retrospect to be an important time for this country.  It is the opportunity out of a crisis that our political system needs to make.  If we do not make these changes now and acknowledge that there have been huge failings in this area which need to be corrected in the very short term, we will have let the country down to an even greater extent than the circumstances that caused the financial and economic crisis in this country.</P>
        <P>After making these statements today I ask that there be some resolve to have the legislation more all-embracing and brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity.  It must be informed by events at the tribunal of inquiry into the banking system, but <Col N="134"/>the Government has determined a short life span of six months for that tribunal.  If we go into the next general election with these issues still being discussed, it will be a huge failure of the political system.  There must be legislation in place and adequate protection.  That protection under the legislation must bring about the transparency that is so badly lacking in our financial services.  Given the scale of resources, which this country does not have, being pumped into resuscitating and perhaps unnaturally keeping alive elements of our financial services, if it is not accompanied by appropriate legislation in the area of transparency and whistleblowing, it will be a further waste, and a criminal waste at that, of public resources.  That cannot and should not happen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the most frustrating things about these debates on transparency and the need for new legislation and measures to deal with whistleblowing and related matters is the extent to which people give the impression that there has only been a recent discovery or realisation of the necessity for such measures.  Senator Ross referred to this.  Senator Boyle hopes there will not be another general election before something is done about this, but there have already been two general elections and we are well into the third Oireachtas since this issue was raised for public debate in 1999 by Deputy Pat Rabbitte who published a Bill that year to deal with this issue.  It is fully 11 years since this matter was first raised for public debate.  It is simply not good enough for anyone, be they a Minister, supporter of the Government or otherwise, to imply that these matters are now coming forward for public consideration and concern and must be addressed in the light of what has happened recently.  We knew about these issues many years ago.  There is little use in people saying that now we have seen the dreadful things that have occurred which we never thought would happen &mdash; the subtext being that they never thought there would be a problem &mdash; but on which we have been proven wrong, we must do something about it.  It is simply not good enough to give the people that excuse.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the conclusion of the company law review group.  Bluntly, the company law review group is wrong.  When we are considering its report and when we are pointing out, as the Minister of State did, the fact that this group of eminent individuals came to this conclusion, we should bluntly state that the conclusion was wrong.  Had these matters been considered in the depth and with the realism with which they should have been considered, the group would have come to a different conclusion.  Mr. Paul Appleby and Mr. Michael Halpenny, the representative of the ICTU, were the two lone members of the group who maintained the view that it was necessary to bring forward a report that proposed robust whistleblower protection and legislation.  When considering the balance sheet of what has occurred, I believe the best way for the Minister of State to view that group&rsquo;s report is to conclude that it was wrong.  We must do something different from what it recommended.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was interesting and helpful in one sense in that it constituted a detailed survey of the current position and the necessity for legislation in different areas.  Where it is deeply disappointing, and I must echo the remarks made by Senator Twomey, is that it is another example of what we see so often in public life in these Houses, especially from the Government, where there is one good reason for doing something and ten reasons for not doing it.  That is what we were treated to today.  Incidentally, we were told 11 years ago by the Government, shortly after Deputy Rabbitte introduced his Bill, that there were significant legal and constitutional difficulties in this area.  What are they?  Eleven years have passed; therefore, the Government should give us a glimpse of what they are.  I am not sure I agree <Col N="135"/>with colleagues who suggest this could be done with a click of one&rsquo;s fingers.  I do not suggest it can be done in 24 or 48 hours, but it certainly does not require 11 years.  It should not even take 11 months.  It might take 11 weeks.</P>
      
        <P>Rather than speaking about White Papers or reports that will be prepared shortly, as the Minister for Justice and Law Reform recently did, I would like the Minister of State to give a convincing and clear indication of a specific timeline for the introduction of the proposed legislation, whether it is sectoral or over-arching.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has called for legislation to protect whistleblowers.  It is not often that a public official such as the Director of Public Prosecutions intervenes in an area such as this.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister of State, rightly, welcomed much of what is in the report by Transparency International.  It is an extremely helpful report.  We must face up to a central political point.  Lying behind the Company Law Review Group report was the fear of upsetting the principle of light regulation.  The report alludes to the concern that we would undermine our competitiveness or damage our image as a country that has light regulation where business happens quickly with little interference or oversight.  That is not a reputation we should want to have or promote internationally.  Our credibility and competitiveness rest on the necessity to have clear, robust and reliable whistleblower legislation.</P>
        <P>Deputy Pat Rabbitte introduced his Bill in 1999 and was told the Government would introduce similar legislation, although it did not do so.  He has again introduced legislation.  It is available for the Government to take up and improve, if it wishes.  The Bill is on the Order Paper.  Let the Government bring forward legislation and toughen up the pious words of the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in his recent speech to the Law Society of Ireland.</P>

	<P>Senator Boyle, rightly, said legislation was an important element of what required to be done and he hoped it would be done quickly.  When will the Minister bring forward these proposals?  It is not good enough to say it will happen in the autumn, although I know that anti-corruption legislation is planned.</P>
        <P>We have heard an impressive survey of the problems and obstacles associated with whistleblower legislation.  The obstacles are not specified.  The legal problems foreseen by the Minister should be explained to us in more detail.  It is not sufficient for a Minister to tell the Seanad that legal and constitutional obstacles exist.  We are all grown up.  We could look at those obstacles and see if we have views about them.  The Government should tell us what they are and let us be party to the debate as to how they can be overcome.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear what Senator Twomey had to say about his professional experience as a medical person.  I have worked in the legal profession.  People who work in financial institutions have a real concern that their employment will be threatened if they come forward and publicise information or otherwise make it available to the authorities.  Instances of this have been outlined to the House today.  Mr. Eugene McErlean is a clear example and there are many others.  There may be many examples of which we will never hear.  The absence of protection for whistleblowers has such a chilling effect on people that we may never know or <Col N="136"/>appreciate the extent, quality and importance of the information people have and which, through fear for their livelihood and professional lives, they have not revealed.</P>
        <P>This issue reduces itself to a political question.  Are we willing to cut through the argument that it is a good thing for Ireland to have a light regulatory regime that stands back from business, the banks and financial institutions, for fear of appearing to be over-regulated?  We need more regulation and not less.  We need quality and discerning regulation and not simply regulation for its own sake.  That would, absolutely, include protection for whistleblowers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We appear to have two economies.  We have the real economy and the financial economy.  The real economy has been making significant progress in recent years.  This week, an editorial in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>  complimented Ireland on the manner in which it was managing its economy and achieving necessary savings without the difficulties experienced in other countries such as the riots in Greece.</P>
        <P>The economy is expected to grow by 3% in 2011 and some growth is expected in the second half of this year.  We have seen an upturn in retail sales.  The Central Statistics Office shows an increase in exports through Dublin Port.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, the Central Bank and the European Commission are all agreed that we are heading for a period of growth.  Retail figures in the motor trade are up, consumer sentiment is high, employment is stabilising and many respected financial journals, other than <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>, believe NAMA and the measures we have taken will work.  We should not diminish the difficulties we had 20 months ago when we did not know what type of economy we faced into or what type of recession the world faced.  Notwithstanding this, we have come through strongly and with flying colours.  We can already see an element of growth.  People are beginning to feel more confident in their jobs and this confidence is reflected in consumer spending.</P>
        <P>Then there is the financial economy which caused all the problems.  The financial economy can be affected by a regional savings bank in Spain going under, affecting global markets and the price of the euro, dollar, sterling and yen.  The financial market is unstable because there has been massive fraudulent misrepresentation of what was happening.  We are fortunate that this massive fraudulent misrepresentation took place mostly in the United States, originally with sub-prime lending, abuse by hedge funds and the market manipulation by those same funds.  Problems were created and the security of banks driven down in order that when Lehman Brothers collapsed,  inter-bank lending was not possible because no one in the banking sector was sure who they could trust anymore and strong difficulties were created within that sector.  The people responsible are as guilty of a criminal act as many who appear in the Four Courts and receive jail sentences for relatively minor crimes.  These people in the banking sector have got away with their actions for years.</P>
        <P>There is a perception in Ireland that people have got away with wrongdoing.  Let us face facts.  There was systematic overcharging in our banking system.  Even recently, I saw a cheque from Visa, which was a repayment for overcharging.  There are other examples.  Banks overcharged systematically on their charges, by giving incorrect interest rates and on currency exchange.  It is high time good people who stand up and are prepared to give information were not held liable for letting down the financial institutions employing them.  It is about time malpractice and parallel companies were addressed.  Such companies are outside the laws affecting ordinary transactions because they are in the financial services sector, but that should not make a difference.  This will be dealt with comprehensively in the whistleblowing legislation.</P>
        <P>We have a new economy and a fresh start.  We know what went wrong and it must be ensured it will not happen again because our financial memory is short.  We should have listened to the warnings of commentators in the late 1920s and early 1930s and the inaugural speech of Pres<Col N="137"/>ident Roosevelt who threatened to do away with merchant banks that had increased the credit available beyond the capacity of people to repay.  The responsibility of those in the financial sector is double that of those who operate in the main economy.  Therefore, we should take strong action now to restore credibility.  Banking is about credibility and belief.  We have created the economic environment in which to trade in this country, but we do not want a scenario in a few years where we will find a bank trading from the IFSC has been responsible for wrongdoing in another country, which could easily happen unless the Government properly and comprehensively deals with white collar crime.  Such crime has been more devastating to economies, people&rsquo;s livelihoods and well-being and the future of nations than other forms of crimes.  That is why we must be deal with it finally, as we embrace a new economy and a fresh start in order that stability can be restored to the financial services sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a little confusion earlier which I said I would explain.  I mentioned to our Whip, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, that I was interested in this matter and he asked me to lead off.  I had agreed to share time with Senator Quinn but then I discovered Senator Ross had a particular interest in the matter and I was happy to yield to him.  That was the source of the confusion.</P>
        <P>The reason I have an interest in the debate is I have tabled motion No. 16 on the Order Paper which has been seconded by Senators Bacik, Quinn and Mullen on whistleblowing, a serious issue.  I have also had direct involvement with two whistleblowing cases and, on both occasions, the persons involved lost their jobs and were not protected, to which I will refer again.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution was bland and he made a number of worrying comments.  He stated, for example, in trying to define &ldquo;whistleblowing&rdquo;, it is &ldquo;usually interpreted to mean the reporting in good faith of a breach or potential breach of the law...&rdquo;.  However, there are other standards such as good governance, morality, the protection of children and so on and they are inadequately covered because the Government parties have withdrawn and retreated from their original position which was to introduce general legislation.  They gave a commitment in this regard but then withdrew it under pressure from now discredited financial sources.  The Minister of State said, &ldquo;while one grand-slam piece of legislation to provide blanket protection would be desirable, there were considerable legal obstacles...,&rdquo; which he did not specify.  Perhaps he will mention what these are.  Is it not curious that these fanciful objections have not obstructed successful engagement on the neighbouring island, the United Kngdom, where for the past ten years a comprehensive whistleblowing law has been in place and operated without once dragging the system into court?  There has not been the slightest legal hitch, which is interesting.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State then recited laws that provided a degree of whistleblowers protection.  There are 15 in all, but they are patchy and irregular.  There is no harmonisation and they do not give the degree of protection required.  I will refer to a number of specific instances later.  He stated blandly, &ldquo;Generally, disclosures are protected where they are made in good faith...,&rdquo; but that is not the case.  That is simply not true and it is dangerous to give people a false sense of security that they are protected by legislation when they simply are not.  That is where I would start from.</P>
        <P>This issue has arisen in the aftermath of a direct call by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. James Hamilton, for the introduction of legislation in this area.  It is in my experience highly unusual for an officeholder such as this to engage with the Government in this way.  Therefore, it is appropriate to take action.  It is three years since a body called the company law review group lobbied against such a proposal.  This was an interesting group as it was chaired by Dr. Courtney, a partner in the leading firm of lawyers, Arthur Cox, which does <Col N="138"/>quite a bit of government work.  It rejected the idea of a law on whistleblower protection in 2007 stating, &lsquo;&ldquo;One cannot say that there is any evidence of endemic failure in relation to corporate governance or its enforcement in Ireland that negatively affects the investment climate and which requires enhanced &lsquo;whistleblowing&rsquo; provisions.&rdquo;  It is interesting that the group stated there was no evidence of corporate governance queries or problems.  Perhaps its members had not heard of the Ansbacher bank, about which I wrote an article in the <i>Evening Herald </i>at the time.  Therefore, I knew about it, but, apparently, this group was unaware of it, which suggests a degree of ignorance that might not place its members in the best position to advise a Minister.  What about National Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks, Irish Trust Bank, PMPA and ICI which resulted in the taxpayer bailing out a major financial institution and so on?</P>
        <P>A series of whistleblowers in AIB paid the price prior to 2007.  Mr. Tony Spollen, group head of internal audit, had to leave after preparing an internal report that the bank faced an estimated &euro;100 million liability over its failure to collect DIRT and he was proved completely right.  Whereas politicians and bankers have been asleep on the jobs, there have been useful contributions by commentators in the press recently, in particular, Kathleen Barrington in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> and John Devitt in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  In 2001 Mr. Rupert Walker was sacked by the British subsidiary of AIB, Govett, because he had blown the whistle on dodgy practices within the bank.  Former AIB group internal auditor, Mr. Eugene McErlean, was not fired but his contract was not renewed.  Senior officials in the bank tried to pin the Rusnak scandal on him in revenge because he had brought to the attention of the board matters, including overcharging and peculiar offshore trading in the bank&rsquo;s shares.  He also brought them to the attention of the Financial Regulator and paid the price.</P>
        <P>I raised two cases in the House, one of which related to the former head of ISME whose civil rights have been completely violated.  People in Departments lied and suppressed information that was necessary and the Garda obfuscated and they are continuing to do so, despite questions being raised in both Houses.  He cannot get justice and lost his job.  I also raised the case of a whistleblower in the IFSC who had brought to my attention and that of the House a serious situation regarding a major bank in the centre.  Nobody took him up on it until <i>S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung</i> got into it.  Where an employee in a bank reports dodgy loans, for example, he or she will not be protected under the proposed legislation.  If a nurse innocently and honestly makes a report on bad conduct, she could be sentenced to three years in jail.  Does the Minister of State think that is a serious response?  He referred to good faith, but I am outlining what is the actual situation.  My niece is in a school for special children and assumed to have reported certain bad practices to the HSE.  At this moment she is probably in floods of tears in that school in north Dublin as she is being punished for being a whistleblower.  Let us not pretend that this legislation is anything other than a farce.  It does not do what it states it is going to do and it is clear we should introduce such comprehensive legislation as has successfully worked in other jurisdictions in the past ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to speak on the subject of whistleblowing.  There have been a number of high profile cases in the banking world where brave individuals have sought to highlight wrongdoing only for their careers and lives to be put on hold or, worse, ruined as a result.  I have no doubt countless others would have made matters public on points of principle but were afraid because of concerns that in doing so, they might put their livelihoods at risk.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister of State said the Government had never sought to play party politics with this issue.  He mentioned the Labour Party Bill of 11 years ago and said a number of amendments were necessary in that regard.  I cannot help believing those amendments might have <Col N="139"/>been introduced at some stage in the past 11 years.  If that had happened, we might have averted some aspects of the current banking crisis or at least mitigated some of the damage done by individuals in the intervening years since we attempted to bring forward that Bill.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;whistleblowing&rdquo; comes from English policemen blowing their whistles on noticing the commission of a crime.  The more technical term, as pointed out by the Minister of State, is &ldquo;reporting in good faith&rdquo;, which has been defined as, &ldquo;the public disclosure by a person, working within an organisation, of acts, omissions, practices or policies perceived as morally wrong by that person, and is a disclosure regarded as wrongful by that organisation&rsquo;s authorities&rdquo;.  A whistleblower is someone who sounds the alarm within an organisation in which he or she works, aiming to spotlight neglect or abuses which threaten the public interest.  Apart from the Labour Party Bill, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has done significant work on this issue and it is clear his office agrees with the Labour Party position that we need comprehensive regulation to protect whistleblowers such as the Public Interest Disclosure Act in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement called for the inclusion of a whistleblower provision in the companies legislation.  This proposal would have provided protection for whistleblowers in cases where the disclosure was made in good faith, where a person had sought to bring a matter to the attention of those responsible, internally at first or following attempts to address it internally if no action had been taken to remedy the default.  Those proposals strike a good balance in ensuring people are encouraged to report matters internally, have such issues dealt with by their managers and only resort to whistleblowing as a last resort.</P>
        <P>It is very disappointing that the company law reform group has rejected this proposal in its submission to Government on a new companies Bill.  I note the Minister of State said that a majority recommendation of the group was to the effect that this should not be included in the new companies Bill.  This conclusion was arrived at because the group took into account the degree of malpractice, the nature and extent of such disclosure, with the reputational risk for companies, and concluded that such an initiative was not warranted.  I wonder whether the group would have come to the same conclusion today after all the wrongdoing highlighted in the past two years.  I believe that, in the event, it would have come to a different conclusion.</P>
        <P>Research from the United Kingdom has found that companies can lose up to 5% of turnover as a result of internal malpractice.  Effective whistleblowing can help to counter and prevent this.  While it is hardly surprising that the Government is running scared on this issue, it makes one wonder what it can be afraid of.  It is disingenuous for the Government to state this can be dealt with sector by sector.  This means, in effect, that only those working in a small number of State bodies which have a whistleblowing provision in their founding legislation will have legal protection while the majority of State employees and all those working in the private sector will have no protection at all.</P>
        <P>Today we are focusing on the financial services sector and, yet again, the Government is showing its determination to avoid whistleblowing at all costs.  A couple of weeks ago the Taoiseach admitted something all of us had known for the past two years, namely, that there had been a stunning failure of corporate governance in the banks.  If we are to address the issue of these past failures, we need to put in place a strong and effective corporate governance structure, part of which would include effective policies and procedures to support those who feel the need to blow the whistle.</P>
        <P>In the last month the Financial Regulator has published a draft code on corporate governance for banks and financial institutions which, as with the rehashed programme for Government, was produced in consultation with the Government.  The contents of this draft code are broadly based on the provisions of the combined code of corporate governance with which companies <Col N="140"/>listed on the UK and Irish Stock Exchanges are required to comply.  One of the interesting omissions from this draft code was the provision of the combined code section C.3.4 in relation to audit committees.  It states that audit committees should review arrangements by which staff of a company may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reports or other matters as well.   Will the Minister of State clarify whether the omission of this requirement concerning audit committees is deliberate on the part of the Government?  If it is an error, he should clarify this because if there was a deliberate decision to exclude this provision, I am baffled as to why given what we now know.  I call on the Government to review that decision.</P>
        <P>A code is not sufficient.  As we have seen, the banks have paid lip service to these whistleblowing policies and speak-up charters.  We need effective monitoring and oversight of the corporate governance code to ensure the whistleblowing policies and procedures are put in place.  We need to ensure they work in practice in order that whistleblowers know they can call time on malpractices within their organisations without fear of getting P45s for their efforts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>My party is determined to introduce strong whistleblowing legislation.  We believe the unacceptable practices at the banks and in other public bodies might well have been uncovered sooner if such legislation had been in place.  Although there are limited protections for employees in certain legislation, there are several problems also.</P>
        <P>Not all employees in either the public or private sectors are safe from retaliation if they report wrongdoing.  There is virtually no protection for whistleblowers in the financial services and business sectors and there is little in the way of whilstleblower codes and guidance to be found throughout the public service.  Our proposed legislation will not harm any business that is compliant with the relevant regulations and ethics in their industry.</P>
        <P>We have published the legislative proposals to give protection to the whistleblowers in the open government Bill 2010, which forms part of Fine Gael&rsquo;s political reform policy, New Politics.  The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008 was published on 6 June 2008.  Two years later it still has not been enacted by the Government.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform said only two weeks ago that he was going to progress the Bill and only then because of sustained pressure to protect whistleblowers.  We will certainly support this measure but believe it does not go far enough.  For example, the Government has tabled an amendment to the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008 which is specific to an offence under that legislation and relates only to the public service and to public officials only where they receive some personal benefit or obtain it from another person.  The Government has inserted a whistleblower provision as an amending section, section 8A.  This is very limited because section 8 itself is very limited.  It is the only reference to corruption in public office.</P>
        <P>In contrast, our proposals are deliberately general.  We need far more than simply this limited offence of corruption in public office offered by the Government.  Hence, the very broad list of areas where an employee can make a protected disclosure.  This would cover, for example, a bank employee&rsquo;s reporting of the fact that the bank did not have proper internal auditing controls in place or was giving out loans without proper legal documentation.  Another example is the misuse of public funds, as we saw in F&Aacute;S.  The 2008 Bill provides for communication to &ldquo;an appropriate person&rdquo;, which is defined as a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or, where the suspected transgression occurred in the course of a person&rsquo;s employment, the employer or a person nominated by the employer.  We do not think this is satisfactory.  Our proposals would allow for whistleblowing disclosures to be made by a nominated person who might be independent.  For whistleblowing provisions to work, employees or members of the public must trust the independence of the person receiving the information.  Nobody will go to his or her <Col N="141"/>employer with information if there is no protection.  It is recognised by all parties in the House that we need strong whistleblower legislation.  We can only think of what could have been prevented if we had had such legislation before the banking crisis and the F&Aacute;S debacle.  I recommend that the Government introduce stronger legislation than it is proposing in the form of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill.  I hope such proposals will be brought before us at the earliest opportunity.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate and particularly for the passion they have injected into it.  I commit to discussing their inputs, including their concerns about restrictions on the proposals, with my ministerial colleagues, after which I will come back to the House to update it.</P>
        <P>It is wrong to suggest, as some Senators have, that nothing has been done and that we are trying to ignore this issue.  When one considers the range of legislation under which we have dealt with specific sectoral issues since the middle of the last decade, as Senator MacSharry mentioned, one can see the Government&rsquo;s intent in this regard.  I have acknowledged that the position has changed since the company law review group made its recommendations.  I also accept what Senator Norris said about events that occurred before that.  We will reflect these changes in the Bills we will bring before the House in the autumn.</P>
        <P>I again thank Senators for their constructive inputs.  I will return to update the House at an appropriate time.</P></Speaker>

        <P FLI="0">I apologise for the unavoidable absence on more important business of my colleague, Senator Healy Eames.  I am her unworthy replacement.</P>
        <P>As a society we face two major challenges and they are inextricably linked.  We must deal with an unemployment crisis &mdash; as of today we have an additional 5,000 people unemployed &mdash; and also restore our economic fortunes.  Central to both exercises is the upskilling of the unemployed.  Increasing the skills base, innovative capacity and creativity of the entire population is necessary.  Recovery in the economy depends on reaching our full potential.  In this regard, we must target those at the lower end of the skills base.  The largest rate of decline in employment is in the construction sector, with males under the age of 25 years being the worst hit, predominantly in the Border, midlands and west, BMW, area, particularly in my own county of Cavan where 7,500 are currently unemployed, a large cohort of whom are under 25.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that 37% of adults in Ireland have not completed second level schooling in full.  A total of 18% of Irish pupils do not survive in the system long enough to complete the leaving certificate.  Those with poor skills have difficulty in gaining employment.  They also face other difficulties in terms of being vulnerable to substance abuse and such difficulties become generational.  Predominant among this group are young men and migrants.  It is a myth that all migrants are returning to their own countries.  There are a large number who have migrated here.  An important challenge is presented by upskilling those at levels 1 to 3 &mdash; second and third year at second level &mdash; to levels 4 to 5 &mdash; leaving certificate level.  That is the biggest challenge we face in the system.</P>
        <P>The percentage of the labour force with higher education qualifications, that is, levels 6 to 10, increased from 33% in 2005 to 39% in 2009 and the target is to reach the figure of 48% by 2020.  That is a good news story, which I welcome.  The figure at levels 4 and 5 &mdash; upper secondary and leaving certificate &mdash; has remained at 40% and the target is to reach the figure of 45% by 2020.  There is, therefore, much to be done in that regard.</P>
        <P>There is a need to combat early school leaving and increase literacy and numeracy skills.  There is a need also for integration of literacy and numeracy skills with all publicly funded education and training programmes.  All education courses, including apprenticeships and other State funded courses, should have a literacy and numeracy content, the need for which should be established by screening.  In May less than half of the 33 VEC adult literacy services had validated programmes leading to certification at level 2.  That is not a good news story.  This problem must be sorted out.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>Public funding support for workplace training and education programmes should be attached to the literacy and numeracy content.  In the last budget the third level maintenance grant was removed if a person was in receipt of the back to education allowance.  While on the face of it that might seem equitable, in practice it is a huge disincentive in returning to school.  We have a great deal of experience in that regard.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach and I know of many people, through the VTOS and the VEC in County Cavan, who have availed of the back to education allowance and benefited hugely from it.  I could chronicle many stories in that regard.  Adult education officers are not being replaced because of the moratorium on recruitment.  That is not acceptable because of the critical nature of that position.  There is a need for additional VTOS and back to education initiative places.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision of the labour activation fund, but it was rushed over Easter.  As a result, the design of courses may be rushed.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the matter and whether the tendering was rushed also.  He should examine the content of courses and ensure there is good validation and good quality courses available.  The VECs and PLCs should <Col N="143"/>have primacy in this regard.  There is nothing that F&Aacute;S has done in contemporary times that should give it primacy over the VECs and PLCs.</P>
        <P>We need innovation, problem solving, design and language skills.  There are two ends to that market.  Many who were carried away by the Celtic tiger and left school prematurely or because of generational or societal difficulties need upskilling in numeracy and literacy, but at the upper end of the market we must upskill people in problem solving, design, computer skills, continental languages and so on &mdash; I refer to graduates in many instances &mdash; to make them employable.</P>
        <P>There are 250,000 people employed in the wholesale and retail business.  A total of 50,000 are directly employed in the food and drink sector; some 60,000 are indirectly involved, with 120,000 farmers.  There was a proposal to establish an industry forum to deal with upskilling, training and retraining.  Will the Minister of State if any progress has been made in that regard.  What is the current position, as I am not aware of any progress having been made.  There was also a suggestion that we should have a dedicated college.  I put a similar question to the Minister in that regard.</P>
        <P>By 2020 we will need 3,000 nurses and midwives each year.  We will also need an increased number of general practitioners.  What is being done in that regard?</P>
        <P>My party has a proposal which seems to be eminently sensible or, to use the awful clich&eacute;, a no brainer.  We should have internships.  There should also be part-time placements for graduates.  We propose there should be 10,000 such places made available throughout the country.  We have a similar proposal in respect of apprenticeships and are also proposing a job sharing initiative.  These initiatives should be examined as a way of absorbing graduates into the system and giving them work experience aimed at lifelong learning.  Our great inheritance from previous generations was their identification of the importance of education and lifelong education.  Education is the key to solving all of our difficulties and in presenting opportunities.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on these issues.  The amendment to the motion states not enough is being done.  Nobody could contend otherwise.  I am sure Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; will accept the amendment, without the need for a division.</P>

I am not giving out about Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; who was hauled in to propose the motion, but surely the Government could have had Members here to speak at least within five minutes so as not to leave other Members waiting.  I understand Members have to attend other meetings, but those of us who came to the Chamber at 5 p.m. also have meetings we would like to attend.

        <P>I am not particularly pleased with the motion the Government has put before the House.  It is common for it, when availing of Private Members&rsquo; time, to put these particularly ridiculous motions before the House in which it praises its own efforts in particular sectors.  However, nothing could be further from the truth in the matter of lifelong learning.  There is a danger that every Government will believe its own propaganda and mistake statements for actions and press releases for the reality.  The Government has succumbed to that danger and this motion is confirmation, if it is needed, that the Government is seriously out of touch with reality.  Only the truly delusional could congratulate this Government for its commitment to lifelong learning at a time when one fifth of the labour force has only a junior certificate qualification.  Before I go any further, I should state that I do not doubt the commitment of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; or the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey to lifelong education, but it is unfortunate this commitment is not shared by the Government, which has failed to properly fund the service or to understand the strategic importance of lifelong learning in the national economy or to the lives and career development of people who are living and working in a knowledge economy.</P>
        <P>Ireland is currently gripped by the worst recession in living memory and there is no business, household or individual which has not been impacted.  The global credit crunch, the domestic banking crisis and, in particular, the implosion of the construction sector have hit the Irish economy hard.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;the smart economy&rdquo; is another that is often used but little understood by Ministers.  The smart economy is shorthand for describing an economy which makes full use of information technology and communications to drive innovation, research and development in a world where economic growth must be environmentally sustainable.  In essence, the smart economy is all about driving productivity and increasing the value of our assets.  The biggest asset we have in Ireland right now is our people and the best way to drive productivity is through increasing educational attainment.</P>
        <P>It is estimated today that every year the average level of education of the adult population is raised there is a corresponding increase of 3.7% in long-term economic growth, which is a very significant figure.  However, education is not only about economics or growth; it is really about people.  Behind all the statistics are real people &mdash; thirty-somethings with young families faced with losing their homes, parents anxiously worried about the future of their teenage children and construction workers, in particular, wondering whether to take the boat or to stay in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are now in excess of 440,000 people claiming unemployment assistance, up more than 50,000 from this time last year.  These people need more than monetary assistance; they need hope and the means to build a new future in a reborn economy.  They also need a system of lifelong learning that works and that delivers real and meaningful education and training when and where they need it.  They need a system that facilitates the learner and does not put obstacles in the way, but this is not what they are getting right now.  How can the Government, with a straight face, ask this House to commend it for its commitment to lifelong learning when in 2009 it accounted for a mere 4% of the overall education budget or 0.22% of GDP?</P>
        <P>In the last budget at a time of spiralling unemployment, the Government took a number of measures to discourage people from going back into education.  From September 2010, if one qualifies for the back to education allowance or VTOS allowance for a PLC course, one will no longer be eligible for the student maintenance grant which could support one&rsquo;s participation by an additional &euro;6,500 per year.  Budget 2010 disbanded the Millennium Partnership Fund which provided some financial support for adult learners, particularly those from disadvantaged <Col N="145"/>communities.  In addition, if one is eligible for a student grant, then one can expect to receive a reduction of 5% in accordance with changes announced in the last budget.</P>
        <P>There is now a significant demand for adult education.  People want to learn.  They want to build their skills and they want to get back into the workforce.  Last year Aontas, the adult education service, received just over 6,000 queries &mdash; the number has doubled since 2007.  In 2009, there were 37,000 applicants for 13,000 places on PLC courses.  The VTOS recorded a 50% increase in applications over the previous year.  The number of applications for the back-to-education allowance approved in October 2009 was almost 19,000, up from a total figure for the previous year of 11,500 applications.</P>
        <P>The people are willing to work to get themselves a second chance at education but the system is failing them.  Due to the public service embargo, adult education officers are leaving the system and are not being replaced.  I am aware of the position in County Mayo, for example, where both adult education officers retired in 2009 with the result that there is now no-one holding that position in the entire county.</P>
        <P>I have dealt with several queries, as, I am sure, have other Senators, from unemployed persons who are trying to find out to what they are entitled when they seek to go back to education and what courses are available, and to be honest, the system just does not work.  Why can we not put in place a single website where a person can answer a questionnaire which tells him or her, at least roughly speaking, to what he or she is entitled and allows him or her to search and apply for suitable courses?  Why, in this day and age, are we still putting people through hoops to find basic information?</P>
        <P>If one is born in certain parts of this city, or maybe certain parts of the country, one is more likely to end up in Mountjoy than in Trinity, and the State would gladly pay more to keep you there for a year than it ever spent on your education.  There is no more shameful waste than the waste of human talent.  As a nation, we can no longer afford a system that does not enable lifelong learning.  The system should not only enable, but encourage and foster lifelong learning so that we can develop all of our people&rsquo;s potential.</P>
        <P>Lifelong learning can mean starting at the beginning, picking up from early school leaving on which Senator Healy-Eames has recently done a report or retraining after unemployment.  We should not forget that for many lifelong learning means starting, not restarting, their education.  We really need to look at proper funding for the community educational sector.</P>
        <P>This House cannot commend the Government for its commitment to lifelong learning, rather we should condemn it for the poverty of its ambition and the ham-fisted <i>ad hoc</i> way it has approached one of the central social and economic challenges of our times, namely giving our unemployed citizens new skills and renewed hope.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.</P>
        <P>When I moved the motion, I omitted to apologise for the late commencement but I do that now.  We regret that it happened.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that this debate is taking place this evening.  I will not go into the nitty-gritty of whether the motion or the amendment is necessarily the main flag-bearer of the debate.  What we should look at, first, is the history of education here.</P>
        <P>Most people would accept that it was precisely because of the high standard of education that we made such progress during the good years in Ireland.  In many ways, it was education that led the Celtic tiger throughout those years as well.  We have been credited, not only within the country but internationally, with being well ahead in the context of IT.  It was because young people took so well to that revolution at that time and it prepared them, not only for the developments that were to take place in Ireland but, for those who decided of their own <Col N="146"/>volition to leave Ireland and went to a country of their adoption, to be confident as compared to those who emigrated from Ireland in previous decades.  We need only look at the success that many of those people attained when they went abroad.  Some of them went into senior management positions.  From time to time I have looked at the top 100 as presented by <i>Irish America</i> magazine and there one will find that many of these young people, as they moved on in life, are now listed among the top 100 because of their achievements and their success.  That would not have happened only for their solid foundation.</P>
        <P>In a practical sense, at home as well, there was a time when third level education was open only to the very wealthy and there was a particular class distinction about that.  We all could identify the potential of those we knew for further education but, because the doors were not open to them for economic reasons, often they had to forego that potential and forego their ambitions as well.</P>
        <P>Now we see an entirely new situation.  As a result of the business structures in this country and the entrepreneurship which has come to the fore, young people are coming forward who are not from very wealthy backgrounds but who are successful because of their own ability.  The opportunities provided to them have enabled them, over a number of decades, not only to open the door but to enter fully into the opportunities which presented themselves.  These young people in turn have become role models for their own peer group and for other young people.  This goes back to the education system which prepared them for whatever opportunities came their way.</P>
        <P>This debate is considering the new challenges facing us as a result of the economic recession.  Considerable numbers of people are no longer employed.  Many of these people were quite skilled in particular areas when opportunities existed for those skills.  We have always been good at responding to current needs.  I look back at the success of the vocational education committees which provided pragmatic and practical training to suit the particular era.  For those who had grown out of the education system at a particular age, night courses were available.  I look back and see how many people came to the fore, learned new crafts in those vocational courses and were able to go out and create jobs for themselves. These jobs did not create significant statistics to put up on the noticeboard but they were self-sustaining crafts within the local community.  Even when economic challenges came their way, those types of cottage industries were not affected, generally speaking, because they did not have the same overheads or international competition to contend with.  This should be one of the guiding thoughts when talking about upskilling.  We should not just think of upskilling in the pure academic sense but rather about upskilling to avail of new opportunities which may come our way.</P>
        <P>Tourism is one area.  It was one of the big revenue earners for this country although we have greater challenges now.  I still think that in this year and future years, while there will be a percentage drop, tourism is still very important.  The training in that case should be to dissect the tourism industry.  It is one of the industries which spreads throughout the whole country.  It is not centralised in areas of large population.  Many of our main attractions are away from areas of large population and, therefore, the opportunities are being dispersed.  It will not be sufficient to take for granted that people will automatically come like they did in the past because we had that generational connection, especially with America.  This is changing and we have to be keen on becoming more professional and, in the best sense, exploit our strengths.  We cannot just go with the tide.  Our education must include not just university education but also practical education in other third level institutions.  The vocational model can play a particular role.</P>
        <P>The House discussed F&Aacute;S over the years and there have been a number of distractions from the great successes of F&Aacute;S and the potential that concept presented for the future.  We often <Col N="147"/>focused on a very small element of F&Aacute;S management but we did not look down into all the schemes operating within communities, each with its own evolution and organic development.  I appeal to the Minister of State to keep in mind the potential of this type of training.  I know of a number of schemes where F&Aacute;S training resulted in 98% job placement.  This is a significant figure which was replicated in many other areas.  The normal structured sense of education will not be able to offer urgent help to the 400,000 waiting to be serviced.  I do not see any reason the F&Aacute;S model and the networks which exist locally and which are well managed and successful cannot be used urgently for providing training for at least 100,000 people from the live register.  I hope, therefore, we do not just think long-term but also think short-term.  I have done considerable research on this topic to see how we might avail of it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the current structured education, everyone seems to be thinking about university, which is good in itself and is a sign of the times.  Having obtained a primary degree, students then think about a masters degree and a doctorate, all of which are vital and correct because education is more than just a job and economics.  If we are talking about providing more jobs, however, it is important to consider what young people are being prepared for in university or in any of the other colleges.  I know of many areas where people are doing their four years&rsquo; study and an extra one year but I am not clear if the opportunities for jobs will be there for them when they leave that educational structure.  This comes back to career guidance in the schools.  In the present recessionary times if we are thinking of education as a stepping stone to a job, our guidance counsellors should be trained to adapt to new situations.  They should be preparing the people who come to their counselling sessions in the context of what jobs will be available for them and help them select the suitable courses.  In addition to selecting the courses, we should consider whether existing courses will prepare them for the existing economic climate.</P>
        <P>We should take hope that there has been very little slippage in our level of exports.  We should consider industrial production, crafts and the products which can be sold abroad.  We should also focus on the basis for that export business.  If, for instance, it is one of our strengths, like tourism, then this is an area of focus.  We should also look at the agriculture area.  I was delighted years ago when I saw the development of agricultural colleges which produced young people well-trained in all aspects of the agricultural industry.  I suggest we need to look at the area of organic farming and organic horticulture precisely because we have a good name and a clean environment and this is one of our strengths.  I hope that in future, education will take that into the proper context.  I am not getting into the nitty-gritty of the motion or the amendment, <i>per se</i>, because that will be well attended to by others.  I am looking at the essentials of what education is for.  It is about delivering a rounded character, but at the same time it is about preparing people for jobs that will become available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, and am pleased that he is taking this debate.  He has taken this subject into his own ambit and has become very knowledgeable in the area.  I appreciate that he is in the Chamber to hear what we have to say.  </P>
        <P>Lifelong learning begins in pre-school and continues to the post-retirement stage.  It is a continuous process.  Education is a fundamental factor in improving our knowledge, skills and competence.  The country currently faces major economic and social challenges, and education is of fundamental importance.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to adopt a national skills strategy to examine the skills profile to 2020.  It clearly shows that if Ireland is to make progress vis-&agrave;-vis our competitors, we must focus on skills development at various levels.  We must examine where jobs are likely to be in future, but how can we go about doing that?  We are now in a major recession and <Col N="148"/>therefore we must assess what kind of courses are most suitable.  We must also decide how to reach out to the unemployed to take on the challenges of the future.</P>
        <P>I have undertaken some research to determine how to protect existing jobs and create new ones.  We must examine the various courses that are available.  I welcome the adult education budget increases which have gone from &euro;256 million in 2006 to &euro;420 million this year.  Let there be no doubt that it is a major commitment, which stands alone.  It means that 23,000 adult education and training places have been created since then, which is a big step forward.  How can we design education courses that will afford access and transfer opportunities for low-skilled, disadvantaged and unemployed people, as well as undergraduates and graduates?  Such courses must be open to all.  The main purpose is to provide a range of supports to those who have left school early, are unemployed and require further vocational education and training to enhance their employment prospects.  Upskilling can enable them to take part in what is a very competitive environment.  They should be facilitated to re-enter the jobs market, which is the core objective.  We must get the requisite courses in line with the vision of the national skills strategy to place square pegs into square holes.</P>
        <P>The Youthreach project, which is aimed at school drop-outs, is an excellent one targeting young people from 15 to 20 years of age.  They may not like the school environment, but they can work in a community environment instead.  That system is working, but we must ensure that the right type of teachers are engaged who understand the young people involved.  The latter cohort do not want to be involved in a structured school situation, so an alternative programme is required for them.  There are horses for courses, so some teachers may be better suited to the community style environment than to the school-room.  Sometimes, academic teachers do not fit well into Youthreach courses.  We should be watchful to ensure that such courses will work for young people who cannot adapt to normal school structures.</P>
        <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme, or VTOS, provides superb programmes for people seeking to re-enter the education system.  The vocational skills courses provided by VTOS are excellent.  Post-leaving certificate courses facilitate entry at all levels, including to third-level institutes of technology.  PLC courses cover vocational skills, work experience, vocational studies and general studies.  They are suitable for those who do not like a formal structure, in addition to leaving certificate applied students, or those who have left the system and now wish to return to it.  PLC courses provide such people with an entr&eacute;e to the education sector, thus giving them a chance to move on to institutes of technology.</P>
        <P>Part-time community programmes provide courses in literacy and numeracy.  Many people may have had great jobs in the construction industry, but could not read or write.  They are now coming to terms with themselves and, with time on their hands, they can opt to pursue adult literacy courses.  They are doing very well in the areas with which I am familiar.</P>
        <P>The back to education initiative provides access to part-time education.  In that way, students can work with a chosen industrial sector while pursuing flexible courses.  That system also applies to higher education courses.  In future, we will have to change course content to absorb the partnership arrangement whereby those in full-time employment can get time off to attend such courses.  Alternatively, part-time workers could access courses two days a week, for example.  We need to work closely in a partnership arrangement with the business community and in conjunction with local schools.</P>
        <P>In the past, the Dublin industrial estates worked well with schools, involving various work experience programmes.  Industry representatives gave lectures in schools, particularly for leaving certificate applied and post-leaving certificate students.  We now need more of that type of co-operation and co-ordination.</P><Col N="149"/>
        <P>The strategic innovation fund covers flexible learning projects which are becoming more prevalent in the institutes of technology.  Flexible courses can encompass a vision of the future, including how to upskill people for jobs and change society&rsquo;s focus towards the kind of jobs that will arise.  All our higher education institutes must change their course content to suit future needs.  Many degree courses have not evolved over the past ten years, so they should become more flexible and outwardly focused.  Academics need to be more open-minded in accepting new suggestions, rather than going by the book and ignoring a vision for the future.  I hope the situation will change.   F&Aacute;S has done a good job, but I am still a bit worried about duplication.  If we are to encourage upskilling, we must consider all the stakeholders.  I refer to officials in the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection and Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and to other stakeholders such as teachers and higher education academics.  More co-ordination is necessary if we are to fill the new jobs and courses of the future.  We need a vision if we are to move from where we are.  The strategy is a good move.  I hope we can use it as a guideline.  If more stakeholders are involved, perhaps it will be broadened further.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to start on a positive note.  I went to Clonakilty, County Cork, a few days ago after the business of the Seanad had concluded.  I was driven to meet some transition year students who had completed a couple of remarkable projects.  One beautiful girl had assessed the gender-based differences in taste regarding perfume and scent, etc.  She tested them very scientifically in a blind test and came up with what turned out to be the formula for Chanel No. 5.  This interesting and fun project might also have some degree of commercial application.  Much better than that was the project undertaken by a group of young women of approximately 15 years of age who had spotted a local difficulty, the efflorescence of sea lettuce, which is a form of seaweed that had accumulated in the local bay.  When it made its way onto the shore, it dried out and stank.  They isolated this problem and examined it.  When they collected the material in question, they discovered they could treat it and compress it to create briquettes.  It burned for twice as long as peat and gave the same heat value.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is marvellous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Young people with such initiative give hope to our country by being able to turn a problem into an advantage.  I spoke last night at a dinner in Trinity College for the disability programme that provides access to the college.  The students who attended the dinner were really inspiring.  One of them, Rosaleen McDonagh, has been a candidate in my constituency on several occasions.  She refused to allow her disadvantages as a Traveller woman in a wheelchair to disbar her from education.  I wanted to start with the positives.  I praise Donogh O&rsquo;Malley and all the rest who freed up access.  By 2020, if things go right, approximately 70% of leaving certificate students will go on to third level education.  That is extraordinary and marvellous.</P>
        <P>We cannot rely on clich&eacute;s.  It is not sufficient to talk about people who are wonderfully educated.  It is blather.  Dr. Craig Barrett punctured that little bubble for us.  We are not as great as we think we are.  We need to face the problem realistically.  If we address it, we will be in a position to capitalise on the talent in this country.  We need to look at what happened when access to education was freed up in Northern Ireland, for example.  I read the other day about the extraordinary roll call of former pupils of St. Columb&rsquo;s College in Derry, including John Hume, the musician, Phil Coulter, Seamus Heaney and Seamus Deane.  It is possible that none of them would have completed their careers as successfully as they did without the improvements in educational access.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention some indicators.  Earlier this year, Catherine Dooley and Paul Downes of St. Patrick&rsquo;s College published a useful and easily accessible document, Lifelong <Col N="150"/>learning opportunities in the workplace for traditionally disadvantaged groups in Ireland.  They pointed out that the National Economic and Social Council estimates that 60% of those who will be in the labour force in 2020 are already in employment.  In other words, the same people will continue to comprise the majority of the workforce in ten years&rsquo; time.  They also argued that skills levels need immediate attention.  Under the international standard classification of education, 30% of the workforce has level 2 qualifications or less, with 10% of the workforce having level 1 qualifications or no qualifications at all.  That is the situation we are at.  There is a serious need for the upskilling of low-skilled workers.  The document also reported that more than 100,000 people under the age of 30 in the Irish workforce left the education system without the leaving certificate.  It found that 18% of young people in the Irish education system leave second level before reaching the leaving certificate.  Many of those who leave school early move into low-skilled jobs with very little opportunity for upskilling.  If the economic downturn persists, these people will be more exposed because they entered the job market at a low skill level.</P>
        <P>We must acknowledge that there is a serious funding problem in the current difficult economic situation.  According to an impartial view &mdash; I am not quoting partisan groups like Fine Gael, the Labour Party or Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; &euro;4 billion is required to upgrade building space and to provide facilities for an additional 55,000 students over the next decade.  We have a reasonably good education system but it is under-resourced.  How will it cope with the vast increase in student numbers?  In January of this year, 12,000 mature students applied to the CAO.  That is more than twice the number of mature students who applied in 2003, which was a mere seven years ago.  In the old days, just 60% of such people pursued their initial applications, but that figure has increased to 85%.  The stress is getting greater.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the payment of grants, which is the real nub of the issue.  Various allowances are available to mature students, the main ones being the higher education grant and the back to education allowance.  Prior to the latest budget, anyone who was in receipt of the back to education allowance could also apply for and receive the higher education grant.  This is no longer the case, however, as a result of a budget decision.  I want to address that directly.  I have been contacted by some mature students who do not have any partisan bias.  They would like me to put their experiences on the record.  They made the point I have just made, which is that both the back to education allowance and the student maintenance grant were available to all mature students before the last budget.  The back to education allowance is the equivalent of a person&rsquo;s social welfare payment, such as the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit of &euro;196 a week.  As a result of the budget, mature students starting college in September of this year will no longer be entitled to receive both payments.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In April 2010, the Department of Education and Skills confirmed that people on disability or lone parent payments will be eligible to claim both payments.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, will accept that despite that welcome blip, what I have outlined represents a narrowing of educational accessibility.  The total amount of money available to all third level institutions for these grants is quite small.  If a student wishes to apply for a payment under the student assistance fund, for example, he or she must submit a receipt and fill in an application form.  He or she may then have to wait for up to three months to get some money.  That causes difficulties for people on tight budgets.  As the fund itself is limited, students are not guaranteed this assistance.  The total amount available is &euro;5 million.  That fund can be accessed by all students, not just mature students.  Mature students are now expected to attend third level education while living on their social welfare entitlements alone.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention a couple of cases.  The first case is that of a woman with five children who lives in rural County Galway and has to travel 80 km a day.  She should not be prevented <Col N="151"/>from returning to university simply because she has children.  It would be impossible for her to attend university without financial assistance.  The second case is that of a young man with three children who has to make a round trip of 20 km.  The cost of travel is a factor for both people.  It is difficult for them to access university without financial assistance.  They have to pay for child care.  The woman has to pay someone to mind her five children while she travels 80 km each day.  It is impossible for her to do so within the existing grant structure.  If one gets just &euro;196 a week, how on earth can one feed and clothe one&rsquo;s children, get an education and make a long round trip?</P>
      
        <P>These issues do not just apply to Galway.  A mature student living in Dublin made a request for their statement to be read to the Joint Committee on Education and Science.  I will put it on the record:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">I need to explain the magnitude of the decision that people like me have made in undertaking the Access course last September, and what the change in the budget has done.  We are mentally, emotionally and financially committed to staying through years of limited income in order to achieve a greater goal, in many cases accepting that a place in the workforce is to be suspended until the education is completed.  However, we are motivated by success.  It is [I think I can safely say this is true of all Access students] our commitment and resourcefulness that have got us this far in our lives, operating often on minimal qualifications, but for which this recession proved to be the final wound.  This educational opportunity would position us to excel and shine without the threat of not having a qualification held over us to finally bring to fruition those skills we had developed outside of formal education but which often went unrecognised and unrewarded.  For many of us, it is not feasible to continue without experiencing severe hardship and ultimately, I think, many will fail.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the dispassionate view of a consumer.  The last piece of evidence I would like to give is a letter I discovered in <i>The Irish Times</i> printed on 12 February:</P>
        <P LI="1">Madam</P>
        <P LI="1">I am a mature student in an Access course in NUI Galway.  This course is designed to get people from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background into third-level education.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">When I started this part-time course in September last year, it was on the premise that both the back-to-education allowance and the maintenance grant would be available to me once I started the degree course next September.  Indeed it was the availability of these moneys that made going back to college financially possible.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Halfway through my Access course, last month, it emerged that the Government had made cuts in education which means that when I go on to do my arts degree on 10 September, I will not now receive the maintenance grant.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">If this continues to be the case, I will no longer be able to pursue my goal of returning to full-time education.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">For the Government to expect us mature students, already paying the weekly bills of an independent life, now to incur the added expense of full-time education on top of this, and survive on &euro;196 a week is ludicrous and out of touch with reality.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I am hugely disappointed and feel let down by a Government, which claimed to be committed to education.  I could never again give my vote to any of the current Government involved in these unjustified cuts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I started on an optimistic note, demonstrating from personal experience the talent that lies latent which could be activated in young and mature people.  It is fanciful, however, for us to talk about this wonderfully well educated group when, in fact, we do not support it.</P><Col N="152"/>
        <P>Trinity College, Dublin, now ranks in the top 50 world universities, even though it operates on a fraction of the funding Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard and Yale universities receive, a remarkable achievement.  We cannot blind ourselves to the difficulties encountered in education, yet we engage in this sentimental waffle about having a wonderfully educated workforce when, in fact, we are falling back.  We need to make the investment in education which will relieve the real people whose stories I have related in Seanad &Eacute;ireann tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator Norris on his point on the back-to-education allowance for Access students and how we simply cannot rely on clich&eacute;s.  He is absolutely right.  Education is not about clich&eacute;s but lifelong learning.  There is often confusion between education and schooling when they are not the same.  I recall my young son, when he was one year old, being fascinated by a leaf and learning about it.  Most of what we learn, we learn as young children.  When I was mayor of Galway, I had the honour to preside over a conferring ceremony at the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology.  Towards the end of the ceremony which involved many young people accepting their awards, I noted an 80 year old lady accepting her degree.  As she had not received a degree when she was a young woman, she decided to complete a degree course in her eighties.  The general reaction in the hall to her accepting her degree was fantastic.  Learning is not just about obtaining degrees, it is a lifelong process.  It does not stop at the end of a university term or at a particular point in one&rsquo;s education.</P>
        <P>In a time of recession every Department will find it difficult.  In this very difficult recession I am pleased education has been prioritised as one area of expenditure that will suffer less than others.  Traditionally, it is the people who bring an economy out of a recession.  It is important to ensure they have as much access to education as is possible to allow them to adapt to new circumstances.</P>
        <P>Regarding the back-to-education allowance for Access students, the right to education is contained in the Constitution.  I want mature students to be able to go to college independent of means to the extent that is possible.  The Government has managed to keep third level fees off the agenda.  Unfortunately, there are difficulties for people from underprivileged backgrounds who attend Access courses, on which the Government is working.  As Senator Norris correctly pointed out, the maintenance grant and the back-to-education allowance were previously available to these students.  The latter is only available now.  Those most in need should not be prevented from going to college simply because they cannot afford it.  I hope the Government will sort out this issue before the new school year.</P>
        <P>Today I had the great privilege, with the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to meet several persons with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  It was a fantastic experience.  They were very well educated and lobbying to secure speech therapy services.  Speech therapy is an anomaly in the health and education sectors.  It is a crucial part of the delivery of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act agreed in the programme for Government.  The difficulty, however, is that funding for such services is provided by the Department of Health and Children.  There are enough speech therapists in the country to ensure all children who require such therapy will receive it.  The problem, however, arises with delivery mechanisms which are not available to all children.  We need to look at imaginative delivery mechanisms which I know the Minister for Health and Children is examining.</P>
        <P>I commend the green flag programme run by An Taisce in schools.  People remember their school days, not necessarily for the modh coinn&iacute;olach or the grind of maths but for special events.  I refer to the idea of working towards project-based learning whereby people work towards a green flag.  This is very empowering for younger people and they get a great amount out of it.  I have attended a number of green flag ceremonies and events from which young <Col N="153"/>children take great memories and learn a great amount of necessary skills for the future, including political and environmental knowledge, which they would not otherwise get from the curriculum.  Such programmes are very important and we should consider the introduction of more of them, especially in the area of health.  We have a view of health education in this country which is not as progressive as that of other countries.  Health education is an area where we can attain real gains in respect of the overall health of the nation.</P>
        <P>Other countries have increased their budgets or spend in health education and have seen very real benefits over a period.  Finland is a case in point.  It took a strategic decision to increase the spend on health education and promotion.  This produced real and lasting effects.  That country went from a health system which was not one of the top systems in Europe to the top health system in the world over a relatively short number of years.  There is no reason this country should not aim to be among the best in the world in both health and education.  I do not believe money is a barrier to that end, despite the difficult times we are going through at the moment.  We can achieve lifelong learning by implementing the various policies which are being put forward by virtually all parties in respect of education.  I refer to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and imaginative programmes for people of all ages, including programmes for older people, which are very important.  Community-based education is very important as well.  We must work on several projects which can enhance the overall education of the nation, but not on a cost basis in this difficult time of recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to hear this debate.  This motion commends the Government on its commitment to lifelong learning and upskilling, on implementing policies in support of activation and training, skills development and lifelong learning, and on the significant progress it has made in meeting the objectives set out in the national skills strategy.  This could have been a good debate about upskilling and lifelong learning.  Instead, because of the wording of the motion, it is reduced to a debate on whether the self-congratulation on the other side is justified.  It is not.  We must address the manner in which Private Members&rsquo; business is framed.  This side of the House is equally guilty in terms of proposals put at Private Members&rsquo; time.  Initially, we frame proposals on this side as a criticism of the lack of action and then proceed to make a further proposal.  We should examine what we do in this regard because it frames the debates in an unnecessarily negative way.</P>
        <P>Should we commend the Government on its commitment to lifelong learning?  Senator John Paul Phelan outlined several indicators which suggest it should not be commended and I support his contention, although I will not go over those points again.  I refer to the national skills strategy objectives, which are as follows: some 48% of the workforce should be qualified to National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ, levels 6 to 10, as against 38% if we continue as matters stand; some 45% of the workforce should be qualified to NFQ levels 4 to 5, as against 44% if we continue as matters stand; and 7% of the workforce will remain at NFQ levels 1 to 3 to reduce from 28% at present.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, provided a progress report on national skills strategy objectives on 20 March last.  Although the strategy was announced in 2007, his progress report was measured against 2005, providing a somewhat false impression of progress.  I am aware the baseline figures were based on the position in 2005.  The Minister of State remarked that the percentage of those in the labour force with higher education qualifications had increased from 33% in 2005 to 39% in 2009 compared with the target of 48% by 2020.  When measured against the 2007 position in respect of third level education and above, a 5% shift in two years is not dramatic, but I seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State remarked that the percentage of the labour force with upper secondary level qualifications, including the leaving certificate, remained at 40% between 2005 and 2009, <Col N="154"/>compared with a target of 45% by 2020.  There has been no progress in this category.  In this case, the 2005 figure is the same as the 2007 figure.  There has been no progress in this category in four years.  There is an argument that the rate of shift from this category upwards is greater than the shift from the lower level to this level and that is a factor to be considered.  The percentage in 2007 was 25% and in this category a shift of 4% is not dramatic.  The Minister of State referred to some progress at junior certificate level and below, with the percentage of the labour force at these levels falling from 27% to 21% and referred to there being some way to go to meet the 2020 target of 7%.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether this is code for &ldquo;We are not going to achieve it&rdquo;?  I seek his comments in this regard.  This is the key area that must be addressed and tackled.  What specifically is the Minister of State doing for those in this category, as opposed to a long-term strategy of working with those who are still in the education system?  This is a real challenge, which I do not underestimate, but there is little evidence of progress.  I call on the Minister of State to comment on this matter.</P>
        <P>The quarterly national household survey figures for quarter 4 of 2009 inform us that unemployment levels among people with the lowest level of educational attainment, that is, lower secondary or below, are considerably greater than those among people with higher educational attainment.  The representative figure for the former is 19% as opposed to the total workforce figure of 12.6%.  There are no labour shortages in Ireland at present but there are skills shortages in the areas of information technology, science, sales and marketing, health, accountancy, engineering and management, which are all specialised high skill areas.  Traditional manufacturing is almost gone from Ireland and is unlikely to return.  Construction levels are seriously reduced at present and are unlikely to return to anything like the heights of recent years.  Services and knowledge-based occupations are for the future and they require higher skill levels.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the situation more positively.  There are opportunities for people with lower level skills and these are referred to in the skills strategy.  What is referred to as generic skills in the strategy are considered to be almost as important as technical or on-the-job skills for the future workplace.  These include basic or fundamental skills such as numeracy, literacy and use of technology; people skills such as team working, communications and customer service; and conceptual, thinking or problem solving skills.  Having worked in manufacturing all my working life until three years ago, I am aware such skills can be acquired through training and development initiatives.  The focus of attention must shift from education attainment mix to a greater focus on upskilling of the current workforce for the new work era while recognising the need for formal recognition of skills attained.  It goes without saying that we must improve the education levels of people entering the workforce.  Early school leaving is a problem that must be addressed, as must the literacy and numeracy levels of those leaving school, to which other Senators referred.</P>
        <P>It is obvious we need to prevent people from dropping out before completing second level education.  We are aware that if pupils stay on in school, they will achieve more.  The evidence clearly shows that young people without a leaving certificate are at a disadvantage in the jobs market and face an increased risk of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.  We are aware also that 9,000 students leave secondary school every year without a leaving certificate qualification.</P>
        <P>I refer to the heartless targeting of access programme students by the Government in the last budget, a matter referred to by Senators on both sides of the House.  We heard evidence at the Joint Committee on Education and Science last week that highlighted the need for the Government to provide more support to this group, not to diminish it.  Student access funding is in place for those who do not have the conventional educational requirements to get into <Col N="155"/>third level or who come from socioeconomic backgrounds which are under-represented in higher education.  Between 800 and 1,000 access students enter third level every year, which is good progress, but not nearly good enough.  By definition, students receiving support include those from a socio-economically disadvantaged background, perhaps the first in the family to access third level education, or a person in a targeted group, namely, the long-term unemployed, people with a disability, minority groups and Travellers.  Despite the obvious need for support, the Government brought down the axe on many Access students in the 2010 budget.</P>
        <P>Jobseekers are no longer entitled to receive the back to education allowance and the student maintenance grant.  This has had a hugely negative impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  Instead of assisting students who are trying against the odds to get an education, the Government has acted in a most destructive manner.  Surely it should not be congratulated for this.  Is it the case that the back to education allowance is not available to persons pursuing postgraduate courses?  If not, why not?  Given the need for people to move out of work areas which are not in demand and into those areas that are, perhaps the Government should reconsider its policy.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister happy that scarce resources being used to provide much needed training for unemployed people are being used effectively?  It has been brought to my attention that on a recent course on AutoCAD &mdash; I cannot confirm whether it was run by or for F&Aacute;S &mdash; 60% of the trainees were foreign nationals who had been in the country for less than four months.  How could that be?  We cannot afford to waste resources in this way, if that is happening to any great extent.  Many complain to me that they cannot get a place on a F&Aacute;S course; therefore, if waste is a problem, it must be addressed.  What controls are in place to ensure we are getting what we pay for?  The Minister should have a review carried out of this important issue.</P>
        <P>Overall, some progress has been made in this area but hardly enough for the self-congratulation in the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity once again to address the Seanad on the key issue of lifelong learning.  I thank the Senators who have contributed so far for the informed nature of the debate and look forward to the contributions of the Senators who are due to speak.  As Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, I know there is growing awareness that education is a lifelong process and that learning should occur at all stages of life, from preschool to post-retirement.  Nowadays we must continually develop our skills and further our knowledge to keep pace in a fast-changing world.</P>
        <P>As a small open economy in an increasingly globalised world, this has never been more true.  We are totally committed to the provision of lifelong learning opportunities, despite the significant economic challenges we face.  The Government is fully aware of the need for people to continually upskill with the necessary skills for the jobs of tomorrow.  This commitment is manifested in the creation of the labour market activation fund, worth &euro;20 million.  The fund is intended to support the provision of training and education programmes for the unemployed, prioritising the low skilled and those formerly employed in declining sectors such as construction, retail and manufacturing, with particular emphasis on the under 35s and the long-term unemployed.  Following an open tender competition in which 370 tenders were received, the T&aacute;naiste announced yesterday the award of contracts to 26 organisations across the private, not-for-profit and public sectors to support 6,500 additional training and education places in programmes for priority groups of the unemployed.  These programmes will come on stream from this month, a very welcome development.</P>
        <P>In terms of additional measures, during the years the Government has expanded opportunities in further education which plays a key role by providing access, transfer and progression opportunities for the lower skilled, the disadvantaged and the hard-to-reach, including <Col N="156"/>the unemployed.  Expenditure in this area increased by 60% from &euro;256 million in 2002 to &euro;426 million in 2010, as Senator Ormonde mentioned.  Part-time learning opportunities for the low-skilled, the disadvantaged and the unemployed are available all year round through the back to education initiative, adult literacy and community education programmes.  Together, these programmes are catering for an estimated 125,000 learners in 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition, full-time further education opportunities are being provided throughout 2010 for over 40,000 learners, including the unemployed, mainly at levels 3 to 6 on the national framework of qualifications, under the Youthreach, senior Traveller training centre, vocational training opportunities scheme and post-leaving certificate, PLC, programmes.  The expansion of opportunities continued in 2009, with an additional 1,500 PLC places for the 2009-10 academic year, bringing the total number of places available nationwide to nearly 31,700.  The increase in demand for education opportunities can clearly be seen in the significant increase in the number of back to education allowance recipients, up to over 18,000, many of whom are participating in further and higher education programmes.</P>
        <P>The higher education sector has a key role to play in helping people who have lost their jobs to develop their workforce skills.  Increasing numbers are choosing to enter higher education, a welcome trend at a time of reduced opportunity for direct school leaver entry to the labour market and increasing demand for reskilling and upskilling among the broader adult population.  The number of Central Applications Office, CAO, applications received by 1 February this year for places in the 2010-11 academic year is up approximately 6% on the same time in 2009.  This increase is broadly in line with expectations and the increase seen the previous year.  Higher education institutions have been responding to the increase in demand by increasing the number of places they offer.  In this regard, CAO acceptances in 2009-10 were 45,582, up 8.3% on the figure for the previous year, 2008-09, which, in turn, had seen an increase of 5.4% on the figure for 2007-08.  At a time of considerable pressure on budgets and staffing resources, this demonstrates a significant willingness on the part of higher education providers to respond to increasing demand.</P>
        <P>During 2009 a number of new initiatives were taken by the higher education sector to support unemployed persons return to education and engage in upskilling.  Over 900 unemployed persons participated in short courses in the institutes of technology, while 160 students undertook accelerated level 6 programmes.  In addition, from September 2009 almost 1,800 unemployed persons were supported to embark on part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses in areas that support the goals of the Government&rsquo;s smart economy document.  Similarly, in the training sector there have been substantial increases in the resources aimed at tackling unemployment.  The F&Aacute;S employment services, together with the local employment services, have doubled their capacity to cater for the rise in referrals from the Department of Social Protection.  This increased the annual referral capacity to 147,000 persons in 2009.  Furthermore, my Department will fund the provision of approximately 157,000 training and work experience places this year for the unemployed.  This compares to the 66,000 places delivered in 2008 and the 130,000 delivered last year.</P>
        <P>There are additional training places on short courses available to the unemployed.  In 2009 F&Aacute;S delivered approximately 92,000 short course training places to the unemployed.  This is a quadrupling of the number of similar courses provided in 2008 and reflects the Government&rsquo;s efforts in increasing relevant supports for the unemployed.  Short training courses are designed to respond to individual training needs in the development of new skills and competencies.  Courses are delivered in a variety of ways in order to be as flexible as possible.  This has enabled more people to access them.  To try to address the significant contraction of activity in the construction sector and its impact on apprenticeships, F&Aacute;S has restructured the apprenticeship <Col N="157"/>system to allow redundant apprentices to progress to the next off-the-job training phase in the education sector.</P>
        <P>Coupled with all of these initiatives, the Department of Social Protection works with social welfare recipients through a network of facilitators to identify appropriate training or development programmes.  These will enhance the skills the individual has and ultimately improve his or her employment chances, as well as help him or her to continue to develop personally.  The facilitators work in close co-operation with other agencies and service providers, including F&Aacute;S, VECs, other education and training providers and the local and community and voluntary sector.  They also provide advice and support to clients who wish to access the back to education and back to work schemes of the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>The Government has sought to provide additional education and training opportunities with the support of the European globalisation adjustment fund, co-funded by the EU.  Details of that scheme have been circulated to Members.</P>
        <P>The training and upskilling of the country&rsquo;s workforce is a vital element of this country&rsquo;s recovery from the current downturn, both in the context of encouraging the emergence of indigenous enterprises as well as attracting inward investment into Ireland.  My Department is therefore focused on ensuring the delivery of high quality activation services to its priority cohorts, including those with low skills or education levels, those who have been on the live register for an extended period and those who were previously employed in sectors that have been most affected by restructuring and where recovery to near previous levels is not a realistic prospect in the short to medium term.</P>
        <P>Members will be aware that, in 2007, the Government published the national skills strategy, based on a detailed analysis by the expert group on future skills needs.  A number of Senators have referred to that.  While the economic situation has changed significantly since the publication of the strategy, the goals and objectives remain valid.  The current economic and labour market difficulties in Ireland mean that the implementation of the strategy is even more important, not just for the economy as a whole but especially for the many individuals who are experiencing unemployment and who require new skills to get back into employment.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made towards the achievement of the strategy targets.  The percentage of those in the labour force with higher education qualifications has increased from 33% in 2005 to 39% in 2009, as was mentioned during the course of the debate.  The percentage of the population aged 20 to 24 with at least upper secondary level education increased from 86% in 2005 to 88% by 2008 and retention at leaving certificate of those who entered school in 2001 has also risen from just over 81% to almost 85%.  The percentage of those in the labour force with less than a junior certificate has fallen from 27% in 2005 to 21% in 2009.  In this context, progress is clear in relation to third level but a priority is upskilling the low skilled, bringing those with skills equivalent to levels 1 to 3 on the national framework of qualifications up to levels 4 and 5.  We are committed to achieving our targets.  We have a long-term strategy continuing until 2020.  We will endeavour to reach those targets and we have no reason to fear we will not do so.</P>
        <P>The bringing together of responsibility for education and skills training under one Department, the Department of Education and Skills, will enhance our ability to deliver a more cohesive response for individuals, potential employers and local communities.  The alignment of skills training and F&Aacute;S with the further education and training activities of the VECs and the institutes of technology provides an opportunity for the elimination of duplication and the streamlining and strengthening of provision to deliver the best possible outcomes for learners.  There has been further co-operation between F&Aacute;S and the VECs, especially having regard <Col N="158"/>to the F&Aacute;S-Irish Vocational Education Association national co-operation agreement, and I welcome that.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to have had this opportunity to highlight the numerous initiatives and opportunities for those who want to engage in lifelong learning.  Currently the focus is on upskilling due to the level of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  We must continue to invest in the skills of our workforce to enhance employment skills.  We must ensure we have the necessary blend of skills required to succeed as a knowledge-based economy.  Ireland is competing in an ever-increasing global competitive marketplace where the key to success is establishing competitive advantage.  We must constantly review our education and training provision to ensure we are meeting the needs of industry and the economy.  We must encourage greater participation in lifelong learning by facilitating and motivating people of all ages to increase their skill levels and qualifications, to acquire new skills and knowledge in different areas and to renew existing skills to stay abreast of technology and other developments.  Lifelong learning is also important for personal development and social cohesion which are imperative if we are to continue to develop a fair and just society in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The challenges presented by the global financial crisis require a concerted and coherent response.  Therefore, we must work together, domestically and internationally, locally and regionally, as partners and joint stakeholders in our country&rsquo;s future.  We must consolidate our investment to ensure long-term sustainability and build a flexible and robust education and training system that promotes social inclusion as well as upskilling and re-skilling.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to promote lifelong learning and support initiatives in this regard.  Much progress has been made in this area and I am committed to building further on our achievements to date.  In this way we will improve not only the lives of learners but the lives of their families and community and our economy.</P>
        <P>I regret we do not have more time to develop some of the issues raised during the course of the debate.  I have no doubt we will revert to them at a later stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the information he has provided to Senators.  The picture does not seem as rosy as he has outlined.  Lifelong learning, upskilling and retraining are now more important than ever in our society and in the lives of many who are unemployed, isolated and abandoned and who do not have the access to re-skilling and education they deserve.</P>
        <P>My colleagues have dealt with the issues of literacy, numeracy and basic educational needs.  They have also referred to the formal and informal roles of the agencies in attaining the basic standard of education that gives people a reasonable and fair chance in life.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to early school leavers and the young unemployed.  Thousands of young people feel they have no option but to leave the country.  Many of them have a good education, vocational training and apprenticeships but they cannot find work where they can use the resources they have acquired over many years.  It is important that all State agencies look at new ways to find employment for those young people.</P>
        <P>We need to think outside the box.  Thousands of young apprentices are skilled in the building trade but will not find work in the construction of new build.  Under master craftsmen, they could be employed in areas such as conservation and community projects renovating or conserving schools, community halls or other buildings of importance to communities.  Surely we can look at ways of getting those apprentices off the dole queues, employing master craftsmen to oversee the work they do and putting practical schemes in place to deliver productivity for the community and develop new or alternative skills in the young apprentices.  That is how we <Col N="159"/>need to think and how State agencies need to restructure themselves to create employment for young people.</P>
        <P>In a recession there is a bigger demand than ever for our State agencies and for those who train and educate.  We need to remove any barriers to people achieving new skills.  We must encourage initiative, enterprise and lifelong learning.  All these areas must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the role of VECs and F&Aacute;S.  They have done a good job over many years, but we are in a different time now.  Old ways will not meet the demands of modern society and of the recession.  We need to restructure and rethink how we can find employment for our people.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the European globalisation adjustment fund.  I come from Waterford which has been heavily dependent on manufacturing.  We have taken huge hits over recent years with significant companies such as Waterford Crystal, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and ABB engaging in large-scale redundancies.  The Minister of State mentioned that a large number of applications are before the European Parliament and while I understand the Waterford Crystal and SR Technics applications are near approval, I regret that the response of the Government to the application was poor.</P>
        <P>I owe an apology to F&Aacute;S.  I organised a public meeting in Waterford to which I invited all State agencies and redundant workers from Waterford Crystal to enlighten them about the application and to make it more transparent.  European Commission officials visited Waterford to explain how the scheme would work and how they would benefit.  Unfortunately, I omitted to invite F&Aacute;S and I criticised the agency afterwards for not attending.  Although the meeting was publicly advertised and F&Aacute;S officials did not turn up, I apologise to them.  The scheme is not being co-ordinated properly and information is not being communicated to redundant workers who are in need and who, at a critical time in their lives, find themselves unemployed.  They are seeking guidance and leadership which they are not getting from the Government.</P>
        <P>Initially, F&Aacute;S was the co-ordinating agency for the Dell application and it was understood it would fill the same role for the Waterford Crystal workers but, unfortunately, the Government has advertised for an independent co-ordinating agency which has only added to the confusion.  The clock is ticking and the workers are appealing for assistance, communication, consultation and tailor-made courses as opposed to standard forklift and computer courses.  Courses that take advantage of new opportunities in the areas of green technology, renewables and entrepreneurship are needed.  Workers need to be enabled to access such courses but there is no engagement on the ground.  I appeal to the Minister of State to address this concern.</P>
        <P>There is a 24-month window to access the European globalisation adjustment fund which will provide &euro;500 million in total.  Funding has almost been secured for Waterford and it is important it is used in the best and most efficient manner to assist workers and the agencies engaged in rolling out courses and to ensure the agencies are fully <i>au fait</i> with their responsibilities and obligations in this regard.  I suspect they are not currently.  I invited representatives of many of those agencies to the public meeting and they were not aware of their responsibilities nor had they been notified officially by the Department of their obligations under the scheme.  This needs attention.</P>
        <P>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. will make 315 workers redundant later this year in Waterford.  Unfortunately, applications to access the European fund must relate to a minimum of 500 workers but there is nothing to prevent the Government combining these workers with those who have lost jobs in the industry at, for example, Pfizer or in similar industries and submitting a combined application on their behalf.  We still have not heard from the Government about whether it intends to make an application to the fund on behalf of the Teva Pharmaceutical and ABB workers, which is neglectful.  The Government must focus on the needs of all redundant workers and not only those formerly employed by large companies.  The <Col N="160"/>job losses of smaller companies need to be combined to access as much assistance as possible for the workers affected.</P>
        <P>The construction industry also needs to be examined because thousands of workers have been made redundant in that sector.  Many of them were self-employed tradesmen and, because of this, they have been more or less left to their own devices.  It is important they receive assistance from the State.  They need to find new ways to create jobs and to return to the workforce, whether that is through entrepreneurship with the assistance of county and city enterprise boards or agencies such as the VEC and F&Aacute;S.  The bar needs to be raised and we need to find the ways to get people back to work or to participate in lifelong learning initiatives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious a number of other Senators would like to contribute and, therefore, I will be brief.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The figures he outlined are impressive but more needs to be done and cutbacks will have to be reversed in the fullness of time.  The day will never come in Ireland when we will be able to say we spend enough on lifelong learning or education.  In the current economic climate, we do not have the money to spend on all the education schemes we have set up.  The Youthreach programme in Killarney, County Kerry, is playing a vital role in ensuring those who normally would fall through the cracks in the system are helped to attain the necessary skills to fulfil their potential.  Lifelong learning is about giving people the opportunity to fulfil their potential.</P>
        <P>Colleagues on all sides of the House fought valiantly to ensure community employment, CE, schemes were retained when it was proposed that they be scrapped.  They have played a vital role in cities, towns and villages, including Kenmare, in ensuring work is done that would not necessarily be done.</P>
        <P>The Government proposes to introduce a new subject to the school curriculum entitled politics in society which will educate students about how they should contribute to their society.  It is startling to think that children go through the primary and secondary school  without being educated about how to be citizens.  They are taught French, history, mathematics, biology, English and Irish but they are not taught how to be citizens, how to volunteer, why they should vote and why they should participate fully in their community.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey raised a number of issues relating to unemployed tradesmen.  A proposal is due to come to Government and the Minister for Social Protection will take it up.  Under the proposal he will utilise those on the dole queues to renovate buildings and construct new buildings for community purposes.   This will not only create employment and provide new community facilities but also enhance the self-esteem of those involved.  Unemployment is terrible not only from a financial point of view but also from a personal point of view.</P>
        <P>Access to university courses is important.  People want to attain degrees and diplomas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Mullen.  I welcome the Minister of State and I am delighted he is present because this issue is a challenge.  I have spent the past three Mondays at different Retail Excellence Ireland training sessions in Dublin, Limerick and Cork, which were fascinating.  A total of 60 people attended each session.  They had been employed in other professions and they replied to an advertisement offering a free opportunity to learn about retailing.  Some were architects, engineers, students and unemployed but they wanted to get into the retail industry because they said there is a hunger out there to learn.  The Minister of State can ensure the enthusiasm for learning is embraced.  It is encouraging that the education qualifications of our labour force have increased dramatically in recent years.  A total of 186,300 more people had a third level qualification last year than in 2005.  Now about 20% of the Irish workforce have higher educational qualifications.  The figures also <Col N="161"/>show that the percentage of secondary students staying on to leaving certificate has risen to 84%, the highest level ever.</P>
        <P>One of the areas that excited me was the involvement I had in the leaving certificate applied.  I know that Senator Jerry Buttimer shares the same enthusiasm I have for this.  The leaving certificate applied identifies talents, skills and intelligence other than those that are measured by the traditional leaving certificate.  People who failed the leaving certificate, perhaps because they were not good at reading and writing, could be brilliant at oration, speaking and listening.  Such students were never identified, apart from some minor exceptions in the traditional leaving certificate system.  I have known that many people who have had that opportunity have blossomed and grown, so let us not tie ourselves down with the old traditional skills and academic qualifications formula when there are so many other opportunities to be explored.</P>
        <P>I spoke recently at one of the DIT campuses.  It was very interesting, and Senator Brendan Ryan made the point about a very large number of those attending these courses not being Irish-born.  I was told one of the challenges facing this particular course was that the Irish attendees, because they were getting it free of charge, did not seem to value it that much and the drop-out rate from this cohort was very high, whereas the non-Irish valued it to such an extent that they stayed.  It seems to me that one of the difficulties we must address is to do with the student who opts out of college having formerly been enthusiastic about the course he or she was taking.  In my company over the years we asked people to pay for attending a course.  They did not have to qualify but if they completed a course, they would get a refund.  There are areas such as that about which we could do something.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the update on the national skills strategy shows that an educational divide is opening up with slower progress being made in upskilling early school leavers and those on the live register for a year or longer.  We must also address the problem of those previously working in areas where jobs have been lost, such as construction, manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing.  The Minister of State has touched on this but I would remind him that much more could be done in that area.  There is an ambition to learn and succeed if we can only find a way to ensure those who are in danger of being left behind get to grab their opportunities to learn and develop themselves to get work.</P>
        <P>I always laugh at this debate on a Wednesday night where the Government says &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann commends the Government&rdquo; and the Opposition automatically says &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann condemns the Government&rdquo; and substitutes everything else in the motion.  Let us work together on this one at some point or other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is greatly respected for his commitment to and championing of adult education, and I welcome him to the House.  I fear, however, that his efforts have not always been as successful here as the porters would wish.  Henry Ford once said that anyone who stops learning is old, whether at 20 or 80.. It was true when he said it and it is even more true now.  The nature of work in a modern society demands that all of us continually learn new skills if we are to survive and thrive in a rapidly changing economy.  I am often asked to give talks to transition year students and also leaving certificate candidates preparing to fill out their CAO forms.  One of the points I make to them is that society has changed rapidly.  Once upon a time people embarked on a particular career and many stayed on the same track throughout life.  Now, as Patrick Kavanagh would say, it is a matter of testing and tasting.  People who leave school and embark on third level education have a choice, but they must be ready to twist and turn in the world ahead, to upgrade their qualifications, perhaps change direction, avail of opportunities and respond to changes in the job market.  It is very important that the education system prepares people for that future reality because it is crucial that people are able to discern at the earliest stage possible the talents they have been given, <Col N="162"/>what natural aptitude they have and how they may best strive for an occupation that will bring satisfaction and help them to serve their families and communities as well as their own aptitude.</P>
        <P>Very few people now, on leaving college and entering the workforce, will stay in the same line of work for the duration of their working careers.  The era of the safe pensionable job for life is now a thing of the past.  We therefore need an education system that is open to participants at any time in their career and which is capable of delivering education when and where needed to suit the student, not the educator.   We do not have such a system, however, and this is a particular problem in rural Ireland where 42% of the national population resides.  Rural areas account for a mere 28% of total employment opportunities and the virtual annihilation of the construction sector has been a key driver of unemployment there.  The simple fact is that many young people left education during the boom to earn good money in the construction sector and now find themselves without a job, skills or educational qualifications.  We need a targeted approach to help these people and a speedy response from Government.</P>
        <P>In 2009 adult education accounted for just 4.3% of the overall education budget.  This amounts to 0.22% of GDP and 0.27% of GNP.  Spending has increased only marginally since 2000 and does not take the current demand into account.  This is putting providers under extreme pressure, while for learners the demand for adult education means increased competition for places.  We need to put in place a properly funded and structured approach for dealing with this challenge.  In the absence of a national co-ordinating body a lightweight structured forum should be created with the aim of facilitating partnership, collaboration and sharing best practice while informing policy development on an ongoing basis.  Such a forum could comprise the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Irish Vocational Education Association and Aontas, the national adult literacy agency, at the outset with inputs from other stakeholders as appropriate.  This would ensure funding earmarked for activation measures would benefit participants while stimulating economic recovery.</P>
        <P>As a final comment on what Senator Quinn had to say about attitudes, it is very important, I believe, as someone teaching in third level, that we do as much as possible to guarantee quality education and also to ensure retention.  People vary in their attitudes to what they are getting.  That is true.  There is a phrase in Irish, &ldquo;An rud a fhaightear go bog, caitear go bog &eacute;&rdquo;, and I often wonder whether things have been too easy in the past.  We need to get people to value the education experience they are going through as well, and that concern is all the more pressing given the international competition we face and the concerns that have been expressed about the quality of our graduate qualifications.  We need to motivate people in all sectors, including the student population, to make the most of the education opportunity so that we may best serve ourselves and our community in the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  It has never been more important that a Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning is active in his brief and that he has the ear of his senior Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, as well as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  It is important we put things in context.  The unemployment figures today underlined the gravity that faces the country as a small open economy, to paraphrase the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  We need more than just words of commitment to lifelong learning, retraining and upskilling.  This debate is timely and Senator Coffey referred to Waterford.  I take the case of Cork and look at the area around Carrigaline, which is one of the highest unemployment blackspots in the country for those under 25.</P><Col N="163"/>
        <P>I heard Senator Ormond earlier, an educationalist, and I agree with her.  We need to change the leaving certificate and remodel the whole emphasis in education.  We need to wipe the slate clean and start again, meet the teachers&rsquo; unions, parents, teachers on the ground and the Department and start afresh.  Senator Quinn is correct.  The leaving certificate applied was one of the most innovative and exciting collaborative initiatives in education.  I taught it for years.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We gave students who were struggling a new opportunity in education and they blossomed.  They flourished.  They went from troublesome, shy and retiring kids to confident entrepreneurs.  Some of them would buy and sell one now.  What did the Government do?  It cut the grants to the leaving certificate applied and reduced its funding.  It poured cold water on it.  The leaving certificate applied gave hope and life to students.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly mentioned an ESRI report from some time ago which stated that 18% of students &mdash; almost one in five &mdash; leave school with no qualification.  That is a damning indictment of all involved in education.</P>
        <P>The A student will always get by because he or she has the motivation, the ability and the drive to get to the final destination, but the student in the middle or at the bottom does not have that drive.  We need to invest in education.  It must be pupil centred and person oriented.  It is not about statistics or figures; it is about people.  Education is about giving people opportunity.  It is about creating hope and rewarding people.</P>
        <P>The example of the construction industry highlights all that is wrong with our approach to lifelong learning, education and skills.  We can have all the reports we want, but we must consider the number of people who left school, went into construction and are now on the unemployment line with no hope and no opportunity.  I made the point on a previous occasion that while I fully subscribe to the aims of the national skills strategy and Towards 2016, the white elephant that is F&Aacute;S must be changed.  It must be rebranded, renamed and given new ideas and opportunities.  It must be brought out into the community.  Community employment schemes must be enhanced and more people should be given employment within the community.  We must rebuild and create sustainable communities.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned my serious concern about the fact that there is no Government jobs strategy.  What we have head today underlines this.  Where is the blueprint for graduate internship programmes as proposed by Deputy Varadkar?  There is no response from the Government.  What about second-chance education?  I am a former director of adult education with the national association of community education directors.  We have thousands attending courses every night in the community, voluntary and secondary sector.  We created FETAC to ensure uniformity in the awarding of diplomas and certificates, but there is too much bureaucracy.  We must allow people to participate in second-chance education and increase their skills.</P>
        <P>Most nights when I am out canvassing I meet people who have lost their jobs and wish to return to education.  They want to have the hope of a career and are prepared to change their lives.  The Government, and our education system, must change with them.  The VECs and all back-to-education initiatives must embrace people.  Education must be people-centred.  The resource is the person.  We have a tremendous workforce whose members really want to work.  We forgot for so long that we had people who wanted to work.  We allowed immigrant workers to come in, thinking they would return to their countries, but in many cases they have not done so, nor do we want them to because they work very hard.</P>
        <P>There is a challenge for all of us, politically and individually, to recreate education.  If the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills does nothing else, let her invest in the leaving certificate applied, talk to the unions and teachers and create a new leaving certificate and junior certificate system.  Our educated workforce and students must be fit to work.  We do not <Col N="164"/>need the chairman of Intel or others to tell us we have an issue with our education system.  It needs leadership and I hope we will get it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a wide-ranging debate and it is quite evident that it has been informed by the experience and exposure of the contributors to the education system.  This reflects the make-up of the Seanad, as we have often remarked on.  It is inevitable that success will be measured against potential for the future, and education is no different.  It is not something that stands still.  We must always look to the future and reflect what is happening in any era.</P>
        <P>The contributions throughout the debate kept returning to the issue of jobs.  This is because of the economic difficulties we face.  It is only right we should consider closely how our education system, as it now stands, suits the current needs of the country.  We deal with issues organically here.  The system is always moving, but it has served us well up to now.  That was the point I made in my contribution and it was also made by a number of other speakers.  Irrespective of the motion and the amendment, one message was coming across.  We all want to see changes where necessary, and those changes will have to take into account the challenges we face at present.</P>
        <P>It is worth remembering that the structure we have had for the past 20 or 30 years has served us exceptionally well.  Those Senators who have served as teachers would agree that we have produced many fine leaders.  Senator Buttimer made the very same point I made in my contribution.  If we consider the entrepreneurs who have come out of the education system in the past, we can see without doubt that the system was suited to those people at that time.</P>
        <P>We should not necessarily have a constant focus on multinationals or major industries when it comes to employment.  We must consider community employment and positions that help the individual, whether it is metalworking, basket making, crochet or delivering apple tarts to local shops.  All such modes of employment have been important in the past and they do not suffer from the same winds of change as bigger industries.  That is not to say that the whole economy can be built on such jobs.  If we are looking for ways to help, however, that is one way.</P>
        <P>We were all proud to see the editorial in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> a couple of days ago which commended Ireland strongly and pointed to it as an example of a country which was capable of taking necessary measures.  Bearing in mind the number of American companies in Ireland, we must remember that <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> will be read by all captains of industry in that country.  This glowing commendation of Ireland was made possible by our education system.  I have moved from cottage industries to multinationals.</P>
        <P>There are two aspects to education, one of which is the development of one&rsquo;s character and personality.  I am fully committed to the idea of a rounded education in that context.  The second aspect is preparation for obtaining a job at the end of one&rsquo;s education.  Both of these must be considered.  We must consider the education system closely to determine whether our qualifications and courses are designed in this way at present.</P>
        <P>This debate has been worthwhile.  Obviously the cut and thrust of politics will require a vote.  That is all right.  We will all go into our own lobbies.  I have no doubt, however, that we have all focused on what is important.  Senator Feargal Quinn put it well, although I noticed that the two words &ldquo;commend&rdquo; and &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; sound very alike.  In fact, they have many of the same letters.  However, when the voting is over, I do not doubt that between those two words, there have been contributions from both sides of the House today of which cognisance should be taken.  The Members who made those contributions have the experience and exposure that can make a major contribution to any reassessment of the education system for the future.</P>

	<P>Yesterday evening I opened a debate in the other House in the immediate aftermath of the events off Gaza.  I am glad also to be able to participate in the Seanad&rsquo;s consideration of this important issue which has generated a great deal of public interest and concern both here and elsewhere.  This debate also gives me the chance to update the Oireachtas on the information I have to hand.</P>
        <P>The Government shares the widespread shock and horror at the outcome of the Israeli military storming of the Free Gaza movement flotilla early on Monday which has resulted in the deaths of a reported nine people and the injury of many more.  I share the sense of outrage that what was intended as a humanitarian act and a response to unacceptable policies on the part of Israel should have ended up this way.  I express our condolences to the families of those who have been killed and our best wishes to all those who have been injured.</P><Col N="166"/>
        <P Just="Left">In the early hours of Monday morning Israeli naval vessels intercepted the Free Gaza flotilla in international waters between Cyprus and Israel, informed the six vessels in the convoy that they would not be allowed to proceed further towards Gaza and ordered them to proceed to the Israeli port of Ashdod.  The exact details of what followed have yet to emerge, not least because the accounts of those on the boats are only beginning to be heard now as they begin to arrive home.  Following the boarding by Israeli commandos of the largest vessel, the Turkish <i>MV Mavi Marmara</i>, firing by the commandos resulted in nine persons on board the boat being killed and a larger number being wounded.  Exact numbers are as yet uncertain, but the number of dead appears to be nine.  All of the dead identified so far were Turkish.  The vessels arrived in Ashdod on Monday afternoon and the injured were taken to various Israeli hospitals.  I again condemn the physical force methods used by the Israeli military in dealing with this situation which cannot be justified.</P>
        <P>The Seanad will wish to be updated on the position on Irish citizens, our first concern in the immediate circumstances.  The vessel owned by the Irish Free Gaza movement, the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, which sailed from Dundalk in mid-May and on which a number of Irish citizens were embarked, had not yet reached the eastern Mediterranean and was not part of the flotilla.  The <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> is still at sea and understood to be continuing towards Gaza with five Irish citizens aboard.</P>
        <P>Four Irish citizens were known to be on <i>Challenger 1</i> which was intercepted and taken into Ashdod.  Three Irish citizens were aboard other vessels and one further citizen, a dual national, had joined the flotilla among the large Turkish contingent.  Of these, two were taken directly to Ben Gurion International Airport, having apparently agreed to immediate deportation, where they were visited yesterday morning by Ambassador O&rsquo;Reilly who then informed their families.  Both men have now been deported, and one, Mr. Shane Dillon, arrived back in Dublin last night.  The dual national citizen was deported, at his request, to Lebanon.</P>
        <P>I met earlier today with Mr. Dillon, following his return to Dublin late last evening.  He provided in a calm manner a disturbing account of what he witnessed on board the <i>MV Challenger I</i> and also of the initial assault on the <i>MV Mavi Marmara</i>, the Turkish cruise ship on which were most of the flotilla participants.  It was clear from what he described that the level of the force used by the Israeli forces in mounting the assault was totally excessive, with widespread and unacceptable use of such weapons as stun grenades, tasers and high velocity paint-ball guns on board the <i>MV Challenger I</i>.</P>
        <P>It is extremely important in the coming days that we hear the testimony of those directly involved in the Gaza flotilla in order to build up a more accurate picture of what actually happened.  Those accounts now beginning to emerge, including that from Mr. Dillon, are, to say the least, not very edifying.  It remains imperative that there should be a full and proper international and independent investigation into last Monday&rsquo;s events which can command wide international consensus.</P>
        <P>The other five citizens arrested on Monday were taken to a detention centre in Beersheva, as part of some 600 or more persons detained on the ships.  An officer from the embassy visited them there, and promptly informed their families.</P>
        <P>It appeared yesterday that some days would pass in arranging the formalities for the deportation of these persons, and there were even reports that some of them may be subject to charges for illegal entry or obstruction.  I clearly demanded, in public statements, directly to the Israeli ambassador and through our embassy in Tel Aviv, the immediate and unconditional release of our citizens.  Late last night, the Israeli Government took the sensible decision, which <Col N="167"/>I welcomed, to arrange for the immediate deportation of all the detainees without further ado.  Arrangements for this were being carried out before I came to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The Turkish Government has sent charter and military aircraft to convey the detainees as a group to Istanbul, and they should reach there later tonight.  The embassy in Tel Aviv is seeking to confirm that all of the Irish citizens are being deported.  An officer from the embassy in Ankara is travelling to Istanbul to assist them there.</P>
        <P>I should also clarify that an early report on one Israeli television channel that the injured included one Irish person does not seem to have been borne out.</P>
        <P>On receipt of the emerging news of the tragic events on Monday morning, I made a statement condemning what happened and I summoned the Israeli ambassador to a meeting at my Department that evening.  When I met the ambassador I conveyed a number of important points to him, which he has conveyed to his Government.  First, I conveyed the Government&rsquo;s condemnation of the use of military force in this fashion against the flotilla, which was unacceptable and which had led to this tragedy.  It will be some time before we have a clearer picture of what happened.  I made the strong point to the ambassador &mdash; similar to what I said at the time of the assault on Gaza in January 2009 &mdash; that when you use excessive military force among civilians you cannot expect to control all the outcomes, and you must accept responsibility for the results of your actions.  Who now could possibly argue that preventing this cargo from reaching Gaza was so important that an outcome such as this could be thought to be reasonable force?</P>
        <P>I further made clear, as I said, that all of the Irish citizens involved should be immediately and unconditionally released.  At that time, I was also angry that full consular access was not being allowed to our embassy, as provided for under the Vienna Convention, and I demanded such access immediately for those citizens in detention.  That was largely secured, although there are still issues around that.</P>
        <P>I made clear to the ambassador my strong view that these citizens were constrained to enter Israel, which was not their intention, and therefore questions of illegal entry should not arise.  Irish citizens were effectively seized by the Israeli forces and forcefully brought into Israel against their will.  With the mass deportation operation now under way, it appears that this issue may now also be resolved.</P>
        <P>I took issue with the description by the Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel of the flotilla as &ldquo;an armada of hate and violence&rdquo;.  We know the Irish activists involved to be sincere committed people, with deep humanitarian convictions and concerns, who were committed to breaking the blockade of Gaza but in a peaceful, non-violent way.  Some Members of the Oireachtas had been with them and intended to join the flotilla.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware from my earlier remarks that uppermost in my thoughts now is the progress of the ship that sailed from Ireland, the <i>MV Rachel Corrie, </i>on which a number of Irish citizens are continuing towards Gaza.  It is thought that she might be approaching Gazan waters as we get to the weekend.  I spoke yesterday with the former UN senior official, Mr. Denis Halliday, who is one of the Irish citizens aboard the <i>MV Rachel Corrie </i>and earlier today with Mr. Derek Graham, the Mayo-born skipper of the ship.  They made clear to me that they are pacifists, they do not want confrontation and they do not want conflict, and they will make that clear to the Israeli authorities in direct communications.  I accept that fully and have conveyed that to the Israeli authorities.</P>
        <P>I asked Ambassador Evrony to convey to his Government my request that, following the tragedy which has occurred, the <i>MV Rachel Corrie </i>be allowed to continue unimpeded and given safe passage to deliver its cargo to Gaza.  Unfortunately, the Israeli Government has stated it will continue to enforce the blockade, but we continue to insist that no violence be <Col N="168"/>used against this vessel and that restraint apply.  We will be watching this situation closely, as indeed will the world, and it is imperative that Israel avoids any action which leads to further bloodshed or confrontation.</P>
        <P>I have focussed on the situation of Irish citizens and on the immediate events, but I am also deeply conscious of the wider context.  Indeed, I find that issues I have been raising since the Gaza war last year have come to the fore again.</P>
        <P>Israel must be brought to understand that military force is genuinely a last resort, not to be resorted to if any other method is available.  It has been said in Israel that when you have a hammer, every problem tends to look like a nail.  Israel has a right to exist and to defend itself, which we would all accept, but that right does not override and supersede all other rights, and the rights of all others.  As we saw in Gaza itself, so now we see in an effort to help Gaza &mdash; when you resort to powerful use of force, especially among civilians, terrible disasters such as this are not unexpected or unforeseeable; they are highly likely, sooner or later, usually sooner.</P>
        <P>I return also to a central issue I have been stressing in international dialogue, which is that the continuing blockade of Gaza simply cannot be accepted as part of the <i>status quo</i>, and allowed to continue indefinitely.  Public opinion in Ireland and elsewhere has shown that it will not accept this collective punishment of innocent people, and will act to challenge it.</P>
        <P>I am aware myself from my visit to Gaza earlier this year that what exists there is a dire and indisputable humanitarian crisis, with most of the population living in inhumane and intolerable conditions and with increasing incidence of what the UN euphemistically calls absolute poverty, that is, basically, not enough food to eat each day.</P>
        <P>The current situation amounts to collective punishment of the population of Gaza and, as the European Union acknowledged this week, is completely counter-productive.  As long as the siege of Gaza continues, it will inflict further injustice on the people who live there without, in my view, contributing at all to the security of Israel, and the blockade of Gaza is an underlying cause of what has happened here.</P>
        <P>The basic facts of what has happened are still emerging, and there is much more I could say, especially on the broader context.  As I stated earlier, it is extremely important, in order to try and ensure accountability, that as full a picture of what transpired is now built up in a credible and transparent manner.</P>
        <P>I will be following events closely, and considering what further action we need to take, nationally or at EU or UN level.  Debates have been taking place, both in Brussels and in the Human Rights Council in Geneva, and the Security Council in New York has called in a presidential statement for an &ldquo;impartial, credible and transparent investigation, conforming to international standards&rdquo;, of what has happened, a call which I fully support and echo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his r&eacute;sum&eacute; of what happened on the high seas in recent days.</P>
        <P>I extend my sympathy to the families of those who were murdered by Israeli forces and wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured.  The attack on the flotilla trying to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza was a terrorist attack on citizens from many nations.  It took place in international waters and showed poor judgment, to say the least, by Israeli forces and the Israeli Government.  Their actions have succeeded in giving credence to some groups whose sole aim is to destabilise the Israeli state and will certainly increase the support for Hamas in the region.  The attempts by various Israeli spokespersons to muddy the waters and try to put their own spin on events simply will not wash.  They would be better off putting their hands up and admitting they got it wrong and apologise for their actions rather than trying to justify a totally <Col N="169"/>disproportionate action which all right-thinking people condemn unreservedly.  Israeli governments have never put the actions of their security forces under critical focus, but these events demand that this policy must change.  The Turkish response is very telling, from a country that had close military and economic ties with Israel.  These actions by the Israelis may result in Turkey having closer ties with Iran and this would have far-reaching consequences in the region.</P>
        <P>The Israeli blockade of Gaza is illegal and it is about time the international community, especially America, acted to ensure humanitarian aid reaches the people in Gaza, who live in deplorable conditions as testified by the Minister after his visit to Gaza.  UN Resolution 1860 states there should be unfettered access for food, medical supplies and commercial goods but this is simply not happening.  John Ging is a champion from a humanitarian viewpoint.  He has clearly outlined what is happening in Gaza and what the response of the international community should be.  The Israeli Government remains a <i>de facto</i> occupying force since it decides what gets in and out of Gaza.  Israel must honour parliamentary and international law by ending the blockade of Gaza.  The deprivation visited on residents and especially the children of Gaza must stop.  The ludicrous situation which prevents the entry of goods for hospitals, schools and materials to assist in the reconstruction of Gaza, must be ended.  Hamas needs to get its act together and take strong action against activists who terrorise the Israeli people with rocket attacks every day.  There is not one person in this House who would disagree with the fact that Israel has every right to defend its own state and its people but it is about time Israel showed some respect for international law and proved that it is truly interested in finding a meaningful and lasting peace in the region with a two-state solution, based on respect for each other and recognition by each side of the other&rsquo;s right to exist.  It is my fervent hope that the recent atrocity, which must be condemned by all nations, may somehow refocus and ignite efforts to kick-start and revitalise efforts to find a solution to the problems of this region which are causing such strife globally.  In the meantime, an international inquiry must be established immediately to establish the truth about how people were killed while undertaking a humanitarian mission to bring aid to Gaza.  The findings of such an inquiry should be binding and there must be consequences for those held responsible for this needless loss of human life.</P>
        <P>The European Union has been weak in responding to the attacks and to the blockade of Gaza.  In fact, it appears to many that Israel was recently rewarded by the EU which supported its accession to the OECD, in blatant disregard of the human rights requirements of the OECD.  How did the Minister allow this to happen, taking into consideration his views on the illegal blockade of Gaza and other matters?  The House deserves an explanation from him on this matter.</P>
        <P>The situation regarding the use of Irish passports by Mossad operatives in murdering a Hamas militant in Dubai, needs to be addressed now.  Other countries have at least taken some action to emphasise that such actions will not be tolerated.  What are the findings of the Minister&rsquo;s inquiry?  What will be the Minister&rsquo;s response to this most serious matter?  The report commissioned by the Minister must be published in the interests of openness and transparency.  I hope the necessary action will be forthcoming from him in the very near future.</P>
        <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I had welcomed the opportunity to discuss the interception of the Gaza-bound humanitarian aid flotilla with the Israeli Ambassador at a special meeting convened for tomorrow.  I now understand that the ambassador has indicated he does not intend to fulfil his commitment to attend the meeting owing to unforeseen circumstances.  He has been offered the opportunity to arrange an alternative date or to nominate a replacement but this has also been refused.  This is far from being acceptable and is almost without precedent.  As a member of the committee, I would have thought the ambassador had a responsibility to attend and answer relevant questions in an open and demo<Col N="170"/>cratic forum, especially with regard to Irish citizens and their treatment.  It is regrettable and unacceptable that this opportunity has been lost.</P>
        <P>I concur with the Minister in wishing God speed and a safe passage to those on board the <i>MV Rachel Corrie.  </i>Let us hope there will not be any violence and that the Israelis will allow the boat passage and unfettered access to deliver the aid to Gaza.  This would be some small gesture after the debacle witnessed in recent days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank Senator Ann Ormonde, the spokesperson on foreign affairs, for allowing me to lead off on this issue.  I think the Irish people appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s great efforts in this matter because he has provided leadership not only in Europe but throughout the world in condemning the actions of the Israeli Government.  On behalf of the Irish people, I express my sympathies to the families and friends of the dead and the wounded.  I also pay tribute to those who participated in the flotilla trying to bring much needed aid to Gaza.  My parliamentary colleagues, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and Deputy Chris Andrews, along with parliamentarians from Germany, Sweden, Italy, Malaysia, Greece, Russia and Israel, made five attempts on Friday and Saturday to get from Cyprus by boat to join the flotilla 12 miles out in international waters.  Owing to the continuous intervention of the Cypriot police and the politicians in Cyprus whose stated intention was that it was not in their strategic interests in the region to assist us in leaving Cyprus to join the flotilla, we were unable to do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister has outlined to some degree the context in which the blockade occurred.  It is interesting that a former Israeli Cabinet Minister, Tzipi Livni, described the withdrawal from Gaza as literally a case of leaving and throwing up the keys to see who would catch them.  This was done on 11 September 2005 and in 2007 Hamas caught the keys.  Israel then decided to lock down the borders and is now engaged in an illegal blockade of Gaza.  It has prohibited thousands of items, including jam, fishing rods and paper.  Mr. John Ging, a former captain in the Irish Defence Forces, is the UN Relief Work Agency&rsquo;s head representative in Gaza which has a population of 1.5 million and is the size of County Louth.  Some 80% of the population rely on the United Nations for their survival and very existence.  In a recent interview with the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper Mr. Ging described the situation in Gaza as &ldquo;a sub-human existence.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The flotilla consisted of Turkish, Greek and Irish boats, with crews comprising 40 nationalities, which converged in international waters.  As the Minister stated, we know that nine people are dead and many more are injured.  Earlier today the Minister and I spoke with Mr Shane Dillon who was on <i>Challenger I</i>.  He told us what he had seen on the Turkish ship when it was boarded by the Israeli defence forces.  Tomorrow he will appear before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to let Ireland and the world know of his experience.</P>
        <P>The Israeli Government has tried to portray a version of events that is less than truthful.  It has stated Israeli forces were attacked first and fired on initially.  In the fog of war events are often portrayed thus by warring sides.  We have seen it happen here.  On Bloody Sunday in 1972 human rights marchers in Derry were portrayed as carrying guns and attacking the British security forces.  This was stated many times to blacken the names of peaceful protestors.  In the coming weeks, however, the Saville report will exonerate the people concerned.</P>
        <P>The Israelis have repeatedly said they did not break international law in boarding ships in international waters.  That is because they have not signed up to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea which forbids the boarding of ships that are of no threat.  The Israelis say they had offered the flotilla which I was due to board the right to bring goods to Israel or Turkey and that they would transfer them to Gaza.  They have failed to mention, however, that they have a long list of prohibited items.  For example, the cement being carried on the <i>MV Rachel <Col N="171"/>Corrie</i> would not have been transferred to Gaza.  In addition, toys would not have been transferred either.  Most of the material aboard the flotilla would not have reached Gaza if the ships had landed in Israel and the Israelis were to transport the items to the Occupied Territories.</P>
        <P>Israel&rsquo;s Deputy Foreign Minister, Danny Ayalon, said the flotilla would not even bring a letter from the mother of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier captured by militants four years ago who has been held without access to the Red Cross for that period.  However, this claim is false.  When the Free Gaza movement was asked if it would do so, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, Deputy Chris Andrews and I contacted Gilad Shalit&rsquo;s family solicitor in Jerusalem to tell them that we would send an email outlining that we would bring the letters and hand them personally to the Red Cross or Mr. John Ging at the United Nations to try to get them to Mr. Shalit.  However, it was portrayed as if the flotilla did not have the heart to do the right thing.</P>
        <P>What next?  As Senators opposite have pointed out, the Israeli ambassador has refused to appear before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  When will he come?  He can name any time and date on which he can explain why Israel has done this to the international community.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have sought safe passage for the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> whose passengers include the former UN assistant secretary general, Mr. Denis Halliday, and the Nobel peace laureate, Ms Mairead Maguire.</P>
        <P>Ireland has experienced what Israel and Palestine are going through.  We know that genuine dialogue is the only way to achieve peace.  The question is what has the Israeli Government done to the honourable State of Israel.  What have the extremists in Israel done?  They have brought dishonour to the name and people of Israel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House, I would like to share time with Senator Quinn.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House for the debate on this timely motion.  I agree with him that one should, first, express one&rsquo;s sympathy to the relatives of the dead and the injured in what was undoubtedly an act of piracy which took place on the high seas.  It was suggested Israel was in some measure under threat, but that calls into question the nature of the regime within Israel.  We are always told that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East.  This has become the mantra.  It has some democratic elements, including some that I welcome.  However, one should now start to deconstruct the nature of that democracy.  The Israelis have behaved in a way that had it been done by the Somali pirates, a NATO task force would immediately have been sent to deal with them.  However, because it concerned a state backed by the United States, they seem to be able to get away with it.  The response of the Obama Administration has been timid in the extreme.</P>
        <P>I welcome today&rsquo;s reports that a member of the Israeli Embassy staff is to be expelled as a result of involvement in passport forgery for the purposes of committing murder.  These are the things that should be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>It would be a useful academic exercise to examine the language employed by Israeli diplomats and Ministers who have an extremely effective propaganda machine.  They are the world leaders in PR, which is extraordinarily glib.  They force language into the most unusual contortions.  For example, this small group of tiny vessels carrying concrete, toys and wheelchairs is described as &ldquo;an armada of hate and violence&rdquo;.  I heard Mr. Ayalon say some did not like to be in the presence of Israelis; we all know what that means.  It means that anybody who opposes the horrendous and barbaric policies of the regime in Israel is,<i> ipso facto</i>, anti-Semitic.  It is, however, very difficult to maintain that the reactions to these events are anti-Semitic.  I remem<Col N="172"/>ber that one of the passengers aboard a previous convoy was an 83-year old concentration camp survivor.  In what way was she anti-Semitic?  Are the Hasidic Jews who demonstrated yesterday with placards at the Cenotaph in London anti-Semitic?  They held up placards calling on the Zionist state to cease its criminal activities, siege and blockade.  That language system needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>The Israeli authorities are even proposing to deport certain individuals, having imported them first.  Is this the new way?  They kidnap people, force them to enter the country and then attempt to criminalise them for illegal entry.  Surely somebody sees the contradictions.</P>
        <P>I heard another Israeli spokesman on radio recently say that under Article 47 of the foundation document of the United Nations, a blockade was permissible.  There is no reference to blockades in that article which I heard the former Irish diplomat, Mr. Noel Dorr, read out in its entirety on radio.  The key point, however, is that they are not afraid of violence.  Of course, the people involved resisted when they were set upon by a collection of brigands, but I thought it was a bit thick.  They talked about slings and a few kitchen knives being used against the most sophisticated arms one could have in the hands of these very violent young paratroopers.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I wonder if they are aware of one of Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Casey&rsquo;s works in which an Irish republican says in a similar situation: &ldquo;Do they want us to come out in our pelts and throw stones at them?&rdquo;.  That is basically what the Palestinians have been reduced to.  They are not just afraid of the kind of propaganda coup which, despite their brilliance, they have handed the Palestinians on a plate.  They are also worried that the blockade might be broken by this.  It should be broken because it is illegal under international law.  It is a humanitarian disgrace.  It has enabled the Israelis to do things under the cover of darkness.  If their own people knew about such things, they would be horrified.  People are living in raw sewage.  The excrement and urine of 1.5 million people is going untreated into the sea.</P>

The Hamas ceasefire was provoked by an Israeli military incursion.  I have put all this stuff on the record.  We have seen the Goldstone report.  The Minister&rsquo;s contribution was very good.  Now is the time for action.  Mr. Justice Goldstone, who is Jewish, has warned that this will be repeated again and again if it is not acted on.  If it is not referred to the criminal court, it will come back again and again.  There are things we can do.  I have argued for years that the failure to monitor the EuroMed agreement, to which human rights protocols are attached, brings the whole idea of human rights into complete and utter contempt.

I support the Minister&rsquo;s final remarks in which he called for an impartial, credible and transparent investigation that conforms to international standards.  I do not support him when he asks &ldquo;Who now could possibly argue that preventing this cargo from reaching Gaza was so important?&rdquo;.  I suggest that anyone who thought it should reach Gaza was not thinking straight.  I am told that for the last five years, Israel has been subjected to at least 10,000 bombs and rockets from Gaza.  Did anyone really expect a democratic country like Israel to allow a flotilla of ships to come in and go straight to Gaza without any inspection?  I do not think that was possible.</P>

The people are running short of food and the other things they need to live, but they do not seem to be running short of guns and bombs.  Hamas seems to be able to get these goods into Gaza, but it is unable to get food into Gaza.  It is quite reasonable and rational to point that out.  I say that as someone who is horrified about what happened.  I do not understand the force that was used.</P>
        <P>People have criticised the use of force in international waters, but I am old enough to be reminded of an incident that occurred in 1962 when I was on my honeymoon.  It is probable that no one else here is old enough to remember it.  Russians with loaded ships were heading <Col N="174"/>towards Cuba in international waters but President Kennedy told them not to go any further.  He told them to stop, just as Israel told the flotilla not to go any further in international waters.  Fortunately, Russia agreed at the time to turn back.  The Americans said they would not allow the Russians to land in Cuba with whatever was on board their ships.  I see a similarity between what happened then and what is happening now.  Israel said the flotilla would not be able to land in Gaza.  It asked those involved to land in Israel and to allow inspections to take place so that the goods could be taken into Gaza.</P>
        <P>I disagree with what has happened.  I believe the investigation that will take place into these horrific killings will be fair.  Regardless of where it takes place &mdash; I assume it will take place at UN or EU level &mdash; I am sure it will be impartial.  I hope the investigation will consider the possibility that the flotilla could be accused of coat-trailing, to use an old term.  In other words, they may have been acting in the hope of causing a scandal and embarrassing Israel.  I am no defender of Israel in this situation, but I believe it would be irrational and unacceptable to expect the Israelis to allow uninspected ships to go into Gaza after they have been bombed continuously and suffered many deaths over many years.  I believe we need a balance.  That is what I would like to have in this debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I thank him for coming to the Seanad to give Members an update on recent events in Gaza.  I start by offering my condolences to the Turkish Government and people as well as to the families of those killed during the Israeli commando raid on the humanitarian flotilla off the coast of Gaza.  Like everyone else, I was shocked as the events unfolded on Monday morning.  I followed the news bulletins as information slowly seeped out about what had occurred on the high seas.  When it became clear that the raid had happened in international waters, I could not believe the Israeli authorities had once again acted in defiance of the overwhelming wishes of the international community.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, not just for the way he has responded to the latest crisis but also for the interest he has maintained in the Middle East region, especially Gaza, since his appointment.  He is right to say that Israel is pushing back the line on what is regarded as acceptable in the name of security.  It is time for the international community to say &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  There is no excuse for the deaths of those who died on the flotilla.  This was underlined in the motion passed by the United Nations Security Council.  It is rare for such a unanimous declaration to be achieved.  That it happened so swiftly shows that Ireland is far from alone in telling Israel that this is simply not acceptable.  I echo the Minister&rsquo;s call for a full independent inquiry to establish what happened during the early hours of Monday.  The information that has been coming out has been one-sided.  It appears that Israel has denied those people it has detained their rights, while its public relations machine was activated to give just one side of the story.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs had invited the Israeli ambassador to address it tomorrow but I understand he has declined, which is very disappointing.  It is more necessary than ever that we should hear from him and have a full discussion with him.  I welcome the fact the Minister has already met with one of our citizens who witnessed the events and has spoken directly to the humanitarian ship <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, both yesterday and today.</P>
        <P>While we are appalled at what has happened, we should also look at the behaviour of the Israeli authorities since the deaths.  The Minister was correct when he strongly came out against what was effectively the kidnapping of our citizens.  Despite the best efforts of the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv, access to our citizens has been extremely unsatisfactory during their time in detention.  Israel has an obligation to recognise the consular rights of Irish people which did <Col N="175"/>not happen.  I welcome the fact people are being finally released and commend the Department of Foreign Affairs, our colleagues in the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach and the Minister for the pressure they brought to bear to help bring about a resolution.</P>
        <P>We must now hear their side of the story.  I encourage the Government to meet these captives on their release and take note of their accounts of what happened.</P>
        <P>Our priority now must be the safety of the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> and those on board including five Irish citizens.  I join the calls of the Minister and the Taoiseach in demanding this humanitarian ship be allowed continue its mission.  In light of the tragedy that has unfolded, it is not an unreasonable request to ask that the ship be allowed to sail on to Gaza.  The supplies it has on board will be welcomed by the local besieged population.  I urge the Minister to remain engaged with Israel to secure this result and at the very least ensure no threat is issued against the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a proud record in the Middle East, calling for peace at every opportunity, restraint and respect between Israel and its neighbours.  We have to remain engaged with many governments in the region, including Israel, and encourage negotiations to bring about a settlement acceptable to all.</P>
        <P>However, the situation in Gaza is unacceptable.  Easing the plight of the people in Gaza was the sole purpose of the flotilla&rsquo;s mission.  Many Members, including the Minister, have seen at first hand the situation on the ground.  I remember the Minister recalling a visit to a boys&rsquo; school built from metal containers.</P>
        <P>The food shortages, lack of building supplies and the pumping of raw sewage into the sea have led to a critical point.  Those on the flotilla were not violent and their intentions were good.  There is no excuse for what we saw unfold off the coast of Gaza.</P>
        <P>The Government is unequivocal in its demand for the illegal blockade to be lifted.  I urge the Minister to use every possible opportunity to achieve that goal.</P>
        <P>I hope Israel will reflect on the bloodshed that has occurred and allow the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> and its humanitarian cargo safe passage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for arranging this debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs at such short notice.  As my party colleague Deputy Higgins said in the other House, we have reached a turning point this week in the Middle East.  This has been brought about by the illegal actions of the Israeli armed forces in the storming of the flotilla bound for Gaza and the ensuing deaths of so many unarmed aid workers.  I express my condolences to the families of the deceased and wish the best recovery for those injured in the attack.</P>
        <P>The Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, described the attack as a bloody massacre, an attack on international law, the conscience of humanity and on world peace.  The Israelis, however, have tried to defend their actions claiming they were unsure whether the flotilla was smuggling guns into Gaza.  We heard such claims before with the non-existent weapons of mass destruction to justify the war in Iraq.  Like in that instance, this has turned out to be paranoia on the part of the aggressor.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the need for balance in this debate.  However, the Israeli action of killing of so many unarmed civilians was in no way balanced.  I fail to accept such a well-armed army as Israel&rsquo;s could not have used non-fatal weapons such as CS gas to detain those <Col N="176"/>on board.  While I do not agree with the detention of the flotilla, Israel&rsquo;s reaction to it has been a gross violation of international law and was in no way balanced.</P>
        <P>The fact the aid flotilla was necessary suggests a failure on the part of the international community to act.  We have known for some time the plight of those living in Gaza.  Matters got considerably worse last year at the time of the Israeli armed forces&rsquo; Operation Cast Lead.  As a member of the foreign affairs committee I received a copy of the Goldstone report on the operation and listened to one of its authors, Colonel Desmond Travers, describe the background to the inquiry.  He candidly spoke of the reality on the ground with deliberate attacks on civilians leaving their homes while holding white flags, an attack on a Mosque during evening prayers in which 15 people were killed and that 30% of agricultural land in Gaza is unusable.  This, along with the blockades, is having a direct impact on food production and availability.</P>
        <P>The population of Gaza is 1.5 million people, 80% of whom are unemployed and 56% of whom are children.  Israel has repeatedly said in recent days there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  However, a UN report in April 2010 showed 300,000 Gazans live in abject poverty and 700,000 need food aid.  Life expectancy and infant mortality rates, as well as the general population&rsquo;s health, have been adversely affected by these conditions.</P>
        <P>The flotilla was an attempt to bring aid relief to the people of Gaza who are being subjected to an illegal blockade by the State of Israel.  I too would have liked to hear the Israeli ambassador, Dr Zion Evrony, give his explanation for his state&rsquo;s action at the foreign affairs committee tomorrow.  I am very disappointed he has cited unforeseen circumstances and cancelled his attendance.</P>
        <P>The Turkish Premier, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said today would change history and nothing would ever be the same again.  Across the world, we have seen governments and citizens stunned by Israel&rsquo;s actions.  Governments on each continent have expressed dismay at the Israeli Government&rsquo;s flouting of international law.</P>
        <P>The UN Security Council called for a prompt impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards.  Seemingly the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; was pulled from earlier drafts at US insistence because it implied the investigation should not be conducted by Israel.  Like Senator Norris, I am disappointed at that watered down statement.</P>
        <P>Inside Israel there is a recognition it has gone too far.  It largest selling newspaper, <i>Yediot Aharonot</i>, called on the Israeli Minister for Defence, Ehud Barak, to resign, claiming:</P>
        <P LI="1">If Ehud Barak doesn&rsquo;t resign, international public opinion will perceive Israel as a country that is deserving of collective punishment as a sovereign entity.  It ought to be hit, if not over the head, then at the very least in its pocket by means of an economic boycott.  That is a clear and immediate danger.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Another newspaper <i>Ha&rsquo;aretz</i> asked why Israel did not see that instead of tightening the siege of Gaza, it was about to tighten the siege on itself.  Across the world citizens are calling for action.</P>
        <P>We must learn from the lessons of inaction.  We should have acted after the publication of the Goldstone report but did not.  I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs for being the first European Minister to see the impact Operation Cast Lead had on Gaza.  He published an article in <i>The New York Times</i> a year later stating the conditions prevailing for the ordinary population of Gaza were inhumane and utterly unacceptable.  Yet last week he agreed to the accession of Israel to the OECD.  This was done with the Council&rsquo;s roadmap, which states the <Col N="177"/>Council reaffirms that OECD membership is committed to fundamental values, including a commitment to human rights.  The Minister must recognise that the actions of Israel show a blatant disregard for human rights and, bearing in mind that his vote could have prevented it from gaining accession, I call on the Minister to appeal for this action to be reversed.  Pressure must be brought upon Israel at a European level.  The Minister has the experience and the knowledge to be at the forefront of this issue and I urge him to ensure be there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Like my colleagues, I express and offer my sympathy to the families of all those who were killed on the Gaza freedom flotilla, the nine individuals who lost their lives in the early hours of Monday morning at the hands of the Israeli commandos, and the all those injured.</P>
        <P>I completely disagree with the comments of my colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn.  They were akin to what we could have heard from the propaganda machine of the Israeli authorities.  It was unlike Senator Quinn.  I agree with many of his views but some of his comments took me by surprise.</P>
        <P>I believe all those on the Gaza freedom flotilla were brave individuals.  I commend Senator Mark Daly, who attempted to join the flotilla, along with our colleagues in the Lower House, Deputies Chris Andrews and Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh.  This is an illegal blockade which must be lifted and Ireland must play its part in lifting it.  I am glad there are Irish people on the <i>Rachel Corrie</i> attempting to break the blockade of Gaza and I wish them God speed.  I hope the Israeli authorities rescind their threats on that ship and allow it safe passage into Gaza.  We should not allow any of our citizens, whether Irish or those of other member states of the EU, to be blackened as the Israeli authorities have attempted and we must defend them at all times.  They are peaceful protestors who are trying to break what is an illegal blockade by the Israeli authorities.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on his early response in respect of this onslaught by the Israeli authorities on the free Gaza flotilla.  The words he uttered gave comfort to the Irish nation.  He expressed the outrage, horror and anger that was palpable throughout the island of Ireland.  I referred to the terminology he used, such as &ldquo;kidnapping on the high seas&rdquo;, and the other language, which was deeply emotive but was very sincere given his track record on this issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a time when we must all stand up and, sometimes, words are not enough.  That time is now.  I refer to the actions of the Israeli authorities not only in this instance but when they forged Irish passports to conduct activities of murder.  In this case, commandos came down from a helicopter in the dark of night, with Irish citizens on board a ship, equipped with iron bars and kitchen knifes and they opened fire.  There is a time to stand up, a time when words are not enough and I believe that time is now.  This is not the time to invite the ambassador to the committee but to expel him.  The Minister should threaten or request an end to the preferential trade agreements with Israel at a European level.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  Senator Quinn is looking through the wrong end of the telescope on this issue and I was astonished by his contribution which struck me as <Col N="178"/>ill-informed and grossly misplaced.  As Senator Doherty remarked, we find ourselves much in agreement with Senator Quinn in this House but in this case his contribution was beyond the beyonds.</P>
        <P>The <i>Rachel Corrie</i> is on its way to the Gazan coastline as we speak.  I have been outing the fact in recent days that I inspected the cargo myself before the ship left and I have no doubt of its humanitarian nature and of the humanitarian intent of the crew.</P>
        <P>I believe the Minister has spoken to Derek Graham by satellite phone.  I heard him today on local radio expressing grave concern at a rumour, and it was just that, to the effect that a Turkish gunboat may accompany the <i>Rachel Corrie</i> on its approach to the blockade.  I hope that is not true but it is something about which he was exercised on radio today.  It would be good to hear an assurance from the Minister that this is not the case in any shape, way or form.  It would represent an appalling vista to see that boat used as a pawn in an international power trade.  I raise this for the safety of the people involved.</P>
        <P>The call for action is prescient right now.  There have been many diplomatic gestures, some of which have been strong and some not so strong.  We need stronger action at this stage with regard to expressing our outrage at the act of piracy in the eastern Mediterranean.  Last year, my party proposed diplomatic expulsion on foot of the abuse of Irish passports and it is good to see that is happening.  As long as Irish citizens are in need of the support of our diplomatic services in Tel Aviv in Israel, we should keep our people there.  It would be inappropriate to remove them at this moment but we should send the strongest possible signals at this stage.  Would a conference of the signatories of the Fourth Geneva Convention be a prospect given that collective punishment is expressly outlawed in that convention?  That is precisely what has been inflicted on the people of Gaza through this blockade and through Operation Cast Lead, to which Senator Hannigan referred and which killed thousands and left many children without parents, schools, education, sanitation, prospects or hope.  Gaza was utterly devastated by that operation.  Approximately 40 lorry loads of construction material have been allowed through the blockade since then whereas, prior to that, there were 7,000 in the same year.  The convoys were sent to deal with a reconstruction project that was nowhere near the scale of what was required after Operation Cast Lead.</P>
        <P>The offer by the Israelis to bring in the goods is utterly disingenuous.  The banned list means that, in fact, nothing would get through.  Serious work must be undertaken in using the collective punishment avenue and we must seriously consider convening some group around this theme of abuse and around the Fourth Geneva Convention to try to lever an end to the blockade of Gaza.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty probably offers us some prospects.  For anyone who had any doubts about its merit, now is the time to show the increased ability of the European Union to act with one voice on foreign affairs issues and such a position ought to be taken up now after the passing of the Lisbon treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, on his actions to date.  He has acted very responsibly and has caught the mood of the people.  I thank Senator Dearey for sharing time.  I commend Senator Doherty on his words, which were very poignant.  There is a very close relationship and an affinity between Palestine and Ireland because of the nature of the conflicts that have taken place in Ireland and Gaza.</P>
        <P>I received a call late one night from the Mayor of Beit Lehia, the third largest city in Gaza.  He is an independent mayor and he informed me his house was surrounded by tanks that night. <Col N="179"/> This is the type of country in which these people live.  I received a text message recently indicating there were several gunboats approaching the flotilla and this concerned me greatly.  Subsequently, lives were lost.  It is time to stop the rhetoric.  I agree with Senator Doherty it is time to consider diplomatic expulsions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Martin, for coming to the Seanad to give a comprehensive report on this situation.  I commend him, the Taoiseach and the Government on their united approach in this regard.  There was a united statement from the Cabinet yesterday and it set a headline around the world on this issue.  The Minister is, as far as I know, the only Foreign Minister in the European Union to visit Gaza.  He was initially refused entry but was then allowed in to see the situation at first hand, as he mentioned in his report.  It gives him a great insight into the situation in Gaza and the plight of 1.5 million people.  It sets a tone for his work with the other ministers.  I believe there should be a united approach by the foreign ministers of the European Union to consider all aspects of the situation in Gaza.</P>
        <P>We are currently reacting to the tragic murder of nine Turkish citizens on the high seas, and the injuries of many more.  We extend our sympathies to the families.  Senator Mark Daly, Deputy Chris Andrews and Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh were also prepared to go on those ships with aid to Gaza.  I commend them on their courage and commitment.  I recall a visit to the West Bank, Jerusalem, Hebron and Ramallah by Deputies Eamon Gilmore, John Gormley and Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, the late Tony Gregory, Senator John Paul Phelan and myself approximately four years ago.  We were guests of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and met the different factions there.  We could not meet Hamas because its representatives were out of bounds as far as we were concerned due to their stance on Israel.</P>
        <P>An independent international investigation must be conducted under the auspices of the European Union or the United Nations.  There is no point having an investigation carried out by the perpetrators of this action; it would be a total whitewash.  An excellent report was produced by the United Nations on the atrocities in the war of January 2009.  A total of 1,200 people were killed then, yet nobody talks about it.  It is a case of the reaction to the last atrocity.  The event on Monday was a great tragedy, but 1,200 Palestinians were murdered or killed over 18 months ago.  That is the reality on which we must focus.  A solution must be found.  What happened yesterday will pass from memory as international events take over and we move on to the next atrocity in the region.</P>
        <P>With regard to action on Israel, I agree with the Minister that removing diplomatic missions is not an option.  We must continue to have a conduit between this country and Israel, as two independent states.  Israel must have a contact in Ireland.  I regret that the ambassador will not attend the meeting tomorrow to put his point of view and to respond to our questions.  The European Union gives massive aid and assistance.  Baroness Ashton should play a role in this and summon a meeting of the Foreign Ministers, if one has not already been summoned, to discuss this issue and consider what action can be taken or what reprimand can be given to Israel.  It should compensate the families that have been affected.  Serious damage has been caused as a result of the nine murders or deaths and the 50 injured.  The Irish citizens are safe and with regard to those on the high seas at present, the Taoiseach has made it clear that the ship should be protected and allowed to deliver its goods to the Gaza Strip.</P>
        <P>With regard to the long-term position, Hamas must accept the right of the Israeli people and the State of Israel to exist.  It cannot continue its policy.  We are aware of this from the situation in this country with regard to recognition of Sinn F&eacute;in and the fact that the IRA has been <Col N="180"/>disbanded.  Sinn F&eacute;in is now in government in this country, and rightly so.  Hamas should follow that example and not exploit the position of its people in the Gaza Strip.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, it might have been unintentional but I ask the Senator to withdraw the similarities he drew between Sinn F&eacute;in and Hamas in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not comparing Sinn F&eacute;in to Hamas; I would compare Sinn F&eacute;in more to the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.  I do not imply anything because Sinn F&eacute;in has taken a very positive role.  There is no connection whatsoever.  My point is that Hamas will have to accept Israel&rsquo;s right to exist.  That is fundamental.  There should be an effort to unite both Fatah and Hamas to achieve a united Palestinian approach.  The Saudi Arabians have done much work on this, as the Minister knows.  A Saudi Arabian delegation visited the Houses last week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To summarise, we condemn what has happened.  The Government has taken the action that was required.  There must also be European Union action which will be stronger with the support of 27 countries.  The Minister has accepted his responsibility and worked for the Irish citizens.  We appeal for no action to be taken against them, that they be returned safely and that they can deliver their aid.  Let us move on to the next step, which is to work with the Israelis and Palestinians to create a two-state system.  Members on this side of the House are very proud that the late Mr. Brian Lenihan was the first Foreign Minister to recognise the right of a Palestinian state to exist in harmony and peace with Israel.  I believe the Minister will continue that fine work on behalf of the Government.  I wish him continued success.</P>
        <P>Our only hope is that we get our five citizens home and that they safely deliver their goods.  The Minister will do his utmost to ensure that happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the compliments that have been paid to the Minister, Deputy Martin.  He has put forward the Irish position very positively.  As Senator Leyden said, he follows in a very proud tradition that dates back to Mr. Frank Aiken and to the late Mr. Brian Lenihan in this context.  I welcome the opportunity to join colleagues in condemning the actions of the Israeli commandos last Monday.  I also echo the concerns expressed on all sides of the House for the safe return of the five Irish citizens.  I am reassured by the Minister&rsquo;s comments that every effort is being made, at both ministerial and consular level, to ensure the rights of these citizens are protected and that they will get home safely.</P>
        <P>It is necessary to frame this debate in the context of the absolute right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and to defend itself from attack, which is a common thread through many of the contributions.  Indeed, that is the Government&rsquo;s position and it has been consistent in that regard.  I will not join in a chorus of disapproval of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution.  The Senator was attempting, as often happens in this House particularly where the Middle East and Israel are concerned, to project the Israeli view.  Whether it is right is not the point; there is an Israeli point of view.  All the contributions made in the House suggest that Members have already researched the domestic Israeli position on what has happened.  A unified approach is being taken by the Israeli people in supporting the military actions of their army, and we should not be surprised at that.</P><Col N="181"/>
        <P>Israel faces many external and internal threats from groups and state actors who question its right to exist.  However, we are now at a critical early phase in the aftermath of this conflict, where the involvement of the European Union and the influence of the United States will dictate what sanctions or actions emerge.  The United States, which in the past has failed to hold the Israeli Government to account for human rights abuses, is part of the solution in light of this recent activity.  This failure cannot continue.  It highlights another problem for the Obama administration, the question of US credibility in the face of the international condemnation.  The Obama administration risks cementing the Bush era hypocrisy label.  That administration made a great deal of advocating democracy in the Arab world, and rightly so, but then worked to overturn electoral results it did not like.</P>
        <P>President Obama has encouraged non-violent resistance for the Palestinians&rsquo; pursuit of equality and freedom, and he made that clear in his speech in Cairo a year ago next Friday.  I will outline the challenge that faces American politicians.  Any Member of the Oireachtas who has had any engagement with American politicians, as I have had through bilateral arrangements between Congress and the Houses of the Oireachtas, will testify to the fact that there are two no-go areas among the issues for discussion with members of Congress, whether Republicans or Democrats.  One is the death penalty and the other is Israel.  Most American politicians are petrified of being seen to step out of line, mainly because of the activities of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the most effective pro-Israel lobby in the United States.  If the AIPAC considers a candidate does not totally support Israel, it will fund an opposition candidate to unseat him or her.  It has happened and will continue to happen.  That is the challenge one faces.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are brave people in the United States Congress.  References have been made to the Goldstone report which was prepared, as Senator Leyden will know, by a Jewish judge and sanctioned and endorsed by the United Nations.  Believe it or not, it was subject to an opposing resolution in the House of Representatives last November that was overwhelmingly carried.  In other words, the House of Representatives rejected the report.  However, some honourable people took part in that debate.  One was Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a Democrat from Ohio.  He made the following comment which is relevant to what happened this week: &ldquo;Almost as serious as committing war crimes is covering up war crimes, pretending that war crimes were never committed and did not exist, because if this Congress votes to condemn a report it has not read concerning events it has totally ignored about violations of law of which it is unaware, it will have brought great shame to this institution.&rdquo;  That sums up what is happening in the United States and the challenge the European Union will face.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will not merely focus on achieving consensus among European Union member states, as has been suggested, as this would be extremely difficult.  One has only to look at the rather bland statement by Baroness Ashton which coincided with the American statement expressing great regret and calling for an investigation.  Beyond this there was nothing.  This is because her hands are tied.  Most European countries, particularly the bigger states, will not speak out in total condemnation of Israel.  This is especially true of Germany which considers itself to have a guilty past in this regard.  I hope the Minister will focus equally on the United States and hold bilateral discussions with his colleagues in Europe and the United States.</P>
        <P>Several Senators have reflected on the fact that everything continues to be the same, no matter what happens.  For them, I leave this quote: &ldquo;In the aftermath of the crisis observers suggested Israel&rsquo;s diplomatic position and foreign reputation had been permanently tainted. <i>The New York Times </i>reported that Israel was facing its worst diplomatic crisis in two decades.&rdquo; <Col N="182"/> Does that comment refer to the events of Monday last?  No, it refers to the invasion of Gaza.  This will continue, unless action is taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What happened is a source of deep embarrassment to the Israeli military.  It is obvious there was not total consensus at Israeli Cabinet meetings last week and that resistance was not anticipated.  One Minister is reported to have said the Cabinet thought the people on board the boats would turn and flee once the military personnel boarded and that they were caught unawares.  This has been a military failure for the Israeli defence forces which pushed the expedition in the Israeli Cabinet, although there was dissent within it.  The secretary to the Israeli Cabinet is quoted in <i>Ha&rsquo;aretz</i>, the most influential newspaper in Israel, as saying he opposed the military intervention, that they should allow the boats to go into Gaza because not allowing them to do so would be a major public relations disaster for the state of Israel.  There are sane voices, even within the Israeli Cabinet.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well in what he has done.  He is following a proud tradition and I hope he will continue to do so in tackling this intractable and complex problem.</P>

	<P>I thank all Senators, including the Acting Chairman, for their contributions to the debate.  It follows the constructive debate yesterday in the other House where all parties agreed to the text of a motion.  It is important that the Irish Houses of Parliament send a unified message to the international community that we condemn the Israeli attack on the flotilla, demand the immediate release of all detainees and call for an independent and impartial international inquiry.  Our best approach is to do this on a united basis.  This sends the signal to the global community that we wish to send.  A united statement from the Houses of Parliament is a powerful message in itself.  That is why I asked Opposition spokespersons in the other House to join me in drafting the motion that emerged from the debate yesterday.  This House may also subscribe to that motion.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly has a continuing interest in this issue and has raised with me many issues pertaining to Gaza, both as a Senator and arising from his involvement with the Free Gaza movement.  Other Senators have also taken an interest in the issue in which there has been a general interest and with which there has been engagement across the House and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the politics of the latest atrocity.  No country has stood more clearly than Ireland on a range of issues from the war in Gaza onwards.  Because of this we have been the focus of much attention.  I do not say this to seek any commendation.  Whether we like it, it is simply a fact.</P>
        <P>Senators mentioned the Goldstone report.  We did not stand by on it.  We endorsed it at the United Nations General Assembly where we had only four other EU countries behind us.  We were disappointed by this.  Thankfully, in a second vote some months later a greater number of EU countries supported our stance.  At the time of the Gaza conflict, there were some very tough and challenging meetings at EU level.  However, I have noticed a shift in opinion and orientation among some EU member states.  Senators have been honest in observing that 27 member states must come from different perspectives and backgrounds.  The conclusions arrived at last December under the Swedish Presidency were strong in their commitment to a two state solution and in terms of the blockade on Gaza.  They were much stronger than previous ones.  Ireland had a significant input in their shape with the Swedish Presidency and other like-minded states.  I have, therefore, noticed an evolution in thought and approach among European member states in the last 15 to 18 months.  It is slow and may not be perceptible to many looking in from the outside, but I have witnessed it.  It stems from the power of debate <Col N="183"/>and argument which can be long and arduous, but is, in essence, the fundamental power we have.  People call for action.  That is the most effective action we can take.</P>
        <P>Side by side with individual issues and episodes that have occurred, there is the broader question of trying to be effective and influential in brokering a peace deal.  There is much respect for Ireland across the Middle East and we want to approach this issue with a degree of balance.  Senator Quinn accused me of lacking balance.  He is entitled to do so.  This is a debate and it is important that we have one.  I believe I am balanced in my approach to this matter.  I speak out when I see blatant injustices taking place or illogical policies that are counterproductive to the security of Israel and a strategic resolution of the conflict.  The blockade of Gaza is wrong because it amounts to a collective punishment of the people.  That is the fundamental point.  All of this happened because of the illegal blockade of Gaza.</P>
        <P>After my visit to Gaza, I was followed by Bang Ki-Moon and Cathy Ashton.  We raised the issue at European Union level and spoke to President Obama who asked us for our observations and Secretary of State Clinton.  The events of the past week happened because non-governmental organisations representing citizens with strong views on the situation in the Middle East wanted to demonstrate their opposition to the blockade.  The Israeli Government has issues with that but citizens in the free world are entitled to articulate their position, to oppose and to object once it is within peaceful means.  As a democrat, I must uphold the right of people to do that.  Israel needs to be more tolerant.  I am not naive and I acknowledge that within any non-governmental movement, elements can emerge from time to time.  We witnessed that in El Arish in 2008.  Many people came back to me and said they did not realise there were elements within that.  In this context, people are entitled to profile and highlight a blatant injustice such as a blockade and to seek to bring humanitarian aid through.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn felt that was unrealistic and unreasonable and he referred to a comment I made, about which I was a little taken aback because I asked whether anyone was suggesting, given what has happened, that it would be unreasonable to allow the ships through.  No one in the wide earthly world, including those in the Free Gaza Movement flotilla, would object to inspection, even in the zone.  As it turns out, I spoke to Shane Dillon, a participant, and his observation was that everything was screened before it was taken on board his ship.  In any event, if the Israeli authorities wanted to screen ships, they could.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The bottom line is that is not the issue.  The issue is UNRWA cannot access cement to build schools because it is regarded as something that could contribute to the manufacture of a war material and, therefore, is not allowed in.  The list of prohibited goods changes at different times, which is farcical.  The international community wants a comprehensive range of material to be allowed in for the reconstruction of Gaza.  Billions of dollars were committed by the international community at the major donor conference in Sharm el-Sheikh in the aftermath of the Gaza war.  Countries such as France are waiting to build hospitals but little progress has been made.  It has not been comprehensive enough and it is only scratching the surface.</P>
       <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The situation would be transformed if the blockade were lifted and if reconstruction took place in Gaza.  Much needed employment would be generated for many young people because Gaza has a young population.  There is significant malnourishment of children, which I witnessed.  It is harrowing to watch fathers and mothers queuing desperately for basic food supplies.  UNRWA does not supply a comprehensive food basket.  It provides basic supplies such as flour, which gives people the bare necessities in the context of the food nutrients a population requires.  Despite all the talk from Israeli spokespeople, it does not stack up.</P><Col N="184"/>
        <P>This reflects the wider peace process.  The blockade has been a significant barrier to advancing talks between the Palestinians and Israel to get to where we all want, which is a two-state solution and people living in harmony.  It is also wholly counterproductive.  Senator Quinn asked about what cannot get into Gaza.  The bottom line is the blockade has sustained Hamas.  There are many tunnels which are controlled by the organisation.  Its members collect customs duties and taxes on goods that pass through the tunnels.  I met legitimate business people who have been wiped out.  They had traded with Israel and through Israeli merchants for a long time.  They have gone out of business and are watching a new generation of business people emerge who are under the control of and supported by Hamas.  This makes no sense and is counterproductive to any strategic objective of Israel or the international community.  Seeing is believing.</P>
        <P>We were satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council meeting in December regarding the blockade.  A range of issues were raised by Members.  For example, I mentioned that Ireland is respected but we must balance how we approach various issues.  Membership of the OECD is not, and cannot be, interpreted as an endorsement of Israeli policies.  It is an economic organisation which issues reports on economic development.  In no way can it be construed as supporting Israeli policy.  I have not taken the boycott-disinvestment route because it would not help to achieve the objective we want, which is a resolution of the Middle East conflict.  We have made that call in the context of how we approach this.</P>
        <P>Ireland was asked to chair the Middle East resolution at the recent Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference because it was felt by those in charge that we had some credibility and would have the capacity to bring countries as disparate as the US and Iran together and devise a formula and language that would meet the requirements of a successful conference.  As one of the founding members of the NPT, we were concerned that progress would be made at the conference, which was held in New York over the past month.  One of our civil servants, Alison Kelly, chaired the Middle East resolution and did an excellent job.  She was a tremendous tribute to our diplomatic service and to the high calibre of staff within the Department.  Perhaps people need to understand the broader context within which we must operate from time to time.  We must have credibility with all sides if we want to make a contribution to the resolution.</P>
        <P>I accept that creates challenges and problems but we have been fair.  For example, we facilitated the ICTU conference in Dublin Castle by organising the hall and so on to ensure the widest exchange of views and contributions.  We knew many of the themes of the conference related to boycott-disinvestment but we supported ICTU&rsquo;s right to host it and to invite speakers and so on.  I was invited to speak and I outlined my perspective on boycotts and disinvestment in regard to Israel.</P>
        <P>I sent a letter to every Oireachtas Member about the EU-Israel Association Agreement.  There are association agreements with many countries but the same principle of boycott and so on applies.  There were moves to upgrade that EU-Israel agreement but we said there could not be an upgrade because of the stalled political process in the Middle East and future upgrades would have to relate to political progress and resolution of the conflict.  I have yet to detect the political will to resolve this.  The proximity talks were undermined in an incredible fashion, which was difficult to comprehend, when US Vice President Biden visited Israel.  When he went to launch the talks he was undermined by an announcement of the construction of a settlement in east Jerusalem.  The talks, which should have begun much earlier, still have not commenced.  Ultimately, they will lead to direct discussions.  There should be Palestinian recon<Col N="185"/>ciliation but that has stalled for various reasons.  It is a major inhibitor of progress because one needs a unified, coherent Palestinian voice at the talks that ultimately will take place.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Senators Dearey, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in and others referred to the <i>Rachel Corrie</i>.  I have made it clear publicly on the basis of my discussions with the crew members that they are pacifists and committed humanitarians and they indicated they will make it clear to the Israeli authorities that they have no wish for confrontation or conflict.</P>
      
        <P>They will demonstrate that physically on board in terms of their demeanours, dispositions and so on, and in terms of the information they are going to impart to the Israeli authorities.  That is why I have asked the Israeli authorities to avoid any interception in international waters.  Given all that has happened they should allow the flotilla unimpeded into Gaza.  They have said they will not, and want to maintain the blockade, but there is an urgent need for people to calm the tension here.  Nine people have been killed.  My utmost priority is to ensure no one else is injured or killed.</P>
        <P>Many Senators have said this is a watershed in terms of the blockade and as regards the international community and its approach.  I hope it is, in terms of the blockade, although what has occurred is an awful tragedy since nine people are dead, that we know about.  Families are mourning tonight who should not be, as a result of the humanitarian situation.</P>
        <P>Finally, as regards the passports, I made the situation clear two weeks ago in the other House.  I had a week in China, but we have received a report from the Passport Office and from the Garda Commissioner.  I indicated two weeks ago in the D&aacute;il that I would be proposing action to Government that would be appropriate to the issue of the forging of Irish Passports, as regards the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh.  When news came in on Monday, I believed that would be the wrong time to announce that action, in the midst of all that had unfolded that day and on Tuesday.  Any announcement would, frankly, have been lost and I also wanted to await more details and information about last Monday&rsquo;s events.  I am proposing action to Government in relation to that and we will announce this in due course.  I have always made it clear how unacceptable it is and was to forge Irish Passports and place Irish civilians at risk while undermining the integrity of the Irish Passport system.  An appropriate response will emanate in relation to that.</P>
        <P>I hope I have dealt with most of the issues Senators have raised.  I have dealt with Goldstone.  I thank and appreciate the genuine interest of Members of the House.  My final comment in relation to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s assertions is that I do not believe there is any comparison between the Cuban missile crisis and what happened last week.  They are many miles apart in terms of the reality of the situation.  We said on Monday and I repeat tonight that the full story is not out yet.  Very few people have spoken to those who were on the actual ship where people were killed.  The situation has yet to unfold in that regard.  We have had one controlled version, and there was a blanketing of all information on Monday and Tuesday, a jamming of all communication.  My understanding is that the vast majority of cameras and videos on board the ship were confiscated, so it is prudent to hear what those on board have to say in terms of their perspective of what happened.  I am in no doubt that a decision to engage militarily with the flotilla was most ill-conceived and wrong.  It was that decision that led to the death of nine people, and the injury of many more.  In my view, that was a fundamentally wrong decision and it should never have happened.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  I am speaking about youth caf&eacute;s and the way the service is delivered in Galway, in particular, but also right across the country.  There are nearly ten youth caf&eacute;s in Galway and they provide a very useful service in this recessionary time.  Never has there been more of a need to provide drop-in facilities for young people such as youth caf&eacute;s.  They are drop-in facilities, not just youth clubs.</P>
        <P>Youth caf&eacute;s have been tremendously popular.  They work very well in this and other countries.  They are extremely important in Galway in particular.  The key point I want to raise with the Minister of State is that youth caf&eacute;s are put together on a shoestring, very much on an <i>ad hoc</i>  basis and there is an urgent need to regularise the manner in which they are dealt with and protected.  One of the key difficulties is the various funding methodologies.  The latest report features the youth party toolkit as set out by the Department of Health and Children.  It shows that up to &euro;10,000 would be provided for existing youth caf&eacute;s and &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000 for new youth caf&eacute;s up to September 2012.</P>
        <P>The difficulty lies with the fact that most of the money being spent &mdash; currently and in future &mdash; goes largely on providing facilities.  There are still very high rents in this country and many of the existing youth caf&eacute;s are in high-rent buildings.  Given the present recessionary period, obviously much more property is being made available.  The key message for the Minister of State, therefore, is to ensure the facility is prioritised as opposed to the building.  I do not want to see any spread of the situation pertaining in one or two youth caf&eacute;s, where a reasonably expensive building is only open for one or two hours a week, because there is no one to staff it or there are no proper back-up facilities in terms of youth organisations being able to provide them.  There has to be a slightly new focus, therefore, in relation to youth caf&eacute;s, ensuring that buildings are open for the maximum length of time and properly manned.  This is where the investment needs to be targeted.</P>
        <P>There is a case for potentially rationalising existing services, and I know talks are going on between different youth and community bodies in Galway, with a view to providing a facility that might work for a number of different organisations.  Imaginative methodologies must be applied to try to ensure the different Departments which are supplying funding for the youth caf&eacute;s, and the efforts of local authorities, communities etc., are very much tied together.  We need to involve organisations such as Youth Work Ireland and For&oacute;ige heavily in terms of every youth caf&eacute;.  I do not believe there is a case for closing youth caf&eacute;s in recessionary times because they are needed more than ever to ensure proper facilities are provided for young people.  Many other facilities, unfortunately, are closing.</P>
        <P>I want to stress the importance of these facilities for younger people.  We must adopt an all-party approach.  There is major support among all political parties for the provision of these facilities.  We need to think outside the box in these financially difficult times to provide the best possible people-focused service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews.</P><Col N="187"/>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, on 12 April the Minister of State announced details of a dedicated youth caf&eacute; funding scheme of &euro;1.5 million from the dormant accounts fund.  This is the first dedicated youth caf&eacute; funding scheme in Ireland.  The scheme is concerned with the structured promotion and development of new and existing youth caf&eacute;s around the country.  It was launched with two associated publications, Youth Caf&eacute;s in Ireland: A Best Practice Guide and Youth Caf&eacute; Toolkit: How to Set Up and Run a Youth Caf&eacute; in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As the funding scheme is once-off in nature, there is an inevitable focus on capital outlay and initial set-up costs.  However, the criteria set out in the official guidelines for the scheme also focus on the broader issues of long-term sustainability and service planning, to which the Senator referred.  The associated publications mentioned examine, discuss and establish a policy context for a youth caf&eacute; model in Ireland and deal with the issues being raised by the Senator in some detail.  Applications must demonstrate that the proposed youth caf&eacute; would provide a safe and high quality space for young people, based on the guidance set out in the youth caf&eacute; toolkit.  The space must have a clear purpose and applications must demonstrate that maximum usage of the facility will be a priority.</P>
        <P>The youth caf&eacute; model envisaged in the current funding scheme is a multi-agency one; therefore, applications for strand 2 funding must be from consortiums which may comprise statutory, community or voluntary stakeholders.  The scheme is not designed to provide for ongoing staffing costs but instead encourages realignment of existing services for young people to help achieve a more focused delivery of such services.  Priority will be given to applications from consortiums which demonstrate leverage of funding from other resources for finance, staffing or site provision.  This places an emphasis on sustainable and tangible service delivery.</P>
        <P>Funding is available for various project types.  Strand 1 is concerned with improving existing youth caf&eacute;s through small-scale refurbishments.  The maximum amount that can be awarded by each city or county development board, CDB, to applicants is &euro;10,000.  Strand 2 is aimed at new youth caf&eacute;s, for which the maximum amount that can be awarded by each CDB to applicants is &euro;100,000, which encompasses up to &euro;10,000 for start-up costs.</P>
        <P>The six general assessment criteria against which applications will be assessed, as included in the guidelines, and on which all funding applications will be appraised are as follows: evidence of need, which requires evidence of a demonstrable need for a youth caf&eacute; in the area, proof of engagement with young people and details of how funding would be spent; evidence of additionality, which requires applicants to show how the proposed facility would augment and interact with existing youth facilities in their areas, improve the co-ordination of youth services and provide a focal point for youth services in their areas; consistency with Government programmes, which requires applicants to demonstrate an understanding of the concepts and definition of youth caf&eacute;s, as identified in the documents published by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs; capacity of the group or organisation, which requires evidence that all operational aspects have been adequately considered and the consortium members have experience of operating or managing youth-based facilities &mdash; details of service planning and evidence of the particular skills and knowledge base of the consortium are also required; consideration of sustainability, which requires a clear demonstration of how the funding, if awarded, would yield significant results in the form of a viable and sustainable facility &mdash; details of plans to ensure maximum usage of the facility in the medium term and evidence of a plan to meet day-to-day running costs once the facility has been developed and opened are also required; and strength of proposal, under which it is determined whether a proposal meets the general aspirations of the dormant accounts fund initiative and addresses the core issues for development of youth caf&eacute;s, as outlined in the associated documents.</P><Col N="188"/>
        <P>The youth caf&eacute; funding scheme is the first such dedicated scheme in Ireland.  It is concerned with promoting the structured development of new and existing youth caf&eacute;s around the country by giving support to local organisations which are providing youth services.  The criteria for the scheme place a clear focus on both long-term sustainability and service planning.  It will be a highly competitive process and the Minister of State is satisfied that only those proposals which demonstrate clear and sustainable improvements in the services available to young people in their catchment areas will be successful under the programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity for the second time in a number of months to bring before the House the request made by Killavullen Housing Association Limited, Killavullen, County Cork, to provide housing for the elderly in the area through local fund-raising and grant aid from the Department.  When I raised the matter previously, I was advised that the question of further funding was still being examined by the Department and it appeared that resources were rather scarce.  That was not surprising, given the current economic plight of the country and the lack of readily available finance in Departments.  However, I hope a scheme such as the Killavullen project, for which the local community has demonstrated the need and there is full support from the county council, in the development of which the HSE has been involved, for which funding has been raised and planning permission sought and obtained, will get the go-ahead at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>Cork County Council has confirmed the need for such a project in the Killavullen area.  As I have said on previous occasions, a local voluntary group has put in much effort and time and shown much commitment to ensure there is adequate local funding available.  At this stage the blockage appears to be at departmental level and, presumably, it is a question of funding.  However, the clock is ticking and the weeks and months are passing by.  We need to know as soon as possible whether there is a possibility of funding being made available.  Has all of the available funding been allocated by the Department?  It is important that we advise the community properly and channel whatever representations we can to ensure progress is made.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to recognise the validity of the project, the bona fides of the promoters, the excellent work carried out locally, the need for the project and the support of the appropriate statutory agencies and let me know the current thinking on the matter in the Department.  I ask her to give us some hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  While, admittedly, we have had a property boom and there is an excess of property in certain areas, there remains and will always remain a need for community and sheltered housing, the maintenance of village communities and the provision of housing for elderly and vulnerable persons.</P>
        <P>This is the type of project we should be proud to support.  It is a building project that everyone would like to see commence, from a social, an economic and a community point of view.  I ask the Minister of State to use her good offices to impress on all within the Department the urgency attached to giving the green light to this valuable project as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  </P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, as it affords me an opportunity to restate to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the housing needs of persons and families with special needs.  Despite the current funding constraints, we continue to prioritise funding for voluntary and co-operative housing projects across the country.  In fact, it has been a goal <Col N="189"/>to ensure as far as possible that cuts in funding do not affect the delivery of special needs housing by the voluntary sector.  Accordingly, we have provided for an increase in the annual funding provision, from &euro;110 million in the 2009 Estimates to &euro;145 million this year.  This is testament to the proud record of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector in the provision of accommodation for people with special needs and low income families in the past two decades.</P>
        <P>Since the inception of voluntary housing programmes in the 1980s, more than 21,000 homes have been provided for households in need in all areas of the country.  This represents a considerable success story by any measure of social housing delivery and it is my intention to expand substantially on this output in the coming years.</P>
        <P>Under a new social housing reform agenda, the voluntary and co-operative housing programme has been refocused primarily to address the housing needs of individuals and groups with special needs under the capital assistance scheme.  This scheme provides funding of up to 100% of the approved costs of accommodation for older people, homeless people, people with disabilities and other special needs, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence.  Already this year, the Government has announced a programme of 64 new projects that will deliver more than 900 new accommodation units for these groups over the next two years.  The projects were identified for inclusion in the programme following consideration of the value for money bona fides of each proposal, the relative priority afforded to the projects by local authorities and the competing demands across all local authorities.</P>
        <P>This brings me to the project raised by Senator Bradford, namely, a project involving 20 housing units for older people at Killavullen, County Cork.  I wish to make clear that this project has not been refused and it remains under consideration by Cork County Council in the context of the overall pipeline of projects designed to provide new accommodation for households with special needs.  The project was not, however, included in the recent announcement for the 2010 capital assistance scheme programme, primarily because it was not afforded a sufficiently high priority by the county council for its 2010 programme.</P>
        <P>That said, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently indicated to the council that it should continue its appraisal of the project to ensure it is ready to progress under a future call for proposals.  Local authorities are charged with overseeing the delivery of such projects and in particular with ensuring they meet an identified housing need, contribute to sustainable communities objectives and provide value for money for the Exchequer investment.</P>
        <P>I re-emphasise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the voluntary and co-operative housing sector as part of our overall approach to meeting housing need.  It will continue to work closely with local authorities and the sector to ensure it can continue to delivery high quality, sustainable, voluntary housing projects where they are most needed and to those in greatest need.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  This Adjournment matter is self-explanatory and arises from a &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; television programme that was broadcast some weeks ago and to which I referred in the House on the Order of Business the following day.  I reiterate my admiration for and compliments to the programme makers and again note that this programme was yet another fine example of public service broadcasting in the finest tradition of that genre.  The programme dealt with what is becoming an increasingly difficult problem.  While I have focused my request on establishing the nature and extent of the problem and on what efforts are being made to resolve it among the State forests, there is a much wider issue in this regard.  According to the aforementioned programme, it is estimated that approximately 4 million tyres are produced in this country and that the number of worn tyres now available for recycling runs into millions.  I emphasise there are a licensed operators which ensure worn tyres are sent for recycling.  However, rogue operators are operating without local licences.  In some instances, they con people into believing they have licences, collect their worn tyres from various depots and then dump them.  In this instance and for the purposes of this Adjournment debate, they dump them in State forests.</P>
        <P>While State forests make a major contribution to the economy by virtue of their original purpose, they also have widened their mandate in recent decades in that Coillte now is integrated into the wider area of tourism.  It works with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and other tourism and local authorities by providing walkways.  In my native county of Leitrim, Glencar waterfall, which is deemed to be an iconic attraction in the north west, is developing greater and better access with the financial support of Leitrim County Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Coillte.  Consequently, this is not simply an important question on the illegal dumping of worn tyres but also pertains to the adverse impact this is having on the countryside and, in particular, on the image it portrays to visitors to State forests, which in all their glory should not be obliged to contend with such despoiling of the environment.</P>
        <P>I understand from the aforementioned programme that the amount of money required to remove the tyres that have been dumped illegally runs into hundreds of millions of euro, which is quite unacceptable.  Will the Minister of State outline the extent of the problem and how it is being addressed?  How may the various local councils be encouraged to take a more proactive approach to ensure they track down and prosecute these illegal operators?  The irony in all of this is that all tyres are recyclable and, therefore, there should be no problem in this regard.  Consequently, there is an onus on the State agencies, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities to wipe out this insidious activity that is despoiling the countryside.</P>

	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and I thank Senator Mooney for raising this issue.  The environmental management of waste tyres was highlighted in a recent &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme and, at the time, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, expressed his concerns regarding the particular cases highlighted.  He also asked the office of environmental enforcement within the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare an urgent report on the issues arising.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s enforcement regime in the waste sector has been strengthened considerably in recent years in respect of powers, structures and resources.  Significant progress has been made by the relevant statutory agencies in dealing with illegal waste activity.  In particular, since the establishment of the office of environmental enforcement in 2003, enforcement has been better structured through the establishment of a national enforcement network.  The office of environmental enforcement and the enforcement network have greatly raised awareness and brought about better practice and a more co-ordinated and consistent approach to environmental enforcement by the relevant authorities.  The latest statistics from the Environmental Protection Agency confirm a significant level of enforcement, with local authorities alone carrying out in excess of 33,000 waste inspections in 2008.  The Minister is committed to ensuring an adequate enforcement response to illegal waste activity and in this regard has provided continuing support from the environment fund towards enforcement staffing costs.  More than &euro;7.5 million has been utilised to support approximately 120 additional local authority enforcement personnel and a greatly enhanced response on the ground.</P>
        <P>Two ministerial policy directions also have been issued, in May 2005 and July 2008, respectively, providing guidance where illegal deposition is discovered.  The policy direction issued in 2005 sets the standard in terms of the expected response from the regulatory authorities which are obliged to ensure the necessary remedial measures will be taken in order that sites are restored and waste illegally deposited is appropriately disposed of or recovered.  The 2008 direction deals with the use of sanctions to ensure effective actions against those involved in unauthorised waste activities.</P>
        <P>The system in place for dealing with waste tyres has been largely conceived and designed by economic operators in the tyre industry itself on an assurance that it would deliver the required results.  On this basis, two collective compliance schemes, Tyre Recovery Activity Compliance Scheme Limited and Tyre Waste Management Limited operate as approved bodies under the regulations.  While giving these schemes a reasonable chance, the Minister is not prepared to tolerate a system that does not work effectively and is open to abuse.  He has, therefore, asked his Department to engage urgently with tyre industry stakeholders to review the situation, and a meeting in this regard was held on 20 May 2010.  The industry was instructed to revert to the Department by mid-July with a joint working proposal from all stakeholders with actions, targets, key performance indicators and a guarantee that the industry can implement an effective tracking system.  The industry is aware that the Minister will consider introducing a full producer responsibility initiative if the situation does not improve.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the reply, the essence of which is contained in the last two paragraphs.  It is evident from the television programme that the Minister does not accept that the self-regulation introduced is working effectively.  I am glad he has had this meeting.  I seek assurances that he will proceed in the short term if there is not a positive response from the industry, which I do not believe will be the case.  I believe he will have to bring enforcement regulations or legislation into the Houses of the Oireachtas because it has been proven that the self-regulatory scheme is not working.  One of the people involved <Col N="192"/>in the scheme interviewed on the television programme, of whom the Minister will be aware, was a member of the regulation committee and when the chief executive officer of one of the committees was asked a direct question, namely, what was his function, he had to stop the cameras rolling because he could not answer.  I hope the Minister of State will convey this comment to the Minister that he should move urgently and not wait for the industry, which has clearly failed in its obligations, and introduce the necessary legislation.</P>
