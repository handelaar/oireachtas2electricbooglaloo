        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement on whether he will encourage and support RTE to carry the advertising campaign to promote peace and reconciliation funded by the IFI and others and currently playing on UTV, given its value to the mutual understanding of the peoples on the island.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the establishment of an advisory board on the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in the HSE South region and to outline the reason there is no public representative or patient advocate on the board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In recent times the reputation of politics has taken a considerable hit.  People have lost faith in politics and trust in the Government.  When politicians&rsquo; words are not met with actions people lose faith even further.  We saw the latest example of this yesterday when the Taoiseach said there had not been cuts to front-line disability services.  Some time later, hundreds of people marched outside Leinster House and many of us went out to speak to them, the parents and carers of the intellectually disabled and people with special needs.  They attested to the truth of the situation, that their loved ones and they, as families, were experiencing cutbacks in front-line services in respite care and the support services to which they have become accustomed.  Surely the Taoiseach is not saying the families are making up these stories.  This is the direct experience of these families and individuals.  I spoke to the families yesterday, as did many other Senators.  Anyone watching the television reports, reading today&rsquo;s newspapers or meeting the families yesterday would have to be ashamed at the level of cutbacks these families and individuals are experiencing.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a woman, Fiona, who told me about her 48 year old sister who has an intellectual disability.  Maeve cannot live at home and her mental capacity is that of a three year old.  She has no speech but has learned to communicate with her family so they can understand her.  They describe her as a generally happy person, sociable, affectionate and joyful.  I spoke to her mother and her sister who were distraught about the current experience in the care facility where this woman lives.  They spoke about the fact that drugs are being used once again as an alternative to therapies.  Sedatives are being used instead of alternatives because of the cutbacks to staff and the need to manage the facility.  They said it was going back to the Dark Ages, a complete reversal of the kind of care for their loved one they had experienced in recent years.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach may say there are no cutbacks but I have evidence of a facility in Dublin where 120 families will soon have little or no respite service, 80 children aged up to six years will be without occupational therapy, physiotherapy services will be curtailed, a day centre will close and the facility&rsquo;s swimming pool has been closed already.  Two children at the facility have no school place for the coming year and many programmes aimed at developing communications and social skills will be severely curtailed. I refer to the point Senator O&rsquo;Malley made yesterday about administration of the disability sector and the need for the sector to be more efficient.  If there have been failings in the area, of which we still need to see evidence, I put it to Government that because it provided the funding, it has the responsibility to see that funding is used efficiently.</P><P Just="Left">We already know the amount of waste there has been.  This matter is a Government responsibility.  It is not an excuse for cutbacks to front-line services.  I repeat my request of yesterday for the Minister with responsibility for this area to address the Seanad before we finish our work for this term, for him to come into this House and talk about the facts and not the theory he talks about in implementing A Vision for Change.  The reality is that 700 staff have been cut from front-line mental health services in the past year.  That is not implementing A Vision for Change.  I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to come in here and give us facts about what is happening in the disability sector before the end of the term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not disagree with one word Senator Frances Fitzgerald said.  In fairness, I presume the same would be the view of Members on the other side of the House, but this is a time when action needs to be taken.  I want to put my own credibility on the line here.  I have stood here and supported Government policy on the harsh economic measures in terms of the support to the banks, the NAMA model etc.  I have argued for it and supported it.   The Government came to a conclusion on this and I made the point at the time that I preferred it, say, to the Fine Gael point of view, though it also had merit at the time.</P><Col N="275"/>
        <P>Similarly when it came to the harshest of cuts, including cutbacks in pay in the public sector, the area that I often represent, I supported the Government in terms of the Croke Park deal and the need to do that.  Responsible positions have been taken in this House in support of the Government&rsquo;s economic measures.  There also has been strong support by all parties on this side of the House for the Croke Park agreement and cuts in public sector pay and pensions etc.  Everybody bought into it.</P>
        <P>I remind the Leader of that because I ask him to also remind his leadership that there is another leg to that stool.  If we are to put money into the banks and to take money from public servants, and people in the private sector have also suffered a loss in income, we need to balance that by ensuring we represent the caring society which worries about the most vulnerable, which worries about those in need of support and about how we are seen to treat the marginalised and the excluded.  This is an issue that we need to be seen to address and it was never more important than now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is good news this week from the OECD and in terms of the Department of Finance revising its growth forecast from a minus percentage to a plus percentage.  These are good things.  We hope we will not have the jobless recovery about which some prophets of doom are talking.  We need to be clear about this.  There is a good deal of deliberately mischievous comment with people saying: &ldquo;We have growth but where are the jobs?&rdquo;  Every Member who has spent an iota of time examining economic issues recognises there is a lag between employment creation and growth in the economy.  We must ensure though that this happens.  The point that has been raised on this side of the House on numerous times is that we do not see the Government policy which makes the link between those two things.  We want to be reassured about this.  I want to see how this will happen.  I want to see how we are pushing for this to happen.  I want to see proposals from Government such as, for instance, the Fine Gael proposal on creating 100,000 jobs in the green economy.  The Government is working on that in the background.  We should have such proposals.  These are proposals we could all get behind and move forward, but we can only do that in the context of the points that have been raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  We must also be seen to take a stand in favour of the people that we pass legislation to support as in the case of the EPSEN Act and other Acts which support people with special needs of various types.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to take that message back to the Government and to arrange for somebody representing Government to come into this House for a debate on that broad issue, not only on the cuts, but where this sits in all of the broader economic issues we are discussing at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday we heard calls for the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, published recently, to be brought before the House.  I support that call.  People are very fed up about our asylum system.  People within the system have to wait four and five years before their cases are dealt with.  We should not forget that these are often the most vulnerable people in our society.  They have left their homes and come here hoping to start a new life and have found that they have to wait an inordinate amount of time before their cases are dealt with.  People in the wider community are also fed up at the cost of this system to the Irish taxpayer.  If it takes five years for the case of an average asylum seeker to be dealt with, that costs the State approximately &euro;50,000.  Every other European country deals with this process in a much more efficient way.  They can deal with their asylum system in one or two years rather than the four or five years it takes us.  Clearly, it is the system that is at fault here; it is not the fault of an individual.  We need to deal with the issue that is before us.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to bring forward the Bill that has been published and is awaiting introduction to this House to enable us to move on with this process.  We can change the procedures <Col N="276"/>and ensure the system is quickened up and thereby save the State some money and let people get on with their lives.</P>
        <P>I would also like to raise the subject of climate change legislation.  We heard as recently as three weeks ago during my party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; time in this House that the Government expected to publish climate change legislation imminently.  The D&aacute;il is rising today but the Seanad will sit next week and it may be that this legislation will be introduced next week.  I look forward to hearing the comments of the Deputy Leader on that query.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will that legislation deal with the issue of the climate change fund of &euro;100 million that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, agreed at the conference in Copenhagen last December?  At that time the Government agreed to make a voluntary contribution towards mitigating the effect of climate change in developing countries.  Has the Government yet agreed at Cabinet level to release this year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;30 million from that fund?  If so, where will it be allocated?  Will it be spent in our priority countries or will it be allocated to some multilateral agency?  I would like to know.  We are now seven months into this year and we need clarity on this issue.  I note other countries that made similar voluntary commitments have already acted.  I would appreciate comments on this issue from either the Deputy Leader or the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>To respond to Senator Hannigan, there have been meetings with environmental NGOs and Department officials on the progress on the heads of the climate change Bill.  It is hoped it will be published before this House rises in any event.</P>
        <P>On the Senator&rsquo;s second query, the House should debate the wider issue.  The Taoiseach gave a commitment on an allocation of &euro;100 million over three years at the rate of &euro;30 million a year, in regard to climate change measures in developing countries.  The funding allocation method has not been agreed in terms of the Department this will come under, but I believe the House will accept that is a promise worth delivering on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the wider issue concerning disability services in particular, we need to have a wider debate.  I was taken by Senator&rsquo;s Fitzgerald&rsquo;s reference to the fact that sedation is being used as a control measure and as a cost control measure.  I have seen evidence of this on recent visits to psychiatric facilities.  In no way can that be seen to be a <i>bona fide</i> medical approach or a caring approach to these particular issues.  We need to have these issues identified, exposed and eliminated wherever they are seen to emerge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome Nos. 2 and 3 on the Order Paper.  No. 2 is the reference to the consideration of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service of the Governor&rsquo;s report and the report of Messrs Regling and Watson.  That is welcome and I look forward to the deliberations on that.  No. 3 is more important.  This motion seeks our approval of the draft Commission of Investigation (Banking Sector) Order, which I am sure we will do.  I am glad the terms were extended, otherwise the State would have been found guilty of colluding in the cover up in regard to the very serious specific lapses that happened in some of our credit institutions.  I refer in particular to the bed and breakfast arrangement that was in place between two of them, the back to back deposit swaps that took place before AGMs, allowing for the publication of reports to be pumped up and for the propping up of false figures.  That is a very important matter.  I welcome that we are to debate it.  I hope we will have the opportunity in due course to comment further on this.  The Leader might make provision for a suitable debate when the time will come.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader briefly outline the sitting arrangements for next week, the number of days it is proposed we will sit and the proposed legislation with which we will deal?  As the D&aacute;il is <Col N="277"/>rising today, we will not be able to refer any legislation back to it.  It is important we know the Leader&rsquo;s proposals for next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the points made by Senator Fitzgerald.  I call on the Leader to arrange for a full discussion on this matter next week &mdash; we will have time for such a discussion next week &mdash; and for the facts to be given on funding for care, particularly respite care.  We have received correspondence in this regard and every case is genuine.  Families are terrified about the demands that will be placed on them if respite care services are withdrawn or reduced.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley has made the point that we have to examine the allocation to the Brothers of Charily to find out how and where the money is being spent and why front-line services are being reduced.  When I was in the Department of Health and Children, there was a particularly strong link with the Brothers of Charity because it was the adviser to the Government on intellectual disability issues.  Therefore, there was a strong channel of funding to the organisation which has carried out tremendous work.  It operates in County Roscommon.  The association in the country for people with intellectual disabilities has provided funding, in conjunction with the Brothers of Charity, on a voluntary basis in recent years and I am sure it will rise to the occasion in terms of the provision of additional support.  I would like the Minister to come before the House next week to give the full facts, provide all the documentation available on the Brothers of Charity and outline the reason respite care services are the first line of attack.  When I was in the Department of Health and Children, this was a regular occurrence.  Whenever cutbacks were proposed, some officials highlighted the most sensitive areas in the public domain to ensure they and management received more funding.  People were used to leverage this funding from the Department.  I would like to have the issue clarified next week.  Let us have an honest debate to find out if there are six managers in the Brothers of Charity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader if he will take No. 36, motion No. 14 on the Order Paper on the situation in Uganda.  It involves in some circumstances the reintroduction of the death penalty.  No one in this House, no matter how strong his or her opposition to the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitees Bill, would oppose the motion.  I cannot imagine anybody supporting such barbarous measures in African countries which have been strongly condemned by the churches.  As the Leader knows, the original wording of the motion was slightly amended by the Department.  It now approves of the motion, for which there is all-party support.  Because of the emergency situation we have had changes to the Order of Business for a series of days.  I am happy to roll with this and would really be grateful if the Leader introduced the motion, even without debate, as we have had a long debate on these issues and I do not think there would be any dissent.  I am prepared to have it taken without debate because I have been asked by the bishop to send it, as it may help to save lives.  If we could take it today, even without debate, I would be most grateful.</P>
        <P>I ask for a debate on cystic fibrosis services, in the light of the fact that there are further delays in the provision of the promised 34 bed unit in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  We have all listened to and read the eloquent articles by Orla Tinsley, a wonderful and courageous fighter for the rights of people with cystic fibrosis.  She has detailed, without engaging in nasty criticism of any of the staff of the hospital, how she has sometimes had to deal with nurses who have received no specialised training and who may have inadvertently exposed her to health risks and how sufferers, because of their condition, need to be isolated and when they are not, they are exposed to the risk of cross-infection.  I was contacted sometime ago by a wonderful young woman, a distant connection of mine, Yvonne McNulty, and I went to visit her.  The circumstances are wonderful but the risk of infection is very high when a person is unwell.  I understand there are difficulties and that the Government has made what appears to be a very firm and clear promise in this regard.  The current difficulties are the result of Bernard McNamara being in financial difficulties but surely they could be overcome.  The contract appears to be unusual in that the Government or the authorities of the hospital do not propose to pay until the job has been completed.  Surely it should be possible to install a system, whereby there would be a series of payments made as the work progresses.  It should not be beyond the wit of those involved to appoint a project manager to oversee the payments and construction of the unit.  I am sure my friends and colleagues in the House, with some of whom I disagree very strongly on certain issues, in a genuine spirit of concern for people who are unwell will examine the matter and give a constructive view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Leyden&rsquo;s concerns about the manner in which money is being spent in respite care and disability services.  I am sure the Leader would welcome a proposal that the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy John Moloney, come before the House to outline the discussions he has had and which are ongoing.  I have every confidence in him that those in receipt of respite care services will not, despite media and other commentary in recent days, find themselves without such valuable and important services.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business regarding No. 36, motion No. 17 on the Order Paper.  I raised the matter briefly yesterday and thank all the leaders of the political groupings who have agreed to the following all-party motion:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Islamic Republic of Iran to spare the life of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani and requests the Minister for Foreign Affairs to convey to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran the opposition of the Irish people to all forms of capital punishment.</P><Col N="279"/>
        <P FLI="0">I propose that the motion be included in the Order of Business and taken without debate.  I am sure the Leader will accede to my request because it is an agreed all-party motion and, according to newspaper reports, there is a danger that the woman concerned could be executed before we return to the House next week.  This is an important dimension to my request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, at the risk of losing public support, on many occasions both he and other Members on this side of the House supported the need for financial retrenchment and corrections to the public finances.  Fine Gael went so far as providing an alternative budget.  However, a line has to be drawn in the sand.  There are certain front-line services for people with intellectual disabilities, the elderly and people with cystic fibrosis which are at risk but which ought not to be.  We on this side of the House have no problem in accepting that administration costs have to be cut back and the challenge we present to the Government is that if there are unnecessary administration costs, they should be eliminated.  It will not be opposed from this side of the House in so doing.</P>
        <P>I draw to the attention of the Leader a very serious matter dealt with in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today.  In an objective study commissioned by it the National Cancer Registry shows that the costs involved when one has cancer, a nightmare for every person and family, are proving too much for families.  The incomes and mortgage repayments of families with a cancer sufferer are at risk.  For example, visits to the general practitioner and consultant can cost up to &euro;700 a year.  Cancer patients spend &euro;360 on travel, while 63% seek social welfare benefits.  Women with various cancers spend in the region of &euro;460 on wigs etc.  These costs are prohibitive.</P>
      
        <P>It is a further nightmare for families at a time when they are already suffering.  We need to debate this report and the cost and psychological impact of cancer.  The public finances can be rectified but people in these circumstances must be prioritised.  If we are able to put money into the banks, we should also be able to support these people during the worst times of their lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Several issues pertaining to asylum seekers and how the State deals with them could be effectively discussed in this House.  I accept we will not get an opportunity to do so before the recess but I ask the Leader to consider a debate on this subject at an early stage after we return.  Good stories can be told about immigrants who have been accepted by communities and made positive contributions to the quality of life by sharing their own traditions.  Senator Hannigan was correct to raise this issue.  I and I am sure other Senators are regularly asked to investigate cases.  Some of these are heart breaking cases involving the possible deportation of people who have partners and children in this country.</P>
        <P>I am aware that in recessionary times issues such as this are not at the top of the priority list but we are diminished as a people if we do not realise anybody who is marginalised needs urgent attention.  When we make representations on these cases, we generally receive clinical replies.  We have seen deportations about which we have felt deeply and we often wonder afterwards what happened to the individuals concerned in their own societies.  I would fear for the safety of individuals in some cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our people have a history of going abroad and meeting challenges and difficulties but at the end of the day they were well received and contributed to their new countries.  Given that we celebrate their history today, is it not right that we should go the extra mile for those who have come here with the best intentions to seek refuge so that they are not left waiting on the long finger or in limbo?  They are in a cruel and difficult situation and they are worthy of being put on our priority list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I draw the attention of the House to the leading editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> today on Seanad reform.  It is interesting that, while calls have been made to abolish <Col N="280"/>the Seanad, certain people have recently changed their minds on the need for it.  Yesterday&rsquo;s debate showed how the Seanad can earn its keep.  I was very impressed with that debate, particularly when I compared it to the proceedings in the D&aacute;il.  Concerns were expressed clearly by a number of Senators and, while it was not healthy that the debate continued until 1 a.m., this may simply mean we need to improve how we organise our business.  If the Seanad is to survive, it is up to us to earn our keep.  Yesterday was a good example of the first steps we can take in that direction.</P>
        <P>Nos. 2 and 3 on the Order Paper pertain to banking.  The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service met this morning to discuss the proposed commission of investigation into the banking crisis.  It is welcome that a time limit will be imposed on the commission&rsquo;s work.  More importantly, it will not solely focus on the past but will also give advice on ensuring we do not run into the same difficulties in future.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Yesterday I referred to the three month long summer holidays taken by secondary schools in Ireland, which compare to 16 days in Japan.  Somebody asked me whether I really expect students and teachers to work over the summer months but my attention has since been drawn to a novel way of teaching languages practised in Britain and elsewhere.  It is called the Michel Thomas system and I was very impressed when I was told about it by somebody who has just completed a course.  Students take no notes and are told they should not memorise anything.  This helps pupils to relax and they seem to be able to form complex sentences in languages they have never previously heard within a few days.  German, French and, perhaps, Japanese and Chinese language teaching would bring huge benefits to the country because jobs are waiting to be filled by people who are able to speak these languages.  We are at the bottom of the pile in Europe for languages but this system would enable us to learn in a fun and exciting environment.  We could have pleasure even while making great achievements.  Rather than requiring students to attend school more often, we could bring them both joy and success.  Let us find a way of bringing this to the attention of our education authorities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second Senator Mooney&rsquo;s proposal on motion No. 17, which would convey our Government&rsquo;s concern about the death sentence imposed on Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani.  She has been sentenced to death by stoning.  No right thinking and civilised nation could condone such a barbaric practice in this day and age.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Why has the Leader not arranged for the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for disability to come before the House this week?  Yesterday the Taoiseach stated that no cuts would be made to front-line disability services.  He made other comments which are unparliamentary but these say more about him than about the people to whom he referred.  The Members opposite made eloquent speeches on Tuesday but words are not enough.  The people we met yesterday and every day are suffering from cuts which hurt the old, the poor and the disabled.  They still hurt 23 years later.  Do not forget that.  Yesterday I stated that respite care is a necessity rather than a luxury but it is being taken away from these people.  Carers are worried and living in fear because they cannot plan.  That is not a good environment in which to live.  Cuts have been made to front-line services.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on the remarks made by Senator O&rsquo;Malley yesterday.  I researched her claims and found that while there are indeed six Brothers of Charity service organisations in the country, one of which is in Cork, to the best of my knowledge none of the CEOs of these organisations receives a salary equivalent to that of the Taoiseach.  If I am wrong I will admit my error in the House.  However, the issue is not the salary of the CEOs; it is the cuts to funding and the reduction of services as a result of Government policy.</P><Col N="281"/>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on banking and the potential job cuts in banks.  The catastrophe in the banking sector was not the fault of ordinary bank employees but of the people above them.  Senior managers and executives were the decision makers and those people continue to call the tunes while refusing to lend money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw attention to the annual report on the meeting of D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g in March 2010.  I compliment D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g on producing the report so quickly.  It has set an example for other organisations which sometimes produce annual reports one or two years late.</P>
        <P>The objectives of D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g are to provide a place where children who are representative of young people in Ireland can raise and debate issues of concern to them, act as a tool for children&rsquo;s concerns to be fed into the development of public policy and provide a model for children&rsquo;s participation which can be developed at local level with links with the D&aacute;il.  D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g lobbied hard for the introduction of a free cervical cancer vaccination scheme.  The young people involved are to be complimented on the effectiveness of their lobbying in securing free cervical cancer screening.  As the Parliament of older people, we have an obligation to listen to the young people in question.</P>
        <P>The themes for this year&rsquo;s D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g conference were equality of access to education and mental health.  How many times have I spoken about the mental health of all the people of this island, especially young people?  We have a responsibility to listen to the common sense views expressed by children.</P>
        <P>One of the key aspects of equality of access to education is examination pressure.  D&aacute;il na &Oacute;g recommends that the Department of Education and Skills extend the leaving certificate cycle to three years and reduce the junior certificate cycle to two years.  Achieving this objective would not be a big deal.  D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g is our customer and we should listen to it.</P>
        <P>A further key recommendation made by D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g under the heading of mental health is that Departments establish and fund an education group to educate second and fifth year students through schools and youth clubs about depression and suicide.</P>

	<P>I formally propose non-Government motion No. 14 on anti-gay legislation in African states to which Senator Norris referred.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I also draw to the Leader&rsquo;s attention No. 35, a report by the Sub-committee on the Role of the Oireachtas in European Affairs which was laid before the House yesterday.  Senator Mooney spoke about the report at a meeting of the sub-committee which examines the role of the Oireachtas, specifically the Seanad, in European affairs and has proposed a number of additional roles.  I ask that the House discuss the report early in the new term.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer commented on cuts in respite care services, while other colleagues referred to potential inefficiencies in the sector, an issue on which the Government placed considerable emphasis yesterday.  The Comptroller and Auditor General published a report on these services four years ago, in which he raised such concerns and made a number of recommendations.  Why is the Government only now acknowledging that there may be difficulties?  Why was action not taken on foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report to avoid days such as yesterday?</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to reductions in public service salaries.  One of the reasons for these measures was to avoid reductions in front-line services.  I could not get over the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement yesterday in which he denied that there were cuts in services.  I have seen with my own eyes the effect such cuts are having on families.  What exactly does the Taoiseach believe people were marching against yesterday?  What fears prompted them to march, if not ongoing reductions in front-line services?  The families in question do not need the Taoiseach to add to their worry and terror by denying that cuts are taking place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Quinn&rsquo;s view that we must keep reform of the Seanad on the agenda.  The excellent debate yesterday on the civil partnership legislation was a prime example of the importance of the House.  Unlike in the Lower House, many Members of the Seanad made very good contributions to the debate.  We must consider Seanad reform in that light and keep it on the agenda in the autumn.  I propose that we have a debate on Seanad reform once each month.  Without the Seanad, political debate would be much poorer.  The Lower House is much more functional than the Seanad and gets on with its work, whereas Senators take the opportunity to tease out various issues.</P>
        <P>In the light of our changing vision of the future, we must examine the issue of reform of second level education.  We should review the curriculum to identify how best we can introduce technological subjects.  While these subjects are not ideal for every student, we must find a means of providing opportunities for those with technological ability to acquire new skills.  Often technology subjects are not on the timetable.  We need a debate on the reform of second level education in the context of the smart economy, the knowledge economy and skills base.  We must not forget, however, that arts subjects are important and will continue to be of service to the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Recent debates in the House, especially the debate yesterday, have highlighted the unique role of the second Chamber.  Notwithstanding differing views on various issues, the House has always debated issues in an honest and open manner and respect has always been shown for everyone&rsquo;s point of view.  There is a strong case to be made for promoting such debate and highlighting the fact that the diversity of opinion in the Upper House is not mirrored in the other House.  This is one of the strong points of the Seanad.</P><Col N="283"/>
        <P>Much has been said recently about cuts in various services.  While we can all argue that specific areas should not be targeted for cutbacks, if yesterday&rsquo;s march against cuts in the disability sector tells us anything, it is that the sector is doing its best with the limited resources available to it.  In recent years carers, the unsung heroes of society, have saved the State a fortune.  If proof were needed, we saw yesterday how people of all political persuasions and none went outside to listen to the views expressed by those who marched.  The marchers were staunch and loyal and we must support them.  It is not good enough to engage in an economic exercise on an area such as disability services, while failing to address the shameful risk-taking that occurred in the banking sector and resulted in the near collapse of the economy.  Not one single individual has served one day in jail.  However, last week we had a double murder in this capital city and all of a sudden the two people murdered were known to the Garda, a phrase I find objectionable.  The people who brought the country to the brink of economic collapse are known to everyone, including the Garda.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Further to what Senator McCarthy said, today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> reports that the Minister for Finance has promised action against banks that have provided misleading information to NAMA.  He said that those who knowingly gave false information to NAMA could face criminal prosecution.  Section 7(2) of the National Asset Management Agency Act states: &ldquo;A person who intentionally, recklessly or through gross negligence provides false or inaccurate information to NAMA commits an offence.&rdquo;  That is quite clear.  The clause is wider and does not just cover false information knowingly provided, but also inaccurate information given recklessly or through gross negligence.  It now appears that NAMA&rsquo;s October 2009 business plan was based on this inaccurate information that was supplied by the leaders of the banks themselves.  We need to know whether that was reckless or through gross negligence and, if so, we need to know when there will be prosecutions.  People are being jailed for not paying their television licence fees and yet these bankers, who have knowingly given this false information, have, as Senator McCarthy and others said, brought the economy to its knees.  We can see the consequences of that in the cuts in respite care, education and pensions.  We know the people behind it and we need to see prosecutions soon.</P>

	<P>It would be wrong to have the Order of Business without noting the positive results in the economy and the expectation of a 1% growth, the highest in the EU this year.  As a clear indication that Government policies are working, we are the first and the fastest-growing of the EU countries.  With that in mind, is it not time we started to speak positively of the benefits and opportunities that would present themselves and create an environment in which people have more confidence in our economy, thus creating jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to consider seriously what was discussed yesterday by the people who were out on Kildare Street and Molesworth Street.  Senator Hanafin just came in full of bluster and excitement about the 1% growth.  However, 450,000 people are unemployed.  The unsung heroes, the carers, are providing for people who are less well off than we are.  Respite is a necessity and not a luxury.  For people to continue to care, they must have respite.  People&rsquo;s mental and physical health will suffer if they do not continue to get respite.  Respite is for the carer and not for the person with disability.  It is crucial that respite is maintained and provided at even greater levels than it is now.  Regarding respite for the elderly in Westmeath, I attended a meeting with representatives of the HSE this week and was told by the regional manager that Westmeath had been allocated two respite beds for the south Westmeath area and two respite beds for the Mullingar area.  That is an inadequate allocation to care for all the people who need respite.  That is not to mention cuts have been made in St. Mary&rsquo;s in Mullingar where the number of beds is being reduced from 190 to 50, Lougloe House <Col N="284"/>in Athlone is being closed and the services in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar have been consistently downgraded.</P>

	<P>It is true.  Some 40 beds were taken out of the system in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.  There is a moratorium on nursing appointments, which is why those 40 beds have closed.  It is not about blaming the managers, including the Brothers of Charity and the chief executive officers.  It is about cuts and taking front-line services out of the system.

	<P>I second Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s amendment regarding anti-gay legislation in some African states.  I have a very special request for the Leader prior to the summer recess.  I know this will be supported by many on this side of the House and perhaps by many on the Government side of the House.  We should insist that the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, comes to this House prior to the summer recess.  I spoke to him personally twice yesterday.  He assured me that respite would not be cut in Galway.  The Leader should consider this carefully.  I then spoke to people who met representatives of the HSE in Galway yesterday.  Ability West in Galway has been told its services will be cut by &euro;1 million.  We also know that funding to the Brothers of Charity has also been cut.  They were told as recently as yesterday that they will lose &euro;4 million in services.  When put together we have total contradiction and confusion.  Only the Minister of State can clarify it and direct the truth.  The line must be from the Minister of State to the HSE to the Brothers of Charity or Ability West.  It must go down that line.  The Minister of State should ask the HSE in Galway to do as follows.  Whatever it cuts, it must not cut respite for people with disabilities.  We all saw those with disability on the street outside Leinster House yesterday.  As Senator McFadden said, respite is for the carer.  It is to help the able help the disabled.  If we burn out the able person, we are finished.  What are we going to do?  I have never seen such terrible destitution.  We are stringing out our own voiceless people without getting help.  The Taoiseach does not have a clue.  I received a text this morning.  He is totally out of touch.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I support what Senator Healy Eames just said.  She hit the nail on the head in talking about putting strain on our best people and stressing them out.  Yesterday I spoke on the issue of carers.  A number of issues are now coming together to increase the pressure on carers.  First there is the drive to get more efficient use of our hospitals &mdash; getting patients in and out quickly.  That means there will be more pressure on carers at the convalescence stage.  Where there is a shortage of nursing home beds, priority will be given to people coming out of hospital, thus reducing the available supports to carers in that context.  There is also the shortage of respite.  There is the coming together of a number of pressures on carers to which we really must pay close attention.  We should pay attention, in particular, to the fact that issues get challenging as time goes on for carers and one has people who are getting progressively older themselves caring for people who are progressively more challenged in their lives.  I want to emphasise this issue.  We will have a debate about it next week but it is something we cannot afford to lose sight of.  As I stated yesterday, the carers are in a sense the most efficient part of our health service and they are the ones on whom we are spending least resources and of whom we are thinking the least.  It is wrong that we should take advantage of their generosity and commitment to their families and loved ones, and think we can somehow then park them to the side and not worry about their needs.  I hope we will put them front and centre next week and that it will be reflected in our budgetary arrangements.</P>

The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is coming back to the House next week.  I spoke with the Minister last night on the portfolio for health and she stated she would make herself available.  I will be pursuing this.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, calling in all the various heads to give a definitive report of where the spending is taking place and for further clarification on matters that are of considerable interest, that is, front-line services.</P>
        <P>Everyone in this House fully supports what the carers are doing, respite care and everyone who is in need of the services carers provide.  As I stated, there are 161,000 carers and they are giving a service that is second to none.  We must do everything we possibly can to ensure anything that can be done, particularly on funding, is forthcoming and that the wastage in spending must stop immediately.

When anyone is unfortunate enough to be affected by cancer it should be mandatory that the State pay for all of the costs.

I hope that colleagues will bring this to the Minister&rsquo;s attention here next week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Quinn, Ormonde, McCarthy and Coffey raised the issue of Seanad reform and called for a debate on banking.  We had a debate on banking with the Minister for Finance here on Tuesday evening and late into the night, and later today we will have a motion on banking.  We will discuss banking issues on two of the three sitting days this week.  I have no difficulty in allocating time occasionally as it is requested to keep us updated on the challenges the Government is facing regarding the banking failures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Quinn and Ormonde raised the reform of our education system and the teaching of languages in the three month break that students get.  I certainly agree with Senator Quinn on the joy learning languages could bring to students.  We all have seen in our Gaeltacht areas in the summer time the joy that students get from going to learn the Irish language.  This is a worthwhile proposal.  We will have a debate on the future of education after the summer break and we certainly can bring this to the Minister&rsquo;s attention in that debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 23, line 39, after &ldquo;specify.&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Any recognised religious denomination such as the Unitarian Church which celebrates the marriage of same sex couples may if the incumbent of such of their church buildings is agreeable have it regarded automatically as a proper and appropriate place for the registration of the civil partnership.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister back to the House after a late sitting last night.  I am sure I speak for all of us when I say we greatly appreciate that he is taking this serious matter himself and is not delegating it to a junior Minister in his Department because that signifies the importance of the debate.</P>
        <P>I will not spend a long time pushing amendments because we have discussed most of the substantive issues.  This issue relates to freedom of religion, freedom of conscience and respect for religious identity.  In the United kingdom, the Unitarian Church, in particular, has had its position recognised.  The reason I tabled this amendment is that I have been lobbied by prominent members of the Unitarian Church, including Chris Hudson, who was the leading light of the peace train which ran between Dublin and Northern Ireland.  He is now the pastor of the Unitarian Church in Belfast, although a Dubliner and a very prominent trade unionist.  He believes, and I agree with him, that it would be appropriate for a church, such as the Unitarian Church, which performs religious marriages of same sex-couples, to conduct these marriages.  The only such ceremony I attended was the marriage of a very old friend of mine to his partner in that church on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  It would seem extraordinary not to recognise the right of a church to conduct these marriages and to be regarded as an appropriate place to do so.</P>
        <P>I say this although I believe completely in the separation of church and state.  It would be far better if we had the French system where those, like myself, of a religious disposition could receive the blessing of the church in what is regarded as a sacrament but that the church kept its hands clean of officiating at what is, in fact, very largely a distribution of property and assets and the legal arrangements surrounding that.</P>
        <P>It is inappropriate for the church to be involved in the registration process but if it happens in one church or in a series of churches, it should happen in all churches and in all circumstances <Col N="290"/>where these institutions are recognised.  I look forward with great interest to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We support this amendment.  We had a substantial debate last night on some of the very significant issues in the Bill and on some of the omissions from it, which we believe are important.  We do not intend to duplicate any of that debate today.  This amendment could be read along with amendment No. 18 which seeks to include the Humanist Association of Ireland in the Civil Registration Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would support that also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Norris was correct in what he said about the French system.  There is much to be said for it.  I have always understood the separation of church and state as being about protecting the zones of the state and the church to carry on their business and not to be interfered with.  There is much to be said for the French system where there are separate ceremonies for church and state. However, I disagree with Senator Norris's characterisation of the state marriage as being largely about property and such arrangements.  The state has an interest in marriage as an institution and it is very much linked with children, encouraging people to bond in lifelong unions and to found families.  That is not just about property and so on.  It would be wrong to think the only people interested in the common good in that sense are religious and church bodies.  The state has a particular view.  As an entity, it acts on behalf of the community and represents its shared vision of the importance of marriage.  If there was no such thing as church marriage, although marriage originated as a church ceremony before the State put rules around it, there would be a need for the State to have a vision of marriage as being for the good of society.</P>
        
        <P>On the amendment, I am inclined to think it would be better to avoid any possible misunderstanding that there is a furthering of an undue interconnection between church and State in this zone.</P>
        <P>It is not inappropriate to refer to a particular church.  We did this in the Charities Bill with regard to mass cards, when we provided that those selling them could only do so in conjunction with a recognised religious authority which was identified as a Catholic religious authority.  To avoid prosecution, the onus was placed on retailers to show that they had such a connection.  Such a reference can be legitimate, although during that debate I received correspondence from people who felt there were dangers for churches in bringing in the State as a regulator of what churches might or might not do.  Of course, in the context of the sale of mass cards, the regulation was introduced to avoid a practice that was being abused and facilitating a fraud upon members of the public who thought they were getting a certain thing when, in fact, they were getting something very different.  The common good was served by legislation intervening at that point.</P>
        <P>I am not sure if the singling out of the Unitarian Church is best practice, from a drafting point of view.  I also have concerns about the use of the word &ldquo;incumbent&rdquo;.  Who is an incumbent in this instance?  Is it the person who holds tenure or has immediate responsibility for a church building or parish?  If this were to be included in the legislation, could some renegade priest within the Catholic Church or the Church of Ireland claim to be the incumbent of a parish and allow the use of his or her church building for same-sex civil partnerships?  Might the church then seek to exercise its prerogative to restore the <i>status quo ante</i>  and the so-called renegade invoke this legislation in support of what he or she was doing?</P><Col N="291"/>
        <P>While the amendment appeals to certain liberal instincts because it recognises the right of people to provide, according to their ideas and values, for the recognition of same-sex partnerships or otherwise, it is, possibly, problematic, for the reasons I have given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 16 inserts a detailed provision relating to the registration of civil partnership in the Civil Registration Act 2004.  The inserted section 59E makes provision for places and times for civil partnership registration.  Subsection (1) specifies that if the place is not the office of the registrar, it must, save in limited circumstances of an exception on the grounds of ill health, be approved by the HSE by reference to matters which the Minister for Social Protection may specify.</P>
        <P>The effect of the amendment would be to give automatic recognition as a place where civil partnership registration may take place to the churches of certain denominations which celebrate the marriages of same-sex couples.  Any organisation may, if it so wishes, apply under the inserted section 59E(1) for the approval by the HSE of its venues as places for the registration of civil partnerships.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With respect to the analogous provisions for civil marriage, the Minister for Health and Children published guidelines in 2007 relating to civil marriage.  These expressly provide that &ldquo;the venue must have no recent or continuing connection with any religion, religious practice or religious persuasion which would be incompatible with the use of the venue for the solemnisation of civil marriages&rdquo;.  I expect similar guidelines to be made with respect to civil partnership registration venues in order that any venue with a recent or continuing connection with a religion or denomination would be unlikely to be approved.</P>
        <P>There is also a major difficulty with the amendment&rsquo;s reference to marriages of same-sex couples.  Since same-sex marriage is not legally recognised in Ireland, this renders the amendment unworkable.</P>
        <P>I would also like to add a clarification.  Approval of a place, whether automatically or by the HSE, is separate and distinct from allowing a celebrant of the given denomination to carry out civil partnership registration.  The Bill provides that only a registrar may register a civil partnership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s response is, as usual, enlightening in its way.  He says the use of the word &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; invalidates the entire amendment.  I had a discussion earlier today with my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who pointed out to me that in amendment No. 15 the word &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; was used.  I assume that will render that amendment invalid, if the Minister&rsquo;s argument is to be sustained.</P>
        <P>With regard to renegade clergy, I am not sure if such loaded language is appropriate, but I leave it to the House to decide.  I have been contacted by a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church, perhaps not one who meets with the entire approval of the established church, but let us put that to one side.  He experienced extreme difficulty in having correspondence even acknowledged by the registrar at the time.  As a public representative, I had to make an appointment to see the registrar and, more or less, smuggle the bishop into the meeting.</P>
        <P>The Unitarian Church is referred to specifically in the amendment because I was so lobbied.  We could parse and analyse the amendment to death.  I do not expect it to be accepted and anticipated that this would be the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>I am interested in hearing the views of those who express themselves as strong devot&eacute;es of freedom of conscience, free voting and all the rest.  It seems there is a conflict.  It might cause difficulties if these so-called renegade priests, bishops, incumbents, rectors, vicars or pastors <Col N="292"/>decided to celebrate marriages for people normally pushed firmly outside the fold.  If they wished to use their premises, I would have thought that was a classic example of people voting freely, having a conscience and acting on it.  Perhaps I take a more expansive view of freedom of conscience and free voting than some of my colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is with the use of the word &mdash; the possessive adjective &mdash; &ldquo;their&rdquo;.  Is it their premises?  If it was, one would have to take the view that they were entitled to act accordingly.  The State, of course, would still have its view on whether it was causing more problems than it was solving.  When we come to discuss freedom of conscience in the context of the provision of services, it will be clear that it is the rights of people who have ownership of and responsibility for certain premises which are at stake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I think I can solve the Senator&rsquo;s grammatical problem.  It is governed by the major clause at the beginning of the sentence; therefore, it is the property of the church.</P>

	<P>I am speaking to the amendment.  I will come in again on a further amendment Senator Mullen has put forward.  However, we are wasting time.  The people I know who want to celebrate a special day as same-sex couples would never in their wildest dreams be going to a church hall or anywhere like it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment is a specific one which endeavours to give an automatic recognition to a place of a particular religion.  I made the point in regard to marriages and same-sex couples.  As I said previously, section 59E makes clear that this is a positive request from a church to be recognised as such.  I made the point earlier that if the guidelines in regard to marriage venues as per the Civil Registration Act 2004 and the regulations made thereunder by the Minister for Health and Children, and now the Minister for Social Protection, <Col N="293"/>are to be replicated and the same terms as relate to marriages are to be replicated in regard to civil partnerships, then the venue must have no recent or continuing connection with any religion, religious practice or religious persuasion which would be incompatible with the use of the venue for the solemnisation of civil marriages.  If they are to extend the logic and practice as per those guidelines, it would be unlikely that these churches would be approved as a venue unless it came under the very limited circumstances.</P>
        <P>Generally in this regard, there has been some misunderstanding about churches being forced to use their property against their wishes.  Section 59 clearly indicates that the only property that can be used other than the registrar&rsquo;s office, if an application is made to the HSE&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister direct us to that section of the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is at page 23.  Section 59E states: &ldquo;A civil partnership may be registered only at a place and time chosen by the parties to the civil partnership with the agreement of the registrar and, if the place chosen is not the office of a registrar [the other place] shall be determined by the Executive by reference to the matters that the Minister may specify.&rdquo;  I have excluded one of the limited exceptions in reading out that section.  In other words, this has to happen on application by the organisation, whether it is a church or otherwise, to have its premises used.  Therefore, there is no forcing of any church to have its property used against its wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not want to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Similarly, there have been suggestions that celebrants of marriages under religion would be forced to be part of the civil registration process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be intolerable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No celebrant empowered to conduct a marriage ceremony existing under the Civil Registration Act may register a civil partnership unless he or she is a registrar in the employment of the HSE.  There is absolutely no possibility that any celebrant who is not a registrar could be required against his or her wishes to register a civil partnership.  I can put it no clearer than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the amendment being pressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make a final comment.  I believe the Minister is slightly over-simplifying certain matters but I will leave that aside.  Why would it be incompatible and what would the nature of the incompatibility be?  If the congregation, the officiating priest and the parties to the marriage were all in agreement, in what sense could it be incompatible?  Is there something about the nature of a church, the Unitarian Church in particular or the fact this man was willing in conscience to celebrate the union that makes it incompatible?  I see no incompatibility whatever &mdash; I just do not understand it.</P>
        <P>As I understand it and although I think it regrettable, in a religious service of marriage the partners, having been married, usually retire to the vestry to sign the register, and that is part of the legal confirmation of the existence of the marriage.  Therefore, it does exist in that sense and the church, as the building, is held to be perfectly compatible.  I do not see any reason that, for example, a Unitarian minister in the St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green church should not apply to be regarded as a registrar for this purpose.  The Minister is indicating this would not be granted.  I believe that if this did happen, the Unitarian Church would probably take the matter to court. <Col N="294"/> I would certainly support it in this and I believe many people of right mind, as I would say, would also support it, including some quite surprising people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek clarification from the Minister.  He has just said, and also said yesterday, that there would be no circumstances in which a church premises would be required by law to conduct a civil partnership ceremony, nor would any religious official.  As one who has been thinking closely about this issue and has tabled certain amendments, I would never have made that claim or expressed that concern.  Strangely, I do not know of anyone else who has.  It would be very useful if the Minister could indicate the sources of the particular claim that the legislation might act in this way.  I am sure there are such sources and it would be no harm if they were put on the record.  Who exactly has been claiming that for the purposes of a civil partnership registration ceremony, in particular, sacred spaces, so to speak, might be required to be used?  I would be interested to know who has been making that claim; it was certainly not myself.</P>

        <P Just="Left">With regard to Senator Norris&rsquo;s point, the change in regard to the venues for registration of civil marriages was done a number of years ago and it was opened up to allow other premises to be used.  Those regulations were framed in such a way that there would be a certain aura around the ceremony of civil marriage so that it would not be in the centre circle of a football stadium, for example.  It would be on reasonably honourable premises fit for the celebration of a marriage.</P>
        <P>If we pass this legislation, civil partnership registrations will become part of this process and the legislation states it must be in the office of the registrar, unless it is under the suggested exception of a place approved by the HSE.  It is then up to the HSE to determine what is a suitable venue.  It is not my area of responsibility and I will not have to make a decision on it.  I expect the executive to replicate the guidelines for civil marriages in the case of civil partnerships, where it is indicated there should be no recent or continuing connection with any religion or religious practice.  There may be a different view on the issue.  I expect anybody who queries the matter will have the right to appeal the decision to a higher authority.</P>

The interpretation is pretty wide and it would be rather a pity if it did not include a willing church that wished to be included.  I expect that they will apply.

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris has opened up an interesting point, although it may be peripheral to the amendment.  If same-sex partners want a religious ceremony, I do not see why they should not have it.  We have indicated it is a matter for each church.  I agree with Senator Norris in making the point on the registration of a ceremony that if it were possible to include somebody in a church who wanted to be part of a ceremony, it could be registered on the day.  We should have had more debate on this, although it may be peripheral to the amendment.  There is a bigger and broader issue to be considered.</P>
        <P>It is wrong to assume people who are entering a gay partnership would not want to go to a church hall.  The only issue involved is that it should be a matter for the owners of the hall.  I am certain there are some churches and religious bodies who would want to accommodate that particular type of ceremony.  It would be wrong to assume that once the legislation is enacted, some people would not want to go down that road.  It is a big assumption on our part.</P>

        <P LI="4">(<i>c</i>) The registrar has given notice in writing to his or her Superintendent Registrar of the said objection and its grounds within one week of appointment as registrar or at least 1 month prior to any refusal or failure to act in reliance on the said objection;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Unless the Superintendent Registrar, having taken all reasonable steps in the management, control and administration of the Civil Registration Service to ensure that the registrar&rsquo;s objection is respected and accommodated, concludes that it is necessary in all the circumstances of a given case for the registrar to register a marriage or civil partnership or give a marriage or civil partnership registration form to one of the parties to an intended marriage or civil partnership in order to avoid undue delay in the provision of the said registration services.</P>
        <P LI="3">(9C) A registrar who, with reasonable cause, fails or refuses to register a marriage or civil partnership or to give a marriage or civil partnership registration form shall not be taken to discriminate against a person for the purposes of the Equal Status Act 2000.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We come to an issue that is of major concern to many people of goodwill.  This is one of three amendments which I have proposed, the purpose of which is to protect freedom of conscience in various issues.  This amendment concerns the role of a civil registrar.  The law currently provides that a registrar who, without reasonable cause, fails or refuses to provide a marriage registration form or conduct a civil marriage commits an offence.  We are aware that in Northern Ireland a person who would commit such an offence might lose their job but in this jurisdiction, under the law as it stands, people are subject to the full rigours of the law and prosecution.</P>
        <P>Following on from that logic, this legislation seeks to amend the Civil Registration Act 2004 by providing for similar outcomes for a registrar who, without reasonable cause, fails or refuses to give a civil partnership registration form to one of the parties to an intended civil partnership in respect of which he or she has received a notification under section 59B(1)(<i>a</i>) or a copy of an exemption order under section 59B(2).  In such cases, that person commits an offence.</P>
        <P>I am starting from the perspective that there is a balance of rights to be struck in this case.  The State has the right to implement a model of civil partnership if that is the will of the majority in the Oireachtas, and at the behest of the Government such a model of civil partnership is created and goes through the Oireachtas.  I disagree with substantial parts of this legislation, which perpetuates new forms of injustice and discrimination.  Even if I am wrong in that, as a democrat I am quite happy to accept the decision of the Oireachtas as to what our laws on marriage, family and same-sex partnership will be, subject to the Constitution.</P>
        <P>A completely separate issue arises because in accepting the majority decision on this &mdash; at least the majority of the Oireachtas &mdash; a separate question arises for people who in good conscience and not just for religious reasons have difficulties with civil partnership for same-sex couples.  There are people who have a profound religious objection to public State recognition of same-sex partnerships, and this does not make them homophobic, as has been claimed in some quarters.  In many cases they are people with no problem with people&rsquo;s right to a private life and who would have supported the decriminalisation of homosexual acts between men in 1993.</P>
        <P>Such people may subscribe to a different moral view and would not like to be implicated in any way in the facilitation of a contrary moral position repugnant to their own.  The question is whether the State has a duty or right to impose this view.  I will confine my comments to the position of a State official as separate arguments will be made on the discrete amendments <Col N="297"/>proposed regarding religious or community institutions with a different ethos, or individuals involved in the provision of services.  Does the State have the right to oblige such an official to do his or her job in all circumstances, regardless of how repugnant to his or her conscience carrying out his or her job might prove to be?  If this matter was the subject of an opinion poll &mdash; the trouble with such polls is that the outcome always depends on how one frames the question &mdash; most people would agree that there were circumstances in which provision should be made for individual conscience, even in the case of those employed by the State.  In the context of the fraught issue of abortion, it would be interesting to examine the laws that obtain in other countries in order to consider whether and how people in the employ of the State might be facilitated in some way in circumstances where they were asked to do something that ran contrary to their own deep personal sense of right and wrong, justice, what constituted good conduct, etc.  It is important to bear this in mind.</P>
        <P>Much of the debate in the past 24 to 36 hours has tended to denigrate the expression of conscience.  I was particularly disappointed by the comments made by Senator Harris who seems to be of the opinion that conscientious objection emanates from some form of twisted religious tradition, according to which people do not think for themselves, hold no moral views of their own, are infantilised by a greater religious authority that tells them what to think and do and are not, in their own right, moral agents who possess a well thought out approach to life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to confine his comments to the amendment.  We have a long list of speakers and many other amendments with which we must deal.  I ask all Members to be brief and concise in their contributions in order that we might have a to and fro debate during which we can deal with the substance of the matter.  I ask the Senator for his co-operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will return to the issue of the balance that must be struck.  The reason I asked the Minister about who had been claiming that religious officials or premises might be required under this legislation for the carrying out of civil partnership ceremonies was that I had not heard that argument being made by any creditable or reputable sources.  As far as I am aware, none of the official church bodies which have commented on this matter raised this issue, although I am open to correction in that regard.  However, if they did raise it, the comments gained little traction in the public debate.  Just as last evening the Minister asked me to clarify my intentions, I have been asking him to clarify for the avoidance of doubt that he is not choosing to answer questions he has not been asked to avoid replying to those questions which have been posed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should ask a direct question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated, the issue that arises relates to the balance which must be struck between the State&rsquo;s right to get the job done in the context of implementing a model of civil partnership and the need to recognise that people may sometimes have a conscientious objection in respect of the matter under discussion.  The manner in which I have approached this has been to take the existing legislation which makes provision for registrars who, without reasonable cause, fail in certain ways.  It is this failure which provides the circumstances in which a registrar may commit an offence.  In amendment No. 15 I provide a definition of what constitutes reasonable cause.</P>
        <P>In reply to any possible objections from the Minister or others to the effect that there is already in place legislation which caters for the civil registration of marriages and provides that it is an offence for a civil registrar to fail to comply, I am defining reasonable cause in such a way that it may apply not only to a person who has a conscientious objection in the context of <Col N="298"/>a civil partnership but also to those who may harbour such objections in general as a result of their particular beliefs about marriage and its importance to society.  The reason I have framed the amendment in this way is it is important to stress that it is not just for religious reasons, <i>per se</i>, that many have strong feelings about the importance of marriage to society and, therefore, concerns about facilitating marriages, in the context of divorce, or relationships, in the context of civil partnership.</P>
        <P>It is in the context of a person&rsquo;s intellectually arrived at sense of the common good in many cases that he or she might harbour a conscientious objection.  I am reserving my position on whether I would harbour such an objection in that situation.  It does not necessarily follow that because a person might be a practising Catholic, Muslim or member of the Church of Ireland he or she would have a problem, <i>per se</i>, with the provisions of the legislation.  It is the job of the House to legislate prospectively.  Senator Feeney stated gay couples would not want to visit Ely Place and the Minister has stated no representations have been made to him to date by any of the bodies representing public officials.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I hope Senator Norris is not obliged to pay an admission fee when he visits it.  The least those who are responsible for it could do is recognise the Senator&rsquo;s noble antecedents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>

	<P>Our job is to legislate prospectively for what might happen in the future.  It is also our job to legislate for the tiny minority who might not dare to express their views to either their trade unions or representative bodies or who might have a difficulty in expressing these views in the light of the overwhelming media consensus on this issue.</P>
        <P>What is interesting about liberalism and facilitating freedom of conscience is that, in some ways, the smaller the group involved the greater the care that we must take not to trample on individuals who might possess an alternative point of view.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The word &ldquo;concise&rdquo; is appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sometimes necessary to go into the detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to proceed in a concise manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot argue against the need to be concise.</P>
        <P>The issue relates to the balance which needs to be struck.  The amendment proposes to strike that balance by defining what should constitute reasonable cause.  The first requirement is that the refusal or failure to act should be based on a conscientious objection to the registration of the marriage or civil partnership and that such an objection must be grounded in a sincerely held religious or ethical belief.  That is the first test they must satisfy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second test a registrar must satisfy is that his or her objection cannot be based on any of a range of discriminatory grounds provided for in the Equal Status Act.  These grounds include discriminating on grounds of race or membership of the Traveller community.  A registrar can harbour a conscientious objection based on grounds relating to marital status or sexual orientation because there are legitimate and fundamental differences between people&rsquo;s viewpoints on these issues.  If ours is to be a genuinely pluralist society, we must take account of this fact.  The third hurdle the conscientious objector will have to meet is that he or she will have to give &ldquo;notice in writing to his or her Superintendent Registrar of the said objection and its grounds within one week of [his or her] appointment as registrar or at least 1 month prior to any refusal or failure to act in reliance on the said objection&rdquo;.  In addition, such a person cannot avail of the conscientious objection &ldquo;Unless the Superintendent Registrar, having taken all reasonable steps ... to ensure that the registrar&rsquo;s objection is respected and accommodated, concludes&rdquo; it is not necessary &ldquo;in all the circumstances of a given case for the registrar&rdquo; to carry out the job anyway.  In other words, the objector will not be facilitated if that would lead to &ldquo;undue delay in the provision of the said registration services&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The last part of amendment No. 15 ensures not only that an objector will not be reached by the criminal law under the 2004 Act but also that a person in such circumstances, having been facilitated by the superintendent registrar, will not be reached by the provisions of the Equal Status Act 2000 either.  This part of the amendment has been included for the sake of completeness.</P>
        <P>This amendment proposes to put in place a set of hurdles.  This provision will be confined to circumstances in which the person can be facilitated without causing undue delay, in which the person has flagged his or her objection in due time, in which the objection is based on &ldquo;a <Col N="300"/>sincerely held religious or ethical belief&rdquo;, and in which that position is not based on any of a range of prohibited grounds of discrimination.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that we make this change.  Yesterday, Senator Dan Boyle pooh-poohed the concept of conscience.  At the core of this proposal is an understanding of the value to any civilised society of respect for conscience.  Senator Boyle quoted from &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; the line &ldquo;Thus conscience does make cowards of us all.&rdquo;  It has been a long time since I heard in this House a quote so taken out of context.

We become cowards when we realise what the possible outcomes of what we do may be.  That is why Senator Boyle&rsquo;s quotation is highly relevant, albeit unintentionally.

At the same time she claimed, without any sense of irony or contradiction that &ldquo;tolerance is about [allowing others] to make choices&rdquo; with which one might not agree.  There has been a lack of refined thinking in this forum about the meaning of conscience and its precise limitations.  The Chair will be delighted to hear I am withholding my response to Senator Harris&rsquo;s regrettable comments until the debate on a later amendment.  Instead, I will put on the record the contents of a letter I received from two people who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Senator has done this most unscrupulously.  I would like to know whether he has permission to name these people and to quote from their letter.  Even if he has such permission, it is outside the tradition of this House and the rulings of the Chair for people to be named in this fashion.</P>

	<P>I would be grateful if their names were removed from the record.  However, I propose to put on the record the contents of their letter, in which their concerns are expressed.  That is what I am paid to do as a legislator.  The letter continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">The right of conscientious objection is a matter for each individual in a matter which he considers serious enough to exercise his conscience.  An example is a conscientious objection to the killing of animals in blood sports but not to their killing in abattoirs, without any inconsistency to his general moral position.  The Minister&rsquo;s contention that a registrar might use such a conscientious objection clause to discriminate on the basis of colour, fat or thin, young or old is insulting to a registrar&rsquo;s sense of moral proportion.  This attitude would trivialise same sex unions and regard them as matters of little moral concern.</P>

	<P>It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">With regard to the punishment proposed to registrars [How is that not relevant?] for refusing in conscience to carry out same sex unions we consider this to be totally against the right of conscience particularly as same sex unions involve not trivial considerations of conscience but a very serious one.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I think that is relevant.  The letter continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">A specific provision could be included in the bill supporting the right of conscience objection on the part of registrars specifically and only in respect of same sex unions.  We would also like to protect the rights of religious organisations.</P>

	<P>Just a moment, please.  The Chair is speaking.  Senator Mullen has spoken for in excess of 23 minutes.  This is a debating forum.  I have consistently asked him to try to be concise in his contributions.  He rightly said that as there is no time limit on Committee Stage, I cannot curtail his speaking time.

	<P>This is a debating chamber.  Senator Mullen, you finally went through the amendment, which is what a Member is asked to do.  I now ask you to desist, out of consideration for other Members.  This is not the only opportunity you will have to speak on the amendment.  It is in the interests of everybody that the opinions of others are heard also.  Our responsibility is to allow debate, which means we should hear more than one voice.  I ask you to wrap up and give the next speaker, Senator Doherty, an opportunity to make his contribution.</P>

	<P>Conscience is about standing up for what one believes in.  The Chair will be glad to hear that I will conclude shortly, but before I do I will mention why it is so necessary for us to discuss this issue in detail.  The reason is that there have been problems in other jurisdictions.  I will not mention New Jersey, but in the United Kingdom, for example, Catholic adoption agencies have been forced to close because they would not accept same-sex couples as prospective adoptive parents.  The diocese of San Francisco was forced to alter its pension scheme to recognise the partners of employees.</P>
        <P>There is another problem in that the Minister has sought to claim there would be many undesirable and unintended consequences if one were to make the slightest provision for the conscience of a State official.  I have been critical of him because he has not been willing to meet critics of the Bill outside this forum.  We could have ironed out this problem by showing just how possible it was to write narrow amendments that would not give comfort to bigots, wife-beaters and so on.  For example, the Minister stated a court clerk might refuse to issue divorce orders because of a religious belief.  He said a fundamentalist Christian garda might refuse to arrest a person who had breached a safety order on the basis that a husband was entitled to chastise his wife.  He said a judge might refuse to register a power of attorney in favour of a person&rsquo;s civil partner.  In his most Islamophobic moment he said a Muslim &mdash; or a Mormon &mdash; accident and emergency doctor might refuse to treat a person for alcohol poisoning.  He said a social welfare official might refuse to pay carer&rsquo;s allowance to a person&rsquo;s civil partner and that a probate officer might refuse to issue a grant of administration to a deceased person&rsquo;s civil partner.  Of course, these are the lines people wrote for the Minister, the convenient rhetorical points which take no account of legal possibilities to arrive at something much more nuanced.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with Senator Mullen speaking on the amendment for the rest of the day, regardless of how difficult it is to listen to the words coming from his mouth.  The amendment goes to the heart of the legislation.  The Senator acted the same way yesterday and will continue in the same way today, with support from others, nitpicking and turning the legislation on its head.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I stated my party and I supported the Bill because of our commitment to equality.  The Bill does not go far enough, but if this amendment were to be accepted, the incremental advances we have achieved in the legislation would be rolled back.  We are being asked to carve out an exception for those civil registrars who do not believe in the principle of non-discrimination so far as gays and lesbians are concerned.  This would defeat the entire purpose of anti-discrimination laws.  The amendment is worded in such a way as to avoid a precedent being set.  It would not allow those who have not come to terms with the increasing diversity of Irish society to refuse to serve mixed race couples.  Clearly, this is being done for the sake of expediency because there is no logic to the argument that one form of conscientious objection is wrong and another is not, nor is it the case, as Senator Mullen has argued, that there is universal agreement on the issue.  Let us not forget that only last year a judge in the state of Louisiana refused to marry an inter-racial couple.  No doubt there are still those who believe that Protestants and Catholics should not marry.  There are many in the Six Counties who particularly hold that view.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect to Senator Mullen, I said I would have no problem listening to him speak on this amendment for the rest of day and I did not interrupt him.  It is a reality that people still hold a strong view based on the religious beliefs that Protestants and Catholics should not marry.  Many of those who hold that view are in the Six Counties.  I ask Members to imagine the reaction of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; or Senator Walsh if registrars in the Six Counties were given the right to refuse to carry out ceremonies in such cases.  We would lambaste that type of discrimination and it is right that we would do so, but that type of discrimination and what is being proposed here are two sides of the same coin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment&rsquo;s proposers have evoked the Constitution&rsquo;s guarantees of freedoms &mdash; freedom of conscience and free exercise of religion, but the Bill as proposed would do nothing to limit those freedoms.  They are, a letter in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>notes, freedoms granted to the citizen.  A civil registrar acting in the course of his or her duties is acting on behalf of the State.  Registrars remain free to discriminate, if they must, in their personal lives but nothing in the Constitution entitles them to subject a person who comes to them, seeking a service of this State, to differential treatment based on their own personal morality.  As the amendment would undermine the limited degree of equality provided by this Bill, my party and I will oppose it.</P><Col N="309"/>
        <P>Senator Mullen mentioned a list of issues which the Minister gave as examples if we were to apply the conscientious clause across the board.  I agree with the Minister in this regard.  I will examine how this would apply if we were to expand it to members of the garda&iacute; without talking account of workers in the health service, Muslims or mixed race marriages.  I will give the example of a member of the garda&iacute; who was to investigate abuse in a gay relationship and who refused to investigate it because of his or her principled stance on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Doherty has put the matter extremely well.  He has gone right to the heart of the matter.  A registrar acts on behalf of the State, on behalf of the people, and he or she must implement the law.  Once the law is passed, that must happen.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen made me feel young again.  I thought I was in a kindergarten being instructed laboriously by an inexperienced teacher.  I found his analysis of Shakespeare wrong-headed but intriguing.  I would have referred rather to Dickens.  Uriah Heep comes to my mind immediately.</P>

	<P>The Senator is not very humble, that is for sure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Moving on to the principal points I wish to make, I endorse 100% what Senator Doherty said with great dignity and, unlike myself, never having interrupted, although he was churlishly interrupted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I understand it, no single registrar in this State has made any formal objection to this legislation.  Therefore, Senator Mullen, having colonised my feelings and having interpreted Shakespeare&rsquo;s mind, now represents the registrars as well.  There seems to be a slight touch of megalomania.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to speak to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking to the amendment.  I am talking about the fact that no registrar and no trade union has raised this matter.  Therefore, it seems to be unrealistic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the Senator on one point.  It would not be at all appropriate for a registrar in these circumstances to go to jail.  There are a large number of matters on which it is inappropriate for people to go to jail.  I deplore the building of extra jails and I believe the number of them should be reduced.  I submitted a proposal to the effect that it is idiotic to put women &mdash; or anyone for that matter, but I was thinking of the case of a person who did not pay a television licence &mdash; in jail and the taxpayer then had to pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make this point, and  I am coming to it, but I accept the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s ruling, of course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not mind if it is not relevant.  I am enjoying the Senator.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="310"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be wrong to penalise the taxpayer by having to pay for the jailing of a registrar, if this were true, who did not abide by this legislation.  If a registrar refuses to do this by his or her stated intention of refusing to implement the law, he or she has automatically ruled himself or herself out.</P>
        <P>Another point is that the Senator used a nasty way to make a smear, and I did not like it.  I do not at all find it appropriate that the celebration of either a marriage or a civil union should be compared, as Senator Mullen has done, to an abortion.  I respectfully ask him to withdraw that phrase immediately from the record of the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tests that he gave were sincerity of belief.  I have no idea how Senator Mullen or anyone charged with operating these tests would know whether someone&rsquo;s belief is sincerely held.  It seems to be an absurd and hypothetical matter.</P>

	<P>The very same people insisted on the inclusion in equality legislation of an exemption for the churches so that teachers could potentially be fired.  There is no difficulty with the firing of teachers simply because they are gay, but, on the other hand, we cannot ensure a registrar fulfils the job for which he or she was paid.</P>

	<P>I would like, as Senator Norris has done, to highlight the importance of the fact that no trade union has sought an opt-out clause.  If trade unions are not seeking an opt-out clause and they represent the majority of public sector workers, we should not be even talking about an opt-out clause.  The Acting Chairman was not in the Chair at the time but I got confused as to what amendment I was speaking to a few minutes ago and I thought I was speaking to this amendment when I explained I am a nominee of the labour panel, as is Senator Hanafin.  We are well aware of the workings of the trade unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the respect trade unions attach to the area of equality.  I will go further and say I am well aware because I have been contacted by members of trade unions who have asked me to speak on this amendment and to say that if they wanted an opt-out clause, they would have gone through the proper channels and lobbied the Minister for appropriate amendments.  They have not done do.  I repeat they represent the majority of public sector workers in this country.</P>
      
        <P>The opt-out clause is not emanating from workers, rather it is emanating from a small minority of Independent Senators in this Chamber.  I heard Independent Senator Mullen on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; a number of mornings ago.  When Pat Kenny put it to him that he could do nothing to bring down the Bill he agreed, but he threw in a lovely remark with a laugh in his tone when he said, &ldquo;But we can delay it&rdquo;.  I am sad to be part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The current equality legislation, which we have spoken about often enough in this House, I am glad to say has stood the test of time.  There is no evidence to say that a pub, bar or hotel has been disadvantaged in any way by treating all its customers with the same level of respect and dignity.  I ask the Senators who have opposing views to the majority of Senators to bear that respect in mind and exercise a little of it.</P>

It is helpful that Senator Mullen spoke at length to this amendment because I found the more he spoke and grasped different arguments and straws to support his argument it so obviously became threadbare.  It is hard to know what is the purpose of the exercise.  I am trying to examine the basis of why he and other Senators tabled this amendment.  It boils down to a hostility towards gay people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I said that because I want to know what is so distasteful about a civil partnership registration that it can give rise to a crisis of conscience.  It is one thing for our conscience to guide our behaviour but it is another matter when we seek to impose our extreme views on others.  That is what is at the heart of this.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen is a lawyer and I will quote the law to him.  There is a case in the United Kingdom, Islington Borough Council <i>v.</i> Ladele:</P>
        <P LI="1">The claimant, a registrar of births, marriages and deaths, was required by the respondent council to conduct civil partnerships between persons of the same sex in accordance with the Civil Partnership Act 2004.  She refused on the ground that such unions were contrary to her Christian beliefs, and she was subjected to a disciplinary hearing on the ground that her refusal was contrary to the council&rsquo;s equality and diversity policy.  She made a claim to an employment tribunal that she had been discriminated against, directly and indirectly, on the ground of her religion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The position of the court and the logic adopted there is instructive in this matter.  She lost her case.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal held:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">[T]hat the view that the requirement that all registrars perform civil partnership functions was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim and that the council was entitled to adopt as a legitimate objective an unambiguous commitment to the non-discriminatory provisions of services by all staff and it followed that they were entitled to require all registrars to perform the full range of services.  The tribunal held that the claimant could not pick and choose what duties she would perform depending on whether they accorded with her religious views.  At least where her personal stance involved discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation which was inconsistent with the council&rsquo;s non-discriminatory objectives, accordingly the council&rsquo;s refusal to accommodate the claimant&rsquo;s religious belief did not involve indirect discrimination.  The tribunal held that the freedom to manifest religious beliefs under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as scheduled to the Human Rights Act, did not apply where it involved discriminating on groups Parliament had provided were unlawful, such as the right of same sex partners to have their partnerships recognised by law.</P><Col N="314"/>
        <P FLI="0">That is jurisprudence which is equally applicable in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen has undermined his own case.  He said what is at issue is that there is a right to pass legalisation which is necessary &ldquo;To get the job done&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Parliament is deciding that it is appropriate to have legislation to acknowledge, recognise and have a system of registration of civil partnership.  It is a legitimate objective.  The question is whether the means to achieve that objective are reasonable and proportionate.  That is the decision we are making and in the debate to date we have considered it is legitimate and proportionate to have the means to achieve the objective that people who are in the public employ are obliged to register civil partnership unions.  That is the objective and the means to achieve it.  It is appropriate that the Bill makes provisions to ensure that it is done.  On principle and law the Senator is wrong and I urge that the House reject the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My party and I have a fundamental objection to this amendment and Senator Alex White put our objections very forcefully yesterday in his Second Stage speech.  We believe the so-called freedom of conscience clause amounts to a rather obvious attempt to undermine the purpose of the Bill.  Senator McDonald correctly described it as dressed up bigotry.  It is a fig leaf to cover what would otherwise be blatant prejudice.  Other speakers have made the point that it would be a mandate to discriminate under the guise of so-called genuinely held religious or ethical beliefs.  Senator Doherty outlined some of the scenarios that might arise if we allowed this precedent to come into effect.  Another example that springs to mind is of State officials refusing to register children born to cohabiting couples.  The sort of law contemplated in the amendment would be appropriate in a theocracy but not in a republic which holds the separation of church and state to be a fundamental principle.  I am glad that the Minister is setting his face against the amendment.  Most of use agree that we should leave our views of religion at the door when we legislate.</P>
        <P>The registrars have not requested this amendment.  Their ears must be burning when they hear others purporting to speak for them.  I am reminded of the apocryphal story that de Valera looked into his heart to know what others were thinking.  It is all very well to look into one&rsquo;s heart to know what registrars may be thinking but it also belittles and demeans them.  Registrars are impeccable public servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and there has been no indication that they are seeking this sort of opt-out clause.  As Senator Regan has pointed out, there is no issue.</P>
        <P>In regard to the technical import of the amendment and what it purports to amend, Part 7 of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which deals with marriage, allows registered solemnisers from different churches to solemnise marriages.  The Bill before us sets out a different means of registering civil partnerships through a new Part 7A to be inserted by section 16 and new sections 59A to 59I.  These rules are rather different from those pertaining to the registration of marriage in that only a registrar may register a civil partnership.  There is no question of persons other than public registrars employed by the HSE being involved.  Under section 59E, the venue would have to be agreed by the registrar if it is other than his or her office.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators have spoken about criminalisation of registrars but section 22 simply adds a provision to section 69 of the 2004 Act, which is the general section providing for <Col N="315"/>offences.  The 2004 Act already provides that it is an offence for a registrar to delete or alter information contained in a register or index contrary to the Act or to refuse or fail to register a birth, still birth, marriage or death without reasonable cause.  The Bill simply expands this category of offences to include omissions or failures to register civil partnerships.  It is entirely appropriate that we would see these sorts of offence and penalties, which are standard for minor offences, set out in section 70 in respect of public officials who are privy to all sorts of sensitive information on individuals who seek to register births, marriages and civil partnerships.  No one objected to those offences being included in the 2004 Act and there can be no valid objection to the extension of these offences and penalties to include civil partnerships.</P>
        <P>Section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 already provides opt-outs for religious run schools and hospitals.  Many of us strenuously object to these opt-outs because they provide a mandate to discriminate against persons who offend an institution&rsquo;s ethos.  This principle is wrong and we certainly should not extend it in any way.  Catholic run, State funded schools already impose an obligation on teachers to teach Catholic religious doctrine.  This should no longer prevail in a secular republic but it is an argument for another day.</P>
        <P>This amendment is an attempt to undermine and destabilise the legislation dressed up in the language of freedom of conscience.  We should look forward to celebrating the first civil partnership ceremonies conducted by professional registrars in the employment of the State.  These red herrings should not be discussed because they simply are not an issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I completely agree with Senator Bacik.  The amendment raises a number of questions, one of which is the motivation behind it.  Having listened at length to certain Senators over the past 24 hours, it is clear from the explanation for this amendment that a different agenda is being pursued.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on the strength of his argument in regard to public servants.  This is not an issue for church or canon law.  These are public servants who are employed by the State.  They are required to uphold and implement the law and they can have no excuse for not doing so.  I am in complete agreement with the Minister and he needs to face down the critics.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment states: &ldquo;The registrar&rsquo;s refusal or failure to act is based on a conscientious objection to the registration of the marriage or civil partnership grounded in a sincerely held religious or ethical belief&rdquo;.  I ask how one can prove that an ethical belief is sincerely held.  I have come across many people who claimed to hold sincere held beliefs against homosexuality of same-sex couples.  They may regard their beliefs as sincerely held but others would simply regard them as homophobia.  While I do not think any registrar is of that ilk, this amendment would put into law the potential to discriminate.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Mullen&rsquo;s argument that the legislation perpetuates new forms of injustice and discrimination.  I have not received a single submission from the more than 100 registrars employed in this country.  The Minister has stated that he has not received correspondence.  I am not sure whether any Member has received correspondence from a registrar on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clearly, some Senators are looking into their own hearts and seeing things that are not there.  I cannot accept that the amendment is being put forward for any purpose other than to wreck this Bill or to diminish the rights it would afford to same-sex couples.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I totally object to this amendment.  It is badly worded, stating: &ldquo;A registrar who, without reasonable cause, fails or refuses to give a civil partnership registration <Col N="316"/>form to one of the parties to an intended civil partnership ... commits an offence&rdquo;, whereas &ldquo;A registrar who, with reasonable cause, fails or refuses to register a marriage or civil partnership or to give a marriage or civil partnership registration form shall not be taken to discriminate against a person for the purposes of the Equal Status Act 2000.&rdquo;  It attempts to make an exemption under the 2000 Act in respect of civil partnership ceremonies but, as I stated yesterday, that is nothing but dressed up bigotry.</P>
        <P>I also stated yesterday that we would create a moral hazard were we to allow officials to pick and choose what they want to do.  We would run into chaos.  Many people in this country have heartfelt views on Travellers, ageism or even women.  They are entitled to these views but they should keep them in their own minds.  The process of acting on such thoughts is called discrimination.  The State and its Legislature do not allow that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Acting Chairman allows me to continue, it will become clear that this matter is closely related to the amendment.  I will contrast the debate in the Houses of Parliament in Britain which was held within the past six months with the debate in this House.  During the debate in the Britain the former head of the judiciary in England and Wales, Lord Mackay, stated equality laws should not force people to provide goods and services in a way that conflicted with their conscience.  Tabling an amendment to the Equality Bill which he subsequently withdrew before a vote could be taken, he argued that current laws should be more flexible to accommodate differing points of view.  He cited the example of printers, both <Col N="317"/>from the point of view of same-sex printers being forced to print matter alien to their views and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What is a same-sex printer?  I am confused.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>He also noted that the British Government&rsquo;s argument on the law did not provide sufficient flexibility for conscience.  The contrast between the debate in the Britain and the views expressed by Senators who disagree with the proposal before us is clear because those arguing against Lord Mackay&rsquo;s amendment agreed that greater flexibility was needed to accommodate conscience.</P>
        <P>I direct the following remarks to the Minister.  The Minister sponsoring the UK legislation, Baroness Thornton, suggested employers could take practical measures to respect the private views of their staff.  She cited specifically the example of a registrar &mdash; this is pertinent to this debate &mdash; stating that &ldquo;if an individual registrar does not want to conduct civil partnership ceremonies because of their religious beliefs, a local authority could arrange for a different registrar to conduct the ceremony if there is one available.&rdquo;  Senator Regan referred to the Ladelle case which was also referred to in the debate in the House of Lords when a Lord stated the relevant local authority was not prepared to work in the manner described by Baroness Thornton.  This matter should be addressed in the context of labour relations.</P>
        <P>While we have been challenged on this matter, we have had the benefit of a meeting with the Minister and his officials, at which we examined this issue.  We can see both sides of the argument and do not want people who have prejudiced views to be in a position to use the veil of conscience to engage in discriminatory actions against people who are gay or, for that matter, any minorities.  We will discuss later an amendment we have tabled proposing a conscience clause in relation to religious ethos and on which we take a different view from the view we hold in this case.  We were reinforced in our belief by the unreasonable attitude taken by a group of people outside the Houses last week who were criticised from all sides.  Its intolerant approach, whether directed at Members of the House or minorities, was unacceptable and I have no truck with it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose briefly to discuss one further interesting example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be relevant to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very relevant.  Senator Regan referred to developing jurisprudence on the neighbouring island in respect of the Ladelle case and its Employment Appeals Tribunal.  A very interesting case arose in which a person who had strong beliefs on climate change took serious issue with the chief executive of his company and lost his job as a consequence.  When the Employment Appeals Tribunal found against him, he took an appeal to the courts which ruled that, as a result of his genuine beliefs on climate change, the plaintiff should be afforded the same protection as that afforded to religious belief in British law.  Christian groups have objected to the ruling and I do not make a case for it.  I am merely highlighting the developing views on this matter which needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>To clarify our position, we believe there are conflicting priorities between freedom of conscience and the absolute entitlement not to be discriminated against.  As a consequence, we did not table the amendment and while we will not support it, we will not oppose it because the issue needs to be addressed in a manner that gives reassurance and protection to people of conscience, regardless of whether they provide individual services or work for the State.  We will oppose the criminalisation of such persons through the sanctions included in the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am discussing the issue of discrimination.  The subtext of the amendment appears to be a lack of respect.  I am a practising Catholic.  While the God in whom I believe does not discriminate, the church of which I am a member does.  If we allow freedom of conscience on this issue, will we allow publicans to ignore equality legislation and bar all Travellers from their premises or will we extend it to encompass marriages between black people, Asians and Caucasians?  Senator Doherty was right.  If this happened in Belfast or Derry there would a revolution down here and we would be almost unanimous in giving out.  Republicanism is about equality.  I support the Minister in what he is doing and I heard what he said earlier.  How many civil registrars have objected to divorce and then performed marriages involving divorcees?  As with Senator Hannigan, I have not heard one complaint from a registrar.  The opposite is the case.  This amendment questions the public servant who does a very good job.  It is about creating exemptions and is about discrimination.  I hope we stand firm and do not allow it.  The final paragraph of the amendment states: &ldquo;(9C) A registrar who, with reasonable cause, fails or refuses to register a marriage or civil partnership or to give a marriage or civil partnership registration form shall not be taken to discriminate&rdquo;.  What is it if not discrimination?</P>

	<P>Debates such as this allow people to pick and choose and make their arguments one after another.  Lord Mackay may sound like a very innocent Member of the British House of Lords, a doddery old man etc.  I just checked his voting record there.  He has been violently and completely anti-gay rights all the time in the British House of Lords.  Let us not speak from the point of view of being in favour of gay rights and then use examples of <Col N="319"/>people who are bitterly opposed to gay rights, which is where Lord Mackay of Clashfern is coming from.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen raised the issue of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  It is important to consider some of the other articles, including Article 16, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.  They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.</P>

        <P>I wish to confirm for the House the position of the trade union movement on the matter.  I sat in Government Buildings during many negotiations on national partnership agreements when this issue was put forward and governments were urged by the trade union movement, employers and other groups to move towards having civil partnership.  It subsequently became part of the programme for Government.  There has been no objection from trade union members about this issue in any way cutting across them.  The view of the trade union movement is completely supportive.  It might feel the Bill might have gone further, but it supports the Minister in what he is doing.</P>

	<P Just="Left">People regularly vote against proposals for all sorts of reasons.  They might be bitterly opposed to each other.  My interpretation is that people were opposed to the idea of civil partnership and found this particular one.  The proposed amendment allows registrars to have a conscientious objection not just to civil partnerships, but also to marriage.  In that regard alone it undermines the entire case put by previous speakers in its favour.  It means we could go back now and say they may not take that particular point of view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have a long history of conscientious objection in this country.  I have dealt with the issue myself.  I made passing reference last night to the teaching of religion in schools.  Very often during the appointments procedure a prospective teacher will be asked if he or she objects to teaching religion in order that he or she is sewn into that particular commitment.  Alternatively they might not be asked, but it is part of the school programme although not part of the national programme.  People might genuinely lapse or evolve, whichever one prefers, to atheism or agnosticism and find themselves in a position with which they are uncomfortable and might <Col N="320"/>have a conscientious objection to the teaching of religion.  In these cases people tend to take a practical view that it is part of what happens in the school and needs to be taught.</P>
        <P>I was a primary school principal and whereas I would not have subscribed to the religious knowledge, I would have insisted as school principal that as we were there <i>in loco parentis</i> all children went through the programme and knew their stuff as well as anybody would expect them to do.  I did not find that in any way cynical or ironic.  It is part of a job.  One gets in, does it, gets on with it and moves on.  It is no big deal.  We should recognise that every day hundreds of teachers teach a religious education programme to which they would be fundamentally opposed, to which they do not subscribe or in which they do not participate.  However, they do it because the parents and school management would like it to be done.  The teachers take the view that they are paid to do a job and should get on and do it.  It is mathematics now and religious education next; get on and do it, if that is the way it is.  People might not like that and people like to think it comes from the heart in all cases; it does not.  It does in some cases and it does not in others.</P>
        <P>In Irish history we have dealt with this before.  I will make a particular reference to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and its founder.  I want to make particular reference to the Catholic Church.  At one stage Senator Mullen worked with an eminent cardinal and Archbishop of Dublin, who found himself in difficulty at times.  His way of dealing with it, as he described to the entire world, was by establishing a mental reservation.  He could do what he wanted without committing himself to what he was doing.  It was a mental reservation.  This has been done by the Catholic Church; it does not seem to cause a problem.  I found it problematic.  I say to my friends coming from the Catholic background that they might advise any registrars they know to have a difficulty that they can use that little device.  It works and exists, I understand.  Theology and Canon Law support it.  The Pope in Rome does not have a difficulty with it.  Who am I to give out about it?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us explain to them how we should do it and perhaps Senator Mullen might explain in more detail how it works when he gets to reply later.</P>
        <P>I recommend that good friends on the other side should look at the situation of their party&rsquo;s eminent founder, Eamon de Valera, who found himself in a somewhat awkward position in 1927.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a few exceptions to that.  Eamon de Valera was not my man.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should direct his comments through the Chair and keep them relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1927 he found himself faced with taking an oath of allegiance to the Crown which caused him some concerns.  However, he knew if he did not take it he could not get in the door to establish the privilege our friends mentioned earlier.  I am explaining this to my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues as a device they could also use.  They could say:</P>
        <P LI="1">I asked myself what my duty was and anything that was not wrong I was prepared to do.  I would not have felt justified in committing perjury or doing anything equivalent to perjury. <Col N="321"/> The party opposite, the Cosgrave-ites, told the people that this was not an oath at all.  I believe that the words &ldquo;I swear&rdquo; mean an oath.  But the Deputies opposite thought differently.  They said it was a formality and that anyone could take it.  I asked myself whether in a crisis like that I would be justified in staying outside when this was a mere formality.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Eamon de Valera listened to Fine Gael who convinced him that this was a mere formality and he moved on.  He then said: &ldquo;When I came to take the so-called oath I presented to the officer in charge [an English chap I think].&rdquo; He presented a document to the officer in charge which contained the republican declaration that they did not regard the oath of allegiance as a binding oath.  He told him that was their attitude and that they were not prepared to take the oath.  He produced a written document in pencil as Gaeilge which contained the statement made to the officer who was supposed to administer the oath and said he was not prepared to take the oath.  He just took it.  He put down the words, signed up to it and went on to describe it as an empty formula.</P>
        
        <P>I am proposing to my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues that they see these words as an empty formula.  They should not get carried away with it.  They should just get down and make it happen.  It is an empty formula and is a process well established throughout the history of the Senators&rsquo; own party.  I will actually support them in getting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>They fully understand the processes, procedures and history of their own party and there is a device within that to suit their occasion.</P>
        <P>Those of my colleagues who come from a Catholic background and who are worried about that have the mental reservation device.  Those from the Fianna F&aacute;il background should listen to the Cosgraveites on this side and get on with it.  They should not be upset.  They should do what their founder did and simply say that this is an empty formula.  Why can they not dothat?</P>
        <P>The reality is that this amendment is a bottle of smoke.  It does not meet any particular needs of any group of which I am aware.  It is rare for us to find an issue of pressing concern to a group of people being articulated by their public representatives but which has never been articulated by the group itself.  Who are we talking about?  Public servants are there to do a job.  They sign up, they take the shilling and they follow the flag.  They do their job as it is set out for them.  In most work places, if people find they have a difficulty in doing some aspects of their job, they find ways around that.  People work together and tend not to steamroll each other into doing what they will not do.  If somebody has a difficulty then they might be sick on the day they are supposed to do it.  They can take a day&rsquo;s holiday or a day&rsquo;s pay cut or whatever.  We deal with that all the time.  We had to meet this morning trying to find a man.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no difficulty in dealing with the perceived problem.  I do not believe it is a real problem.  The registrars have never articulated a problem.  I can give much more evidence as we go along of the other ways in which we have dealt with this kind of thing before.  This is not new.  I do not want Members to think this is a major issue of importance.  It is a huge argument about nothing.  It is an issue that does not concern anybody outside the few Members in here who raised it.  They raised it for their own reasons.  I have given one of my views.  I am happy to be contradicted on it, but I still hold my view.</P>
        <P>As parliamentarians, we must recognise where this legislation is going.  Were this amendment to be accepted, it would undermine the spirit and the operation of the legislation.  It would also create moral hazard because it would allow, encourage and reward people for not doing their jobs.  It would force extra work on other people who would have to pick up the slack from those who claim to have a conscientious objection.  If this lead to a situation where somebody was jailed for these acts, then that would be ridiculous.  There are certainly better ways of dealing with it, but that is not to be for or against anything.  It is a kind of a scare tactic that was raised to add a bit of credence to an argument that was pretty threadbare.  It was long and interesting, but it added little to the overall argument.  I have not found a scintilla of argument or evidence put forward in the last two or three hours that would change my view on this amendment.  We should just dispose of it and vote on it shortly.  I do not think I am entitled to put the question under Standing Orders, but somebody can.</P>

I notice that when those of us who hold a certain view get up, we are told it is not relevant.  In fact, it will show itself to be relevant when I am finished.

	<P>Senator Norris, you have not been called.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, you were asked to speak to this particular amendment.  All I have heard is a commentary about the Minister.  If you can speak to the amendment, there is no problem.  When other people did not speak to the amendment, I pulled them up.  I am not that long in the Chair and I cannot say what happened before that, so I am not casting aspersions on anybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard so many comments in the last few hours which had absolutely nothing to do with the amendment but dealt with us as individuals who had a separate view.  Are you saying to us that we cannot go back on those views and explain our opposition to the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>You can speak on anything that is relevant to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="324"/>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  I would like to continue and if you feel that you are not able to abide what I am doing, I will sit down.  It would be for the good of this House to have fair comment across the board.</P>
        <P>What the Minister said was correct.  There has been an exceptionally good debate in this House.  Several other Senators made exactly the same point.  My name is not to this amendment, but I fully uphold the right of Senator Mullen and Senator Quinn to put down that amendment.  I also uphold the right of every Senator to oppose that amendment.  My view on it has been informed by the debate that I have heard here.  This has been one of the most learned debates ever in this House.  I compliment all those who have brought professional expertise with them to the House and who have made it known to us.  That is precisely what we are doing.</P>
        <P>For those outside the House looking in, those we represent, the Seanad has been done a service today by the opposing views being put in such a generous and open-minded way.  That all relates to the amendment because it is important I put it into context.</P>
        <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I have been a lifelong trade unionist but I do not accept it is vital that the trade union movement must make a comment or interact with us, as legislators, to have a view.  Whether one is Independent or a member of a party, one is still entitled to have a view.  That is in response to a comment made.</P>
        <P>Whether it is 46 votes to five or 46 votes to one, the numerical strength of the vote has nothing to do with democracy because if we follow that concept, someone may presume that on the basis that only a minority is putting forward a point of view, it should not put it forward at all.  If we follow that concept, it is a negation of democracy itself.</P>
        <P>We have some new converts to brevity today, and so be it.  I wish to make a point, on which Senator Norris touched.  My hearing is not as acute as it should be and I did not have the earphone on my ear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe I referred to anything the Senator has with hearing.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Senator does not need to interrupt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did not say that.  I was coming to Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I did not know whether to include him in the following point.  The only point I have made on this issue on all Stages was in regard to the imprisonment of a registrar for six months.  I made a contribution on the Order of Business on this issue and I have been misquoted.  I have made this point three times.  I said I do not want to find myself in a situation of having to stand up in the Seanad in defence of a prisoner of conscience under this particular section in legislation, of which I will have been seen to be part.  I was anxious to pre-empt what might be said subsequently and deal only with that focused issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I make that same point again.  I do not believe imprisonment is necessary as a deterrent in this case.  We are using a sledgehammer in the wrong way and it is undermining much of the goodwill and debate which has taken place heretofore.</P>
        <P>I refer to edges of the debate when it gets iffy or flippant.  That is in order and I am not raising questions about that.  We should not all stand on a butter box on issues such as that because I am sure we have all fallen into that trap at times.  However, in the course of that iffy part of the debate, I always feel disappointed that when we are discussing a specific issue, a blanket is thrown over us all as if, in this case, we are opposed to gays and lesbians.</P>
        <P>I ask Members to read the record of the House.  When we were allowed to make statements, I made very definitive, strong and supportive statements.  I will not use words because, at times, Senator Norris feels people are being patronising even when we repeat perhaps some of what <Col N="325"/>he has said.  When I made points in a ten-minute statement, I laid out precisely my view on gays and lesbians.  That is what this amendment is about.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>For someone, in the course of the debate on the amendment, to in some way throw a blanket over us all as if we were homophobic or whatever is wrong because that does not help the debate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we are entitled, when considering the rights of same-sex couples, to discuss the impact of those rights on the rights of other people.  We will discuss this in the context of other amendments.</P>
        <P>For the rest of the debate, we should leave aside that blanket cover as if, in some way, we were anti-gay and anti-lesbian.  I am not, never have been and never will be.  I am supportive of them having their rights.  Why should they not have rights?  I have made this point before.  This should not be used as an obstacle to developing the debate in order that we can find out precisely what is inherent in the legislation.</P>
        <P>I genuinely learned much from Senator Mullen and I listened to him with great interest.  I heard him refer to different sources but I did not hear any repetition in what he put forward.  I accept that perhaps it was somewhat long in the context of the time but unless there is an order to indicate the time allowed, then we will have a difficulty in the future.</P>
        <P>For years I have sat in this House when we were discussing Bills and I listened to what I did not think was, in any way, what we might consider rational debate.  People used other words and terms.  I listened to those debates but not once in my 13 years in the House did I make any reference to personalise that or, in some way, demonise the point being put forward.  How often have we heard that being put forward in the debate on this amendment?  For the remainder of the debate on the amendments, I genuinely hope we can all feel free to put forward our views on each amendment without personalising or demonising anyone else in doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I question whether this amendment deals with the issue.  I am not quite clear what it is about.  The amendment may have had some favour in the 1950s but it is extremely out of date and misinformed.</P>
        <P>The notion that someone who works as a registrar on behalf of the State to provide a service would have a difficulty providing that service is strange.  A registrar who, as a result of his or <Col N="326"/>her conscience, is able to opt out of doing the basic job he or she is employed to do, which is to bring two people together in a partnership, should not be working as a registrar.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, under this amendment, if a registrar had a difficulty with a particular heterosexual couple, he or she could opt out under the conscience clause.  Why would someone work as a registrar if he or she would not do the job they have signed up to?</P>
        <P>The law is the guidebook on how the registrar works.  This is what a registrar is employed to do.  I do not understand where this conscience clause comes into it.  I made the important point yesterday that conscience certainly comes into spirituality and religion but it does not come into law.  Law and conscience do not go together.  We live in a civil society.  We represent all the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a worthy amendment and I hope it will not be approved by anyone other than its two proposers.  It does not have a place in legislation.  The idea that people can opt out of doing their job on the basis of conscience is not acceptable.  We all carry prejudices and religious beliefs with us.  Everyone who does a job has views unrelated to that job.  The amendment is not related to the job of registrar.  Conscience is a matter outside civil society.  It is not a matter of law but of religion or spirituality.  To insert conscience clauses in legislation would be regressive rather than progressive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have listened very carefully to all of the arguments made.  I thank Senator Mullen for making my argument by listing the various issues that show clearly how a freedom of conscience clause in legislation would allow public servants to take an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach to legislation passed by the Oireachtas on behalf of the people.  The general public deserves to know that if we pass legislation on its behalf, it will be implemented without fear or favour on an equal basis.  If we were to implement a freedom of conscience clause in relation to any of the exemptions I mentioned previously in the other House and that Senator Mullen has listed on my behalf, I could foresee future Members speaking on the Order of Business in the D&aacute;il or Seanad and objecting to the fact that public servants were not implementing legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  How could one run a country and how could the public service be expected to run a country if individuals were allowed to adopt a view contrary to the stated intention of the representatives of the people?  That is the essence of democracy.</P>
        <P>We have heard much about republicanism, including self-professed republicanism.  We seem to refer frequently to our neighbouring island.  I have not looked to see how our neighbouring island deals with this issue, as one would not be comparing like with like.  We have a Constitution and an independent Judiciary, the members of which make their own decisions.  Of course, we are subject to EU laws, but the Constitution is supreme on these issues.  We have passed legislation to ensure equal treatment of the general public and it has stood the test of time.</P>
        <P>I respect the views expressed by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  He indicated that he would find it difficult to have it on his conscience if someone was sent to prison as a result of this legislation.  I believe he was a Member of this House when it passed the Civil Registration Act 2004, but he may correct me if I am wrong.  Section 17(4) of that Act states clearly that a &ldquo;registrar shall have and perform ... functions conferred on him or her by or under this Act&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used, not &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Section 70 contains the penalties for offences under the Act and there is provision for officials to be relieved of their duties if they do not perform the functions conferred on them.  It states a person guilty of an offence shall be liable on summary conviction to six months imprisonment or a fine, or on indictment up to five years imprisonment.  What we <Col N="327"/>are doing in this instance is adding, as we are doing in a number of other areas, the issue of civil partnership to this legislation and the Civil Registration Act 2004.</P>
        <P>When the issue of conscientious objection was originally raised, my officials made inquiries in this regard.  Everything that has come back, anecdotally and otherwise, shows that registrars have no problem with and are looking forward to the implementation of this legislation.  That begs the question: where is this coming from?  I cannot answer that question.</P>
        <P>I was asked what representations the Department or I had received on the use of church property.  I can say there were representations from religious representatives who made out, incorrectly, that they would be forced to use their church property.  We did not receive representations from any of the people supposedly affected by a freedom of conscience clause.</P>
        <P>As a matter of public policy, there is no reason in any democratic society, when legislation is passed, circumstances would be allowed to obtain where it could not be implemented.  I suggest to any legislator who says we should do this that it would leave the State open to a potential claim for substantial compensation on the basis that people who had not received the service to which they were entitled under the legislation would have an open and shut case for compensation because the law had not been implemented without fear or favour and on an equal basis.  For public policy and also practical reasons, if we pass legislation, the least we can expect is that it will be implemented.</P>
        <P>My officials have been dealing with this legislation for the past few months.  They may very well have a conscientious objection to dealing with it, as officials in the Seanad may have with this or any other legislation.  However, as elected Members, we cannot allow a situation where such persons, whether they have an issue, which is fair enough, will not do their jobs because that is what they have been appointed to do, as public servants.</P>
        <P>Others have made the arguments and I fully agree with them.  To be fair to Senator Walsh, I must acknowledge that at my meeting with him and his two colleagues they at least understood the argument I was making on behalf of the Government.</P>

	<P>I do not accept there should be a free vote on the issue.  I heard what was said about what Fine Gael had done.  Of course, there may be people within a political party who hold a certain view that may not be in line with the majority view.  Again, that is the democratic system that has worked very well for this country and I do not think we should change it.  While I do not want to be pejorative in this regard, I wonder, when the very people who potentially would be affected by the amendment are not the ones calling for this change&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;why is it being suggested?</P>
        <P>On the overall issue, it makes no sense in the running of a democratic state if a law is democratically passed through the Legislature for people to be allowed, in effect, to adopt an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach to its implementation.  One would not be able to run a country or any of its public services, particularly given the society we now have, if that were to be the case.  Twenty years ago this was a mono-ethnic, mono-cultural and virtually mono-religious society.  Today, it is multicultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious and includes those with no religion.  That is why we, as legislators, cannot legislate for one concept of morality; we have to legislate for the common good as best we can.  We will not always succeed because there will be people who will be adversely affected by the legislation we bring forward.  However, when the vast majority of the elected Members of both Houses agree with the principles laid down in this legislation, I do not support the effort made to chip away at the principle of treating people with fairness and equality and implementing what is contained in the Constitution.  It is our Constitution, not a British constitution.  It does not concern what the British do in this regard; it dictates that we should treat everyone equally before the law.  In this regard, it also gives special recognition to the family and marriage.  It is that balance, whether we like it, that we must, as legislators, adhere to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I look at this issue from the point of view of my profession.  As doctors, nurses or other allied health professionals, we could not begin to have issues of conscience.  There are ethical questions such as abortion which are major for health care professionals.  We should be very careful, as the Minister pointed out, in how we interpret &ldquo;conscience&rdquo;.  It could make life absolutely impossible and people could take views which would have <Col N="329"/>more to do with prejudice, which can be major or minor, than genuine ethical concerns about how they do their jobs.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I must be allowed to comment on certain remarks made about me earlier.  I do not mind people seeking to ridicule, taking me on in arguments or suggesting that my amendments might have unintended consequences or might facilitate bad people in society.  I am a big boy and am able to argue my case.  I take issue with being accused of dressed up bigotry.  In one case Senator McDonald suggested I might have issues with women but I would be happy to supply her with references from some of the exes.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris compared me to Uriah Heep, and Senator Regan basically suggested homophobia is behind the amendment.  That hurts and is unfair.  The Labour Party suggested there were hidden agendas and the Minister made half a suggestion to that effect.  There is no hidden agenda and the proposed amendment is not designed to set this entire Bill at naught.  I have problems with aspects of the Bill but my problems with the civil partnership model being proposed in the Bill pale into insignificance with the concern I have for the protection of conscience in our society.  It is a genuine concern and I would be grateful if people would attack me on the argument and not on my bona fides.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not normally talk about my personal life but I subscribe to a Christian world view, which suggests we should be ready to give our lives for one other.  Whether a person is homosexual, a sister, brother or distant relative does not come into it.  That is the standard I try to live by.  There is no hatred or fear of homosexual persons in my heart and I do not believe it is in the heart of any of the others who have tabled amendments.  It would be too bad if people trying <Col N="330"/>to legislate for the common good were constantly having their motivation scrutinised and being accused of some quite ugly motivation when such motivation is absent.</P>
        <P>I ask those people in the House who brought up the suggestions &mdash; they know who they are &mdash; to reflect genuinely and dispassionately on what they have said and consider whether they might withdraw them either on the record or privately to me.  I would appreciate it if people would not second-guess the motivations of others.  There is no hatred, distrust or dislike of homosexual persons in my heart but there are legitimate differences of moral opinion in our society, which is what I am trying to protect.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated I made his argument by going through the various categories, which I will not repeat.  He gave examples such as bank officials refusing to open a joint account, doctors refusing to share information with a civil partner, Revenue officials refusing to consider civil partners as a couple or funeral directors refusing to handle a burial ceremony according to the deceased.  If the Minister or Senator Pearse Doherty had considered my amendment, they would see it gave no comfort to any of those persons.</P>
        <P>The reason this amendment is necessary is precisely because Ireland is becoming a multicultural society.  Once upon a time people did not need to think about their consciences because they did what the church or the law indicated.  We all accept that it is now wonderful that we are getting to a society where people think for themselves and will decide for or against what they hear from churches and other bodies.</P>
        <P>I gave the example of the abortion Act in Britain which specifically provides for a conscientious objection to participation in treatment.  I am glad Senator Twomey brought that up because it at least establishes the principle that it is sometimes necessary in a just and pluralistic society to allow people who have a genuine problem in their conscience to continue to function as State officials in certain positions while being allowed to go their own way and live out their ethos and morality.  It is a delicate issue calling for a balance.</P>
        <P>My argument to the Minister, which I did not hear him address in any detail or at all, is that my amendment offers that balance.  It would not in any way give comfort to a racist or other motivation.  It starts from the premise that there are different points of view in our society with regard to sexuality and recognition of same-sex partnerships.  It offers some comfort to those who may have a conscientious objection by saying that provided it does not impact on the State, they can be accommodated.  That is different from giving <i>carte blanche</i> to racists or homophobes to blithely claim a conscientious objection and gum up the works.  That is impossible under my amendment and I would have been grateful if instead of attacking me personally, other Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; would have teased out what my amendment proposes.  By all means they can attack any unintended consequences found.</P>
        <P>It cannot be argued, as Senator Doherty and others have tried, that if conscientious objection is allowed in one case, the floodgates will be opened.  It is our job as a Legislature to set out the circumstances in which we will allow for exceptions.  In that regard I want to be very clear on the subject.  Considering the existing equality legislation, it is replete with exceptions and anti-discrimination provisions have exceptions included designed to achieve the common good.  I will not go through all of them but, for example, treating a person who has not attained the age of 18 more or less favourably than another shall not be regarded as discrimination.  There are even provisions for discrimination in the treatment of a person on gender grounds with regard to services of an aesthetic, cosmetic or similar nature.</P>
        <P>We all know about section 30 of the Employment Equality Act, which the Supreme Court said was necessary for employment equality legislation to be constitutional.  That exception allows religious-run schools or hospitals to make decisions, where necessary, to prevent the <Col N="331"/>undermining of their ethos.  We have admitted the principle of conscientious objection into our law.  Not only that, the Constitution has stood by it and indicated it is necessary.</P>
        <P>It makes a mockery of legislative debate if the first time someone comes up with an exception that is carefully crafted, he or she is accused of ulterior motives.  That is not in the best spirit of legislative debate.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Of course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has instanced a number of cases where there are exceptions.  There is no exception to the circumstance where a public servant, in the performance of statutory duty as laid down by legislation, is allowed to decide based on freedom of conscience.  It is nowhere in existing legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true and I do not believe I said anything to gainsay that fact.  In other cases, such as the British abortion Act, it has been deemed necessary to have such a provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about the Irish context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There could very well be a public employee seeking to invoke such a provision.  It is the first area in which British law might be relevant.  The second issue was brought up by Senator Regan and is very telling.  He mentioned the Islington borough council case, which as far as I know involved an evangelical Christian who did not want to be involved in the provision of civil partnership.  In that case Senator Regan agrees with the eventual decision, which I understand was against that person.</P>
        <P>It is very well for the Minister to say there has never been anyone who brought up this concern or that the trade unions have not yet expressed it.  That may be true.  In light of the reaction to that expression of concern by me, does the Minister think people would feel courageous enough to raise that concern?  We can consider the reaction when I raised the possibility that someone might have that concern.</P>
        <P>We must legislate prospectively because we are becoming a multicultural society.  There may be a lady or gentleman who will mirror that British issue and indicate a conscience problem.  I do not have any problem with the fact that our current equal status legislation, for example, prohibits discrimination on sexual orientation grounds.  I have never opposed that idea.  By legislating for the new model of civil partnership, new issues are being brought to light requiring us to look at the workings and implications of existing legislation and this Bill in particular.</P>
        <P>The principle I am standing up for today is not necessarily a principle on which I would intend to rely.  The fact that I worked for the church in the past is being allowed to muddy the debate because people are focusing on the idea that the exception comes from a particular quarter.  The principle I am defending is the idea that a person with whom I may disagree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole respectfully suggested that the amendment is tantamount to a bottle of smoke and that there is no real mischief which it seeks to remedy.  It is my view that the amendment seeks to pre-empt a possible mischief that might arise.  I offer the amendment in sincerity to the House and on the basis that we are moving into a multicultural society within which we must begin to contemplate issues of conscience.  It is precisely as a result of the multicultural nature of our society that in the future people will hold views or whatever that will differ from the prevailing morality.  That morality will probably be very secularised in nature.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On the issue of sexual orientation and same-sex relationships, I am of the view that society does not have a settled opinion.  For the foreseeable future, there will be a majority and a minority in respect of this matter.  There are two roads which can be taken from the point.  One can decide to impose the morality of the majority and state that anyone who dares to differ therefrom should not work in the Civil Service.  On the other hand, one can try to tack with the changing circumstances that prevail to discover whether there is a means by which people of a different ethos can be accommodated.  We must also ask whether we can allow people who hold a different ethos to function as respected members of society or as employees of the State without coercing them in some way and without frustrating the State&rsquo;s ability to get the job done.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult for people to understand that there are some issues which are of profound importance to some members of society.  Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Walsh and I have received a great deal of correspondence in respect of this matter.  Much of its was sent by people who do not understand from where we are coming and just as much came from those who are of the view that this is a civilisational issue that deserves careful attention, especially as it goes to the heart of the question whether we will allow freedom of opinion and conscience in our society.</P>
        <P>Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who lived much of his life under a regime based on the denial of the authentic rights of conscience, once stated that those who clearly recognise the voice of their own conscience usually recognise also the voice of justice.  I mention this because conscience is being denigrated in this debate as something that will allow narrow-minded people to be awkward.  The history of conscience and conscientious objection is much more about people, such as Martin Luther King Jr., who stood against laws because of principles they ultimately believed <Col N="333"/>to represent the common good.  I sincerely believe that the common good is best served by allowing people with different values to function to the greatest extent possible, subject to the overriding need of the State to get the job done.</P>
        <P>It is in that context that I ask Senator Regan, in particular, to at least consider that I may hold such a view without being a homophobic person.  This really matters to me.  To be accused of being homophobic when what one is trying to do is secure the common good for everyone in society is not acceptable.  Nothing I am proposing would prevent civil partnership from working, particularly as it would be subject to the overriding ability of the civil registrar or superintendent to avoid delay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White stated that my proposal emanates from a theocratic position.  As I understand it, under a theocracy church leaders make the laws of the land.  I am no theocrat.  That is why I refer to religious and ethical concerns.  We do not have a right to question from where people obtain their views and values.  Nor do we have a right to assume that the only reason a person has a certain moral view is because some guy wearing a mitre has done his or her thinking for him or her.  That is not the truth.  The truth is that people form their own consciences according to the authorities they most respect and on the basis of the arguments they find most convincing.  Let us forget notions of theocracy and say rather that there are people in our society who harbour different moral views.  Let us try to facilitate these people to the greatest extent possible without frustrating our ability to get the job done.  As I stated, let us try to legislate prospectively.</P>
        <P>We should not worry about the fact that the registrars have not, for whatever reason, been lobbying the Minister.  The tenor of this debate is one good reason they would not do so, particularly in the context of the reaction they would receive.  I am not criticising the Minister in this regard but the general tone of the debate has not been good.</P>

        <P>In concluding, I ask the Minister to inform me how, in view of its tight scope, the amendment before the House could possibly offer <i>carte blanche</i> to the people on the list to which he referred.  There is not a single item on that list which could be contemplated in the conscientious objection clause as I have drafted it.  Why is it not the prerogative of the Oireachtas, as the State Legislature, to contemplate our new society and the issues which arise in respect of it?  In view of the exemptions contained in the equality legislation, why should we not, in a tightly drawn way, facilitate one group in society &mdash; which may possibly be small or which may not, as yet, have manifested itself &mdash; without treating its members as bigots and while also ensuring the State can get the job done at the same time?</P>

        <P Just="Left">On amendment No. 15, the practicalities involved have been well argued by the Minister.  I do not doubt the sincerity of those who moved the amendment.  I am of the view that they genuinely believe in the veracity of the argument they are making.  I wish to address the effect of that argument.  There seems to be an implication that there are people with conscience and people without conscience.  That might be too broad a generalisation but that it exists at all is offensive.  Even in its narrowest sense, the implication is that there are those who possess a more developed sense or higher form of conscience and that this is better than the form of conscience possessed by others.  That is offensive.  The further implication is that there are people who want to apply their sense of conscience specifically to people with a certain lifestyle and sexual inclination and that this would salve their conscience, regardless of the effects on other members of the community.  As the Minister said, the further implication is that public servants could address their public service roles in an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> manner without having to apply the law, as passed by this and the other House, directly and even-handedly.  That is offensive, regardless of the sincerity with which the argument is made, how genuine those who believe in the argument are, how the argument is heard or represented.  I suggest my speech will be well short of the average length of the contributions made on Committee Stage.</P>

The disproportionate amount of time we have spent on it &mdash; we have spent more time on it than on any other &mdash; has eaten into the amount of time we will have to discuss the other amendments.  If we were to list all of the remaining sections and amendments that have yet to be discussed, we would not reach the allocated time of 5.30 p.m.  During the rest of this debate and in the light of the overwhelming willingness of the Members of this House to have the legislation passed we will need to give serious consideration to how we should make progress with this Bill.</P>

	<P>I have a great deal of sympathy for what Senator Boyle said.  Perhaps we will have to approach the issue in another fashion.  On the amendment, I said on Second Stage that I thought the proposal to introduce a conscience clause was a contrivance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not spoken this morning and will not detain my colleagues for very long.  Nothing I have heard in the last three hours has persuaded me that what I said on Second Stage was wrong.  This proposal is a complete contrivance because it is based on the perception that classes of people may require to exercise an objection.  The point made by the Minister in his intervention ten or 15 minutes ago was bang on.  We should consider his clear statement that &ldquo;nowhere in existing legislation&rdquo; have we provided for public officials to opt out from implementing the laws passed by these Houses.  The point made by him in his timely intervention on our codes and  laws is absolutely the case for very persuasive and compelling legal, constitutional and democratic reasons.  Of course, it is true.</P>
        <P>I accept the genuineness of what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said about people having their views.  He may not have meant it to come across as slightly patronising when he said he was prepared to let people have their views.  However, there is a corollary to the holding of that position.  One cannot say, &ldquo;I do not mind if people are gay, or want to live in a particular way,&rdquo; unless one is also prepared to include in law a means by which such persons can vindicate their right to live in such a manner; for example, with whoever they like.  I heard an interview with Senator Mullen &mdash; I think it was on radio &mdash; in which he was pressed on this issue which has come up time and again in terms of motivation.  He said he believed people who were homosexual absolutely had a right to their dignity.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;without being prepared to include in law a means and a method by which their rights can be vindicated.  That is the point I would like to make genuinely to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  It is at the heart of this debate.  One cannot have one without the other.  In a democracy one cannot say in all fairness and honesty that it is fine for people to be gay and to want to live with somebody of the same sex without also providing for laws that allow that to occur.  Senator McDonald made the same point eloquently earlier in this debate.  That contradiction is at the heart of this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should read the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will refer to the wording of the amendment.  One of the provisions in the amendment is very telling.  It refers to protecting registrars who raise an objection, as long as it &ldquo;is not based on any of the discriminatory grounds identified in section 3, subsection (2), paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>c</i>), (<i>e</i>), (<i>f</i>), (<i>g</i>), (<i>h</i>), (<i>i</i>) of the Equal Status Act, 2000&rdquo;.  That is the section of the Act that lists the prohibited grounds, including sexual orientation.  How could the objection of a mythical registrar to registering a civil partnership not offend against the law that states there should be no discrimination against people of a particular sexual orientation?  What else would the objection be based on?  It could not be made on any other ground.  Such an objection would constitute a direct form of discrimination.  If I am wrong in that regard, I suggest it would certainly constitute indirect discrimination.  How could it be otherwise?</P>
        <P>As Senator McDonald said, this proposal would be a charter for discrimination.  It does not stand up in any respect.  This bogus notion is supposedly being proposed to accommodate those who hold a different moral position.  In a democracy one debates what the laws governing state services should be, but one cannot play out the controversy every time the State delivers that service.  The controversy should take place in Parliament and public when one is deciding what the solution is.  One draws up a law on that basis.  That law cannot be implemented, or not implemented as the case may be, on the basis of the views of a person providing the service.  That is not how democracy works.  One plays out the issues in public and Parliament and then one makes one&rsquo;s decision.  I think Senator Mullen understands this.  I do not intend to stray into the area of questioning people&rsquo;s motivation.  Senator Mullen is intelligent enough to understand precisely what I am saying.  I will set out the central contradiction.  Perhaps &ldquo;flaw&rdquo; is too marginal or benign a word.  The central dishonesty&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Come on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is that it can be nothing other than an attempt to attack, undermine and set aside the basic objective of the legislation.  It should be opposed absolutely.  I thank the Minister for being so clear in his opposition to this provision which we should reject.  If it is order to do so, I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to put the question now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to intervene on the same basis as Senator White.  Before I do so, I genuinely do not believe Senator Mullen is homophobic.  I accept that completely.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>To a certain extent, this is a battle in which Senators are engaged on the issue of freedom of conscience, but there is a bigger battle to be fought on what are probably more difficult ethical issues that will come down the line in years to come.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="338"/>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is partly true.  There is a principle at stake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In his last intervention the Senator clearly indicated that he had foreseen that there would be difficulties in this respect.  Most people would accept there might be issues coming down the line, in respect of which freedom of conscience may very well be examined.  However, we are dealing with the issue of civil partnership which we all accept is a reality.  The Senator&rsquo;s amendment would for the first time set a precedent, whereby a public servant could discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation.  That is specifically stated in the amendment.  Section 3(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Equal Status Act 2000 includes what is known as &ldquo;the sexual orientation ground&rdquo;.  The Senator has gone even further, saying a refusal or objection on the grounds of sexual orientation or marital status would not be deemed to be discrimination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Senator because clearly that would set up the possibility that a public servant could opt in or out as he or she so wished.  I made the point that one could not run a country on that basis, that on issues such as this, particularly to do with sexual orientation or marital status, people would have the right to opt in or out as they so wished.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be reasonably brief.  I note from the explanatory memorandum that section 23 imposes a fine of &euro;2,000 or imprisonment of up to six months on a registrar who is in breach in regard to registration.  I do not know whether it goes further than applying to registrars.</P>
        <P>There are three parts to the conscience issue.  There are religious bodies, with which we will deal later as we have tabled an amendment in regard to them, registrars or the employees of the State and service providers.  In regard to service providers, if I had a premises such as a hotel which provided a service and I was approached by a couple who wished to celebrate their civil partnership in it, I would have no difficulty allowing them to have their celebration there and I would gladly take their money.  Balancing the anti-discrimination side with freedom of conscience is an important issue in this respect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I am taken with what has been said, if an employee of the State in particular does not comply with the legislation, surely there is provision under industrial relations procedures to deal with that.  I have concerns about criminalising such non-compliance in cases where people could have a very genuine conscientious objection.  We must try to see if we can allow for that.  I could not find a way as to how we might allow for it without there being a feeling of some form of discrimination.  It was for that reason we thought that not criminalising it might be a better approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what Senator Walsh said.  I am very conscious of the allowance that is made in the UK for nurses who, on conscientious grounds, will not perform or be involved in the performance of an abortion.  How can we have a situation where we would criminalise people for genuinely conscientiously held reasons?  It appears to be excessive and very wrong.  The issue goes beyond the fine or term of imprisonment of six months.  It is at the core of what Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; eloquently spoke on during the Order of Business on an occasion.  The section imposes penal laws on people who have genuinely held beliefs.  Such actions will not promote the liberal agenda.  For the remainder of the debate it would be useful if people spoke on what we believed rather than what they think we believe.</P>

	<P>I made my views on this issue known before the Bill was brought before the House and I still feel the same way.  There are Senators in the House who may not necessarily take the same view as we do on some issues and who may have certain reservations about the Bill which I hope can be revisited.  Criminalising somebody in this way would serve no purpose.  It generally has a counter effect.  In this case we would be as well off not to include such a provision in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="340"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to take the opportunity to speak to the amendment which goes to the core of some of the arguments made, some of which have been disgraceful.  It is pure scaremongering; the arguments made have no basis in fact or law.  I went to the trouble of checking after I heard what Members had to say yesterday.  The amendment would change the 2004 Act which deals with the issue of criminalisation.  Under the Act, on summary conviction, a person is liable to a fine of up to &euro;2,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to six months for deleting, altering or procuring the deletion or alteration of information on the register, keeping or procuring information on the register on a computer and changing it.  There is a list of wrongdoings and actions specifically taken to corrupt the process of registration, in other words, there is a wilful act in breach of the law which covers all such eventualities.</P>
        <P>The section being opposed adds a new offence and I would like the House to listen carefully.  It deals with a registrar who refuses to registers a civil partnership.  I would like Senator Walsh to listen to this.  It reads: &ldquo;A registrar who without reasonable cause either fails or refuses to give a civil partnership form shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  Somebody has to say, therefore, that there was not reasonable cause.  There can be a range of responses to the offence, but if one takes it that the range will have to be reflected in the judgment of the court &mdash; this would be the least serious of a series of offences &mdash; this is not something that should worry decent people; it is not something about which we need to worry.  It does not mean somebody who fails to give a civil partnership form will be criminalised and thrown into jail.  A person will first have to be asked why he or she did something.  Perhaps that is why Senator Walsh asked why there was no provision for a human resources approach.  There is.  The first question to be asked is: &ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo;  Somebody will then have to decide that there was not reasonable cause.  This does mean somebody will be thrown into jail or fined &euro;2,000.  One could argue the provision is excessive, an argument to which I am prepared to listen but not agree with, as I can see the point of it.  However, it is wrong to give the impression that somebody who fails to act on the basis of conscience or any other will suddenly winds up in jail.  That is not the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to be controversial in my remarks, but there is something inherently wrong with this debate when we compare the celebration of a same-sex union with a person&rsquo;s objection to carrying out an abortion.  When a person who puts them on the same level says he is not homophobic, there is an inherent contradiction.  Much of the debate on the Bill has skewed completely from what it seems to be about.  There is a need, therefore, for the Senators who oppose the Bill to tighten their arguments on what their objections are and not use emotive language while debating the issues involved and not make such a direct link.  They should make their points on the ethos of a church or religious institution but stay away from making such comparisons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We support section 23 which is very straightforward.  The arguments in favour of it have been made.  Senator Alex White has made the same point.  The sanctions are included in section 20 of the 2004 Act and section 23 simply extends them to cover civil partnership registration and the work of a registrar in that regard.  It is appropriate that we do this.  I do not think we will ever see anyone being prosecuted or penalised for breaching the provisions of the section which has been in place since 2004 and there was no objection to it at the time.  This is a red herring, a non-issue and an attempt to destabilise and undermine the Bill.  It is time we moved on because the Bill has the broad support of the overwhelming majority of Senators.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the Bill and will be voting in favour of it.  That does not mean we have to agree with every single point, part or section of it.  I disagree with virtually <Col N="341"/>everything that has been said about this clause on both sides of the House.  An offender under the section can go jail and be fined an enormous amount of money.  I have just read it and may be open to correction.  The person concerned is being put in the category of a criminal, which is completely different from the offence which he or she has supposedly committed.  The other offenders under the 2004 Act all actively commit offences such as fraud which is obviously something which not only has to be discouraged but also punished.  I understand in this case, based on what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, that when a person &ldquo;without reasonable cause&rdquo; &mdash; a very subjective judgment &mdash; fails to do something, he or she is committing an offence.  It is when someone fails to do something which is part of his or her job that he or she is committing an offence.  The idea that for not doing one&rsquo;s job for whatever reason &mdash; I do not want to discuss the issue of conscience because I do believe there is a case to be made for conscientious objection which is impossible to define &mdash; a person can be put into jail is utterly wrong.  There should even be such a possibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is obvious that this is an inappropriate punishment.  The appropriate punishment in this case is simple: people should be dismissed from their jobs &mdash; end of the story.  I do not know if people in the private sector are put in jail when they do not do their job.  It only happens when they commit an offence such as theft, show disloyalty or do something which is against the law.  We are creating a new offence of not doing one&rsquo;s job which is utterly wrong.  We hear a lot about others possibly being sent to jail, but that this will happen to people in the public service is unacceptable.  To be told it is unlikely to happen is totally unconvincing.  I agree it is unlikely to happen, but to suggest people should be locked up for not doing their job is extreme.  On this issue only I am prepared to vote against the Government.  I appeal to the Minister to consider amending this provision in a reasonable way because it is not convincing to say it is impossible for this to happen.  It is possible; it is the law.  Judges can make completely different decisions for different reasons.  The idea that someone in the public service should go to jail because he or she has said, for whatever reason, that he or she will not do his or her job is utterly wrong.  Let us fire them or leave them to be subject to the normal process of employment law.  Let us not send him or her to jail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>By opposing section 23 I hope to achieve a similar goal to my previous amendment.  Whereas I had attempted to define &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; so as to leave the offence in place while giving a person room to avoid being deemed to have committed an offence, I oppose the section because the severe punishments it sets out are inappropriate in the context of registration of civil partnership.  As far as I am aware, if an official fails to comply with the law in the North, he or she may lose his or her job but would not be liable for criminal prosecution.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole argued there is no basis in fact or law for what is being claimed.  I demur at the use of the word &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo; to describe not only the issue but also by implication the motivation of the people who put forward the amendment.  I dissent from such an approach to the argument.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is incorrect to claim there is no basis in fact or law for what is being claimed by the proponents of this amendment.  There is the possibility of an offence which covers a range of transgressions.  Nothing in the legislation excludes a possible offence <Col N="342"/>in this context from the most severe of the penalties.  The Senator may have an arguable case that there is no basis in fact on the grounds that this area has not seen many prosecutions, although he appeared to be looking into the crystal ball when he suggested there never would be a basis in fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>He is certainly wrong to say there is no basis in law because the law clearly provides for this possibility.  It is no argument to say &ldquo;trust us&rdquo;, which is the essence of Senator Bacik&rsquo;s intervention.  We are here to legislate for situations that may not have occurred in the past but which might occur in the future.  We must have an eye for the changing trends in society and possible future examples of intolerance on the secular side, just as there was in the past intolerance on the religious side.  This is why we have to think out the future.  To paraphrase G.K. Chesterton, let us not be so open minded that we let our brains fall out.  We must predict what is going to happen.</P>
        <P>The opponents of this section do not have to meet a high threshold.  They merely have to show that, for the avoidance of doubt, it would be preferable to exclude the possibility that a person would face such severe sanctions for a transgression of this nature.  To my mind, they have discharged that obligation persuasively and I will support them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross is totally wrong.  This is not a simple question of someone not doing his or her job.  The offence is unlawful discrimination and, worse still, it would be committed by a public servant acting in an official capacity.  This is why sanctions are needed to prevent such discrimination.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen used the term &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;, which is contained in the Act.  If I understand him correctly, he is saying sexual orientation is reasonable cause to discriminate where the registration involves a gay or lesbian couple.  This brings us back to the hostility against gay and lesbian couples which, as far as I can see, is inherent in this and other amendments.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.  Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this section.  It is appropriate that jail is the ultimate sanction in our penal code.  A person who threatens to kill somebody can be imprisoned for life but he or she would more commonly receive a suspended sentence or two years in jail.  That is an example of the sliding scale and the evidentiary process.  When a public official makes a mistake or discriminates against another individual in the course of his or her duties, he or she will be subjected to the rigours and fair process of the disciplinary system.  In a worst case scenario, where the discrimination is so blatant and terrible that it warrants jail, that would have to be considered in the final analysis.  Generally speaking, however, that road has never been followed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not agree with Senator Ross&rsquo;s assertion that people cannot go to jail for not doing their jobs.  At issue here is an official who performs a public duty by marrying same-sex couples.  It is not sufficient that discriminatory practices would merely result in the perpetrator losing his or her job and continuing these practices in a new position until, perhaps, the penny drops that he or she requires a conversion on the road to Damascus. If one has a problem with same-sex couples getting married, one should not be a registrar but one should not discriminate.</P>

	<P>In other jurisdictions around the world where minorities have suffered, tough legislation was needed to stop discrimination.  Before the Equal Status Act came into force, Travellers were refused service in many bars.  Now, however, they can go into bars and they behave themselves.  I appreciate there are times when everything is not okay but if the sanction was not available we would never have taken that quantum leap.  We must move away from the word &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; and begin to accept all minorities in society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are debating a phantom minority which does not exist.  We say minorities need to be protected because we are navel gazing or wondering what will happen in the future.  We will deal with the future when it comes but, right now, we are dealing with a minority whose rights have been trampled on for decades and who were criminals in this country 16 years ago.  We need to move on with this legislation and put the section to a vote.  I accept Senator Walsh&rsquo;s bona fides in opposing the section but it is my right to disagree with him.  We need to move on to vindicate the rights of the minority we are here to protect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator McDonald, I do not agree with the opposition to the section.  It is just a red herring or a pretext for the wider opposition to the Bill.  Public officials, by their very nature, are good people who carry out their duties to the highest standard.  Those who work in the public service do not and, I hope, would not seek the freedom to ignore State policy.  This Bill is going to become State policy.  If they had that freedom, the machinery of the State would grind to a halt and we would become a banana republic.</P>
        <P>Job descriptions change from time to time.  We have all taken on added responsibilities or covered new areas at some point in our working lives.  ICTU or another source would have sought an amendment or protocol to the Bill if there were any such concerns about persons performing their duties.  I agree with Senator McDonald that a person who is not capable, on the basis of conscience or otherwise, of treating everyone equally and with dignity and respect should not be a registrar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not spoken much on this topic.  This issue has been simplified and speakers have not recognised that some people have real problems with the section.  It has been argued that job descriptions change from time to time.  When this occurs, people are disciplined or, as Senator McDonald stated, disciplinary procedures are pursued.  If someone does not obey the outcome of a disciplinary procedure, he or she is usually sacked.  Senator Ross is correct on that point.  This matter is different, however, because we are creating law which will last.  I am concerned about the use of terms such as &ldquo;it is highly unlikely&rdquo; or &ldquo;generally speaking&rdquo;.  Relying on improbabilities or generalities does not make good law.</P>
        <P>If we do not remove the section, a person who commits an offence because of a change in his or her job description could go to jail.  While I accept that such a scenario is highly unlikely, I am not in favour of making laws which rely on generalities or improbables.  As Senator Ross noted, the solution is to dismiss those who do not do the job they are supposed to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Quinn.  If a scenario is highly unlikely or does not feature on the agenda, why is it provided for in the Bill?  It seems the purpose of the section is to be penal in the sense of penal law, in other words, vindictive.  The approach appears to be one that those who do not agree with our view will be made to pay for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It appears I am not allowed to use an example unless it is <i>pari passu.  </i>This does not happen at times but it accentuates the point.  I ask the Minister to address two points.  If it is acceptable in the United Kingdom for a nurse to be allowed to decline to perform her duty as prescribed <Col N="344"/>by law, why is a similar scenario &mdash; a decision taken in conscience and not necessarily provided for in the Act &mdash; not acceptable?  I have requested a schedule of cost for the legislation and ask the Minister to provide such a schedule to show the cost of the Bill in the next three to five years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from his preamble on the motives of people who hold a contrary view to his own, Senator O&rsquo;Toole hit on something for which I felt like cheering him.  On examination, however, I believe he is incorrect because having discussed this point with the Minister, we left the meeting believing there was a possibility that someone would go to jail in this context.  I will be pleased if it transpires that I am wrong and Senator O&rsquo;Toole is able to show this is not the case because this is the only aspect of the Bill on which I have spoken, whether on the Order of Business or at other times.  I continue to make the same point on this section.  If, as most people argue, the scenario provided for is unlikely, it is not necessary to include it in the legislation.  Senator Hanafin went further and asked why the section is included in the Bill.  If it does not serve a purpose and we are not trying to send out some type of message and wish to continue to implement legislation in the right spirit, it would be better not to have a provision of this nature in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I know lay people who are much more religious than I am and hold conscientious views on matters which they believe infringe on their beliefs and the teachings of their religion.  I can envisage such persons being caught by this provision.  I assumed &mdash; perhaps I was wrong &mdash; that the words &ldquo;without reasonable cause&rdquo; would not cover such persons.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this matter, on which there have been discussions among officialdom.  If a person found himself or herself in the circumstances described, will it be possible to accommodate him or her to ensure he or she is not criminalised?  I do not mind if a person is suspended for a week or transferred to another Department.</P>
        <P>I do not disagree with anything Senator McDonald said about discrimination.  What we are trying to do is reconcile two competing priorities, namely, the need to ensure people are not discriminated against and the need to accommodate genuine freedom of conscience.  I know the latter is difficult to determine.  If the Minister is able to give me any comfort on this matter, I would take a different view on opposing the section.</P>

	<P>Senator Mullen is indicating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Senator has spoken since I last spoke.  I would like to respond to his comments as he challenged my views.</P>
        <P>We need to examine what is happening here because it is a little like the invasion of Afghanistan when the Russians stated they were invited into the country.  The group of people the amendment is rushing to protect does not want our protection.  The individuals in question are doing their job, are aware of the issue given that it has been widely reported in the newspapers yet not one of them has said he or she needs our protection.  Some of us are determined to give it to them in any case.  We are rushing to help people who do not want to know.  The last thing they want to see is a group of politicians rushing at them, as it were.</P>
        <P>We need to consider this issue in real world terms.  Important issues have been raised by a number of speakers, including Senator Quinn.  To assist Senator Mullen and others, I will read again what is written in the section.  It will apply to a registrar &ldquo;who, without reasonable cause, fails or refuses to give a civil partnership registration form to one of the parties&rdquo;.  What happens before one reaches this point is the human relations aspect of the process to which Senator Walsh referred.  If someone working in an office indicates to his or her boss that he or she is <Col N="345"/>not prepared to carry out civil partnership functions or weddings, the boss then has a job to do, namely, find a local arrangement, transfer, sack or suspend the person or find another solution.  We must bear in mind that a crime has not been committed and a human resources procedure is followed before one proceeds further.  When someone refuses to carry out a function it must be dealt with locally.  Sacking the person, as some Senators have suggested, could be much more costly than the maximum fine of &euro;2,000 provided for in the section.  The action taken will depend on the local arrangements in place.  At that point, the civil registrar may simply refuse to carry out his or her function.</P>
        <P>Why do we need the provisions of the section?  It is not only a matter of scale, as a number of speakers suggested, but also one of aggravating circumstances.  In many cases, a gay couple will not have a great deal of self-confidence in dealing with public matters of this nature.  Not only could they be deprived of the civil partnership registration form, there could be aggravating circumstances, for instance, they could be led to believe that it is not possible for them to enter into a partnership or a form could be lost.  The scale provided for is necessary to address such aggravating circumstances.</P>
        <P>The issue is not one of a person refusing to hand over a piece of paper or sign a form but one of discrimination.  I ask Senator Mullen or another opponent of the Bill to put a price on discrimination.  At what point does a continuing contravention of the law by discriminating against a person fail to be important?  If someone continues to hold an unlawful position, should we back off?  While I do not envisage such a scenario, I am being forced to bring the hypothetical case to its conclusion.  If there are aggravating circumstances, we must be able to measure them in terms of the response of the law.  We are depriving a citizen of a legal right &mdash; rights we are putting in place with this legislation.  Someone is being discriminated against.  Someone is being deprived of his or her rights.  Someone is not applying the law we are passing.  Someone may not have dealt with this or agreed with any arrangement that was made previous to this in his or her office, whatever HR arrangements were there.  This is all the background stuff.  Things do not happen like that.  As there is always a story behind a story, how would we get to it?</P>
        <P>The other issue is moral hazard.  The idea that we could put into legislation that someone can refuse to do an aspect of his or her job is inviting situations where people go forward.  I am not talking about people with a conscientious objection; that may well be the case.  I find it difficult to deal with that issue, but I am not talking about that.  A parish priest described someone some time ago by saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that he had lost his religion; he was just too lazy to get up to go to Mass.&rdquo;  I am talking about someone who is too lazy to do his or her job and claims to have a moral objection.  That is a moral hazard.  It would open issues which would make it impossible to control because someone could claim to have a conscientious objection.  Someone who is lazy might not have any trouble telling lies or &mdash; I remind Senator Mullen about this &mdash; might have a mental reservation about it one way or another.</P>
        <P>The serious point is that this is not something that happens like a bang.  This is something that builds up.  If someone working in an office or elsewhere, including in teaching, claims to have a difficulty about something or other, the boss needs to deal with it.  If it cannot be dealt with, action needs to be taken.  If action is not taken, it moves to a next step.  If it is a minor thing that someone has refused to do his or her job, action should be taken about that.</P>

	<P>We need to allow for aggravating circumstances.  I will not hear anyone say that the refusal is simply refusing to hand out a form.  I want to hear it said that this is discrimination and deprivation of a legal right we are putting in place.  We need equality before <Col N="346"/>the law.  It is important we respond to it in that way.  I do not want to and I do not believe I will ever see anyone go to jail as a result of this.  However, I want people to know that we, in this House, value the rights of our citizens and will ensure they will be delivered for them.  That is why it goes up that sliding scale.  It is not as if someone makes a mistake and finishes up in jail.  There are many steps in between.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole has very adequately dealt with a number of points.  I believe Senator Mullen indicated very honestly that this is, to a certain extent, a device for reopening the discussion that has been held already on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Something very close to that was said.  I shall leave it at that.</P>
        <P>The Minister has largely dealt with these problems.  Taking into account that this is a device for reopening the discussion of the subject matter of amendment No. 15 and because the wording of that amendment also includes marriage, it opens up the floodgates of Islamophobia, etc.  There may well be cranks who would not give a civil partnership to people who are Muslim.  That is a much greater possibility than the possibility of someone going to jail.  I do not believe that anyone would go to jail.  I think it is highly unlikely that this clause will ever need to be invoked in terms of the provision of service.  I have just returned from the barber&rsquo;s shop.  I have read reports in the newspapers that some people believe that hairdressers would be forced do weddings and civil partnerships.  I asked in the barber&rsquo;s shop whether there would be any objection and everyone there fell around the floor laughing.  It is so bloody absurd.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is not a victimless crime.  It is not just someone claiming he or she does not want to shuffle a piece of paper around.  Senators should imagine themselves in the situation of people who want to apply for a civil partnership, which they will be perfectly entitled to do under the law of this land, hopefully, after this evening, and are bluntly told: &ldquo;No.  Get lost.  We&rsquo;re not doing it.&rdquo;  What will their feelings be?  This is really poisonous.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin and several others have deliberately dragged in the idea of abortion.  I now call on them publicly to clarify that and to make it absolutely clear that they are not equating in the slightest sense or in any way the performing of a civil ceremony for same-sex couples with the performing of an abortion.  That must be clarified.  It is so easy to throw around the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;, which gets many people very steamed up.  I want that issue to be clarified urgently.</P>
        <P>I hope we will not have a repetition of what happened last night when on a series of amendments with exactly the same wording we were put through the necessity to vote.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 23 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I said at the end of Second Stage that I thought it had been an excellent debate, and it was.  Unfortunately, as I predicted, the way in which Committee Stage has been dealt with has not done the Senate any service.  I do not have to point the fingers in that respect.</P>
        <P>I am implacably opposed to the deletion of this section for the simple reason that to do so would be discriminatory.  It is purporting to create a situation whereby a registrar fails or refuses to give a form and does not suffer any sanction other than the disciplinary procedures that might be normal for any public servant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Hanafin and others asked why we should have a criminal sanction if it is not used.  The criminal sanction has already been on the Statute Book since 2004 in respect of other offences and whether it has been used, the fact that it is there is a clear statement by the Oireachtas to those people who might, without reasonable cause, fail to do something they are required to do.  It is clearly a dereliction of their duty and the Oireachtas should send a strong signal that this is not something that can only be dealt with by a disciplinary tribunal or whatever.  It must be dealt with if it is a very serious offence.  As Senator Ross said, this is not a victimless crime.</P>
        <P>Section 69 of the 2004 Act lists the offences a registrar might commit by not acting in accordance with the Act.  It also includes a non-registrar, in other words, an ordinary person.  A person who gives to the registrar particulars or information which he or she knows to be false or misleading is guilty of an offence.  All of those offences are punishable, on summary conviction under section 70, by up to six months and a fine of up to &euro;2,000, while there are much more serious penalties for conviction on indictment.  All of those section 69 offences are punishable by that criminal sanction.  What is being proposed here is clearly discriminatory in respect of a failure to give a form concerning civil partnership.  The people who are proposing the deletion of this section are effectively proposing that in that instance, there should be no criminal sanction.  I disagree because it is clearly discriminatory.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;without reasonable cause&rdquo; is there as a defence if the person has good reason not to fulfil what he is required to do under the section.  It is entirely up to that person to prove it in a defence of any prosecution that takes place.  Therefore, there is an &ldquo;out&rdquo; in that respect.  However, what is proposed is discriminatory because it is making a difference in the sanction purely and simply because it refers to a civil partnership registration.</P>

It is quite clear there are different views on this Bill and the Minister has to provide us with a focused view that we believe will enable us to endorse the legislation that is being brought forward.

I kept things very brief because I had hoped that throughout the debate, we would be able to categorise each argument, each point of view and each question for clarification.</P>
        <P>If there was filibustering here &mdash; it has been suggested there was &mdash; there could be reasons for it, but I will not point fingers at any person.

	<P>I do not think we could have a guillotine this evening only for the fact there is near unanimity within the House.  It is a black mark on us and I know the Leader will be very hurt about this because he has a very proud record.  It means that instead of using Standing Orders to control the debate, we now find a big question mark in the public arena that because there were only a few who wanted to question this legislation, the only message that goes out is that for the first time in the life of this Seanad, we brought in a guillotine because we had near unanimity to do that.  As a democrat, I am sorry to say that.</P>
        <P>I accept the ruling and when the Bill is passed, I will accept that.  However, we should make up our minds that whatever happens in the future, we may still come back and express our views.  If others do not agree with those views, which we expect to happen, we should still be entitled to put them and those opposed should do likewise.

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 49, to delete lines 21 to 26 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;the estate shall be distributed in equal shares to the surviving civil partner and each of the children of the deceased civil partner&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment, tabled by Senators John Hanafin, Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and me, refers to section 73 and deals with intestacy.  Section 73 inserts a new section after section 67 of the Succession Act 1965.  The newly inserted subsection 67A(1) of the Succession Act will deal with a situation where a person dies intestate leaving a civil partner and no issue.  It provides that the civil partner will take the entire estate.  I recognise there is an element of equity in this provision and I do not have difficulty with it. However, I have concerns about the newly inserted subsection 67A(2) and our amendment would change it.  It states that if an intestate dies leaving a civil partner and children the surviving civil partner is entitled to two thirds of the estate and the remaining shall be distributed among the children.</P>
        
        <P>I have had some slight discussion with the Minister on this matter.  I ask Senators to picture a scenario where a husband dies, leaving his estate to his wife.  He also leaves three children.  The new family unit is a mother and three children.  The mother subsequently enters into a civil partnership with another woman.  Should she die, her children&rsquo;s inheritance would be confined to a small proportion of their parents&rsquo; estate.  We think this is inequitable.</P>
        <P>We fully accept that the surviving civil partner is entitled to a proportion of the estate.  However, the children of the deceased civil partner are not adequately catered for in the Bill, although I understand there is provision for them to go to court and seek a redistribution of the estate.  Our preference is that the estate be divided in equal share to the surviving civil partner and each of the children of the deceased civil partner.  In the example I gave, the civil partner would then get 25% of the estate and not two thirds, and each of the children would get 25% and not one third of one third, or approximately 10%.  We think that is fairer and it is the motivation behind the amendment.</P>
        <P>A second issue arises from this.  The widow and her three children would be regarded, constitutionally, as a family unit.  Once she enters a civil partnership that unit no longer exists.  It looks to me as if there could be a constitutional issue here.  The provisions of the Bill do not adequately address the surviving members of her family, her three children.</P>
        <P>There are two issues to consider.  One is the possible infringement of the constitutional regard for the family.  The other is the more important issue of fairness to the children of the deceased member of a civil partnership.  A surviving civil partner might well be self sufficient or quite wealthy whereas the children might have only a small proportion of their parents&rsquo; estate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to clarify the following matter.  If the father of three children died and the children were left in the care of their stepmother, who was their father&rsquo;s second wife, the Succession Act would affect them similarly to the children in Senator Walsh&rsquo;s example.  They would be entitled to a share of one third of their father&rsquo;s estate and their stepmother would be entitled to two thirds.  The legislation would also have to be changed if the equity called for in the amendment were to apply to them.  All succession legislation regarding how families work would need to be changed.  I ask the Minister to clarify my query.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I oppose this amendment.  On Committee Stage, Labour Senators tabled two other amendments to section 73, which we felt would have clarified the section.  One of our amendments would have been to delete the phrase, &ldquo;subject to subsections (3) to (7)&rdquo; in subsection 67A(2)(a).  The Law Society of Ireland had recommended that those words should be deleted to avoid litigation and uncertainty and to make it clear that the surviving civil partner would take two thirds of the estate of the intestate civil partner who had died.  This would have put them on par with the surviving spouse of a marriage.  We felt that would have been an improvement to the legislation.  Unfortunately, due to the filibustering and obstruction earlier, we did not have an opportunity to put that but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the amendment for the simple reason that, as Senator Twomey said, we would have to examine the Succession Act in order to amend this matter.  However, as a practitioner, I have seen many instances where the two thirds, one third rule on intestacy has put many people living in their family homes in jeopardy.  I accept there is a point to the amendment but the only way around it is to write a will, a matter that has been quite readily advertised lately.  Other than that, there is an issue we need to consider in the tenet of the amendment but I do not believe we can accept it on this occasion.</P>

	<P>On the amendment, rules are being provided on intestacy to the effect that a civil partner would take two thirds of the estate over and above any issue of the person.  When one considers that the Constitution supports the institution of marriage on which the family is founded, it seems that respect for the family should survive the death of a spouse.  If, in the event of the death of a spouse, a person enters civil partnership &mdash; perhaps the Minister can correct me on this &mdash; it would seem bizarre that the rights of a subsequent civil partner could trump the issue of the marriage.</P>
        <P>As the fellow would say, I have had no more than a glansory curse at this because of the guillotine but it does seem to raise constitutional issues.  I do not see how we can in any credible way uphold the ability of the Seanad to discuss an issue as profound as this in circumstances where there is such a ridiculous guillotine.</P>

	<P>This amendment has the merit that it refers to the children of the deceased civil partner.  We have said that one of the gaps in the legislation is the fact children are not dealt with.  However, the overall thrust of the amendment is to denigrate and discriminate further against those who are in civil partnership and to put them in a less advantageous position.  For that reason, I do not believe it should be supported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendment No. 1 would have the effect of substantially altering the rules of distribution on intestacy for civil partners where the deceased had a child or children.  The civil partner would be entitled to the same share of the deceased&rsquo;s estate as each child of the deceased if this amendment was to be accepted.  Section 73 states that if an intestate dies leaving a civil partner and issue, the civil partner shall be entitled to two thirds of the estate and the remainder shall be distributed among the issue, which equates to the position in <Col N="354"/>regard to a heterosexual family.  This amendment, therefore, would substantially erode the rights of the deceased civil partner. For example, in the case of an adult and three children, the adult civil partner would be entitled to two thirds of the estate and the remaining one third would be equally distributed among the children.  However, under this proposal, the civil partner would only get one quarter of the estate and the children would each get one quarter.  Such a distribution would be novel and would substantially erode the rights of a deceased civil partner.</P>
        
        <P>We had some debate where it was suggested there was nothing in the Bill to look after children, which was not correct.  Unfortunately, this was because of the type of debate we had, although I know there were Members even on my party&rsquo;s side who were genuinely worried about the issue of children.  There are several mechanisms contained in the Bill to protect the position of children explicitly, particularly children of a former heterosexual couple now in a civil partnership arrangement.  There is ample further provision to allow civil partners to make greater provision for their children should they wish to do so.  Section 73 protects a child&rsquo;s position by allowing that the child can apply for enhanced provision from the estate of a deceased civil partner-parent on intestacy up to a maximum of the amount that the child would have received had the parent died intestate with no spouse or no civil partner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also always available to the civil partner, as some Senators have suggested, to make a will providing a greater share or, indeed, no share of the estate for these children.  Section 83 inserts a new section in the Succession Act which allows a civil partner in an ante civil partnership registration contract to renounce his or her legal right in the estate of the civil partner.  Thus, a civil partner who wishes to make extensive provision for his or her children can arrange for such a contract to be made in advance of registering a civil partnership and can then make a will giving that enhanced provision to their children.</P>
        <P>The rules on intestacy replicate those in regard to heterosexual couples save that &mdash; this is the protection for children of a prior arrangement &mdash; under the new section 67A:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Court may, on the application by or on behalf of a child of an intestate who dies leaving a civil partner and one or more children, order that provision be made for that child out of the intestate&rsquo;s estate only [this is the important part] if the court is of the opinion that it would be unjust not to make the order, after considering all the circumstances, including&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the extent to which the intestate has made provision for that child...</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the age and reasonable financial requirements of that child,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the intestate&rsquo;s financial situation, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) the intestate&rsquo;s obligations to the civil partner.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I cannot accept the amendment, which would lead to a diminution of the rights of the civil partner on intestacy.  It would lead to discrimination in the way they are treated <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> heterosexual couples.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  His latter comment accords with Senator Twomey&rsquo;s comment that because our amendment would not mirror the marriage arrangement, it is in some way &ldquo;diminishing&rdquo; or eroding the rights of the surviving partner.  I thought that until the civil partnership Bill is enacted, there are no rights prescribed in law and we are prescribing these rights today.</P><Col N="355"/>
        <P>People have said this would discriminate against the civil partner and I appreciate the point made by Senator Twomey with regard to a step-parent etc. but we are discriminating against children.  That is a matter of genuine concern to me and others who signed their name to the amendment.  We must be particularly careful about the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also mindful that the inheritance generated and distributed may well have been accumulated through the efforts of the father of a child who because of a premature death will not have a say because he left the inheritance to his wife.  There are fairly fundamental issues in this going beyond just the rights of the civil partner.  I note the reply to me and comments made by other people concern the rights of the adult and not the rights of children.  This is a child-centred amendment and it should be considered.  I also note the Minister did not make any reference to any constitutional implications.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This applies equally to children of a deceased partner as well as children of a prior marriage, so there is no discrimination against the children involved.  For that reason it is a pro-children measure and seeks to protect children in circumstances where they may not gain any provision in a position of intestacy.  We believe it will stand up to constitutional examination because it is endeavouring to deal with a position where there may be children of a prior marriage as part of the civil partnership arrangement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 56, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(4) The Act of 2000 is amended by inserting:</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;Nothing in this Act, or in the Acts amended by this Act, shall prohibit a religious, educational, social or community organisation, which is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values, from refusing to provide property, goods or services that assist or promote the solemnisation or celebration of any civil partnership or marriage, or provide counselling or other services that directly facilitate the perpetuation of any civil partnership or marriage, where such refusal is reasonably necessary to prevent the undermining of the religious ethos of the institution.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As Members know, we have always been very conscious of the ethos of the churches and religious organisations.  We have generally endeavoured in legislation to accommodate the issue and one of the reasons the Minister has not included churches is precisely for that reason.  He wishes to avoid any misunderstanding and he is right in that respect.</P><Col N="356"/>
        <P>The same provision should have been extended to church property and religious organisations with a particular religious ethos and policy.  This is different than people in private circumstances refusing to provide services.  The mere fact that we have made a distinction for churches in this and other legislation shows we are particularly conscious of that need.</P>
        <P>The Minister may have to some extent extended the view on the issue by indicating that if we are talking about a hall, it would also be used for other community purposes.  Very often those other community purposes are related to church activities and therefore have a particular ethos attached.  For that reason I ask the Minister to reconsider the issue, upon which I have had exceptionally strong views.</P>
        <P>Somebody said he or she could not imagine a gay couple wishing to use the property of a church or religious organisation if there was an existing antipathy.  That may be so but I would be sorry if people had to feel such a way in the context of antipathy or otherwise.  Interestingly, commenting on what Senator Norris said earlier I asked that we tease out the possibility that where a religious organisation or church wishes to provide a service, and if the service included the registration of the ceremony, I would see reason in that case to debate the matter.  For the same reason, if a difficulty is provided for the ethos and policy of a church, it is not enough to say a gay couple is most unlikely to use it.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn in another context stated that it is not good legislation to say a possibility does not arise.  It should not be like that and in this case it is more than a legal issue that is involved.  There is an element of symbolism that is important in this case also.  The Minister might find it possible to extend the same view as has informed the legislation in regard to the church itself; if that could be extended to church property or religious organisations with a particular policy or position, it would be helpful in the acceptance of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  We take no credit for the drafting of the amendment, which we used because we were taken by the content coming from Christian church leaders who circulated it to all.  It covers not only civil partnership but also marriage, or divorced marriage, which might be against the ethos of the church.  That would exclude them from the issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Article 44.2.1&deg; of the Constitution states &ldquo;Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen&rdquo;.  Our amendment is specifically and exclusively directed at church bodies and organisations.</P>
        <P>I noticed the Minister dismissed some of my earlier comments regarding comparisons with Britain.  I hope he will follow through on that ethos and thinking by looking at the common law system we inherited from the British and look to introduce Napoleonic code structures into the system.</P>
        <P>In Britain Catholic adoption agencies had to accept the equal status Act and terminated their service as a consequence.  In the US, Connecticut and Vermont have provisions for a conscience clause and it takes in churches in regard to civil marriage in Vermont.  The legal provisions indicate:</P>
        <P LI="1">The civil marriage laws shall not be construed to affect the ability of a society to determine the admission of its members as provided in section 4464 of this title... and shall not require a society that has been established and is operating for charitable and educational purposes and which is operated, supervised, or controlled by or in connection with a religious organization to provide insurance benefits to any person if to do so would violate the society&rsquo;s free <Col N="357"/>exercise of religion, as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of United States.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In respect of public accommodations it is stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a religious organization, association, or society, or any individual who is managed, directed, or supervised by or in conjunction with a religious organization, association, or society, or any nonprofit institution or organization operated, supervised, or controlled by or in conjunction with a religious organization, association, or society, shall not be required to provide services, accommodation, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges to an individual if such request for such services [were to contravene their ethos] . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is what we are trying to achieve in the amendment.</P>
        <P>I listened carefully to the debate.  We were challenged in respect of ensuring we did not discriminate against people or minorities, on the one hand, while ensuring people&rsquo;s freedom of conscience would be protected, on the other.  In this instance, the church does discriminate.  In other very liberal states, however, provision is made for that type of exercise by the church of its own ethos.  That is our strongly held, conscientious view on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not support the amendments, particularly as they constitute another effort at discrimination.  Amendment No. 2 deals with church property, while amendment No. 3 in the name of Senator Mullen goes further in the context of individuals being allowed to discriminate.  The amendments are designed to derogate from the normal equal status and equality provisions contained in existing legislation in order to allow for discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.  That is why I oppose them.  Like many of the other amendments tabled, they seek to undermine objective behind the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined the arrangements &mdash; information in this regard is also set out in the explanatory memorandum to the legislation &mdash; whereby church property or other property is used for the solemnisation or celebration of civil partnership or marriage.  In that context, I do not believe amendment No. 2 is necessary.  It comes down to a choice with regard to where civil registration is to occur and whether there is solemnisation or celebration of civil unions.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 3, in circumstances where one provides or supplies goods or services, there are protected grounds set down in existing legislation which prevent discrimination.  Where buildings owned by religious bodies are rented out for non-religious purposes to the public generally or to a section of the public, the provisions to which I refer apply.  Said provisions prohibit discrimination on the nine grounds set out in the relevant Acts.  The Bill before the House adds civil partnership status to the protected grounds by replacing marital status with an extended civil status ground.</P>
        <P>Where a church or religious institution operates in a commercial environment such as that relating to the leasing or renting of properties, it is bound by the Equal Status Act in respect of the supply of goods and services.  I do not see why that should be changed.  In addition, I do not understand how it could conceivably undermine the ethos of a church or religious institution &mdash; the matter to which amendment No. 3 in the name of Senator Mullen relates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not see a basis for these amendments, other than that they seek to maintain in our society discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.  I urge, therefore, that they be rejected.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="358"/>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Regan seems to be unaware &mdash; I know that this is not actually the case &mdash; of the many exceptions in our equality legislation which are designed to achieve the common good and protect people from capricious or unfair proceedings.  Amendment No. 3 is the only amendment I have tabled on Report Stage.  The rather delicate fig leaf of parliamentary scrutiny which obtained was ripped away by the decision to guillotine the debate on the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 would not undermine the objective behind the Bill in any way.  It would, however, temper the effect of the Bill in some areas.  While I wish those who will benefit from the legislation the very best &mdash; I am genuinely delighted for them &mdash; we should spare a thought for those whose freedoms will be curtailed by its enactment.  As a result of what has happened here today, the Bill will leave the House tainted.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 is very much based on the existing section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 2000.  It is interesting to note that the courts stated employment equality legislation would not have been constitutional were it not for the inclusion therein of section 37 which allows religious-run institutions to make employment decisions, where necessary, in order to prevent the undermining of their ethos.  If that is the delicate balance required as a result of the provisions in the Constitution relating to freedom of conscience and religion, it should follow that the Bill before us which creates a new potential scenario because of the inclusion of civil status among the prohibited grounds of discrimination could lead to a curtailment of the freedom of religious institutions to act and operate fully on the basis of their ethos.</P>
        <P>As with one of the amendments we discussed during the truncated Committee Stage debate, I have sought carefully to delimit the circumstances involved.  It is not a question of allowing discrimination, rather it is a question of providing that certain situations shall not constitute discrimination.  I have confined the amendment but enough scope is retained in order that &ldquo;A religious institution or an educational, social or community organisation which is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values&rdquo; would not be taken to discriminate on the marital or civil status grounds or on the sexual orientation ground if it does not provide goods and services.  I have further curtailed the provision by requiring that these entities would only enjoy such an exemption where it related to matters directly related to the occasion of such a solemnisation or registration or where it involved relationship counselling or adoption services.  It would, therefore, be a clearly delimited ethos protection provision.</P>
        <P>The reason I have brought forward this provision is, as stated on Committee Stage, there are different views and values within our society and the ethos of the religious institutions which have contributed so much to the life of this country for a long period differs from what is becoming the prevailing secular ethos.  The question arises as to whether we should condemn them for this or whether we should find a way to accommodate them in order that the freedoms people enjoy will be balanced.  That is what the amendment involves.  It is not about discriminating against any section of the community, rather it is about following in the tradition of allowing certain exemptions to equality legislation.  Such exemptions can be found at many locations for those who wish to seek them out.</P>
        <P>Under the Bill before the House, there is a possibility that people&rsquo;s right to live and act according to their ethos could be crushed.  The protection offered under the proposal I have brought forward would come in two parts.  The first relates to religious institutions and the second to private individuals, sole proprietors or small businesses.  It cannot be stated amendment No. 3 relates to State officials, rather it relates to private providers of goods and services. <Col N="359"/> Does the Minister want such people to be obliged to lie?  If a photographer would rather not spend the day taking pictures at a civil partnership ceremony with which he or she has a moral problem, do we want him or her to lie about his or her reasons for not offering his or her services?  Does the Minister wish it to be the case that it should be fair dinkum for the Equality Authority to pursue such individuals?  Do we want people to be obliged to lie and say they are busy in order that they do not have to supply their services?  If we want to be mature and accept that our society really does believe in pluralism &mdash; after today&rsquo;s use of the guillotine I would be surprised if many actually did believe in it &mdash; we should try to find a way to accommodate the aspirations of others, even if we deplore them.  Even if one deplores the aspirations or religious objections of others &mdash; I do not deplore them but there are others present who do &mdash; it does not follow that one should seek to crush them or discourage people from harbouring them, as was the case with religion in Soviet Russia.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 contains a narrow exemption which recognises that some have conscientious objections in this regard.  The amendment would limit people&rsquo;s right to go their own way in respect of the circumstances directly relating to the occasion of a solemnisation or registration.  I would include a celebration in this regard because I do not want the Minister to raise the stock point relating to a sacred space.  I am not interested in that matter and have never made the argument in respect of it.  I am referring to parish halls, church halls, halls owned by the Knights of Columbanus and so on.  I am not espousing my own views on this matter.  I regard myself as a pragmatic person and I am not necessarily sure what decision I would take in the circumstances to which I refer.  As a legislator, however, I wish to legislate for people whose views I do not believe should be regarded as being second class.</P>
        <P>That is all I have to say on the matter.  I recognise that no matter what I say, I will be treated to the same answer as previously.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will refer to a related point, which is the non-issue of the hypothetical homophobic registrar who might at some point wish not to register a civil partnership.  These amendments go well beyond the point we have already debated.  Senator Mullen has suggested they are narrowly drafted &mdash; far from it.  This measure would involve an enormous new exemption to the equality legislation.  I agree with him that there are existing exemptions to the equality legislation.  We should not add to them by providing for a further mandate or charter to discriminate.  Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 would allow religious-run community centres and the owners of hotels and small businesses to discriminate not only against civil partners but also against people entering a marriage if it for some reason offended the religious ethos or views of the proprietor of the business or the manager of the community centre.  If a previously divorced couple are remarrying and wish to have their reception in a hotel, the hotel owner will be permitted to refuse them under this measure without being subject to the equal status legislation.  It is clear that these amendments would provide for extra discrimination by the back door.  They would drive a coach and horses through the new civil partnership legislation and the existing equality legislation.  We live in a republic.  This is not a theocracy.  The only justification for introducing amendments of this nature would be a theocratic one, to the effect that laws should derive in some way from the Christian churches, which were behind the drafting of some of these amendments, apparently.</P>

	<P>Many Members of the House understand the ethos of this country&rsquo;s churches and their members.  These amendments seem to reflect the ethos of the churches in managing their affairs and the ethos of individuals in dealing with civil partnership unions.  It is true that churches, like individuals, have rights.  The people who are involved in civil partnerships have rights as well.  The need to balance the rights of both groups is probably one of the reasons we have reflected on this legislation for so long.  A forensic and detailed debate on this issue would have been very useful.  I regret to say we have not had such a debate today, however.  Senator Mullen has criticised Fine Gael Senators in this respect.  When he gets an opportunity to read the transcript of the Committee Stage debate, he will see that it verged on the farcical.

I accept that they have a fully democratic right to do so.  I support that right.  I retain a feeling of shame that my fellow citizens and Members of this House have behaved in such a way.  If I heard Senator Walsh correctly, it appears that the wording of one of his amendments was supplied by a church.</P>

	<P>I consider it really appalling.  I want to examine what the amendment actually means.  I listened to Senator Quinn speak movingly about isolation and loneliness etc.  I challenge him in that regard.  Amendment No. 3 in his name proposes that people may be excluded by a &ldquo;community organisation&rdquo;.  It seems that we are not to be part of community organisations at particular times.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 2 proposes that these organisations be allowed to refuse to &ldquo;provide counselling&rdquo;.  The Senators want to prevent the provision of counselling.  One of the worst aspects of the amendment is its reference to refusing to provide &ldquo;services that directly facilitate the perpetuation&rdquo; of the relationship.  This measure has been proposed by the Senators who were talking about commitment and marriage.  How dare they?  Do they not feel ashamed?  I should point out that some of these buildings may have been paid for by taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>

I do not care if the church that assisted with the compilation of this amendment is my church, although I would like to know if it is.  If that is the case, I will contact the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Neill, tonight.  I doubt he had anything to do with it because I know he is an honourable man.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak on the rest of this disgusting tissue.  It seeks to allow &ldquo;any private individual, sole proprietor or small business&rdquo; to refuse to provide goods and services.  Are we to protect a shop that refuses to sell wedding trinkets or a bouquet of flowers?  I cannot believe that gentle people I have respected for so long &mdash; Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Quinn &mdash; have signed their names to such a proposal.  If either of them is surprised, or expresses shock, that the gay community might feel antipathy towards a church, I suggest to them that the antipathy is coming entirely the other way, if it is the case that these proposals were drawn up by a church.  I cannot believe that having heard the strong expression of my genuine feelings yesterday, Senator Quinn signed his name to this shocking piece of attempted or purported legislation.</P>

	<P>These amendments are not worthy of support due to their discriminatory nature, as outlined by Senator Regan.  Senator Norris has highlighted how shameful they are and what it would mean if they were accepted.  Senator Bacik alluded to the manner in which those who have proposed these amendments have sought comfort by referring to exemptions in other legislation.  I agree with her that we should be providing for fewer exemptions rather than more.  The last thing we should do is provide for more exemptions.  When we draft legislation, we should always seek to provide for equality.  The more exemptions we have, the less equal is the legislation.  I do not think I share the same understanding of the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; as others who have spoken about it, including Senator Mullen.  He does not seem to think that exempting and listing people counts as discrimination.  I agree with Senator Norris that when one examines what is being proposed, one would expect people to be ashamed to put their names to it.  What we have lost sight of is a sense of the purpose of this legislation which is to provide a legal basis for people in a loving relationship&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I had intended to speak on section 23 but decided there was no point.  The most objectionable point about it was that comfort was being sought for the hypothetical registrar as if he or she were the injured party when the injured parties were those people being denied the right to marry.  That was lost sight of completely.  These amendments do not warrant anyone&rsquo;s support.</P>

	<P>To my colleagues who tabled these amendments I say, &ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;  If a reinforcing argument was needed for passing this legislation today, it is found in these two amendments.  I have just re-read section 7 of the Equal Status Act which has similar wording, as Senator Mullen noted.  Doing so brought back the sick feeling I had in my stomach when that legislation went through.</P>

	<P>No interruptions, please.  Members have had an opportunity to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw the law being abused for the past ten years to threaten, frighten and control people, especially teachers who had not come out in regard to their sexual orien<Col N="364"/>tation.  I have seen this repeatedly and have met teachers and groups who outlined chapter and verse to me but would not allow me to become involved or do anything.  One walks away angry, biting keen to do something but afraid to because that would expose or further threaten those people.  On occasion, Senator Norris attended some of those meetings with me.  I felt inadequate as a public representative.</P>
        <P>The idea that people celebrating their relationship cannot go and buy a box of burgers or whatever they want for a barbecue is appalling.  It is only one step from not being allowed breathe the air or come into a room.  It is appalling, distasteful and offensive.</P>
        <P>I ask my colleagues, having listened to the debate, to withdraw the amendments and not put this issue to a vote.  It undermines all the arguments made.  One cannot support those two amendments and at the same time claim to support the rights of people who, in different ways, are the subject of this Bill.  It does not add up.  Both notions do not come together.  It also proves another point which I have been making since 1977.  Before one can change habits and attitudes one must change legislation.  The Employment Equality Act 1977 did more to change attitudes than any other factor.  No attitudes were changed until that came about.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is crucial.  If this measure were applied to any other group in society, whether Travellers or anyone else, people would be appalled.  It is desperate.  As to ethos, I have appealed 24,000 times for someone to define that word.  We finished up in primary schools with 3,000 different applications &mdash; perhaps I should call them ethoi &mdash; but there is no definition in the Education Act, the Equal Status Act or the amendment to the Employment Equality Act.  Ethos means whatever people wish it to mean.  It is <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> stuff, it is what I say it means.  If one uses words such as &ldquo;undermining&rdquo; or &ldquo;maintaining&rdquo; or &ldquo;essential to the ethos&rdquo;, one winds up in court and is told that something quite other is the ethos as seen by another person.  Ethos can be anything and there are no restrictions on it.  This is open sesame to discriminate.  It is worse than anything in the Equal Status Act.  Once again, it is proposed to give licence to people to run through the legislation.  I appeal to my colleagues who tabled these extraordinarily distasteful, offensive and embarrassing amendments to withdraw them.</P>

There are some brilliant examples in the history of this country, instances in many areas, at many times, where minorities have been trodden upon.  Why would anyone want to introduce a measure that would give a green light to people to discriminate against a minority of people?</P>

	<P>I remind those Members who tabled these amendments today that since 2000 it is against the law to discriminate in the provision of goods and services based on nine grounds, namely, gender, age, race, nationality, sexuality, marital status and membership of the Travelling community.  I understand the beliefs of those who tabled the amendments although I do not agree with them.  If we were to accept this amendment, it would maintain discrimination.  As Senators &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, McDonald and others have noted, it would send people further underground.</P>

	<P>It would make discrimination legal.  I fail to see Senator Mullen&rsquo;s point about the amendment achieving common good.  How would it achieve the common good?  What is the common good?  What does he understand by common good according to this amendment?  To me, as a Christian, a Catholic and a legislator, this is not about common good <Col N="366"/>or maintaining the rights of people.  This is erosion and the taking away of rights.  This is not about the common good but about putting forward a proposition to play to the Senator&rsquo;s electoral gallery.  Let us get real.

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Owing to pressures of time, I will call only the Minister and lead speaker from each of the parties and the Independent group.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="368"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I am under time constraints, I appreciate the Cathaoirleach allowing me to speak and thank him and the staff of the Seanad.  I also thank my staff who have been working with me on the Bill for a number of months.  They have been excellent and available at all times and the job they have done is a credit to the public service.  We heard a great deal about public servants having objections or otherwise to doing their public duty.  I assure the House that in this instance we have been very well served.  I thank the Attorney General and the staff of his office who were also assiduous in the responses they provided, particularly given the constraints of time.</P>
        <P>As I stated, both in this House and the other House, my party, before the previous general election, made a commitment to provide a legal framework for gay and lesbian couples.  The preamble to this was a statement that it was to be done based on the republican ethos of our party and the equality agenda to which we are committed.  These were significant words and this is a proud day for my party that we have been able to introduce this progressive legislation.  I fully accept, however, that there are people inside and outside my party who may have difficulties with the Bill.  That public representatives can argue their position without falling out with each other shows a sense of maturity.  As I stated previously, I have good friends on the other side of this equation but we will remain friends following the enactment of the Bill.</P>
        <P>As I noted on Second Stage, one thing we learned and I, as a heterosexual person, had not appreciated was that other people are directly affected by the lack of rights and duties available to gay and lesbian people.  They include family members and friends who are affected as a result of the difficulties associated with a person coming out as gay or lesbian.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This has been a good day&rsquo;s work for the Oireachtas and politics generally.  I stated, to a certain extent jocosely, that I should examine my conscience.  In my 23 years in Leinster House and especially in my 13 years as a Minister, I have not had so many people on all sides agreeing with me.  I do not believe I have ever secured such a large majority in this House.  While I may have had frayed nerves on Committee Stage, the speeches made on Second Stage were a credit to this House and public representatives of all political parties.  In that respect, I pay due regard to the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party in both Houses, the other parties and the Independent Members of the Seanad.  This is a good day for politics and I thank everyone for their forbearance in ensuring the Bill passed.  I hope it will be signed into law by the President in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the enactment of this Bill.  I have never worked so hard to get Government legislation through the House.  As one can see, all Fine Gael Party Senators supported the Bill because it is the right thing to do.  It is good legislation that is modelled on Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy document of 2004 which carved out the civil partnership approach to resolving this problem in a manner that does not trespass on the constitutional guarantees and protection for the family.</P>
        <P>The Bill reflects changes in society, the extent of same-sex couple and cohabitee relationships and the acceptance by the vast majority that civil union relationships should be given legal recognition and protection.  It is also an attempt to end the victimisation, discrimination and hostility which has been shown to the gay community over the years.  For Members of the House it has been an exercise of conscience to be fair and reasonable and tolerant of the gay community.   It is the Christian thing to do.  That is what we have done here over the past two days.  We have had a good debate.  It deteriorated at certain times and became a sham debate.  It became taut because there is an issue of discrimination.  The objective of the Bill was to end discrimination and we did not want to see any of that creep back into the Bill.  I commend the work of the Department, the Minister and everyone who contributed to it.  The input of the Independent Senators who have spoken and raised issues made for a good debate.  It was too <Col N="369"/>prolonged, but nevertheless valid issues were raised.  The debate centred on the merits of those arguments more than on the personalities.  I am very happy with the Bill and I am happy that we have fully supported it.  It is legislation that reflects a more modern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a truly historic day.  I agree 100% with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that we have done a good day&rsquo;s work.  In fact it has been a good couple of days&rsquo; work.  I note with some pleasure the collaborative nature of our efforts.  The Minister said it was a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  We then learned that it was modelled on a Fine Gael Bill.  I do not think we should leave out the Green Party without whose pivotal involvement we might not have had the Bill at all.  I also acknowledge the Labour Party which was second into the field because with my usual modesty I must point out that I put the first Civil Partnership Bill before this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister knows I had reservations.  I was very concerned about the children.  I very much welcome the clear and positive indications he has given that what we all agree is a lacuna in the Bill will be speedily addressed, to which I very much look forward.  I had intended and had signalled my intention to vote against the Bill, but after the extraordinary and dramatic developments of the past one and a half hours, I was left with absolutely no moral alternative to walking through the division lobbies with all my colleagues.  I never thought in my dreams that I would walk shoulder to shoulder with almost the entire membership of Seanad &Eacute;ireann into the division lobbies to vote for this kind of wonderful liberalising legislation.  I am proud that this day has come.  It is a massive overwhelming victory.  It is a victory, not for gay people nor for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party, the Labour Party or the Independents; it is a victory for decency and this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I add my voice to the voices of others very much welcoming the passage of the Bill.  I thank the Minister and his officials who have worked so hard on the Bill.  I ask the Minister not to get too used to such a big majority; it may not last.  However, it was nice to be part of such a genuine consensus on the issue.  I also thank the many non-governmental organisations and individuals, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery now, who have worked for so many years to make this happen.  It has been a long road to introduce this legislation.  It is 17 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  Senator Norris and others have been working for many years on this legislation.  A tribute must be paid to Senator Norris who introduced the first legislation on civil partnership, followed closely, of course, by the Labour Party with the two Bills introduced in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Howlin in 2006 and 2007.  All parties rightly support this legislation.  It is a great day to see that we all support it.</P>
        <P>Of course, the Labour Party has been critical of the legislation.  We said it does not go far enough.  In particular we were critical of the major omission of children and children&rsquo;s rights from the Bill.  However, I was very heartened by what the Minister said last night in proposing a comprehensive review of children&rsquo;s rights in other legislation to come.  We very much look forward to that.  We are also very heartened by such a major shift in public opinion and such a vast majority in favour of the legislation as shown by the very small minority who sought to oppose it.</P>
        <P>This is a day for celebration.  We all look forward very much to the first civil partnership ceremony taking place in this jurisdiction and we see it very much as a stepping stone and a step forward towards true equality for gay people and all of us in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I acknowledge the wonderful work done by the Minister, his staff and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister put considerable personal effort and thought into the Bill.  It is ground-breaking legislation that will join him with people such as the wonderful M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn who decriminalised <Col N="370"/>homosexuality back in 1993.  In years to come when we look back at ground-breaking legislation, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will go down in the annals of history for his courage in bringing this Bill through the Houses today.</P>
        <P>The legislation gives rights to gay and lesbian people that they did not have yesterday, which gives grounds for celebration.  I am delighted the mood has lifted in the Chamber.  We had a very fraught Committee Stage and a very taut Report Stage.  That is all about difference of opinion that must be respected, which is why we are here debating the legislation.  The benefit of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is that we get to air these views.  It would be fair to say that if we did not have differences of opinion in politics, we would just be in the realms of public administration.  As politicians we need to lead.  Today we have led the country the right way forward in progressive legislation that will only make people&rsquo;s lives better.  When we talk about people&rsquo;s lives, we must acknowledge that gay and lesbian people now have rights that they did not have and also their families do not need to worry so much any more.  Their mothers and fathers can relax.  It is to be hoped they can enjoy their new-found rights and settle down to enjoy their lives.  I hope it lifts much of the pressure that has been on them in the past 17 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality as we moved towards this point today.  The summer of 2010 has been a very historic time and I am delighted to be here today to welcome and to have supported the passage of the Bill through the House.</P>

	<P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, those who sat in the Chair on your behalf and the staff of the Seanad for their patience, forbearance and even-handedness.  I especially thank the Minister for his stewardship of the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  His name will rightly be associated with one of the most significant pieces of social legislation in this country, on which I congratulate him.  I thank the Members of the House for conducting a debate full of passion and directing Ireland towards a future vision of all citizens being treated more equally.  I thank those who have waited so long for a day such as this, knowing that the Ireland to which we will wake up tomorrow will be a different Ireland.  It will not have changed utterly, but it will have changed significantly.  Our gay friends, our gay family members and other gay members of our community can now walk taller knowing there are rungs on a ladder that have yet to be clung to.  I thank all Members for their co-operation in this debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Obviously, we had concerns.  We expressed concerns over marital status, siblings, freedom of conscience for people, and children.  The step we took was done from our own genuine beliefs and we acted in accordance with those beliefs.  People may criticise us for it and obviously we are getting messages from people who disagree and those who agree.<Col N="371"/>It gave rise to a debate on issues of real importance as to the core values we have in our republic.</P>
        <P>I recognise that this is a very important day for those in the gay community who are in same-sex relationships.  I know that the rights and entitlements which you will gain will give them opportunities in life when they commit to each other which I know they will value.  While I have taken an opposing view on certain aspects of the Bill, I wish them everything I would wish for myself and my family.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister and his officials who have been very helpful to us, as the three of us would acknowledge.  We went through the Bill microscopically with the Minister.  We might not have agreed on everything, but we have been friends for a long time and agreed a long time ago that our differences on the Bill would not cause a breach.  I know he is anxious to get away and where he is going.</P>

However, I recognise the rights it confers on the gay, lesbian and bisexual community.

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Last January the Minister for Finance set out in the D&aacute;il a framework of investigation into the problems that arose in the Irish banking sector.  He stated a comprehensive understanding of the events that took place in the banking sector in recent times was an essential component of recovery.  He noted that, as a Government and Members of the Oireachtaqs, we had a duty to ensure not only that the origins of the crisis were understood, but that lessons were learned and that international and domestic confidence in the banking system was restored in order that the economy could return to growth and employment creation.</P>
        <P>As the first stage of the process of investigation, the two preliminary reports prepared by Klaus Regling and Max Watson and the Governor of the Central Bank, respectively, provide a comprehensive and authoritative examination of the crisis in the banking sector in Ireland.  The authors have given us a detailed and insightful analysis of the global, European and domestic macro-economic factors at play in the relevant period.  Governor Honohan&rsquo;s report details the failures in our regulatory and supervisory arrangements and the weaknesses in the evaluation of the stability of the banks.</P>
        <P>The reports draw attention to a number of issues which require further analysis and provide a sound basis for the further investigation of these significant issues.  The Government welcomes their direction in this respect.  They were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 June and debated.  The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service has had two separate and lengthy engagements with the authors and subsequently with the Minister to discuss how we should proceed.  The meetings allowed a comprehensive airing of the issues raised in the reports and a necessary rebalancing of the initial interpretation and media commentary by highlighting the complex interplay of factors at work that culminated in the extreme turbulence that impacted on the banking system in September 2008.</P><Col N="374"/>
        <P>In their report Klaus Regling and Max Watson distinguish between those issues that are amenable to further investigation through a legally orientated process and other issues which are less concrete and verifiable and may be more appropriately the subject of policy review.  This distinction formed the basis of the Government&rsquo;s proposed approach to the next steps in the process.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the Seanad to a number of points about the findings of the preliminary reports.  Both reports, in particular that of Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson, describe in some detail the nature of the explosion in the availability of credit in the Irish banking sector and characterise the failures in governance and risk management in the banks as &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; and ultimately leading to systemic difficulties in the financial system.  What went on in the banks leading up to the crisis remains a cause of significant public concern.  The public interest demands that we investigate the very serious failures in the standards and controls that should have ensured prudent risk management policy and procedures.</P>
        <P>It is clear that there were particularly egregious failures in corporate governance and risk management at Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society. Certain matters are already the subject of investigation by the relevant authorities and I do not propose to comment on these.  However, there is a clear need to examine more deeply and broadly what went wrong in these two organisations, while taking account of the other investigations.  That is why the draft terms of reference prepared by the Government specifically set out the need for a full examination of the business models and strategies adopted by the boards of these institutions and the implementation by their senior managements of business and lending practices which resulted in these institutions experiencing such uniquely severe financial distress.  The investigation will cover the period from 1 January 2003 to 15 January 2009, the date on which Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Building on the need to investigate failures in governance and risk management, it is proposed that the commission also investigate whether the external auditors commented in their audit reports on the standards and controls and risk management policy and procedures, or on the business models and strategies and business and lending practices that led to the severe difficulties experienced by the banking system.</P>
        <P>On foot of the analysis by Governor Honohan of the failures of financial supervision, there is a need for further examination of the nature of supervision and oversight of the banks by the Financial Regulator.  For this reason, it is proposed that the commission examine the failures of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator to regulate and supervise the covered institutions and maintain financial stability.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference in the draft order laid before the Houses address each of these points in the light of the findings of the preliminary reports.  Under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, a commission of investigation may be established by the Government, with the approval of the Oireachtas, to investigate any matter considered to be of &ldquo;significant public concern&rdquo;.  There can be no doubt that the banking crisis and its origins fall squarely within that category.  It has had a profound impact on the State and its financial position and we will live with its consequences for some time to come.  It is essential that we identify what went wrong and why and that we learn the lessons of the past to ensure we never make the same mistakes again.</P>
        <P>The Minister announced this morning that Mr. Peter Nyberg, the former director general for financial services at the Finnish Ministry of Finance, has agreed to lead the commission.  Mr. Nyberg has all the necessary experience to undertake this important role.  He will be supported <Col N="375"/>by the expertise he requires and provision has been made in the Estimate for the Department of Finance for this year to cover the costs of the commission.</P>
        <P>There are ongoing investigations by the relevant regulatory and other authorities into specific matters of a serious nature in a number of institutions.  The commission of investigation will not supplant or hinder these investigations.  In fact, it is open to the relevant authorities to initiate further investigations into additional possible breaches arising from any findings the commission may make.</P>
      
        <P>The motion before the Seanad seeks approval of the draft Government order laid before the Houses yesterday providing for the establishment of a commission of investigation into the banking sector.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the Seanad to the Government&rsquo;s decision, following the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, to extend the period to be covered by the commission of investigation from 1 January 2003 to 15 January 2009.  This means the commission will now be in a position to examine all relevant matters relating to corporate governance and risk management in each of the banks covered by the Government&rsquo;s guarantee up to the date of the Government&rsquo;s decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>The second motion before this House seeks to refer certain macro-economic policy lessons to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service arising from recommendations set out in the Regling and Watson report.  As is clear from that report, these policy issues can be divided into two groups &mdash; those that relate to macro-economic management and those that relate to financial stability and prudential-supervisory matters.  The former are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance in the first instance and the latter fall within the remit of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government is, therefore, proposing that the joint committee, taking account of the emerging EU proposals on fiscal and economic governance, examines the following matters highlighted in the Regling and Watson report: the role of macro-economic management and surveillance in securing the long-term sustainability of Ireland&rsquo;s economic performance and also in responding on a timely basis to risks and imbalances that may build up in both the private and the public sectors of the economy, including external imbalances <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>other euro area members and the funding of any imbalances that might arise; the role of fiscal policy in securing an appropriate alignment of the national business cycle with monetary conditions in the economy; the requirement for the design and conduct of budgetary and taxation policies to take account of the cyclical nature of particular revenues as well as their temporary nature in certain circumstances in order to maintain an appropriate and effective tax base; and the case for the establishment of new institutional structures to provide an independent validation of economic and fiscal projections as well as for the introduction of domestic medium term fiscal rules.</P>
        <P>Following discussions between the committee and the Minister, it is understood the committee is agreeable to the main elements of the overall proposed scope.  It is proposed that its deliberations be concluded by the end of October in order to publish and report back to this House and to the D&aacute;il by 4 November 2010.</P>
        <P>In regard to the issues within the remit of the regulatory system, the House will be aware that the Central Bank published a report on 21 June setting out its proposed approach to future regulation of the banking sector.  This report also addresses how the range of measures it is putting in place will address the issues raised in the Governor&rsquo;s report and that of Messrs Regling and Watson.  This is another step in the road to the recovery of our banking system.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s view, underpinned by the two preliminary reports, that certain decisions and processes, which are fundamentally political in nature, are not amenable to an <Col N="376"/>investigation, the purpose of which is to make findings of fact.  The Government will not be changing its position on that point and there are no good reasons for it to do so.</P>
        <P>It must also be made clear that the Department of Finance will feature in significant ways in both of these investigations.  First, the terms of reference of the commission require it to examine whether any advices or directions given by the Department of Finance to the Financial Regulator were, in any way, relevant to failure of the Financial Regulator in the performance of its supervisory functions.  Second, in regard to the proposed policy review by the committee, the Minister has already indicated his availability to meet the committee as the accountable Minister to assist it in its deliberations as necessary.  The Minister and the Government have at all times remained accountable to the Oireachtas for decisions taken.  That will continue to be the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, as the Minister has already indicated, he is establishing an independent review by an international expert or experts with relevant international and-or domestic experience to evaluate the systems, structures and processes used by the Department of Finance in providing advice to the Minister and the Government.  The review will examine the Department&rsquo;srole and performance in the past ten years in providing advice for the Minister and the Government.</P>
        <P>The matters we are discussing are important and will have enduring consequences for future economic and financial policy.  It is appropriate, given the scope and cost of measures that have been necessary to stabilise the Irish banking sector, that it be fully and completely investigated and the lessons learned in order to put in place the best systems and structures in the future so this kind of crisis can never happen again.  I commend the motion to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I apologise to Senators for galloping through my speech but time is limited and it was for the purpose of allowing them to have their say.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the investigation of the banking reports by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, the establishment of a banking inquiry and the review of the Department of Finance over the period to which the Minister of State referred. However, there are other very important issues.  There is a need to ensure there is a rapid investigation by the Garda and State authorities to restore confidence in our economic system.  It has been a long time since the Garda went into the headquarters of Anglo Irish Bank.  We need to know how that investigation is proceeding and whether prosecutions will be forthcoming from it.  If anything is <i>sub judice</i>, it will hinder the work we can do in regard to other aspects of the investigation.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">We have put much time and money into NAMA but we now find that the information we were given last October is complete bogus.  We cannot allow that sort of thing to happen.  We cannot investigate this crisis, the way it has affected taxpayers and what it will cost them in future only to find the banks are giving us the wrong information, either deliberately or because they are somehow not capable of putting the information together.  That does not inspire taxpayer confidence in the Government&rsquo;s ability to handle this crisis.</P>
        <P>I hope we will see genuine changes in the way budgets are prepared in future and that all the announcements are not just made on budget day and that we are given some indication as to the position for the following year or the following couple of years.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State indicate whether there will be interim reports?  We do not want to wait three or four years before the final reports land on a Minister&rsquo;s desk when many of the issues about which we are talking will be resolved and the information may well be out ofdate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I commend the motion.  It is important the commission of investigation gets under way quickly.  I welcome the appointment of Mr. Nyberg, former director general for financial services at the Finnish Ministry of Finance, and the work of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, of which I am a member.  I look forward to both these investigations bringing more clarity to the mistakes of the past.  It is a great sign of the maturity of our democracy that we are prepared to take the time to examine the mistakes of the past and learn from them.  These processes will do that and will build on the already good work done in terms of the structural changes we have made in the past couple of years.  I thank the Minister of State and commend the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to explain this.  I welcome the fact the commission is being set up.  It is obviously required after the two earlier reports.  There is a danger that we will have five reports in the same area fairly shortly, including the Honohan report and the Regling-Watson report.  The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong but there will be three inquiries going on.  We will have this commission of inquiry, the policy inquiry and the inquiry into the Department of Finance, which is an awful lot.  I am not sure whether they will overlap.</P>
        <P>I worry about some of the limitations of these inquiries.  The terms of reference are very important and are quite confusing when one looks at them.  My understanding is that a very sensible concession was made at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last Monday in response to a motion tabled by Deputy Burton asking for an extension of the time.  The Minister very sensibly extended the time to the date of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I worry about that.  One of the problems with the last report was that there was a limit on the time until the end of September 2008.  A legitimate complaint at the time was that it did not cover important matters such as the Anglo Irish Bank-Irish Life and Permanent deal, a few other deals and the Sean FitzPatrick deal in which he moved his loans.  This will cover that area and other very sensitive areas, which we have not covered before.  That is very mature. It will also cover the actual process of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, which will be fascinating and useful.</P>
        
        <P>Why does it stop there?  I am not being pedantic.  I am interested in what the Minister of State has to say about this.  He said one never knows when to stop when one is holding inquiries, and I accept that.  However, stopping there is not necessarily a good point.  The Minister of State will be aware, as will all Members of the House, that what had been going on in the banks into which we are inquiring did not stop on 15 January 2009.  It did not stop on 15 February 2009 or even on 15 February 2010.  It has not stopped yet.</P>
        <P>The evidence for this is what Frank Daly, chairman of NAMA, said this week.  The NAMA business plan was revised because the banks had been telling lies, certainly until early this year.  Frank Daly said we are not 100% certain we have sorted the problem out yet.  He said we have got the majority in line but we are not 100% certain of that.  The result of the banks&rsquo; lies is that the NAMA projected profit, which is fantasy, has been turned into a loss.  I do not believe the figures one way or another.  I never did and no one should.  However, the projection went from a profit of &euro;4.8 billion to a possible loss of &euro;800 million.  This was because the banks had been telling lies about what percentage of their loans were being serviced.  They were giving these lies to NAMA.  NAMA was accepting them and making business projections on the basis of them.  The figure has now been revised from 40% to 25%, which means the projections have gone west.</P><Col N="378"/>
        <P>Frank Daly said the banks had been misleading NAMA and getting away with it for a long period.  If this was going on, we need inquiries.  We need to find out how they continued to be able to do this.  Right up to a couple of months ago they were pulling the wool over the eyes of NAMA as well, but our inquiry will stop on 15 January 2009.  I have no objection in detail to this but I object to it in principle.  The inquiry should probably have no time limit on it.  One must restrict its terms somewhere because we do not want it to be like the Mahon tribunal and go everywhere.  I see the problems we will have if we do that.  However, if we restrict the commission&rsquo;s time, we restrict its pursuit of the themes and details, which are so important.  Will the Minister of State explain why the inquiry stops at that point?  I do not want him to say one must draw the line somewhere.  I want him to explain why it stops there and why the inquiry cannot at least pursue a line it is following beyond that date.</P>
        <P>Patrick Honohan did that in his report.  He went beyond his terms of reference, as far as I can remember.  The Minister may not be grateful to him for that but that is what makes him so useful.  He stands up to those who appoint him and does not say exactly what they want him to hear.  He is a wonderful appointment.  I do not know anything about Mr. Nyberg but I accept what Senator MacSharry says about his bona fides.  Let us accept him on face value, not criticise him and hope he is the sort of guy we are looking for.  He is an outsider, which is tremendous.  In that respect, the Minister of State and the Minister have dealt very well with the area of appointing outsiders.  The appointment of people to the Central Bank, to the inquiries and to the regulator&rsquo;s office have been excellent.  I will not say the same about bankers but in that area things have been done extremely well.  Some very good, although unfortunately mostly foreign, appointments have been made.</P>
        <P>I have a reservation and a worry that the restriction to that date means the inquiry is restricted on up-to-date things.  It also restricts inquiry into people who are in positions of power.  That probably plays into the pitch of the golden circle.</P>
        <P>Am I limited in time?</P>

	<P>I apologise.  I did not realise I was taking other Senators&rsquo; time.  If the inquiry is restricted to that period of time, it will tend to restrict itself to the fallen personalities rather than the present ones, and personalities are important.  One of the values of the report will be that the commission will be in a position to criticise those people who are exercising power in the banks at present.  That is very important.</P>
        <P>The report on the Department of Finance, which is peripheral to this, is also important.  That should examine the people in the Department of Finance and not just, as we continually hear, the systems, procedures and structures.  It is fine to talk about systems, procedures and structures but let us also get a look at the mandarins and see what they were doing, who was advising the Minister well, who was advising him badly and who was saying what to whom and when.  This is a people business and not just a structural business.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="379"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the motion.  Questions have been asked as to whether the right methods of inquiry were being followed, whether the right questions were being asked and whether the right people were involved in the process.  There is still dissatisfaction with individuals who fail to take responsibility for what happened and we all share that frustration and impatience.  Nevertheless, the inquiry process has worked well.  People have been identified who were not part of the clique which brought us to where we are.  Some of them are from outside the State and are not part of what is loosely described as the golden circle.  Patrick Honohan has been appointed to the Central Bank and Matthew Elderfield to the Office of the Financial Regulator.  The report was commissioned from Klaus Regling and Max Watson.  Now Peter Nyberg will head the commission of inquiry.  The right approach has been taken and will pay dividends in providing a long-term analysis of why things went wrong and what we need to do to avoid repetition of them.</P>
        <P>That said, I agree with Senator Twomey.  If we are to restore public confidence we must also use the other methods available to us, such as the judicial system and the prosecution services, to identify the key individuals who were involved in these institutions and who made the decisions that brought us to where we are.  I share Senator Ross&rsquo;s view that the impact of both the internal review of the Department of Finance and the commission of inquiry report itself will be in identifying individuals who are still in the system and who had a direct decision-making impact, whether through the provision of wrong information or in taking decisions that led to the State, through the taxpayer, picking up the tab.  Those procedures still have to be put in place.</P>
        <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I am confident that its element of the process, concentrating on policy decisions and the co-operation of those who were involved in the formulating of them, will work very well.  It is important that the three facets &mdash;  the commission of inquiry, the work of the joint committee and the internal review of the Department of Finance &mdash; take place within a very tight timeframe of six months to a year.  This mitigates against the extension of the period to be examined, which Senator Ross proposes.  If we keep extending the date we will make it difficult to complete the inquiries in that narrow timeframe.  The Minister has been very accommodating in placing the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank as the key date in this process.  We will learn more by having a definite date and waiting for the reports that arise from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The more information and analysis we have the better.  I acknowledge that the Regling-Watson and Honohan reports are extremely rigorous and helpful in making an assessment or analysis of what has occurred.  Although I have never heard of the gentleman who has been appointed to lead the commission, I have no reason to believe Senator MacSharry is incorrect when he says he is a person of integrity and experience.  I am sure we will find out more about his level of experience and background in the coming days.  Therefore, we will not hold up this discussion by going through his CV.</P>
        <P>One of the points that strikes me about the sheer number of reports available is that there is at least a risk that various aspects of the problem will be analysed and scrutinised separately from each another.  While perhaps to some extent that is necessary or inevitable given the structures involved, some in the private sectors, for example, the banks, and others in the public sector, for example, the Department of Finance as a discrete body with regard to macro-economic policy decisions, a different approach is required by an outsider.  While I understand this, my concern is that, whereas we might end up with a proliferation of reports, each one of which might be important, stand on its own and contribute to the discussion, ultimately we will all have to pull together.  We can have a debate between ourselves that is purely political in terms of who we say is responsible for what happened and the decisions made by politicians <Col N="380"/>which were were wrong or questionable, but that will remain at the level of a political contest until both sides are armed and equipped with the details of what, in fact, occurred.  That will inform the debate and we will find it more satisfactory to have discussions and even disagreements if they are based on factual information and analysis.</P>
        <P>One of the points that concerns me about the second of the two issues we are discussing relates to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  I am probably the only one present who is not a member of the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross is also not a member.  It is an important exercise.  There was much debate about this issue a few months ago and I recall the Taoiseach being anxious to say he would be available to come to the committee to answer questions.  However, because of the way the terms of reference have been drawn up, they do not suggest the Taoiseach will be going before the committee or will be involved in dealing with issues that were within his remit when Minister for Finance.  I very much hope he will appear before it.  Lest I am accused of what Senator MacSharry used to suggest, namely, of wanting to have a guillotine on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, that is not what I am interested in.  However, in so far as Ministers made decisions which might be open to question and criticism and were put under pressure to make them, this should be analysed and debated.  I raised the issue in the House previously in the context of a recent statement by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who is never mentioned on the other side of the House any more, which is probably understandable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday&rsquo;s man.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>He is still around and will still feature in all of this as our former Taoiseach.  While I do not want to personalise the issue, I raise his involvement for one reason only, that he himself said this recently when asked about his role in what had occurred:</P>
        <P LI="1">&lsquo;Even the self-criticisms in it I accept also, which was mainly the tax incentives.  We probably should have closed those down a good bit earlier, but there were always fierce pressures, there was endless pressures to keep them.  There was endless pressures to extend them.&rsquo;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">He said the pressure had come from developers, owners of sites, areas that didn&rsquo;t have the developments, community councils, politicians and civic society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a very significant statement by the former Taoiseach, one that requires further analysis, scrutiny and debate.  I would have thought that this exercise would occur at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, although I may be naive in thinking that.  I also thought that all the people mentioned, including the current Taoiseach, had said they would be happy to go before the committee.  However, the terms of reference do not suggest that will be the nature of the inquiry at the committee.  Will the Minister of State comment on this?</P>
        <P>I accept there is a wider political environment.  It is a matter for political parties and politicians to analyse the issues involved as they see fit and bring forward proposals, analysis, attack lines and so on.  However, there is also a role for a committee of the Oireachtas to examine policy making, policy decisions and the pressures to which the former Taoiseach referred.  I did not say it; he did.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for agreeing to the motion which obviously was the subject of substantial discussion between the parties.</P><Col N="381"/>
        <P>On Senator Twomey&rsquo;s remarks, there are many who would like to see outcomes, to put it tactfully, to the work of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and so on.  Certainly, what we are establishing will not interfere with this, but, equally, the Government is precluded from interfering.  Nonetheless, the public&rsquo;s wish for developments is nearuniversal.</P>
        <P>With regard to NAMA or anything else being set up, it would be wonderful if one could foresee perfectly all of the difficulties, hitches and developments along the road.  That is not always easy, but, at the same time, because of the extreme importance of the issue which is constantly debated and the subject of questions and media coverage, we also need structured investigations and reports.  I am not concerned about the fact that there will be five reports.  The importance of getting to the bottom of all aspects of what went wrong is so great that one has to examine the issues involved from different angles and through different lenses.  Obviously, there will be overlaps, but it is important to synthesise to reach a conclusion.  I do not believe it is a situation where, although investigations are important, one investigation will provide all the answers.</P>
        <P>The crucial period is the years leading up to the crisis in 2008 and its early stages.  I am very happy the remit has been extended to cover the period leading up to nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank on 15 January.  However, the Government does not consider there would be additional value, at least at this stage, in extending any later the period the commission of investigation will be asked to examine, having regard to the need to ensure it will undertake its work in as efficient a manner as possible and the requirement in the draft order that it complete its report no later than six months from the date of establishment.</P>
        <P>Certainly, listening to debates in this and the other House, Members do not want investigations to continue interminably.  As we have found with many other inquiries &mdash; Senator Ross mentioned some of the tribunals &mdash; if their scope is widened too much, the investigation is prolonged.  There is nothing to stop the Houses from deciding when it comes to November and the report can be debated that further action is needed.  One must take the process a step at a time and we may want the report in November extended to 15 January 2010, which was argued for by the Labour Party and which makes sense.  We should get to November first.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure the Taoiseach and former Taoisigh will, if called upon in an appropriate context, be willing to answer questions.  I agree with Senator Alex White with regard to the quotation from a former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, about tax incentives and the endless pressures to keep and extend them.  I can express a personal view on those and other pressures.  The Houses have been discussing non-financial legislation over recent weeks and people have tried to exert enormous pressure in this regard.  We need to get better at dealing with, withstanding and resisting such pressure because many people seem to believe that legislators such as Deputies and Senators can be pushed around, bullied, intimidated and harassed by groups who very often do not represent any kind of majority but rather represent a vehement view.</P>
        <P>We must get better at combating this.  There was an amendment in the Finance Bill where people wanted to create financial incentives for building primary health care centres.  I was lobbied on the subject but I did not bother either the Minister or the Department of Finance and told the parties involved they were part of a wealthy group and if the complexes were worth building, they could do it on their own.  I argued that incentives had got us into trouble and said goodbye to them.</P>

Whereas companies from Donegal must comply with the registered employment agreement, companies from the Six Counties do not have to comply with the agreement, leading to an anomaly.  I am for an all-Ireland economy and do not advocate the idea that people from Strabane should not be able to bid for a contract in Lifford.  However, a company in Strabane should not be able to bid for a contract in Lifford while paying their employees lower rates than the Donegal company.</P>
        <P>The registered employment agreement sets out minimum wage rates for its workers.  For example, an electrician under the registered employment agreement is paid &euro;21.49 per hour, with the cost to the employer of the labour per week, taking in employer&rsquo;s PRSI and pension contributions, coming to &euro;957.29.  If we allow State contracts to be awarded to companies outside the State which do not have to comply with the registered employment agreement or pension scheme, we are discriminating against our own registered contractors in this State.  There is no way companies in places such as Donegal can compete with those outside the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is there a way to introduce legislation to ensure that out-of-State contractors would be obliged to offer their employees the same terms and conditions laid down by the registered employment agreement in the South?  I note the issue of registered employment agreements has been taken to the High Court and a judicial review was sought with a judgment given last week.  I do not support the idea of renegotiating these agreements but this issue is about ensuring compliance across the island.  I noted the judge in the case stated the agreement applies to self-employed people and subcontractors, and out-of-State workers should enjoy the terms and conditions as laid down in the agreement while working in Southern Ireland.</P>
        <P>An example may clarify the issue.  There is much-needed work ongoing in Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair, a secondary school I attended.  An emergency works scheme will start over the next couple of weeks.  There is a pre-qualification application sent out by the Department of Education and Skills, and this is done across the board.  Some other Departments dealing with public works ask in a questionnaire if the applicant complies with the registered employment agreement or the pension scheme, which is a signal that there is compliance with the agreement.  There is no qualification in the Department of Education and Skills.</P>
        <P>I do not want to name the company which has been successful in the Gweedore project but it comes from outside of the State.  I do not know if it complies with the agreement but having spoken to people involved in the application, it seems likely that companies in the past and in this case may not be compliant with the registered employment agreement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State shed light on this and can legislation be introduced in this respect?  Is the legislation already in place but not enforced adequately?  Could we ensure through pre-<Col N="383"/>qualification documentation from the Department that we ask all companies &mdash; both inside and outside the State &mdash; that they be compliant with the registered employment agreement and pension scheme?  How can we address the issue otherwise as it is currently unacceptable to companies in Donegal?</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney and I understand how many State contracts are going across the Border.  As a republican I have no problem with people across the Border getting the work as long as the employees are treated the same and there is a level playing field.  If it is a case that a company on the other side of the Border can pay a lower wage for doing a job in Donegal than a company from the county, the indigenous companies will not be able to compete.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and his ongoing interest in the area.  I assure the House that one of the objectives of the industrial relations and employment law provisions currently in force in this country is to uphold a level playing field in the construction sector in which common labour costs apply to all contractors under the terms of the registered employment agreements.</P>
        <P>An employment agreement is an agreement made either between a trade union and an employer or employer&rsquo;s organisation at a meeting of a registered joint industrial council which relates to the pay or conditions of employment of any class, type or group of workers.  Such agreements may be presented to the Labour Court for registration.  Where the Labour Court is satisfied that the agreement presented satisfies the statutory requirements, it will register said agreement.  The effect of this is to make the provisions of the agreement legally enforceable in respect of every worker of the class, type or group to which it is expressed to apply and to his or her employer, even if such worker or employer is not a party to the agreement.</P>
        <P>The maintenance of a level playing field with regard to the determination of basic wages and conditions is one of the objectives of the parties to registered employment agreements, REAs.  The existence of these legally backed agreements is one means, recognised under European Union law, of ensuring contractors from outside this jurisdiction do not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs.  As Senator Doherty stated, a recent ruling of the High Court in an action seeking to challenge a decision of the Labour Court upheld the Labour Court&rsquo;s view that in the absence of our system of REAs, contractors from other member states could readily exercise their freedom to provide services in this jurisdiction under the relevant EU treaty at the same rates and conditions of employment as apply in their country of origin.  Accordingly, as all companies who are awarded State contracts are already legally obliged to comply with the relevant REAs, we are of the view that no new legislation is required.</P>
        <P>There are two REAs in place for the construction industry.  The first of these deals specifically with pension, assurance and sick pay, while the second relates to wages and other conditions of employment.  Separately, there is also an REA in place for the electrical contracting industry which covers all terms and conditions of employment in that sector, including pensions and sick pay.</P>
        <P>The construction industry REA in respect of pension assurance and sick pay requires employers in the construction sector to become and remain a party to a contributory pension scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners and sets out the conditions upon which pension and mortality payments are payable, and the associated minimum amounts and benefits.  This REA does not specify any particular pension scheme to apply but rather sets out the general criteria within which any such scheme should operate.  The REA is an agreement reached between employers and trade unions representative of workers in the sector.  The construction workers pension scheme, generally referred to as the CWPS, was established on foot of the REA.  It is an independently run occupational scheme.</P><Col N="384"/>
        <P>While it is not a legal requirement for employers and employees in the construction industry to pay into this particular scheme, it is, as already stated, a legal requirement that employers provide for pension, mortality and sick benefits for those workers to whom the REA applies.  The conditions upon which such pension, mortality and sick pay benefits are payable and the amounts thereof must not be less favourable than those which are set out in the REA.</P>
        <P>The construction industry monitoring agency, CIMA, which was established by the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and ICTU, monitors compliance with the REA with a view to ensuring employers register their employees in the scheme and pay weekly contributions on their behalf.  CIMA engages trade union monitors to follow up on cases of non-compliance and to bring proceedings, where required.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, carried out 395 inspections in the construction sector in 2009.  Among businesses inspected, a compliance rate of 45% was recorded and &euro;252,000 in unpaid wages was recovered for workers.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of the provisions of an REA may also be effected by direct complaint to the Labour Court.  A trade union may complain to the latter that a particular employer is not complying with an REA.  If, after investigating a complaint, the court is satisfied that an employer is in breach of an REA, it may, by order, direct compliance with the agreement.  Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.  In this context, a total of 108 employers in the construction sector were referred by NERA for prosecution in 2009.</P>
        <P>These safeguards are in place to ensure the satisfactory operation of the pension schemes.  They are also designed to ensure non-compliant employers are discovered and do not benefit in any way from their avoidance of their obligations.  Information relating to REAs is disseminated to employers and workers by way of a wide range of structures and organisations, all of which have an important role to play in ensuring compliance by employers with the pay and conditions requirements in those sectors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">NERA provides information for employers and employees on its website and through its call centre in relation to employment rights and responsibilities generally.  This would include responsibilities arising under REAs.  It would also include providing detailed advice if requested.  Other bodies that play an important role in disseminating information on the terms of the REAs in the sector under discussion include the CIF and IBEC.</P>
        <P>The REA system has been the subject of a number of recent legal challenges that have come before the High Court.  Senator Doherty referred to a number of these.  As well as raising issues specific to particular REAs, these challenges also related to the constitutional propriety of the legislative provisions under which they were made.  In this context, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which has passed all Stages in this House and is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, will provide for a number of amendments to the existing legislative framework surrounding the REA and joint labour committee, JLC, systems, including that REAs will be given legal effect in future by ministerial order and that a perceived gap in the scope of parliamentary supervision will be filled by providing for Oireachtas scrutiny of these instruments.</P>
        <P>All construction related projects involving public expenditure must conform to Department of Finance public procurement procedures.  These procedures state that contracting firms, including subcontractors, must be compliant with all statutory legislation, including REAs, when engaged on public works contract.  It is in this way that the level playing field to which I refer is created.</P><Col N="385"/>
        <P Just="Left">The standard public works contract between a contractor and procuring authority requires the former to undertake to ensure the wage rates and other terms and conditions for all workers comply with the relevant REA.  I will raise the specific issue to which the Senator refers in this regard with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills.  Furthermore, the contractor is obliged, for the purposes of the reporting requirements during the course of the contract, to make a statement to the contracting authority certifying compliance with employment rights legislation in respect of each payment due under the contract. If an employer is aware of specific instances where public contracts have been awarded to firms that are not paying their workers their legal entitlements, the matter can be investigated through NERA, the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Act 1969 or the relevant public authority that awarded the contract in the first instance.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">In December last year, the T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment received the report of the inquiry that she had established to investigate the dispute that arose between the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU, and employers in the electrical contracting industry regarding the status of the REA which applies in that sector.  Peter Cassells and Finbarr Flood addressed issues of enforcement and compliance in their report and jointly recommended that the Departments of Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should ensure those sections of the public works contract which oblige contractors engaged in public contracts to observe the terms of the REA are more rigorously enforced by public authorities, including local authorities.  In particular, they highlighted the need to develop a more rigorous system of enforcement in respect of firms from other jurisdictions, including the Six Counties, which undertake short-term assignments in this jurisdiction.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has taken up this issue with the relevant authorities and is also hoping to foster a renewed spirit of co-operation between the trade union and employer bodies in that regard.</P>
        <P>I again thank Senator Doherty for his ongoing interest in this matter.  I will correspond directly with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills on the specific issue relating to Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair and revert to the Senator in respect of it at a later date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I am glad he is present to respond in respect of this matter.  During the debate on the Civil Partnerships and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009 today, there was a great deal of discussion with regard to republicanism.  There are many connotations attaching to republicanism.  However, the ability of people to live beside each other and respect each other&rsquo;s differences lies at the core of what true republicanism involves.</P>
        <P>Last year, I compiled a report for the Council of Europe on how history is taught in post-conflict areas.  I spent approximately 12 months gathering information while visiting places such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Northern Ireland.  The one message that came across to me during that period is that we on the island of Ireland must find a way to respect each other and live together.  Education in this regard must begin with young children and must be carried until people reach adulthood.  I discovered that teachers must be given the ability to explain the standpoint of those on the other side or in the other community.  Educational policies needed <Col N="386"/>to be developed to help that.  Strategies needed to be developed to that end.  Too often, we think that means we are talking about some other group of people.  In reality, the Twenty-six Counties are as bad as the Six Counties when it comes to a lack of perception or understanding of the other community.</P>
        <P>I am raising this matter to highlight a short advertisement I saw over the weekend.  When I happened to turn on the television, there were two little cartoon characters on the screen.  One was playing with a red, white and blue drum and the other one was playing with a red, white and blue baton.  They seemed to be having great craic in the playground until they suddenly started to look very scared.  The cartoon then cut to two other boys, wearing Celtic jerseys and carrying hurleys, who were coming into the playground.  The little lad with the baton threw it into the air in sheer horror.  He thought he was going to be attacked.  The baton got caught in some trees.  Then the little lad with the hurley came racing up.  It looked like there was going to be a fight, but instead he used his hurley to get the baton out of the trees for the young fellow &mdash; the perceived other person.  They ended up playing together in the playground, having overcome their assumptions and presumptions.</P>
        <P>After I saw the advertisement, I went on the Internet to find out where this advertisement was coming from.  I had noticed the logo of the International Fund for Ireland.  It was broadcast on UTV.  I discovered it was made as part of a programme designed by Early Years, an organisation for young children.  It received &euro;1.1 million in support from the International Fund for Ireland, among others.  The project is being rolled out among 5,000 pre-school children, parents and 240 pre-school teachers over a three-year period.  It basically embraces Ulster &mdash; the North and the Border counties.  Those involved are working with young children to increase their awareness of diversity and help them understand what it is like to be excluded or discriminated against.</P>
        <P>Hundreds of thousands of euro are spent on peace and reconciliation projects, but this little advertisement knocked me back on my heels because it said so much in such a short period of time.  I have discovered that there are five advertisements in total.  I have seen the advertisement on the theme of anti-sectarianism.  There are other advertisements about race, bullying, Travellers and physical discrimination.  They are geared towards three to six year olds.  I have discovered that they are being shown for a brief couple of months.  I have seen the list of broadcast times.  The advertisement to which I refer was shown on RTE during &ldquo;The Den&rdquo; on seven occasions between 23 June and 30 June last.  I found its message so strong.  It has been embraced by UTV, Channel 4 and, to a limited extent, RTE.  The Department of Foreign Affairs may well be contributing to this campaign through its peace and reconciliation funding.  Serious consideration should be given to increasing the number of times this advertisement is broadcast on television.  No one to whom I have spoken has seen it.  I would be interested in getting more feedback on it.  We can all learn from it.  Although the work that goes on in our schools is important, young people and adults who watch television should also be exposed to campaigns of this nature.</P>
        <P>Following the three-week pilot programme, it was found that the children involved were more willing to play with others, including some of those who are different from themselves.  There was an increase in their ability to understand how being excluded makes someone feel.  They became able to recognise instances of exclusion without having to be prompted.  I could go on at length, but I do not think I need to.  I congratulate the chief executive of Early Years, Siobh&aacute;n Fitzpatrick.  Studies show that by the age of six, one in six children in the North is making sectarian and racial remarks.  This project is proving to be right and to be working.  We should accept it.  An evaluation of it will be formally launched on 13 October.  I ask the Minister of State to talk to the Minister, Deputy Martin, about injecting serious money into this project. <Col N="387"/> There should be a good blitz of a campaign here, because it is as valuable to us as it is to anybody else on the island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter and giving me a chance to acknowledge the tremendous work being done under this specific programme and by the International Fund for Ireland.  The Senator has confirmed that these advertisements, which take the form of short animated messages, were made under a cross-Border programme.  The programme in question, Respecting Difference, is part-funded by the International Fund for Ireland, which is an independent international organisation established by the Irish and British Governments in 1986.  Its objectives, as set out in its founding agreement, are to promote economic and social advancements and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout this island.  Since 1986, the fund has received international contributions from the US, the EU, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  At present, the EU and US contribute all of the funding, which is much appreciated.  As required by the founding agreement, approximately 75% of the fund&rsquo;s expenditure is in Northern Ireland and approximately 25% of it is in the South.  To date, the fund has committed over &euro;811 million to more than 5,700 projects in Northern Ireland and the six Southern Border counties.  The board of the fund, which is appointed jointly by the two Governments, comprises a chairman, Mr. Denis Rooney, and six other members, who under the agreement establishing the fund act independently of the two Governments in discharging their decision-making roles.</P>
        <P>In February 2008, the board of the International Fund for Ireland approved financial assistance of up to &pound;1.1 million to allow the Respecting Difference programme to be rolled out to over 5,000 pre-school children, their parents and teachers in 240 pre-school settings over a three-year period, across Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties.  Atlantic Philanthropies provided matching funding of &pound;1.1 million.  The Department of Education in Northern Ireland provided &pound;200,000.  Sufficient funding was not available at that time to implement the programme in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  However, the board of the fund approved additional funding of &euro;282,625 at its meeting in June 2010 to extend the programme to the two counties.  The formal delivery of the programme in Northern Ireland and four of the southern Border counties &mdash; Louth, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal &mdash; began at the start of the 2008-09 school year.  The programme will commence in counties Cavan and Monaghan in September of this year.  Under the programme funded by the International Fund for Ireland, 12 groups have been trained and resourced to service design level in Donegal.  Some 25 practitioners and teachers have completed the training and 104 parents have attended parent workshops.  The total number of children in the 12 Donegal groups that have been exposed to the programme is 207.  The reconciliation fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs has provided funding for 13 further groups to be resourced in Donegal, with at least two members of staff trained from each group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Respecting Difference programme originated from a 2001 research study of the attitudes and behaviours of young children in Northern Ireland.  The study concluded that sectarian prejudices are present in three year olds, become significant in six year olds and are particularly pronounced in boys.  Following the 2001 research, a pilot programme was developed.  It was designed to change such attitudes and behaviours in young children, particularly with regard to sectarianism and inclusiveness.  The pilot programme was found to have positive effects, and led to the development of the Respecting Difference programme.  The programme offers children a range of activities and resources, which aim to increase awareness of diversity and difference issues; help children understand what it feels like to be excluded and thereby encourage more inclusion and understanding of those who are different; make respect for difference a real experience that children can share with their families; provide comprehensive training <Col N="388"/>and awareness seminars for parents, teachers and school management committees; and provide resource packs and specialist support for each group.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As part of the programme, the advertisements referred to by Senator Keaveney are broadcast three times each year &mdash; in October, February and May or June &mdash; to coincide with each school term.  The themes of the cartoons are physical, cultural and ethnic differences.  The cartoons are broadcast at various times over a one-week period to catch children and adults.  While mainly broadcast on UTV, they are also shown on Channel 4 and on RTE during &ldquo;The Den&rdquo;.  During the most recent run, they were broadcast on RTE on seven occasions over one week from 23 June to 30 June.  I understand the promoters intend to broadcast them more frequently on RTE, particularly now that the Respecting Difference programme is being delivered in all the southern Border counties.  However, it is a matter between Early Years, which is delivering the programme on behalf of the International Fund for Ireland, RTE and the other broadcasters to agree the terms on which the cartoon messages are shown.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">The Senator and I are at one on the merits of the message conveyed and the wish that the series of cartoons and the respecting differences programme as a whole will succeed in addressing sectarian issues in preschool age children at that critical time when their attitudes are being developed.  For the Senator&rsquo;s information, the Department of Foreign Affairs, through the reconciliation fund, has contributed &euro;85,000 over a four-year period to support the introduction of the respecting differences programme to additional preschools in Northern Ireland and the Southern Border counties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the idea that the number of programme broadcast times is to be expanded.  If a funding application should come before the peace and reconciliation fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs, while I do not wish to pre-empt anything, I underline that this is the most effective intervention I have come across.  I will be a very strong advocate and trust the Department also will recognise it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this Adjournment matter regarding the reconfiguration process in the HSE South area.  This concerns the region&rsquo;s acute hospital service.  As the Minister of State will know well, a process is under way under the stewardship of Professor John Higgins.  It is my view that the HSE is not communicating or making information available, although clarification is required on a number of topics, including the status of the accident and emergency departments in the Mercy University Hospital, the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, the transfer of services, the issue of community hospitals and the role of St Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital.</P>
        <P>There has been a profound impact on acute hospital services in the Cork-Kerry region.  The reconfiguration process must be carried out in an open and transparent manner and it is for that reason I tabled this matter.  As I understand it, a special and secret committee is being established in an advisory capacity.  Its terms of reference are not clear and were not published when the committee was established.  I stress I do not question the composition or membership of the committee and in no way do I wish to impugn the integrity of the members.  However, the board is comprised of developers and medics.  There was no public notification or ratification process and, to my knowledge, no selection or interview procedure for the membership.  In many ways it could be viewed as self-nominating.  Is there a conflict of interest?  I stress again I do not question the bona fides of the members of the committee.</P><Col N="389"/>
        <P>A number of other fundamental questions arise.  What process was put in place to ensure there was no conflict of interest?  Was the Minister for Health and Children aware of the establishment of this advisory board?  Why were the terms of reference not set out until March 2010 when the board was established in September 2009?  In addition, the board has a gender imbalance in that there is no female member.  Although I am not a spokesperson for County Kerry there is no representative of the county on the board.  There is no patient advocacy representative and no public representative although there is a HSE southern forum comprising councillors of all political parties and none.  Ironically, the board has access to the highest level up to and including the chief executive officer but there are a dozen or so committees under the reconfiguration process which do not have the same level of access.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State in his reply to clarify the points I raised.  I hope there will be increased representation on the board to take on board the groups I mentioned and that there will be a more open and transparent process regarding this.  I reiterate I do not question in any way the integrity or the personnel but the presentation of the board on the part of the HSE and the Department needs to be more honest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  As the House is aware, patient safety is central to the delivery of health services.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance so people can have confidence in the care they receive and achieve the best possible health outcomes.  The overwhelming consensus among clinical experts is that demonstrably better outcomes, as seen in cancer care, are achieved for patients if delivery of complex care takes places where the necessary staff and equipment are available and where there are sufficient volumes of activity.  To achieve better outcomes for patients, the acute hospital system needs to change fundamentally the types of service it delivers to our communities and how those services are delivered.  The reconfiguration of services in counties Cork and Kerry, when implemented, will produce an improved service, with clinical benefits for patients and treatment of the highest standard.  The HSE&rsquo;s work on the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in counties Cork and Kerry is informed by the principles enunciated in the Teamwork review of services in the region as well as by an extensive consultation process with stakeholder interests.</P>
        <P>In early 2009 a group of individuals from the business, education and health care fields expressed to the HSE an interest in supporting the executive&rsquo;s work in regard to the delivery of acute hospital services in the region.  Arising from this and after discussions between the parties, a non-executive advisory board was established in September 2009.  This board has 17 members and includes persons from academia, professional practice and non-HSE hospitals.  Its purpose is to support and advise the HSE, as appropriate, in regard to the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in the region and to bring practical experience to bear from outside the health field.  The advisory board members receive no remuneration for their participation and give of their time and advice voluntarily.  The board is purely advisory and has no executive or decision-making functions.  The Minister for Health and Children very much welcomes the fact that senior people from a range of disciplines are willing to offer a fresh perspective on important issues in health care and on how the challenges that reconfiguration poses might be addressed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The reconfiguration process in counties Cork and Kerry is informed by a wide-ranging and comprehensive consultation process.  This includes a regional reconfiguration forum which brings together clinical directors and health service managers as well as 40 clinical subgroups, with input from patient advocates, nursing, service staff, general practice, primary, community and continuing care and from University College Cork.  The regional director of reconfiguration has also met public representatives regularly and has reported to the regional health forum. <Col N="390"/> Specific initiatives, such as the introduction of advanced paramedics to west Cork, have been supported by a public information campaign that included direct interaction with community groups and public meetings.  Nonetheless, in the light of a number of representations which it has received, the HSE is at present considering the possible extension of the membership of the advisory board to include additional representation of patients and the public.</P>
        <P>The Minister looks forward to the continued engagement of the advisory board and all the other stakeholders in the development of arrangements which will ensure the provision of safe and sustainable hospital services for the people of Cork and Kerry into the future.  I shall forward the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the gender make-up of the board directly to the Minister.</P>
